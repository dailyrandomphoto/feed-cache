  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="B1aeyk"&gt;Buying a smartphone for under $500 is a lesson in setting priorities. It’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point, but luckily you will be able to buy a great phone that does the things that matter the most to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qMTFV"&gt;Phones at this price point are better than ever, many coming with features that used to be reserved just for flagships. But instead of getting it all, you should think about the features that you care about and focus on finding a phone that nails them. Some phones emphasize a big screen, others a quality camera, and one of them emphasizes speed and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opZnVh"&gt;The trend of inexpensive phones getting better has been happening for a few years now, with companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung making devices that absolutely can meet your needs for less. Other companies like TCL have started trying to build their own brand by marketing directly, and OnePlus is also making a return to the lower end of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O271rc"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the Apple iPhone SE. It serves the needs of most people and does a competent job at everything, but its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77wmze"&gt;If you prefer an Android phone or are looking to spend less, then the options start to bifurcate a little bit. The Google Pixel 4A has an excellent camera and good software, but it doesn’t have the large screen many people are looking for. To get that, your best bet is Samsung’s Galaxy A51 smartphone, which does boast a big, beautiful screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAV1gP"&gt;Those phones are pretty much available worldwide, but if you’re in the markets where OnePlus has more presence, the OnePlus Nord is a newcomer that beats out the competition by hitting a higher baseline in all its categories rather than excelling at just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ejzg03"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a flagship: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight As in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2020&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GatTSx"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xGSQd4"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Specifically, we recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yS33o"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJSrTq"&gt;But in exchange for that very familiar phone body, you get a lot of value. The best thing about the iPhone SE is its processor, Apple’s A13 Bionic. That matters because it is literally the fastest processor you can get on any phone, anywhere. It’s the exact same chip found in Apple’s $999-and-up iPhone 11 Pro. Normally speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFxDqg"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means that in a few years the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XX01cV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yPInwx"&gt;Battery life is good, but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, a relative rarity at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape of the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8 there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbhSVu"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2020 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEIcsk"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four, five, or even six years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s clean iOS software, and huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uGMHIJ_EFkQE2rMcf3ISzHc3EYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21691927/vpavic_4113_20200721_0041.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lIP45s"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PmYbc8"&gt;The best inexpensive Android phone with the best camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ea8Tfu"&gt;If you prefer Android, want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxMxyh"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means that the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gMP3dB"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgAIi6"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it. That puts you first in line for Android updates and also guarantees you’ll get them for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EQNFx"&gt;Unfortunately, in three years, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be on its last legs. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbtrpB"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus Nord has very good specs for its price." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QLGyEbYOEFNw7_Knc2RmCAHngOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20149535/vpavic_4112_20200721_0034.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord has very good specs for its price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWBCf6"&gt;The best all-around Android phone outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uLYmxs"&gt;Technically, saying the OnePlus Nord costs less than $500 doesn’t make much sense because it’s not available in the US right now. But if you live in a market where it’s available, the OnePlus Nord is the kind of phone that aims for a solid B in every category instead of trying to ace one or two. For £379 / €399, it’s a safe Android bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jllZvZ"&gt;The OnePlus Nord has a couple of features that are normally reserved for much more expensive phones: support for sub-6 5G networks and a high-refresh-rate 90Hz display. If you live in an area where 5G is built out, you may notice faster download speeds. But it’s the display that’ll have a bigger impact on your day-to-day experience. It makes everything feel smoother and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMIHtL"&gt;You will miss out on wireless charging and a headphone jack with the Nord, but they’re really the only big things that are lacking. Battery life is solid, the 6.44-inch screen is big and beautiful, and the software is less annoying than some competitors (though not as clean as Google’s). The £379 / €399 model comes with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, both plenty good for this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzsRwZ"&gt;As for cameras, there are a bunch of them — maybe even too many. There’s a standard, an ultrawide, and a macro camera on the back as well as a couple selfie cameras on the front. As is the norm with most smartphone cameras these days, they will get you decent photos in decent light but fall down a bit in the dark. You’ll mostly want to use the main camera, as the ultrawide has a noticeable drop in quality and the macro is only good for, well, macro or close-up shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQiNib"&gt;All too often, phones at this price point have some critical compromise you’re forced to make in order to get the feature you really want. With the OnePlus Nord, there’s no big flaw you’ll have to work around. Again, though, it’s not available in the US. You can import it, but it’s not recommended as it won’t support the right LTE bands.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy A51 has a huge screen and is otherwise a pretty decent phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6gGzxS0kO-_Qkwy_XyWUOyb1Jo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19951824/vpavic_052004_4007_0022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A51 has a huge screen and is otherwise a pretty decent phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHeLLf"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A51&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="n49IDp"&gt;The best phone if you want a big screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9zHmts"&gt;Samsung’s $399 Galaxy A51 Android phone may well turn out to be the bestselling phone of 2020. Its predecessor, the Galaxy A50, outshone all expectations. For the A51, Samsung focused on nailing a big screen, good battery life, and the camera. It got the screen just right; the other two are just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCBvU5"&gt;The 6.5-inch OLED display on the A51 is bright and vivid, and you’d have to be pretty persnickety to find fault in it. It doesn’t offer the same high refresh rate you can get on the OnePlus Nord, but it makes up for that with Samsung’s great quality. If there’s one weird thing about the screen, it’s that Samsung put a chrome bezel around the hole punch for the front-facing selfie camera. It’s distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BPSfp"&gt;The A51 sports nice build quality, though you can definitely feel that it’s plastic on the back. It has a headphone jack and 128GB of storage, which is the number you should be aiming for on any phone these days. Battery life should be superb thanks to a 4,000mAh battery, but because it has to power that big screen, it nets out to being just so-so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReiNOy"&gt;As is becoming a (weird) standard on this class of phone, the A51 has a regular wide angle, an ultrawide, a depth sensor, and a macro camera. And as is also standard, the regular wide angle will get you the best images. The A51 can’t beat the Pixel 4A for quality, but the different lens options might be more fun for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ot0H0"&gt;Samsung recently committed to providing the A51 with three generations of Android software updates, which is great news. Less great is that it usually takes Samsung longer than you’d like to get software updates out to the A-line of phones. Samsung has also started to junk up its previously elegant OneUI software interface with ads and other junkware, so be prepared to do some cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZjXl5"&gt;On the whole, though, what the A51 gets you is a very big, very beautiful screen. If that’s your highest priority — and for many people, it is — the A51 is a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You probably don’t need 5G yet, but the Google Pixel 4A 5G has other strong benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ARB606"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="L6XTYh"&gt;If you really think you need 5G&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WqKDDc"&gt;If you live in the US, chances are the 5G networks in your area are not going to live up to the high-flying promises carriers have been making. But if you really do think you’d benefit from 5G, the best phone under $500 that supports it is Google’s Pixel 4A 5G. At $499, it comes in just under the wire on our price limit — but the Verizon version costs an extra $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbBb7l"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G is good for all the reasons that the Pixel 4A is good: it has a great still camera, solid battery life, and clean Google software. It has some other benefits, though. It uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor, which means it’s faster than the Pixel 4A and nearly all the rest of the sub-$500 Android phones you can find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8W2PnU"&gt;It also has a larger screen, clocking in at 6.2 inches diagonally. It doesn’t feel too gigantic when you hold it, but you can tell it’s a larger phone. Google chose this size not to give you that bigger screen, but because it needed the extra space to hold all the components and antennas required for 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m13wf6"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G has a slightly better camera system compared to the Pixel 4A, thanks to the inclusion of an ultrawide sensor. Google has also made its excellent Night Sight mode automatic and improved video with some new stabilization modes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajp1K5"&gt;Otherwise, it follows the standard low-cost Pixel formula. It has a plastic back with fingerprint sensor and a headphone jack. Google doesn’t load down the software with extra crapware you don’t want, but it does include some nice little Google touches like a voice recorder that automatically creates a transcription as it records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K241jf"&gt;Someday, not having 5G will be a serious downside for smartphones, but right now those networks still need to be built out a little bit more. Even if you ignore the potentially faster network speeds, the Pixel 4A 5G is a surprisingly great phone. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Power has incredible battery life, but the rest of it isn’t so incredible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pxVQdv"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pn815f"&gt;The phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uP3407"&gt;Motorola makes a pair of phones that are siblings: the G Stylus and the G Power. The difference between them is right there in the names: the G Stylus comes with a stylus and the G Power has a larger battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3BFGL"&gt;We prefer the G Power because a 5,000mAh battery on a $249 phone is a shockingly good deal. You will, of course, notice a bunch of other compromises in exchange for that huge battery, but if you definitely need a phone that will last, the G Power is your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pvfy9"&gt;The G Power has a 6.4-inch FHD+ display which looks decent, but it unfortunately only has 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. You’ll get by on both, but you’ll run into hassles just a bit more quickly than on phones with more. The processor is a Snapdragon 665, which will be enough to run whatever app you want, it just won’t launch it quickly and overall the phone may feel too slow in two or three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDBZ93"&gt;As for cameras, the G Power keeps the trend of a main sensor, an ultrawide, and a macro on the back. The main sensor is 16 megapixels and performs much better than the $250 price would lead you to expect. If you’ve used inexpensive Motorola phones before, you’ll likely find that the G Power offers a big step up in picture quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHrfLr"&gt;If you’re very confident you want a stylus, your best bet is to see if you can find a refurbished or gently used Samsung Galaxy Note. It does a much better job providing a software ecosystem of compatible apps for its stylus. If you can’t, the G Stylus pretty much matches what we’ve said about the G Power, just with less battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="FvN09U"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257398/tcl-10-pro-review-release-date-specs-features-camera-screen"&gt;TCL 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aQnAQL"&gt;The phone that looks professional&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="woKhbI"&gt;TCL is probably best known for its televisions, but it has served as the white label manufacturer for smartphones for many years. Now, it’s trying to make a name for itself in smartphones with new, low-cost options like the TCL 10L and the TCL 10 Pro. The Pro is the upgrade pick and retails for $449.90, though you can often find it on sale for less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnR7sq"&gt;The 10 Pro looks like it means business. Instead of iridescent colors and big camera bumps, it’s thin, flat, and gray. It has a 6.47-inch display, but overall feels smaller than some phones on this list. You also get a headphone jack and a big, 4,500mAh battery that should get you through a full day without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikA6Gl"&gt;The best spec on the 10 Po is its 6GB of RAM, which is plenty for multitasking and should keep your most recent apps from shutting down in the background. There’s the appropriate 128GB of storage, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uQsKq"&gt;The 10 Pro’s understated looks also extend to the Android software, which has a few extra little features but generally tends to stay out of your way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6q4BYj"&gt;As for cameras, they’re somewhat uninspiring: there’s a 64-megapixel main sensor, a 16-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel macro. The photos you’ll get have that over-processed look that sometimes makes images look artificial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OWbWI"&gt;Overall, the best thing about the TCL 10 Pro is that it has plenty of RAM for multitasking and a thin shape that isn’t bombastic. If you can find a good deal on one, it’s worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple iPhone 12 mini review: fit to size</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not the best iPhone for most people, but it’s going to be a favorite for many&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WcAaL9"&gt;If you asked me which of the four different models of the new iPhone 12 you should buy without providing any further context on your needs or desires, I would tell you to buy the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;regular iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; without question. It has the best balance of screen size, storage, cameras, battery life, and value. It is, in my opinion, the best iPhone 12 for most people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9n4e0"&gt;But the iPhone 12 mini is my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYK1Ka"&gt;For the first time in many years, Apple is making an intentionally small phone. The key, though, is that unlike other small phones, Apple isn’t putting worse parts in it. The iPhone 12 mini has all the same features as the larger iPhone 12. It has the same cameras, same processor, same everything save for two things: screen size and battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIhcXD"&gt;The iPhone 12 mini starts at $729 for a 64GB model in the US, but $50 more gets the 128GB model and that’s a much better option. It’s a small phone, but it’s not a cheap phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gykqHc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21319942"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rdM0hW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9567073"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bFBN8MluXn6y4m9z7znDgdeH93Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023095/vpavic_4279_20201107_0043.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="43W7tD"&gt;iPhone 12 mini hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ezSvny"&gt;It’s traditional to refer to phones by their screen size and for the iPhone 12 mini, that number is 5.4 inches diagonally. But that number doesn’t tell the story at all. The phone is smaller than the traditional 4.7-inch-home-button iPhone design we saw from the iPhone 6 on through the 6S, 7, 8, and 2020 SE models, even though the screen itself is larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdEc46"&gt;That’s because the 12 mini, just like the rest of the iPhone 12 line, has switched over to Apple’s more modern OLED screens and Face ID notch for unlocking. Those two features allow Apple to design the phone with minimal bezels and maximal screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skoj7q"&gt;Despite the smaller screen size, you don’t miss out on as much as you might expect. Compared to the regular iPhone 12 with a 6.1-inch screen, there are maybe one or two lines of text that are cut off. What you actually miss out on is that sense of immersion you can get from a bigger screen when you’re playing a game or watching a movie. Those were the only times this screen felt cramped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVgW3X"&gt;If there is a knock on the screen, it’s that it doesn’t offer a high refresh rate like many Android phones — including the Pixel 5, which isn’t &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; far off from the iPhone 12 mini’s size. I’m more annoyed that the Pro iPhones don’t have it, though — here on the mini, I think battery life is more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini has flat aluminum rails on the side" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0tgQ9BIsH_lPmyun-bD1t_6su7E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023091/vpavic_4279_20201107_0053.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini has flat aluminum rails on the side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 mini (top) and the regular iPhone 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CSYs7KXIRHc8p0s5WhReW7o9-8c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023092/vpavic_4279_20201107_0051.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 12 mini (top) and the regular iPhone 12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwy2JC"&gt;To me, the iPhone 12 mini is most reminiscent of the iPhone 5. Yes, it is bigger and has a glass rear panel instead of aluminum, but it shares the squared-off aluminum sides and general feeling of being an object that was designed to be proportional to your hand. This is a phone that you can get a grip on, literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4HKzs"&gt;The phone feels well built, with tight tolerances and subtle touches like carefully beveled edges. The rear glass is glossy and the rails are matte — on our black review unit the rails have a kind of slate finish instead of being true black. The camera bump on the back and the Face ID notch on the front are proportionally big compared to the smaller size of the phone, but not annoyingly so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3gVG7"&gt;Because it’s a bit narrower, it’s easier to reach the opposite side of the screen with your thumb. Because it’s a bit shorter, a lot of people will be able to reach the top for the swipe-down gestures without contorting their hands into awkward claws or risking dropping the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJnBWp"&gt;It has a much, much better chance of fitting into small pockets — the kind that are all too common on pants designed for women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTnMPk"&gt;As a man with big pockets and big hands, I do not have the strongest feelings about why it’s been so frustrating not to have a small iPhone option. But I sympathize with those who do and agree with the sentiment 100 percent — I’m glad Apple recognized it and I hope other phone companies do what they often do and follow Apple’s lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 mini (left) and iPhone 12 (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8833rrFzFziADRLiBLUiwc7W2Ew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023082/vpavic_4279_20201107_0180.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 12 mini (left) and iPhone 12 (right)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IF4Fhd"&gt;iPhone 12 mini battery and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oytonH"&gt;Apple chose to make the iPhone 12 mini hew closely to the features and specs of the regular iPhone 12. It’s a laudable goal, but as I used it I found myself second-guessing that decision a little bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1M24VJ"&gt;It’s corny to say I’m impressed by how much Apple packed into such a small space — but I am. The iPhone 12 mini has the fastest processor on any phone, it has the same dual-camera system as the iPhone 12, and most remarkably it has all the components and antennas necessary for both sub-6 and (in the US) mmWave 5G. It is fast, multitasks well, and doesn’t feel like a compromise when you use it. It really is an amazing feat of technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLCTCf"&gt;It’s amazing until the battery dies, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="j4vFG8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life is a noticeable step down; you’ll need to pay attention to it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 (left) and the iPhone 12 mini (right). The mini only loses a couple lines of text compared to the bigger screen, but feels less immersive." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TXp_om44TvdZ0D4a1yxLoxpFOBY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023088/vpavic_4279_20201107_0101.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 (left) and the iPhone 12 mini (right). The mini only loses a couple lines of text compared to the bigger screen but feels less immersive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vzJ8T4vTcwufYzJDT6F-WEzdfLg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023425/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QmD5mH"&gt;I don’t want to sugarcoat it nor be overly dire about it, but the battery life on the iPhone 12 mini is noticeably worse than on the iPhone 12, which itself was a step down from the battery-champ iPhone 11. For me, it’s good enough, but it does mean I’m already using it differently than I use bigger phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZE83A"&gt;Without making any effort at it, I have consistently drained the iPhone 12 mini’s battery by early evening. I’d say it’s fair to expect the 12 mini to clock up something near four hours of screentime with stuff like web browsing, Facebook, and taking photos. Intense games give you a chance to watch the battery percent tick down minute by minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLbEgW"&gt;So it’s not &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s definitely not great. My feeling after a little less than a week is that getting through a day requires a little bit of battery management. Holding yourself back from putting an hour into an Apple Arcade game, knowing where your next opportunity to charge might be, and above all being more willing to turn on the low power mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XO3WQz"&gt;Of course it works with Apple’s new magnet-based MagSafe system for cases and wireless charging. Using MagSafe, the iPhone 12 mini maxes out at 12W wireless charging instead of the 15W you get on the larger iPhones, but since the battery is smaller, the overall charge time ends up being about the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpeMJ2"&gt;Exactly how small is small? Apple never provides exact battery size specs — and I get the reasoning even though I disagree with it. Lots of factors affect battery life, and the iPhone 12 mini has the benefit of a smaller OLED screen. But it also has 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEIynG"&gt;The reality of 5G in the US continues to be very different from the hype. It’s radically dependent on which network you’re on and what part of the country or city you’re in. Often the speeds are equivalent to LTE. If you stand out on the right street corner and get mmWave, you can indeed get speeds that are astonishing — until you walk down the street and they drop back to the same LTE we’ve used for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmXO6K"&gt;I often have to remind people that phone design isn’t inevitable. Apple chose to keep this iPhone 12 mini the same thickness as the iPhone 12 and it chose to keep the extra parts necessary for mmWave 5G. I would rather lose both of those things in exchange for a bigger battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini has a regular wide and an ultrawide camera" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RECsS4OxTS94oW5e6NbJSEYwpGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023094/vpavic_4279_20201107_0048.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini has a regular wide and an ultrawide camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hXag4T"&gt;iPhone 12 mini cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7Pk60E"&gt;The iPhone 12 mini has the exact same camera setup as the regular iPhone 12. There’s the 12-megapixel main wide-angle camera with a f/1.6 aperture for letting in more light paired with a somewhat worse 12-megapixel ultrawide camera. Unlike the Pro models, there’s no telephoto lens nor a LIDAR sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUq6uV"&gt;I am happy to report that the results are just like the specs: the same. The iPhone 12 mini reverts to Night mode less often than even the iPhone 11 Pro and the Pixel 5. Apple has made some improvements in image processing this year with its A14 Bionic processor that results in more detail in more lighting conditions (aka the Deep Fusion “Sweater Mode”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G8rqE5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9567090"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MrC3Eu"&gt;It’s a very good camera system, and that’s not usually something I get to say when I’m talking about a smaller phone. Usually smaller means cut corners and the camera is often the place where those corners get cut. Not so here: video is excellent at handling different lighting conditions, portrait mode is usually more than good enough for Instagram, and you can trust the camera to take the photos you expect when you tap the shutter. And you can expect them to get saved quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKylTg"&gt;Next year, though, I hope Apple pays a little more attention to the secondary camera sensors. The selfie camera is fine, but it’s increasingly disappointing compared to the advances on the main camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QClTF7"&gt;I can take some dramatic shots with the ultrawide — the tree you see above is objectively boring but looks dope with this lens. Still, if you zoom in even a little, you can see that on a technical level the ultrawide is also far behind the main sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6toh3O1DbuZe2BqBtVjxfYcviuQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023090/vpavic_4279_20201107_0081.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ow8iP0"&gt;As I said above, I don’t have ergonomic reasons to need a smaller phone. My advice for most people is to get the regular iPhone 12 for its better battery and bigger screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVj89V"&gt;And yet, I love the iPhone 12 mini. It is my favorite of the new iPhone 12 models. Despite real concerns with the battery, it’s the one I have decided to get for myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="okzHp7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first iPhone in a long time to be designed around ergonomics instead of screen size&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6WevGI"&gt;For me, the reason to prefer the iPhone 12 mini is hard to state in words, but I’ll give it a shot. With every phone, you can tell what it was designed &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt;. There’s some key feature that everything else has to contend with, that sets the hardware narrative. For many years now, that feature was the screen. Making it big, bright, beautiful, and bezel-less was the big thing driving phone design, and all other considerations were secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HoQY0y"&gt;The iPhone 12 mini feels like the first iPhone in a long time with a different goal. It was designed around the human hand and real pockets. It is an object that doesn’t aim to be judged against other smartphones (which are mostly big now), but to be judged simply as an object you need to hold. You judge a spatula or can opener or whatever by whether it’s easy to grip, by whether it fits in your hand. It’s about time we got back to judging smartphones that way, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymQNkg"&gt;That design decision means that other things — like battery life — are secondary. But it’s nevertheless a strange kind of relief to hold it. You know the feeling when a buzzing noise you’d grown accustomed to suddenly stops and you realize you’ve been annoyed all day but couldn’t say why? It’s like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="LSftQm"&gt;Whether we admit it or not (and whether we hate it or not), we’ve subtly been adapting ourselves to ever-growing phone sizes. The iPhone 12 mini is adapted to &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max review: the best smartphone camera you can get</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s biggest iPhone brings along an impressive camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FxiRSL"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is a big phone. The biggest iPhone ever made, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLWAdK"&gt;The Pro Max’s 6.7-inch display is the largest screen ever on an iPhone. It has the biggest camera sensor of any iPhone, including the three other iPhone 12 models Apple announced this year. It has a 5G radio, and it’s got a bigger battery. It is without question the most iPhone you can get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYHAou"&gt;And while it’s expensive, it’s not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much more expensive than the smaller iPhone 12 Pro: it’s just $100 more at every storage level, starting at $1,099 with 128GB of storage and going up to $1,399 for 512GB of storage. For that money, you get a larger display, a bigger battery, and a very different camera system. I’ll just cut to the chase and say it’s absolutely worth it over the standard 12 Pro if you can deal with the size — but it’s a lot of size. And the camera is worth exploring in depth, because there’s a lot going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJYgv9"&gt;Like I said, it’s the most iPhone you can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="232UTY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9567008"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VTtRTY"&gt;There’s just no getting around it: the iPhone 12 Pro Max is a very big phone. The measurements don’t tell the whole story — by the numbers, it’s just a little bit bigger than the 11 Pro Max, but the new design with flat sides makes it feel much larger than it is, and makes it slightly harder to hold than a phone with curved sides. It’s also a bit heavier than other big phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it feel even bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="deppjt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro review: ahead of its time","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"},{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 review: raising the bar","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"},{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 mini review: fit to size","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Y9gCon"&gt;The combination of the size and flat sides basically demands a case to make it easier to hold, which makes the whole thing even bigger. It’s still workable, but it is right on the edge of being too big. I think the size is a reflection of increased choice: this year Apple has more phone sizes available than ever before, including the diminutive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21319336"&gt;iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, so it had the ability to push the Max even farther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aCYSC"&gt;But: it’s still big. I strongly recommend finding a way to &lt;strong&gt;safely&lt;/strong&gt; see the 12 Pro Max’s size in person before making a call on ordering one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXbqRsJXIdQky0lT_oSOdnY1foA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022559/bfarsace_201106_4269_022.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The 12 Pro Max has a larger main camera sensor than the other iPhone 12 models.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="92VGL1"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1z7hgk"&gt;Aside from the large size, the main thing that sets the iPhone 12 Pro Max apart from the rest of the iPhone 12 line is the camera system, which is substantially different and more capable than the cameras on the smaller 12 and 12 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8voeoj"&gt;The basics are the same as the 12 Pro: three cameras including a wide, an ultrawide, and a tele, with a LIDAR sensor that enables portrait photos on the wide camera in Night mode. Night mode is available at all three zoom levels now, which is an improvement over the iPhone 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxK0Oq"&gt;The ultrawide camera is the same as on the 12 and 12 Pro, and it’s a noticeable improvement over the ultrawide on the 11 Pro. I think it’s useful and fun to have an ultrawide, but it still takes medium-quality photos compared to the main camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cQfOUPRckCDbMFdNR_uI5T8jBYo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022555/bfarsace_201106_4269_028.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The telephoto lens on the 12 Pro Max is also slightly different, with a longer field of view.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ue1FUxVTE9deql-HVqDBz3n20JY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022570/bfarsace_201106_4269_014.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The camera bump on the 12 Pro Max is larger than the 12 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C3iGuY"&gt;It’s the main wide camera and the telephoto that are very different on the 12 Pro Max. The wide has the same f/1.6 lens as the 12 and 12 Pro, but it also has a 47-percent larger physical sensor that can capture more light with less noise. The wide camera is also stabilized differently than the other iPhone 12 models, which have traditional lens-based optical image stabilization to reduce vibrations and thus blur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywkc5A"&gt;The 12 Pro Max uses sensor-shift stabilization, which moves the sensor itself around to reduce vibrations. Apple tells me the move to sensor-shift stabilization on the 12 Pro Max was more about making this sensor size work to its standards than overall performance, but that the system on the 12 Pro Max is slightly more effective at reducing a wider range of vibrations than the OIS on the 12 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iIoYH"&gt;(As an aside for camera nerds, Apple keeps calling this “sensor-shift OIS,” which doesn’t quite make sense because the lens isn’t involved. It’s more like the in-body stabilization you’ll find on Sony and Panasonic mirrorless cameras. But I digress.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qvxisg"&gt;The bigger sensor also has an impressive maximum ISO, which is a measure of light sensitivity. The iPhone 11 Pro had a top ISO of 3,072, the regular iPhone 12 Pro has a top ISO of 5,808, and the 12 Pro Max has a top ISO of 7,616. As the numbers go up, the amount of noise at any given ISO tends to go down, which means images from the iPhone 12 Pro Max are generally less noisy than the 12 Pro’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="YW9SmJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 12 Pro Max’s main camera is one of the most confident smartphone cameras I’ve ever used&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9yn9hg"&gt;The upshot of all this is simple: the wide camera on the iPhone 12 Pro Max is one of the most confident smartphone cameras I’ve ever used. It can take great photos in a huge variety of situations, and rarely feels pushed beyond its limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cFUa4U8rLiCw9y9ue8tziSs_WSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023319/4269_bright_light_all.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;In broad daylight it’s hard to tell the pics from any modern high-end phone apart. | Left to right: Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, Apple iPhone 12 Pro, Google Pixel 5, Samsung Note 20 Ultra&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bkNXbX"&gt;You won’t always see the benefit from that increased capability; it really depends on what kind of light you’re taking photos in. In sunlight and other bright situations, photos from the 12 Pro Max and 12 Pro look identical to me — we’re at the point where photos from all the major flagships are starting to look the same. Yes, there are differences: the Pixel 5 is a little more contrasty, the iPhone still boosts shadows the most aggressively, and the Note 20 does some weird things with reds and yellows, but when any of these cameras gets enough light, they produce photos that are more alike than different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95zl33"&gt;But when the light gets dimmer, the 12 Pro Max really starts to stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIG2oD"&gt;Take this photo I took at sunset: all the phones did a fine enough job, but the 12 Pro Max has far less noise, better and more accurate colors, and more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oKnKrJ2HLDuorkH9V5HjvjpCTKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022620/note20ultra20201103_165422.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, Apple iPhone 12 Pro, Google Pixel 5, Samsung Note 20 Ultra. The Pro Max captures better colors and more detail as the light starts to drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Upbh6"&gt;Under slightly darker conditions, most of the phones automatically shifted to their respective night modes, where they take multiple long exposures and merge them together. But the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s bigger sensor, with its higher maximum ISO, means it doesn’t automatically go into Night mode as often. And when the iPhone 12 Pro Max &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; go into Night mode, it does so with shorter exposures than the 12 Pro — in situations where the 12 Pro would take a three-second exposure, the 12 Pro Max only needed a one-second shot, resulting in a sharper photo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="b2p5s2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9566760"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="DGN5kF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9567014"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HLvqOf"&gt;(Night mode itself has been improved across the iPhone 12 line: the iPhone 11 took Night mode shots by merging together frames with a one-second maximum exposure time, but the iPhone 12 lineup can capture two-second stabilized frames, allowing for better shadows with less noise. And if the phone detects that it’s on a tripod, it will turn off image stabilization and capture three-second frames, for a maximum 30-second night mode shot composed of ten three-second frames. The iPhone 11 would take thirty one-second frames.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfzXNt"&gt;The LIDAR sensor lets you shoot portraits in Night mode using the wide camera, which, combined with the better overall low light performance, means that Night mode portraits are better and more detailed on the 12 Pro Max than the 12 Pro and Pixel 5. It’s impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tF4SCw"&gt;Overall, when it comes to low light, it feels like no contest: the iPhone 12 Pro Max consistently took better, more detailed, and less noisy photos than the Pixel 5 and Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. Look at how muddy the Pixel 5 looks in this basic sunset photo compared to the Pro Max, and look at how washed out the image of the truck from the Note 20 looks. Apple has noticeably moved ahead of the pack here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="gOieSX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9566923"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="BN5phb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9566928"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T6buSS"&gt;You might be expecting some dramatic change to depth of field because of the brighter aperture and bigger sensor — I certainly was — and while close-up photos do have a slightly increased background blur, it’s not particularly more noticeable to my eye than the 12 Pro. If you’re looking for that dramatic DSLR-style bokeh, you’ll still need to turn on Portrait mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0g5Q7"&gt;The benefits of the bigger sensor are less apparent in video — and really, they’re only really noticeable if you’re watching on a larger screen like a TV. At night, you’ll see a little more detail and less noise in the shadows compared to the 12 Pro, and there’s the tiniest more detail in bright light, but you have to go looking for it. We already thought the 12 Pro was far ahead of the pack in terms of video, and the 12 Pro Max is maybe a tiny bit better, but it’s not nearly as dramatic as the improvement in stills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGx2MS"&gt;(I did a deep dive on Dolby Vision in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;12 Pro review&lt;/a&gt;, and all the promise is there, as are the compatibility challenges, so go watch that video for more. And there’s still a lot of lens flare going on. Apple told me that there shouldn’t be any increased lens flare over the iPhone 11 line, but that the improved low-light performance means people are noticing it more, which feels roughly equivalent to saying “I’m a perfectionist” when someone asks you for your biggest weakness. Sure.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FSn4v"&gt;The telephoto camera is less straightforwardly improved. It is essentially the same sensor as the 12 Pro, but with a longer 2.5x zoom and a less-bright f/2.2 lens instead of the 2x f/2.0 lens on the regular 12 Pro. So: a longer zoom that can pick up less light. It’s a tradeoff, but I found I really enjoyed having the tighter zoom, and I went to use it more than the telephoto on my 11 Pro. It performed slightly worse in lower light than the 2x zoom on 12 Pro, but I think it still has the upper hand compared to the Note 20 Ultra and Pixel 5 — Apple’s Smart HDR 3 is really good this year, with excellent noise reduction and vibrant colors that are still accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="owE6nE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9567049"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G9cAgv"&gt;All in all, the combination of the larger sensor, faster lens, improved stabilization, LIDAR, and processing power means that the iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best smartphone camera I’ve ever used — it produces terrific, colorful photos with excellent detail in lighting situations where other phones start to struggle. We’ve seen Android phone makers like Samsung and Huawei use much bigger sensors this year with a variety of complicated techniques to make them work, but Apple’s approach of pairing a moderate sensor size jump with its focus on improved processing has kept it in the lead. I’m intrigued by Apple’s new ProRAW format that promises the editing flexibility of RAW images from this sensor with the processing of Smart HDR… but it’s not out yet, so we’ll have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crCsTZ"&gt;Lastly, I have to mention the selfie camera, which is stubbornly the same as the other iPhone 12s. Many people will use the selfie camera more often than the telephoto or ultrawide cameras; it’s well overdue for a serious improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/STO1HxuiN5bphgE700cOHR4bOmc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022554/bfarsace_201106_4269_001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The 6.7-inch OLED screen is the largest ever for an iPhone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oEcEKF"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max Display&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dYBf8C"&gt;Apart from the cameras, the rest of the iPhone 12 Pro Max is very similar to the iPhone 12 Pro. The display is obviously bigger, but it’s just as bright and colorful, and the pixel density is essentially the same. And there’s not a ton more information presented on the big screen by default. I think that’s a shame — this thing is veering into tablet territory in terms of size, and I’d like to see Apple allow app developers to make better use of all this real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hvt8KS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Every other flagship phone this year has a 120Hz display, it’s odd for the top of the line iPhone to not have it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vre03b"&gt;Disappointingly, the iPhone 12 Pro Max still has a 60Hz-refresh-rate display, while virtually every Android phone above $600 is now at 120Hz. This was maybe passable on the standard 12, but on the 12 Pro and especially the Pro Max, I think it’s a miss — it’s the most expensive iPhone with the biggest battery, and the display shouldn’t be one tick behind the competition. Maybe next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcPAUr"&gt;The 12 Pro Max adds the same MagSafe magnetic wireless charging system as the other iPhone 12s, but Apple’s charging adapters are expensive and suffer from the usual USB-C spec confusion. I am &lt;em&gt;eagerly&lt;/em&gt; anticipating the first wave of MagSafe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"&gt;car mounts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21545486/moment-magsafe-iphone-12-case-mount-announced"&gt;other accessories&lt;/a&gt; — MagSafe has all the potential to be terrific, but Apple’s ability to build and nurture accessory ecosystems around its connector ideas is iffy at best. (See: the near-total lack of iPad keyboards that use the Smart Connector.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1OAnyY"&gt;5G on the iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1BunY0"&gt;I tested the 12 Pro on Verizon’s network, which offers ultrafast millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G on various street corners and sports stadiums around the country, so for the 12 Pro Max I used AT&amp;amp;T’s network. And 5G in the US continues to be a deeply mixed bag that is barely worth discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4LJaq"&gt;Speeds where I could find AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/13/21014816/att-low-band-5g-network-broad-10-cities-launch-speeds-internet"&gt;standard 5G service&lt;/a&gt; were not so much better than really good LTE, and AT&amp;amp;T’s mmWave network is essentially nowhere to be found. And AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G plan automatically enables a “feature” called Stream Saver which streams all video at 480p because this so-called “unlimited” plan has complicated limits. So you’ve got a huge phone with a beautiful display and a fast connection that displays most video in… DVD resolution. C’mon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1j01B4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;5G in the US is more hype than reality and you can ignore it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNYFEl"&gt;I don’t mean to just dunk on AT&amp;amp;T: Sascha Segan at PC Mag just released data showing that 5G in the US is &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/race-to-5g-5g-limps-to-nationwide-status"&gt;slower than anywhere else in the world&lt;/a&gt;. So 5G is not only hard to find, it’s slower. If there was ever a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637213/5g-race-us-leadership-china-fcc-lte"&gt;race to 5G&lt;/a&gt;,” the United States has lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fId2yo"&gt;Anyway, I cannot stress this enough: 5G in the United States is more hype than reality, and you should not buy a phone because of it. Just ignore it for another year. It’ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BA_uvgR0fz0wgC4CBVIGimC7eLc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022556/bfarsace_201106_4269_027.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The big size of the Pro Max allows for a big battery, which translates into big battery life.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3gBIeu"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max Performance and Battery Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8BJfG2"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is a big phone, and as such, it has a big battery. And so battery life is terrific. At home, on WiFi, I saw screen-on times of as long as 14 hours as I doomscrolled through our interminable election, with an average of well over eight hours in more reasonable (and healthy) use over the course of a week. Now, I’m not leaving my house as much as I did before the pandemic, and I didn’t test a lot on 5G or even LTE, but with numbers like that, I’d expect battery life overall to be tremendous in almost any circumstance. Big phone, big battery, big battery life. It makes the lack of a 120Hz display puzzling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/37pUx3JgB0PUKctA6KREwo-rwJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022582/bfarsace_201106_4269_002.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is the most iPhone you can buy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cIvgGf"&gt;I’m just going to say it again: the iPhone 12 Pro Max is a very big phone. Big ambition, big camera sensor, big… size. I’ve been using it for a week, and I still haven’t gotten used to how big it is. I’m curious to see how accessory makers handle the size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUeO4x"&gt;But the size allows for what I think is easily the best and most capable smartphone camera on the market right now, and a battery that seems to last forever. If you can deal with the size, I think it’s worth passing over the 12 Pro and getting the 12 Pro Max. Those are two dramatic and meaningful improvements for the money. This is a tremendous phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="39txgl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best iPhone... if you can deal with its size&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="COmL5P"&gt;But I can’t shake the feeling that the iPhone 12 Pro Max very much feels like the perfect phone for the life I led &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the pandemic. I used to spend a lot of time commuting, and on airplanes, and otherwise out and about getting work done on my phone. I used to go to a lot of events at night and take a lot of photos in bars. My notes indicate that I used to care a lot about mobile network speeds. This phone would have made significant improvements to all those things, but right now it just feels like another screen for social media on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCaoBt"&gt;I have a kid, and I always buy the latest phone to have the best camera. And there’s no question that this is the best camera. But if you’re feeling that usual tug to upgrade and you don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to, I do think you can wait this one out. Maybe 5G will be better next year. Maybe we’ll get that 120Hz display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="27J05I"&gt;Also: did I mention that it’s big?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="y5soJj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9534129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Motorola Razr (2020) review: 5G folding flip phone feels fine</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s better than the original in every way but still costs too much&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="fLiwtC"&gt;What a difference eleven months makes. That’s how long it took Motorola to iterate on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963294/motorola-razr-new-foldable-smartphone-android-hands-on-flip-phone-photos-video"&gt;original remake of the Razr&lt;/a&gt;. In that time, Motorola has crammed in 5G and improved virtually every aspect of the phone. Virtually every aspect of the original 2019 Razr &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; improvement — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;it was a mess&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGxY7t"&gt;This 2020 Razr is fine. But at $1,399, it’s also still incredibly expensive when compared to any other non-folding phone with similar capabilities. Whether that price is anywhere near worth it depends on how much you are willing to give up to have a cool, nostalgia-inducing flip phone with a folding screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ja8HHC"&gt;The new Razr is a cool phone, there’s no doubt. And now that it’s passed a minimum bar of usability and quality, I’ve mostly enjoyed using it. But I wouldn’t enjoy paying for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razr feels really thin when opened, but it’s no thinner than a standard iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dZe7yj"&gt;Motorola Razr (2020) design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="o1Ep7b"&gt;Motorola has done a great job maintaining the classic look and feel of the Razr with this iteration, right on down to the curved edges and jutting chin at the bottom. When closed, it is an elegant, pretty thing. Opened up, it feels thinner than it actually is — it’s about the same thickness as your standard-issue iPhone, but the overall design has that Razr ethos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YU5ZYL"&gt;The plastic screen feels better, too, thanks to some subtle changes to the hinge system that makes it all just seem a little sturdier. There are still some weird bumps in the middle, but no folding phone has figured out a way to avoid that yet. It’s not the prettiest screen — at 876 x 2142 pixels it has a super tall aspect ratio, and overall its color and clarity looks middling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Razr folds fully flat with no gap, unlike the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VhC5ZdAvqf4UQOefFwg2DgH3RR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21993120/dbohn_201023_4260_0005.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razr folds fully flat with no gap, unlike the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The hinge on the 2020 Razr is much improved while retaining the teardrop fold" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vHliCrKAbgCPXlZ4A72oIekSOgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21993114/dbohn_201023_4260_0010.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hinge on the 2020 Razr is much improved while retaining the teardrop fold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint sensor is on the Moto logo on the back, but that turns out to be an awkward spot to reach." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXCxU3BZwtzEcWn3Vqa1Mxt8WIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21993113/dbohn_201023_4260_0011.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fingerprint sensor is on the Moto logo on the back, but that turns out to be an awkward spot to reach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0XvwFy"&gt;Motorola has also added a little more springiness to the flip. It’s possible to flip it open with one hand, but it takes some practice. Once you figure out how to do it, it’s fun. The Razr can’t hold itself up at an angle like the Samsung Z Flip can, but the Z flip isn’t quite as satisfying as a physical thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbgWyk"&gt;I don’t want to gloss over that having a phone that folds down into a slim, pocketable shape is still incredible. I can go out with the thing in my back pocket and not worry about it sticking or even falling out when I sit (though sitting directly on it probably isn’t recommended). It just plain fits in pockets and bags where bigger, taller phones are awkward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwM1Tu"&gt;So, nostalgia box checked. But that wasn’t the problem with the original Razr reboot. That 2019 phone literally creaked and made grinding sounds when you opened it. This one is silent and smooth except for the faint hiss of the plastic screen sliding into place as you close it. And unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip, it closes completely with no gap since the screen can form a teardrop inside the hinge itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUqt21"&gt;The Razr comes in three colors: gold, graphite, and silver. The rear of the phone is flat glass with curved edges, which feels nice but is slippery as all get-out and weirdly doesn’t have a wireless charging coil underneath it. The best you can do there is a 15W USB-C fast charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZj5BE"&gt;Surprisingly, my major complaint with the hardware has nothing to do with the hinge or the screen, it’s with the fingerprint sensor’s placement. It’s on the back now, hidden within the Motorola logo. It turns out that is an awkward spot, smack in the middle of the phone when it’s open. It doesn’t require contortions to reach it, but it does make unlocking feel like a whole extra step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Razr’s Quick View display is convenient" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ua_fal-ZY32jlPdZwvSNUuFSIPw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21993117/dbohn_201023_4260_0008.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razr’s Quick View display is convenient.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Il0n0a"&gt;Motorola Razr (2020) performance and software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zfNYcF"&gt;The leg up the Razr has over the other flip phone on the market, Samsung’s Z Flip, is that big display on the outside of the phone. Motorola calls it a “quick view” display and it has a few features that are genuinely useful — but sometimes it’s a little buggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oI7oF"&gt;It has two states. Most of the time, it’s in a locked-down mode where you can long press icons to bring up previews and then swipe up to see even more previews. But the real move is to unlock the phone when it’s closed. Then you will have access to the full Android interface for notifications (including replies), a camera viewfinder, and even an app launcher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aTHfp4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s not a ton of room for a big battery inside the Razr, but with some care you can last through a day&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lFZf0O"&gt;You can put certain apps on an approved list for the quick view display, letting you run them on its 2.7-inch 800 x 600 screen. Most Android apps are straight up terrible at that size, but it is convenient to reply to a message with it — the keyboard works well with swipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xCSWx"&gt;The best part of the outer display is that you can use it as a camera viewfinder, letting you take selfies with the better of the two cameras on the Razr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcOEKX"&gt;The new Razr has 5G, though it doesn’t support the higher-speed mmWave version of 5G (no big loss there). It’s also available unlocked and will take a standard SIM card — two things you couldn’t actually get with the original, believe it or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dN8hbb"&gt;Motorola is using the processor you’ll find on most midrange Android phones (like the Pixel 5 and 4A 5G), Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G. It’s paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The upshot of all that is the Razr ran fine in my testing, but I wasn’t throwing a ton of massively complicated games at it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zG1bPL"&gt;The processor may also help the diminutive 2,800mAh battery last longer. I definitely needed a charger with this phone by early evening, but with lighter use (including spending more time on the outer display instead of opening the phone up), I could see getting through a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can use the better outer camera for selfies" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4aoSzNB9CgkgrXsn6vLkvaxyEtQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21993122/dbohn_201023_4260_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the better outer camera for selfies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="biHooL"&gt;Motorola Razr (2020) camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="owv62M"&gt;There are two cameras on the Motorola Razr. The selfie camera on the inside, next to the screen, has a 20-megapixel sensor crammed into a tiny little space. You should use it for videoconferencing and nothing else, as it’s not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRO49A"&gt;Luckily, you can take selfies with the main outer camera easily. It has a 48-megapixel sensor that puts out 12-megapixel images. You can use one of Motorola’s custom gestures (a twist of your wrist, in this case) to launch it and then snap photos of yourself all day long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qbyJpa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9548556"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s9stcf"&gt;When you do, though, try to make sure you’re in decent lighting. Anything too challenging and this otherwise thoroughly average camera goes a little sideways. The same advice applies when you’ve opened the phone up to use the camera like normal, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Sl7q9"&gt;I just can’t really predict what the Razr will choose to do. In twilight, it would jump to night mode even when it’s not at all necessary. It takes time to get familiar with any new camera, but this one will take a little more getting used to than most to learn its quirks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjR5cc"&gt;As with most phones, you can get really nice photos out of the 2020 Motorola Razr in the right conditions. Most times, colors are a little muted and there’s not much sharpness in the details, then out of nowhere it’ll blow out a flower for no particular reason. Every now and then it’ll seriously impress me, as with the sunset shot in the gallery above. Mostly, though, it’s merely okay, including for selfies and especially in low light. Overall, the thing is mostly competent enough for Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJQTCi"&gt;Add all of that up and you have a camera that is a significant improvement over the camera on the 2019 Razr and a significant disappointment compared to the camera on pretty much any Android phone that costs $600 or more (to say nothing of the $349 Pixel 4A). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 2020 Motorola Razr with 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SVb-u3sKN9tP5jCayjT7jNj1tN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21993116/dbohn_201023_4260_0009.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 Motorola Razr with 5G&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Cebn7x"&gt;I feel like a broken record when it comes to reviewing folding phones, but here goes anyway. At some point, I have to believe that the cost of these flexible screens and carefully engineered hinges will come down. If they did, a device like the 2020 Razr would be a perfectly acceptable midrange phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ca4767"&gt;Judged just as a phone, there’s nothing standout on the Razr. The camera could be better, but otherwise it has decent battery life, performance, and even build quality. Judged as a flip phone, the Razr occupies its own well-designed niche next to the main competition, the more ho-hum but better in many ways, Galaxy Z Flip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cck8RH"&gt;I think that $1,400 should get you a phone that is amazing in nearly every possible regard, not just a cool design and a satisfying flip. At half the price, I’d be ten times more excited about it. At this price, the 2020 Razr cuts too sharply into any reasonable budget.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG Wing review: learning to fly, failing to soar </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;LG’s latest dual-screen phone flies too close to the sun&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="E6pq0F"&gt;The LG Wing is a smartphone unlike any other, with a wild rotating design that makes it stand out when compared to even the weirdest 2020 phones. It’s also the first phone in LG’s new Explorer Project brand, which looks to experiment with new ways to think about how we design and use our smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vl1vkz"&gt;The $999 Wing is a bold experiment, but it can’t translate that creativity into a phone that’s worth the added price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qxizzN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9547021"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QFParR"&gt;The LG Wing looks cool, but it’s also expensive — at $999, it costs as much as a brand-new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS895US899&amp;amp;ei=j06YX7n-D5nAytMPir6MyAQ&amp;amp;q=verge+s20&amp;amp;oq=verge+s20&amp;amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCAAQyQMyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BwgAEEcQsAM6CAgAEMkDEJECOggIABCxAxCDAToFCAAQsQM6BQgAEJECOgYIABAWEB5Q-x1YwSFg0yVoAnAAeAGAAbMCiAGkB5IBBzAuNC4wLjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEEwAEB&amp;amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5gealnNXsAhUZoHIEHQofA0kQ4dUDCA0&amp;amp;uact=5"&gt;Galaxy S20&lt;/a&gt; and more than plenty of other fantastic phones. That’s a lot of money to put down on a funky screen gimmick, which ultimately is the biggest factor that separates the Wing from less expensive phones with similar specs, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21405357/motorola-one-5g-verizon-att-macro-camera-ring-light-specs-price"&gt;Motorola One 5G&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304097/lg-velvet-phone-review-price-us-specs-camera"&gt;LG’s own Velvet&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTyFFZ"&gt;So, let’s talk about those screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="84WHjo"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="LG Wing hands-on: really flipping fun|95647" data-volume-uuid="068430365" data-volume-id="95647" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-869" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ePBFhA"&gt;Looking at the Wing, it’s easy to mistake it for just another supersized Android phone. In fact, it looks similar to the LG Velvet, a phone with which it also shares most of its specs. With a 6.8-inch, 9:20.5 OLED display, it’s just a bit smaller and a bit thicker than a Galaxy S20 Ultra. Credit to LG’s design here: at 0.43 inches (10.9mm) thick, it’s still compact enough that you wouldn’t necessarily guess that there’s anything more to it. (I tried, in fact, with several family members, none of whom suspected anything out of the ordinary.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2eVgkG"&gt;Of course, the Wing isn’t just a big Android phone. With just a flick of the lower right corner of the phone, the entire main display swivels up and around to a horizontal orientation, revealing a second, 3.9-inch OLED screen underneath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Cf2DQj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The mechanism is top-notch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V7trnu"&gt;The mechanism is top-notch, with the display gliding smoothly and snapping shut with an incredibly satisfying, audible “snick.” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUWbtrG5IKI&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;Check out our hands-on video&lt;/a&gt; here for a better idea of what that all looks and sounds like. (As an aside, the Wing can effectively only be opened if you hold it in your right hand, which may or may not be an issue for some people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ok0cNP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454384/lg-wing-teardown-hinge-circuit-board-display-springs-hydraulic-damper"&gt;actual engineering&lt;/a&gt; behind the Wing is fascinating, involving clever mechanical tricks and a miniature hydraulic damper — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxGI8r8vAFk"&gt;JerryRigEverything’s teardown&lt;/a&gt; has a good look at how it all works. And you can actually &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; that damper kick in when you slide open the phone — there’s an ever-so-small half-second pause as the display gets caught on the damper, which then slowly and gently finishes its rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxRHph"&gt;While the hardware is excellent, the Wing reveals that as cool of a concept as the rotating and secondary displays are, there are just not enough practical use cases to justify them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xBfIxp8m7s2ODj8XyglH2RUF9Lk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990608/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0009.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Wing in its open configuration...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yuz4pFE8W2VXFfFb9KCioJqNL0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990612/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0005.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;... and in its closed mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gjW5Y4"&gt;There aren’t that many applications that it makes sense to run in a horizontal orientation on Android. Most phone apps are designed to be used in portrait, the way that most people hold most phones most of the time. And even apps that do have landscape modes (like Twitter, Gmail, or even Chrome) just don’t look very good that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70PCcE"&gt;Technically, you can use the phone rotated so the main display is vertical, with the smaller screen sticking out like a little vestigial limb, but it’s awkward to hold the Wing that way, as the bulk of the weight of the phone is still almost entirely in the now-horizontal back portion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxXj1r"&gt;The best use case is for video or gaming — tasks that actually benefit from a horizontal orientation and can have potentially useful second-screen apps. But there were so few situations in day-to-day use where I found it to be faster or worth the extra time and effort to fiddle around with the second screen mode instead of just switching back and forth between apps. Sure, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; watch a YouTube video and text at the same time, but buying a phone just for the vanishingly few times that you might need to do that seems unnecessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JHoh1o_5HPFW71nrvu716UduAJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990610/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0007.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gaming is one of the few areas that the Wing’s potential really shines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CgIDIO"&gt;If you’re willing to sit down and go out of your way, you can come up with a few use cases where it actually makes sense to use the Wing the way LG imagines. It’s a fantastic device for completing weekly challenges in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, for example: I could play the game on the main screen while keeping a Chrome window or YouTube walkthrough open to show the location of the specific items I needed to collect or objectives that I had to accomplish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbOjh9"&gt;If you have a terrible attention span during movies, it’s also good for scrolling through Twitter or checking IMDb to figure out what TV show that actor was in while watching Netflix, although the second small display is hard to use for any overly complex tasks due to its size and nearly square aspect ratio. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhWRM7JC4tnGFDEVBAgoGWQb034=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990611/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wing isn’t much thicker than a regular Android phone, despite the second display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tCsPXB"&gt;There’s a constant awkwardness to using the software on the Wing. While a few apps — like LG’s built-in note-taking software or music apps — are designed to take full advantage of the dual display, support is rare on third-party apps. It’s easy to imagine a world where more apps could take advantage of a second display: games could offer a Wii U-esque second screen experience for maps or inventory, or Maps could display a list of upcoming directions over on the side of your main navigation. But support is few and far between (of all the games I tried, only &lt;em&gt;Asphalt 9&lt;/em&gt; had any real second-screen support).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bjqfxe"&gt;YouTube, for example, will pop up a useful set of media controls when you’re watching a video on the second display, but nearly every other video app doesn’t offer similar options. It’s a shame, too, because the screen covers the volume keys on the side when rotated out, and they’re already hard enough to find given the size of the Wing and the fact that they’re the same size and shape as the power button (which is located directly below). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlJeHo"&gt;Another barrier is the Wing’s use of an in-display fingerprint reader, which is located on the bottom of the main display (where you’d think it would be). But the natural way to use the Wing isn’t to tap the screen and unlock the fingerprint reader; it’s to swing open the second display, which puts the fingerprint reader impossibly out of reach. I first registered a finger on my other hand to unlock the phone, and then just shut it off altogether. LG seems aware that it’s an issue: when the phone is swiveled open, the numpad for manually entering a password appears on the smaller screen under your thumb, but short of adding a second in-display scanner on the secondary screen, I’m not sure what a good solution here is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9H4shxAxhuUtZu5MG3uhY6Okzsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990609/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0008.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Wing’s rear triple-camera system includes a dedicated gimbal camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cBDXOQ"&gt;The rest of the Wing checks nearly every box for an upper midrange Android smartphone. The Snapdragon 765G, combined with 8GB of RAM, is enough for smoothly running nearly everything (although there’s still the occasional spot of lag, particularly when it comes to rotating open the display). And the 4,000mAh battery is enough to easily last a full day of battery life, even with heavy use of both displays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJLYV8"&gt;The LG Wing also has support for 5G; the model I tested was the Verizon variant, which offers support for both millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-6GHz connections (including Verizon’s newly launched nationwide network). Speeds on that network were marginally better than LTE, but the real benefit comes from Verizon’s mmWave network, which is still scarce. Like any other 5G phone, unless you live directly on top of a mmWave hotspot, it’s not a great reason to get the Wing specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOlXg6"&gt;There are also a few misses for a $1,000 phone: the screen refresh rate is limited to just 60Hz on both displays, which can help contribute to the occasional slowness of the phone (especially considering that nearly every other Android phone in this price range offers better). There’s no waterproofing, although it’s admittedly hard to imagine how LG could have accomplished that with the swiveling design. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OahXQjkyTloglNaY-2rPPvVuMPQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990614/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In gimbal mode, the lower display shows camera controls for panning around a shot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iOJXdC"&gt;The LG Wing has four cameras: a single 32MP pop-up selfie camera built into the top frame and a trio of rear cameras on the back. The pop-up camera isn’t just a style choice to eliminate the notch, either. It’s necessary to keep the camera located where it should be, even when you’re rotating the display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MmphG"&gt;Things are more interesting on the back of the phone, though, where LG has three cameras: a 64-megapixel main camera, a standard 13-megapixel ultrawide for use when holding the phone regularly, and a dedicated 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that features a physically rotated sensor that’s dedicated to the Wing’s “gimbal mode.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V0EI8A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9547053"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yDqRly"&gt;The nature of the display means that you can only use the two standard cameras when the screen is rotated vertically and the gimbal mode camera (which LG says has a special “hexa motion” sensor for stabilization) when the screen is rotated horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3R80An"&gt;The main camera is good, with bright colors and a good level of detail. But low-light performance isn’t on par with 2020’s best phones, and while LG’s night mode helps to alleviate that, it comes at an additional loss of detail in exchange for the brighter shot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6lhHUaDTlECpHt1U5dVt8c-qwRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990613/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pop-up selfie camera on the LG Wing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bHTrTf"&gt;But the most notable camera feature is the gimbal mode, which takes advantage of the Wing’s design: the main display shows your video output, while the smaller panel works as the grip, complete with gimbal controls. But as much as it looks like a real gimbal mount, LG’s implementation is almost entirely software-based — the camera isn’t rotating around on a different axis to keep in place, like an actual gimbal mount would. It’s just using digital cropping on the wide field of view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="dM94Af"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The gimbal mode is neat, but it’s just a software trick&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MFuHP7"&gt;Still, the software effect is impressive: LG does a good job of keeping footage locked and stable, even through a fair amount of motion. Panning around a frame also results in smooth, clean footage. But the fact that it’s entirely done through software means that what looks like the Wing’s most unique feature is actually something that LG could replicate on any device, if it chose. And given the Wing’s already pricey cost, it’s hard to imagine that you’re getting a better experience here than with a cheaper combination of say, a Pixel 5 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21401564/dji-osmo-mobile-4-phone-gimbal-magnetic-announce-price-release-date"&gt;a motorized smartphone gimbal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qi400B"&gt;Like the rest of the Wing, the cameras aren’t bad — but for what the phone costs, you can get better for your money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yCn9JsJxwhJ87ikzQbNSAP7Y7DE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990616/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0002.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Wing in a rotated use case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="coAafL"&gt;In my time with the Wing, there was one app that was perfectly suited to its unique design: the now-doomed streaming service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527197/quibi-streaming-service-mobile-shutting-down-end-katzenberg"&gt;Quibi&lt;/a&gt;, whose similarly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21208932/quibi-app-review-price-short-form-video-content-features-streaming-rotation"&gt;gimmicky “Turnstyle” video format&lt;/a&gt; (which is designed to seamlessly swap between portrait and landscape versions of a clip) was practically made for a phone that can instantly rotate its display to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvkdCU"&gt;But unfortunately, it feels like the LG Wing — at least in its current incarnation — is set for the same fate as Quibi, outclassed by products that offer more and better service for less money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EfpZ0r"&gt;The LG Wing’s rotating display is a marvel of engineering and an incredibly fun novelty, the kind of design innovation that’s exciting to see in a world where most smartphone designs are just variations on the same identical black slabs. But being new and interesting doesn’t mean that something is good, and without better software support or a lower price tag, it’s hard to recommend the Wing for anyone but the most jaded smartphone owners. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fairphone 3 Plus review: sustainability comes with compromises</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;You have to get behind the phone’s mission to face its flaws &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QE82bG"&gt;It’s hard not to be charmed by a smartphone that comes with a screwdriver in the box, especially when it’s as small and dinky as the one that comes with the Fairphone 3 Plus. In fact, that’s the only accessory you get with the phone. There’s no USB cable, no wall charger, and definitely no earbuds in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYyVLJ"&gt;This little screwdriver is an important indication of what you’re getting with the latest device from sustainable smartphone manufacturer Fairphone. For starters, the phone is designed to be as repairable as possible. It’s an upgraded version of last year’s Fairphone 3, one of only two devices to have earned a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FFairphone%2B3%2BTeardown%2F125573%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21534276%2Ffairphone-3-plus-review#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;perfect repairability score from &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond repairs, Fairphone also attempts to use ethically sourced materials where possible and offer good working conditions for the people making its phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0427l"&gt;These are all noble aims, and it’s hard not to want Fairphone to succeed. But wanting a smartphone manufacturer to succeed means holding its devices to a high standard because that’s how it can attract the biggest audience and create the biggest positive impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNvYMB"&gt;Holding the Fairphone 3 Plus to these higher standards can be frustrating, though. At €469 / £425 (the Fairphone 3 Plus isn’t available for purchase in the US, but that converts to roughly $550), it’s competing in price with the likes of the Pixel 4A (€349 / £349) and this year’s iPhone SE (€489 / £399). It’s a crowded price point, one that the Fairphone 3 Plus struggles to be competitive at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RX3BM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9544463"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ui2y7s"&gt;Before we get into talking about the phone itself, it’s worth taking a moment to talk about how it’s made. For starters, 40 percent of the plastic used in its construction is recycled, as is some copper. It uses gold from &lt;a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/2016/01/27/how-we-got-fairtrade-certified-gold-in-the-fairphone-2-supply-chain/"&gt;Fairtrade certified mines&lt;/a&gt;, tin from conflict-free mines, and Fairphone also has initiatives to improve conditions for factory workers in China. It’s a lot of stuff you probably don’t think about with other phones, but Fairphone is making an effort to be ethical across its supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iTYDfN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s incredibly easy to open up the Fairphone 3 Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aV1IKY"&gt;When it comes to the final product, however, the Fairphone 3 Plus’ design is basic. This isn’t a phone that’s designed to hide its technology inside of a sleek slab of glass or metal. Repairability dictates a design that’s slightly bulkier, as Fairphone makes space for all of the user-accessible screws and plastic clasps this requires. The phone also &lt;a href="https://support.fairphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001535486-Is-Fairphone-dust-or-water-resistant-"&gt;isn’t dust or water resistant&lt;/a&gt; because this would require using seals or glue that would get in the way of repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rKC4t"&gt;You’re exposed to these repairability features just by setting up the phone. There’s no SIM tray accessible from the outside of the phone, so instead, you have to pull off its plastic back, take out the removable battery, and then slide your SIM card into an internal slot. Personally, this was a nostalgic process that reminded me of what it was like to use feature phones in the ‘90s, but for others, it might come across as a bit dated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDOQoYVACpBe4tylbJSanqpRM3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21980706/jporter_201021_4251_0009.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take off the phone’s back, and you’ll find a removable battery and a set of easily accessible screws.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KQbqSQ"&gt;Once you’ve got the back off of the phone, you can see all of the design features that contributed to that perfect repairability score. There’s no awkward glue or proprietary screws holding the phone together, just a series of plastic clasps and standard Phillips head screws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4N5CL"&gt;It’s charming in its simplicity, but it also makes for an old-fashioned-looking device. Compared to most modern smartphones the Fairphone 3 Plus is a bulky slab of plastic. It’s got big fat bezels above and below the screen and an oddly prominent earpiece and selfie camera. If you like technology that looks like technology, then you’ll appreciate it, but it’s far from sleek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbgzyD"&gt;Functionally, this design can also be a bit awkward. I found the Fairphone 3 Plus has an annoying design quirk where the location of the rear fingerprint sensor is just too high up the back of the phone, forcing me to readjust my grip to unlock the phone. As a right-handed person, it also felt a little weird having both the volume and power buttons on its left side. Then again, my left-handed roommate loved it. Make of that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lNcOfnVDu8PoyQT4LVMSAfBLxiE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21980711/jporter_201021_4251_0004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a rear fingerprint sensor, but it’s uncomfortably high up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7N9a3ibgeOX3CVRQwmbwonemVWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21980712/jporter_201021_4251_0008.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, there’s a headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VqvTRt"&gt;Design gripes aside, the rest of the Fairphone 3 Plus’ appearance is unexceptional. It has a 1080p LCD display that doesn’t get very bright with colors that look a little washed out. Its single speaker is average, and unlike a lot of other phones, it’s placed on the left side of the device rather than the bottom. The location meant I accidentally covered it slightly less while holding the phone landscape to watch videos but more when I held it in portrait. Regardless, you’re going to want to use headphones here, so thankfully, there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack to make that easier for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hw3Zys"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Fairphone 3 Plus isn’t a very fast phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AghQla"&gt;Performance-wise, the Fairphone 3 Plus chugs. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 632 with 4GB of RAM, which translates into a two-year-old chip with an amount of RAM that only budget Android handsets try to get away with these days. Stutters are a fact of life with the Fairphone 3 Plus, whether you’re activating Google Assistant to perform a quick task, flicking between apps, or opening the app drawer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juKxPW"&gt;I also encountered a couple of annoying bugs during my time with the phone. Most annoying was that I couldn’t find a way to import my WhatsApp contacts or chat backup. Every time I tried to do so, the app got stuck in a loading loop, which didn’t end after even leaving it to run for half an hour. I’m running WhatsApp’s Android beta software, but even so, I’ve never experienced this on other devices. After switching Android to gesture navigation, I also found that UI elements on the home screen would overlap with one another. It makes the phone feel a little cheap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ru7Jl3sNsfQnKTgDjvhGz1pBtLA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21980707/jporter_201021_4251_0002.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn on gesture controls, and the phone’s UI elements can sometimes overlap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0rv4loAO96fLOUvxYNCPcXzDHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21980705/jporter_201021_4251_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fairphone’s bezels are big.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JHLqgA"&gt;The battery life of the Fairphone 3 Plus is nothing exceptional. Most days, I’d end the day with around 40 percent of charge, but that’s me working from home, so I’m not doing anything battery-intensive like navigation. Screen-on time varied massively between a low of three and a high of five and a half hours. In normal use, I think this is a phone that’ll just about last you a day, but not much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XifCil"&gt;At least part of this dated hardware can be blamed on the fact that the Fairphone 3 Plus is fundamentally the same phone as last year’s Fairphone 3. That’s by design since it means that any Fairphone 3 owners who want to benefit from the Fairphone 3 Plus’ upgraded cameras can buy these separately as upgrade modules for their existing handset rather than buying a whole new phone. It’s an interesting response to the criticism companies like Apple face for bringing out new phones every year, which critics say encourages unnecessary yearly upgrades. It’s an admirable design feature, but it creates unfortunate compromises for the final device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BpNBIw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fairphone 3 owners can get the new cameras as upgrade modules&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j8UjV8"&gt;These specific camera upgrades in the Fairphone 3 Plus are focused on its new higher-resolution sensors. The rear camera has increased from 12 to 48 megapixels, while the selfie camera is now 16 megapixels up from 8 megapixels last year. You still only get one rear camera, but considering how low-resolution and unnecessary a lot of secondary cameras are, that’s probably an acceptable trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Xatlt"&gt;Despite the resolution improvements, however, the overall quality of the photographs taken by the Fairphone 3 Plus only ends up being okay. It might not be priced like a flagship, but it’s still £75 more expensive than the Pixel 4A, a midrange phone that offers very similar performance to its more expensive siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7CHc2T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9544505"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xJHohe"&gt;In daylight, the Fairphone 3 Plus tends toward producing detailed images with lots of contrast. They have punch, but this can sometimes come at the expense of shadow detail, and images can sometimes look overly sharp. The combination can create some noisy photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bLrrj"&gt;This is especially apparent in low-light situations, where detail can end up being crushed out of darker areas of an image. This means that when things get really dark, you can lose detail entirely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBiZbw"&gt;I generally liked the photos I got out of the Fairphone 3 Plus’ selfie camera, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HigK9G"&gt;Despite the camera improvements, the Fairphone 3 Plus still offers an average smartphone camera. It’s fine in daylight, but you don’t get much flexibility, and in low-light images can end up looking grainy and lacking in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJ_IyAQlEkNkvejTrFoqWaKhne0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21980710/jporter_201021_4251_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone’s upgraded camera modules only deliver average photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XpjGZL"&gt;It feels wrong to criticize the Fairphone 3 Plus by the same metrics we use to rank other smartphones because it makes such an effort in areas that a lot of other manufacturers aren’t interested in. It really is remarkable just how easy it is to take this phone apart, and Fairphone’s efforts to source its materials ethically should be applauded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9EzlHq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A budget phone with a midrange price&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JLx6Mi"&gt;But all of these efforts, no matter how worthwhile, come at a cost. In terms of the device that sits in your hands at the end of the day, you’re paying more for less functionality. Performance can be buggy and slow, and battery life and camera performance are average. It’s a phone with charm, but it’s far from stylish, sleek, or any of the other compliments we throw around about phones from other manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Bjm564"&gt;If you are someone who wants a more ethical and sustainable alternative to a budget £200 device, then the Fairphone 3 Plus delivers. It’ll serve your needs in the same way as a budget smartphone will in 2020 but at a price premium that reflects its ethically sourced materials and repairability. But don’t expect this to compete with other similarly priced phones. Fairphone has different priorities, and in order to buy one of its phones, you need to share them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple iPhone 12 Pro review: ahead of its time</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;5G, LIDAR, MagSafe — the new iPhone 12 Pro has a lot of things you won’t be able to do much with right now&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ktg5nh"&gt;It’s a big year for the iPhone: Apple’s iPhone 12 line is totally redesigned and features four models — the iPhone 12 mini, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21287029"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone 12 Pro, and the iPhone 12 Pro Max — at a range of screen sizes and price points. Across the board, Apple’s added new video features, a new MagSafe charging system, the new A14 processor, and all of the hype it can muster for 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTzaMT"&gt;It’s obvious what sets the mini and Max iPhone 12s apart, but the two 6.1-inch models in the middle of the line are remarkably similar. The iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 Pro have the same basic design, very similar OLED displays, and the same processors and 5G capabilities. The Pro adds an extra telephoto camera lens, a LIDAR sensor, a little more RAM, twice the base storage, and a shiny stainless steel frame. All that will cost you $999, around $200 more than a base iPhone 12 at the carrier-subsidized price of $799.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IuYKee"&gt;Now, there are some of you who are going to spend the extra money because this is the shiny one. In most cases, I would make the same choice because I have come to accept my weaknesses. But it’s worth diving in to see if the extra money is worth it, especially since the iPhone 12 now has an OLED display, which means the differences between the regular iPhone and the Pro are fundamentally much smaller than last year, when the regular model had a lower-resolution LCD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whLKuv"&gt;So the real question for the iPhone 12 Pro is whether the small list of extra features justifies a roughly $200 price bump from the standard iPhone 12. And if you’re spending that much more, it might be worth it to wait a little while longer and spend another $100 on the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which will add a bigger display and a larger main camera sensor with a very intriguing new sensor-shift stabilization system that could offer a huge jump in picture quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wl5IU3"&gt;That leaves the 12 Pro in a weird spot, and really, I think it comes down to how much you might use the telephoto lens or shoot portrait photos at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWHsnh"&gt;Then again, it’s shiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tg3swz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9534219"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QjSChR"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1a4ewb"&gt;The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro share the same fundamental new design, which is very squared off and very flat — almost shockingly flat. Nearly every other phone has a curved edge and an obvious border between the display and the frame, but the iPhone 12s feels much more like a single piece. It reminds me a little of the iPhone 5, but more importantly, it looks and feels very different than any other modern phone, in the way Apple is historically good at making older designs seem instantly out of date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRaNOo"&gt;Oddly, the squared-off design also makes the iPhone 12 Pro seem more substantial than it actually is. It doesn’t look it, but it’s thinner than an iPhone 11 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EUgoRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Air (2020) review: take it from the Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"},{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 review: raising the bar","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LifubQ"&gt;As I mentioned, the 12 Pro is the shiny one, and the glossy stainless steel frame instantly picked up fingerprints. This is a phone you will be trying to keep clean quite often if you don’t put it in a case. Even still, this is the first iPhone in a long time that I’ve been sad about covering. It’s just nice to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0aKRxovB5kXvkkS_Zm8iOYkUxz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973365/akrales_201018_4238_0443.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro’s stainless steel frame looks great but catches fingerprints with ease.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rhVzUV"&gt;The front of the phone is covered in what Apple calls “Ceramic Shield,” a hybrid of glass and ceramic. Between the new material — you can’t call it “glass” because it’s technically not glass — and the new design, Apple claims the iPhone 12 line has four times better drop performance than the previous models, with the same scratch resistance. (I drop my phone a lot, so I’m excited to see how this goes.) On the back, you’ll find the same type of glass as last year, but the new design should improve its drop performance as well, Apple says. One thing Apple would not tell me is how resistant this stainless steel frame is to nicks and scratches… and we’ve already put a tiny nick in the frame of our review unit, even though all it’s really done is travel from video shoot to video shoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="hF8iwS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9534129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MmmkVj"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro’s OLED display is larger than the iPhone 11 Pro, at 6.1 inches, and the phone is slightly taller as a result. The display is otherwise basically the same as last year in terms of brightness and pixel density, which means it looks excellent, although it’s still a 60Hz refresh rate, which at this point is behind virtually every Android phone at $700 and up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2TTka"&gt;There are excuses to be made about Apple’s sales volumes and available display panel supply, but in the end, a 60Hz display is simply not very… pro. Indeed, Apple’s own iPad Pro has a ProMotion high refresh rate display. If you’ve only ever had iPhones, you will not really notice this because it is the same as ever. But if you have used a 120Hz display, the difference in smoothness when scrolling is certainly noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeQKEf"&gt;The bezels and notch at the top of the screen are still the same size, which more or less means eventually you just won’t notice them. Early adopters will notice that some apps need to be updated for this new screen size — Instagram is a little broken, as usual — but the iPhone ecosystem generally adapts quickly, so I’d expect a flurry of app updates to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSnRYZ"&gt;On the sides of the phone, you’ll find four standard antenna gaps, and US models have a millimeter-wave (mmWave) antenna window for ultrawideband (UWB) 5G on Verizon. Apple told us that holding the phone with your hand over this window shouldn’t affect wireless performance and that there’s no particular guidance on how to hold the phone. I have large hands and basically can’t hold the phone without covering the antenna window unless I try, and I didn’t have any issues during my brief UWB tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nG3pHT"&gt;The back of the phone features Apple’s new MagSafe magnetic wireless charging and mount system, which feels like the connector equivalent of the summer before college for the first time: the future is bright and exciting, and you get to reinvent your whole situation from scratch. But the days of the Lightning connector are obviously coming to a close, and it’s okay to be sad about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivDMCy"&gt;MagSafe is extremely clever as a concept and exceedingly fine in reality. I am excited about magnetic car mounts and stabilizer gimbals and other accessories that don’t require fiddling to attach. I also think there will be neat uses of the additional alignment magnet just below the charging coil; that’s the one that keeps Apple’s just-okay wallet case attached correctly. Apple seems confident that an actual MagSafe accessory ecosystem will develop, unlike the iPad Smart Connector. There are already third-party chargers and car mounts and things being announced. (Apple claims taking its more standard cases on and off the phone is easier because of the magnets, and I have no idea what they’re talking about. It seems just the same as ever.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7yD6gGjYi8W6TMRlPhnEvs7HSy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973364/akrales_201018_4238_0464.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe charger is a $39 accessory that snaps to the back of the iPhone 12 Pro with magnets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dClDw21tYnuGxCT7vyH4OkRwmLk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973363/akrales_201018_4238_0505.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s cases also use magnets, but the process of putting them on and taking them off feels the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ifabnU"&gt;Interesting possibilities aside, the actual MagSafe charging puck is pretty huge for something you might carry around with you even though it’s small for a wireless charger, and I’m not particularly excited about traveling with it in my bag. The cord itself is short, so it does feel like only a baby step toward a version that’ll work while you’re on the couch or in bed with a low battery. Apple has yet to come out with one with a longer cord, but it seems inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjKZxL"&gt;MagSafe is also expensive. If you want to use Apple’s $39 MagSafe charger so you can get fast 15-watt charging, you’ll need to buy your own 20-watt USB-C power adapter, or shell out for Apple’s at $19 because it’s no longer in the box. (In general, the removal of the power adapter and headphones from the iPhone box this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;seems like a good thing&lt;/a&gt; but with mixed environmental repercussions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuwM7k"&gt;If you don’t want to pay that much, you can use any regular Qi wireless charger for up to 7.5-watt charging, same as the iPhone 11 line, and Apple says third parties will be able to build approved MagSafe chargers in the future, so hopefully there are some cheaper options soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqqUXm"&gt;All in all, MagSafe is a very clever idea that needs some more bake time in the wild before it can actually replace the Lightning connector and deliver the port-less iPhone Apple seems to be headed toward in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FCnOzrfhH7jyd4-CTtSnpmQ3mz8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973374/akrales_201018_4238_0293.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro has three cameras — normal, ultrawide, and telephoto — plus a LIDAR sensor on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aL5zo9"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="unaZRP"&gt;Last year I said the iPhone 11 Pro had the best camera on a smartphone, and it’s not like the iPhone 12 Pro went backward. But it’s only a small step forward — enough to stay just ahead of the competition. Most of the improvements are fairly minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhy4wy"&gt;The main camera has a very slightly brighter lens than last year, which helps it in low light, and Apple’s new Smart HDR 3 processing seems to be, well, a little smarter. The noise reduction is improved and looks better than the iPhone 11: photos look less grainy, and there’s a little more detail. The photos are also slightly more contrasty; every year, Apple seems to be more willing to let highlights be highlights and shadows be shadows, which is a look I’m personally fond of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="U9YDvt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9534291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="co4kLF"&gt;All four cameras on the phone can do night mode now, which is very nice to have, but it’s most useful on the front camera for night mode selfies. Using the tele or the ultrawide for night mode shots works, but I’d stick with the main camera. It’s the best camera on the phone, and it takes the best images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2Z2Hi"&gt;There are some other small but noticeable photo improvements over the 11 Pro: the ultrawide lens distorts a little less at the edges, and photos from the ultrawide and telephoto are a tad sharper and more detailed. There are also some new settings: you can actually turn lens correction off, and you can turn off both Smart HDR and “scene detection,” which tries to intelligently recognize a shot and expose it correctly. It’s nice to see Apple embrace additional camera options, but I would generally leave everything flipped on; if you are offended by auto camera modes, you should just use an app with good manual controls like Halide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U0B8i7Zxb84VNoUlyzAmSOn-b7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973385/akrales_201017_4238_0022.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 12 Pro doesn’t have much in the way of camera hardware upgrades. The improvements are mostly due to Apple’s new processing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7EFdhd"&gt;The 12 Pro also has a new LIDAR sensor on the back, something we first saw on the iPad Pro. If you’re deep into AR gimmicks, you’re going to love the LIDAR sensor. It makes AR gimmicks better than ever. (I do not love AR gimmicks, but the ones I tried were quite nice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ryb4H"&gt;In regular, non-augmented reality, most people will take advantage of the LIDAR sensor on the 12 Pro in low-light situations, where it enables the camera to focus much more quickly — up to six times faster, according to Apple — and also take night mode portrait shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hhddhPIPnQjekSinmlXYcc5VS4s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973854/IMG_0153.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night mode portraits let you get the fake blur even in dark situations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G99TSR"&gt;In testing, the focus was indeed fast, and iPhone 12 Pro low-light photos were sharper than the iPhone 11 Pro because it has a brighter lens that allows for faster shutter speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVbYuJ"&gt;Night mode portrait shots are remarkably impressive — although they only work with the wide lens, not the tele. Google’s Pixel 5 can take Night Sight portrait photos as well, but it can be fiddly to make it happen. The iPhone 12 Pro just took impressive photos, no fiddling required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvN5OJ"&gt;Unless you are extremely committed to either AR gimmicks or night mode portrait photos, I don’t think you’ll get much value out of the iPhone 12 LIDAR sensor. When you take photos in regular light, the camera focuses just like always; the LIDAR sensor isn’t active. In many ways, it feels like LIDAR is mostly on the phone so that Apple and other people can figure out what to do with it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abWUKt"&gt;Compared to the Google Pixel 5 and the Samsung Note 20 Ultra, the iPhone 12 Pro delivers exactly what we’ve come to expect from Apple: great photos in almost every case, with balanced colors and great details. I still prefer the Pixel look ever so slightly, and I am reliably informed that there are people who prefer Samsung’s hyperrealistic colors, but the iPhone 11 Pro was the phone to beat. The iPhone 12 Pro slightly improves on the 11 Pro in most situations and adds the ability to get usable shots in even harder edge cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Gpuh6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9534258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GffCtz"&gt;The big thing hanging over all of this is that we have yet to test the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which has a much larger main camera sensor with a new stabilization system. The tele lens on the 12 Pro is nice to have, but there’s a reason Apple puts the ultrawide on the regular 12: it’s just more versatile. If you’re spending extra money because you want a slightly better camera on your iPhone, I’d wait to see if spending just a little bit more extra money can get you a far better camera. This, as my colleague Dan Seifert says, is how they get you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o2xFt5Ax0oslmCgD-8IrcgFo_7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973384/akrales_201017_4238_0053.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The big video upgrade is in the form of Dolby Vision HDR capture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jWymoT"&gt;Speaking of video, the other big new camera feature across the iPhone 12 line is the ability to create Dolby Vision HDR video. There is no way to talk about this without falling deeply into the weeds of video formats, but I promise you it’s going to be fun. I promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7PtK3"&gt;HDR stands for high dynamic range. You’re probably familiar with the term from still photography, where HDR systems in smartphone cameras have been a revolution. But to understand HDR in video, you have to set aside everything you know from photography HDR. It’s very, very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUjBqH"&gt;HDR in video basically means that the brightest part of the image can get much brighter, and you can see more detail in the bright parts of an image compared to SDR, or standard dynamic range. This is actually really easy to show on the iPhone. When you shoot video, it captures in HDR, and when you swipe through your camera roll to play it back, you can see the display change modes and get brighter. That’s HDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6RqCc"&gt;HDR videos also generally have more available colors in them. SDR videos can have 16 million colors, while HDR videos on the iPhone have 700 million colors. That’s a lot of additional colors, and it means things like gradients and sunsets and so on look smoother. Add it all up, and HDR video is brighter and more colorful than SDR video, which is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CX9K0A"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watching&lt;/em&gt; HDR video has gotten very easy over the past few years. Almost every new higher-end TV and phone supports HDR, and most of the major streaming services offer movies and TV shows in HDR. (HBO Max is the most notable exception.) But it’s still been hard to &lt;em&gt;shoot &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;share&lt;/em&gt; HDR video yourself. It’s not impossible: Samsung phones since the Galaxy S10 can shoot in a format called HDR10+, but it’s a setting that’s tucked deeply away. And if you’re really motivated, there are workflows to get HDR video out of everything from a Sony RX100 Mark V on up. But none of that is easy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8QXFz"&gt;So the iPhone shooting HDR video by default, out of the box, is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hngFFg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone shooting HDR video out of the box is a big deal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pprVtN"&gt;I’ve been saying “HDR” this whole time, not “Dolby Vision.” That’s because Dolby Vision is one kind of HDR — a format — and there are lots of HDR formats. With lots of formats come compatibility problems. And, yep, Dolby Vision on the iPhone 12 has some compatibility problems — but not as many problems as I feared. Apple and Dolby have done something very smart to ensure long-term compatibility at the cost of some short-term incompatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUnSVc"&gt;Dolby Vision and the rival HDR10 format are what’s called &lt;em&gt;perceptual quantizer&lt;/em&gt; (PQ) HDR systems. And PQ systems are not backwards compatible with SDR displays, meaning Dolby Vision video has only been compatible with Dolby Vision displays. (Playing a Dolby Vision video on a non-Dolby Vision display would look completely wrong.) If you wanted to watch a Dolby Vision video on a regular display, you would have to re-encode it into SDR — basically, make an entirely new video file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozH78H"&gt;But the iPhone 12 shoots video in a newer version of Dolby Vision called Profile 8.4 that’s built on a standard called HLG, or hybrid log-gamma. HLG works differently than PQ systems; it was developed by broadcasters like the BBC and NHK to be backwards compatible with SDR displays so they would only have to broadcast one video stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFtNMe"&gt;All this means that an iPhone 12 HDR video is a 10-bit HLG file with additional Dolby Vision metadata on top, and it will happily play back as SDR on SDR displays, HLG on HLG displays, and Dolby Vision on Dolby Vision displays that support Profile 8.4. And iOS 14 is smart enough to know when the apps and devices you’re sharing video to don’t support this new format, and it’ll make sure you send something that works. It is all very clever, even though, in practice, what it means is you’re mostly sharing SDR video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jKwamY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple sacrificed some short-term compatibility today to ensure long-term compatibility tomorrow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n59uLJ"&gt;There’s a catch. (Of course.) Dolby Vision Profile 8.4 is a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; version of Dolby Vision, and that means a bunch of older Dolby Vision gear out there needs to be updated to support it. So I can’t promise you any random Dolby Vision TV with AirPlay 2 will play back iPhone 12 Pro video in Dolby Vision. You’ll have to check to see if your TV supports Profile 8.4. Dieter’s older Vizio P65 has AirPlay 2 but played back iPhone 12 Dolby Vision video in SDR. My 2016 LG B6 OLED supports Dolby Vision but not profile 8.4, and it wouldn’t play an iPhone 12 video file from a USB stick at all. It’s also old enough now that it’ll probably never get another software update to do so. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2UjZV"&gt;That said, new TVs will naturally support the newest versions of Dolby Vision, and you can always just plug in an Apple TV 4K and AirPlay to that. (The way iPhone 12 Dolby Vision video works with an Apple TV is wonky, though: you have to run the Apple TV in Dolby Vision mode all the time to make it work. If you are a sane person and use your Apple TV in SDR with “match content” turned on, you will still always see SDR video from an iPhone 12. I hope Apple fixes this very quickly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOg60J"&gt;Oh, and if you have a Mac, Dolby Vision video won’t be supported until macOS Big Sur comes out, and we don’t really know when that’s going to be. I also don’t know when the likes of Instagram and TikTok and YouTube will support Dolby Vision video from the iPhone; right now, you will see your videos in SDR when shared to those platforms. (YouTube supports HDR video right now, but only in HLG and HDR10. Formats!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gf6bR"&gt;So Dolby Vision video on the iPhone is a little complicated, and there will be some compatibility goofiness at the start. But over time, I’d expect it to fade away. TV manufacturers and social platforms have a lot of incentives to figure out how to play back people’s iPhone videos well, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcmJ1u"&gt;And in the meantime, it’s true that most people watch their smartphone videos &lt;em&gt;on their smartphones&lt;/em&gt;, and iPhone 12 Dolby Vision video looks very bright and colorful on the iPhone 12 Pro and other newer iPhones and iPads that support HDR. I’m excited it’s there and am even more excited it is the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIpQDM"&gt;I was lucky enough to work on this review with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; video director Becca Farsace, so I asked her for some thoughts on iPhone 12 Pro video quality in general. Here’s what she had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LxHSNz"&gt;There are three things I noticed when shooting video with the iPhone 12 Pro: a great level of detail, brighter footage at night, and light reflections for days. The iPhone 12 Pro can shoot up to 4K at 60fps and 1080p at 240fps, just like the 11 Pro. I was impressed with the video capabilities of the iPhone 11 Pro last year, and with the iPhone 12 Pro, it’s no different… like, it’s actually hard to tell the difference between footage from the 11 and the 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iViUdc"&gt;In perfect lighting conditions, the video is beautiful. Colors are punchy, details are crisp, and it can handle skin tones well. The 12’s footage is the slightest bit warmer during the day, but unless you are really trying to find a difference between these cameras, you won’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Fzr9"&gt;At night, the 12 Pro is a bit brighter overall and does a nice job of smoothing the dark areas to combat noise. The main sensor is certainly the brightest, and once you switch over to the ultrawide, things get a bit dark. But more concerning is when shooting at night, and using that main sensor, there are still little dots all over the frame! Any light coming directly into the lens, such as headlights from cars, casts lots of light reflections onto the image, and it’s quite distracting. This was a problem with footage from the iPhone 11 Pro, and that problem has not gone away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oqqYS"&gt;But overall, this camera system continues to be great, and when you are playing it back on a device that supports Dolby Vision video files, it looks incredibly colorful and punchy. That’s the main difference between the 11 Pro and the 12 Pro’s video: the new one shoots in Dolby Vision, as discussed extensively above. I’m excited to put the 12 Pro Max to the test with that larger sensor and optical image stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UkQgnG"&gt;All in all, the iPhone 12 Pro camera remains one of the most powerful, capable smartphone cameras on the market right now. The problem is that the iPhone 12 Pro Max camera is coming out in less than a month. If you are the sort of person who buys a new phone for the camera, I would definitely wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MUbdR5ZZ2wUDA99zjBCft7AwMI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973387/akrales_201017_4238_0004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most of the 5G experience is only slightly faster than LTE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="B85FAd"&gt;5G on the iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="4niP3B"&gt;I am obligated to discuss 5G in a review of a new 5G iPhone, even though I personally do not find 5G compelling because I do not live anywhere close to a 5G service area on any of the major networks. I think that will be the case for a great many people for some time to come, and so I am happy to report the iPhone 12 Pro does just fine on LTE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brGXqx"&gt;But I did spend a day in NYC, and I can report that Verizon’s Sub-6 “nationwide” 5G is basically fine. It’s there, and it was reasonably fast, although my iPhone 11 Pro on AT&amp;amp;T LTE could produce equivalent speeds in many cases. Verizon’s “nationwide” 5G network feels like the early days of LTE to me: I can’t tell if it’s always going to be this fast or whether it will slow down as a flood of devices — like, say, aggressively subsidized 5G iPhones — hit the network. We’ll find out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IVQkRc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Real 5G is blazing-fast — when you can find it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uurs6p"&gt;There’s a Verizon mmWave 5G tower just across the street from our office, and the iPhone 12 Pro was fast to latch onto it and light up the UW indicator. In a patch of 20 glorious square feet, I pulled over 2 gigabits per second down. (And 40 megabits per second up, which matched regular 5G.) If I walked 100 feet away, the signal dropped, and that was that. I hope you are not anticipating being very mobile with your 5G mobile phone if you have giant files to download. Using mmWave definitely made the phone get a little warm, and it seemed to drain the battery a little faster. It’s good that it’s very difficult to use mmWave, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pf4Bal"&gt;There’s much more on 5G in Dieter’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21287029"&gt;review of the regular iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to dig deeper. But I think for most people, the experience of using 5G will be virtually the same as using LTE for now — not least because the iPhone will step you down to LTE to save battery life whenever it can, with a feature called Smart Data. In fact, if you’re in a 5G service area, you’ll see the 5G symbol at the top of the phone to indicate that you have access to 5G, but the phone might &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; be using LTE because it doesn’t think you need the extra speed. You can turn Smart Data off, but I can’t see any reason you’d want to at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OHcZ2DDoqq10UZz4jn-LaZwpo60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973382/akrales_201017_4238_0143.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A14 Bionic is fast now. But more importantly, it should still feel fast years down the line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5Swv1Y"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro performance and battery life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="kfRjLl"&gt;The iPhone 12 has Apple’s new A14 Bionic processor, which is the first 5nm chip in a smartphone, and it feels lightning-fast. I write that every year, of course: I wrote it last year about the A13 Bionic, and the year before that about the A12 Bionic. And those phones don’t necessarily feel slow. Apple still sells the iPhone 11 and iPhone XR with those chips in them, which means they will be supported for years to come. I continue to think Apple’s commanding lead in smartphone performance is most valuable to people at the end of a phone’s lifecycle than at the beginning. This phone is so fast that it’ll stay fast for a long time. That’s great and more important than a slightly higher synthetic benchmark score today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCcwcK"&gt;There’s a U1 chip in the iPhone 12 Pro, just like the 11 Pro, and it’s still pretty much good for AirDrop. Apple does say that some neat U1 features are coming to the new HomePod mini, so we’ll have to see how those pan out, and if this system is ever really used for all the things it can seem like it can do. But for now, AirDrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rv7WXg"&gt;iOS 14 runs great on the 12 Pro — unlike the buggy mess that was iOS 13 last year. For a more detailed rundown of everything iOS 14 includes, go read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;Chris Welch’s review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GsJMzA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Don’t expect the 12 Pro to be the battery champ the 11 was&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vT1mFA"&gt;Testing battery life on the iPhone 12 Pro was probably the hardest thing to do since I don’t live anywhere close to a 5G service area, and I was only back in New York City for a single day to shoot our review video. But in that single day, it felt like the battery on the iPhone 12 Pro died a lot faster than I expected. After around 2.5 hours of screen on time, I was at 18 percent. Of course, we were using 5G a lot for testing, and using the mmWave radio drains the battery faster, so it’s hard to say how representative this is. I asked Apple, and I was told the company expects people to get a full day of usage out of the phone. In my normal quarantine routine where I’m on Wi-Fi nearly all of the time, that certainly seemed reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvVgab"&gt;In the end, I think iPhone 12 Pro battery life is going to vary widely for people depending on how much they use 5G — especially mmWave 5G — so this is something we’ll have to track over time. But I would definitely not expect the “try and stop me” battery life we saw on the regular iPhone 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1fxH6ran2Xf2XkeWcdZtxkcD8VI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973366/akrales_201018_4238_0435.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It comes in blue. It’s very pretty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Oumprt"&gt;So that’s the iPhone 12 Pro. Is it worth $200 more than the standard carrier-subsidized iPhone 12? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RlDLK"&gt;Yes, because it is shiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iRIUv"&gt;That’s the best answer I have right now: it looks cooler than the regular iPhone 12, and some people value that, just like some people value a telephoto lens, the ability to take portrait photos in night mode, and LIDAR AR tricks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmUWBt"&gt;But my instinct is to hold off on recommending this slightly more expensive iPhone until we’ve tested the even more expensive iPhone. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a much bigger display and what could be a huge jump in camera performance for another $100, which feels like a lot more value for the extra money. So we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6BUHi"&gt;It’s also hard to suggest that anyone spend more money than necessary upgrading their phone in the middle of a pandemic. If it’s time to upgrade and you want a new phone, the iPhone 12 Pro is a great choice. Anyone with an iPhone XS or older will love the new cameras and enjoy the new design. I have a kid, and we upgrade every year because I always want to have the best cameras on our phones. But again, if you are upgrading for the cameras, it’s worth seeing how the best camera Apple thinks it can make performs on the Pro Max before making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gAheyr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 12 Pro doesn’t offer so much more over the 12 to make it a must-have&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MzVzYc"&gt;if you’re not upgrading for the cameras, the iPhone 12 Pro doesn’t offer so much more over the iPhone 12 that it’s a must-have upgrade. In many ways, most of the new features on the phone are ahead of their time. I don’t think 5G is all that big of a deal yet when the networks aren’t really built out, there aren’t exactly killer apps for it, and we’re all spending most of our time at home anyway. Dolby Vision video is right up my alley, but it still has to shake out in the wild a little. The U1 chip and LIDAR sensor… well, it certainly seems like they’re going to be big deals, but not quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FVH1o"&gt;I’m not trying to end this on a down note: the iPhone 12 Pro is a beautiful, powerful, and incredibly capable device. I enjoyed using it during this review, and the camera is extremely good. If you can find a patch of sidewalk with an mmWave signal, you will have a killer speedtest screenshot to share. It will make you happy if you buy one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSvB8K"&gt;But if you’re going to spend the money to upgrade over the regular iPhone 12, I would definitely wait for iPhone 12 Pro Max reviews first.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple iPhone 12 review: raising the bar</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s the one you should get unless you’re waiting for the Max or mini&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="K7uSoh"&gt;More than most years, there are a lot of things that are new in the iPhone 12. Apple has loaded in the usual upgrades like a faster processor and improved camera, but that’s something we’ve come to expect. In addition to all of that, there’s a new design, a new OLED screen, an entirely new charging and accessory ecosystem with MagSafe, and, of course, 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKfXUI"&gt;It seems obvious that both Apple and its carrier partners are trying to align to make this a supercycle for upgrades. All of that new stuff is also paired with both a higher price ($829 for the base 64GB model) and discounts and heavily marketed carrier trade-in and installment plans. In the midst of a pandemic-induced economic downturn, it could be a hard sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pH2yM1"&gt;It’s easy to recommend the default iPhone for the times when you need a new phone anyway, but it’s much more difficult to say whether all of this new stuff adds up to something that could compel you to upgrade earlier than you’d planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUNxf0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21288329"&gt;Nilay Patel is reviewing the iPhone 12 Pro separately, here&lt;/a&gt;. Both the smaller iPhone 12 mini and the iPhone 12 Pro Max with its better cameras won’t arrive for a little while. There’s reason to consider all of them, but the standard iPhone 12 is the one I think most people who need a new iPhone will want to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="TFBufI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9534108"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12, in blue." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QJUxnFQEvDtjVUSvoA5ZhI5_bro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973505/vpavic_4243_20201018_0121.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 in blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xhuoY6"&gt;iPhone 12 design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aZOdQu"&gt;I love the new design for the iPhone 12. In addition to being smaller and lighter than the iPhone 11, it has flat sides and a flat screen. We’ve been living with curved edges on iPhones for six years, since 2014’s iPhone 6. So part of my affection might just be that the iPhone 12 feels new. But it’s also that it feels like a throwback to the iPhone 4 and 5 models, which were the last iPhones whose design I truly loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgFW07"&gt;Despite all of those flat edges, the seams and the corners are beveled just enough to make it comfortable to hold. The rails on the iPhone 12 are matte finish aluminum, and I prefer them to the glossy steel on the Pro models. Unfortunately, the rear glass is super glossy, super prone to picking up fingerprints, and as susceptible to picking up tiny little micro-abrasions as ever. Most people will put a case on their phone anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 looks great. The new design feels both modern and classic." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ih-pYjCwC2zdyghJDQQ06YHKn8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973518/vpavic_4243_20201017_0088.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 looks great. The new design feels both modern and classic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 is noticeably smaller than the iPhone 11." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQSBc8E-OX_DqbGoG66w5NH3d_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973523/vpavic_4243_20201017_0014.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 is noticeably smaller than the iPhone 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The aluminum rails have a matte finish and are flat instead of curved." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y5f7VL6jn_PiA6Tr0_RcUaR8LGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973512/vpavic_4243_20201017_0124.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The aluminum rails have a matte finish and are flat instead of curved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are antenna lines and this little plastic window for Ultra Wideband antennas." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a8HOpmsa8aBpILT3tX_4692cGiI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973511/vpavic_4243_20201017_0131.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are antenna lines and this little plastic window for Ultra Wideband antennas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aVeqJ3"&gt;The front of the iPhone 12 isn’t technically glass at all, but a glass-ceramic hybrid Apple has branded “Ceramic Shield.” It uses ceramic crystals within the glass itself to improve drop resistance over the iPhone 11. Apple says it’s four times better, which is a good thing because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522751/iphone-12-pro-screen-repair-other-damage-costs-applecare-plus-warranty"&gt;screen repair costs have gone up this year&lt;/a&gt;. I can’t test that with our review unit (at least, not intentionally), but I did have a totally accidental drop to concrete from three feet that stopped my heart but only put a barely perceptible ding in the aluminum. Scratch resistance should be about the same as last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeHG3f"&gt;If you look at the aluminum rail, you’ll see a bunch of antenna lines and even a small plastic section on the side for the Ultra Wideband (UWB) mmWave antenna. They break up the symmetry a bit (especially on the bottom), but it doesn’t bother me. I’ve also become notch-blind at this point, but I should note that Face ID still requires a very big cutout at the top of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZvDZ3U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ceramic-glass hybrid screen should be more resistant to breaking from drops&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OJVt3N"&gt;There’s no fingerprint sensor, and though I didn’t really expect one, during the pandemic, it is a frustration. I suppose the one silver lining for Android manufacturers mostly whiffing on Face Unlock is that their phones are easier to get into when you’re wearing a mask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJiaK3"&gt;Overall, though, this design just feels more elegant and confident than the past few years of iPhones, including even the big iPhone X redesign. And the smaller size is the best part; the iPhone XR and iPhone 11 always felt just a little too big. If this is the design we’ll be living with for the next six years, I won’t complain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12’s OLED screen is excellent." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIyE8lEYboL_TkKszRzcHzZNN2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973498/vpavic_4243_20201018_0141.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12’s OLED screen is excellent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fBfLg2"&gt;iPhone 12 screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="w3JX0P"&gt;One of the reasons Apple was able to reduce the size of the iPhone 12 is that it has switched over to an OLED screen. That helps reduce the bezels and also keeps them perfect even all the way around the phone, while at the same time keeping the actual viewable screen the same 6.1 inches as the iPhone 11. I prefer the look of OLED to LCD because of its blacker blacks, so I’ve been waiting for this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Za9i71"&gt;Along with the switch to OLED, Apple has also increased the pixel count to 1170 x 2532. If you haven’t been immersed in smartphone tech discussions, you have blessedly avoided the complaining that previous iPhones didn’t even technically hit 1080p. Now they have, and those complaints can finally cease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="QMUDt9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The OLED screen is excellent, with great contrast and colors — but no high refresh rate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The large FaceID notch is still there, but it eventually feels normal." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9nbJbUEu2WEZNOlTas0gOz9CFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973495/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The large Face ID notch is still there, but it eventually feels normal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TWvH92"&gt;But they’ll be replaced with another argument: whether the iPhone ought to have a high refresh rate screen. Many Android phones at this price point (and nearly all of them that cost more) have a 90 or 120Hz refresh rate, which makes scrolling and animations smoother. The iPhone’s is locked to the same 60Hz it’s always been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBdXZq"&gt;This is a tech spec argument, but it is something that you can feel when you scroll or navigate around a phone. Apple ships such a screen on the iPad Pro. I think the iPhone 12 gets away with leaving it out for two reasons: one, iOS already feels smooth and fast natively, and two, this is the lower-cost iPhone, so it isn’t a surprise to see a standard refresh rate. The iPhone 12 Pro models lacking 120Hz is a little more jarring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPv1K7"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro does have one screen advantage over this phone: it can reach a higher level of brightness in regular use. I didn’t have any complaints about screen brightness on this iPhone 12, however, even outdoors. And when watching HDR content, both phones can still reach peak brightness of 1,200 nits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVzv3t"&gt;Overall, the OLED screen is a noticeable improvement for me mainly because of its improved contrast and HDR, not the pixel count. I’m also happy to report that Apple hasn’t compromised on its color science either — colors are as accurate as ever. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe charging puck is thin, light, and can power the iPhone 12 at 15W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RGDaLH"&gt;MagSafe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gZE63Q"&gt;Of all the new things on the iPhone 12, I think MagSafe is the most interesting. It’s an entire system for attaching things to the back of the iPhone via magnets: wireless chargers, cases, car mounts, wallets, and eventually, other things like gimbals or something I haven’t thought of yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgCRIn"&gt;The premiere accessory is the MagSafe charger, a $39 puck that snicks onto the back of the phone with a satisfying clap and then wirelessly charges it. The iPhone has a second NFC chip for MagSafe that identifies what’s been attached to it. When it’s a MagSafe charger, it will allow the phone to power up at 15 watts instead of the usual 7.5, provided you have at least a 20-watt power brick. (The MagSafe charger doesn’t come with one. Apple will sell you a 20-watt USB-C charger for $19, or you can use one from another device such as a laptop.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEFtBy"&gt;It’s the difference between wireless charging being annoyingly slow and being acceptable. In my testing, I would get around 40 percent charge in an hour. That’s slower than the fastest wireless charging systems out there and much slower than a cable, but it’s also easy and convenient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The magnets mean you can use the phone while it’s wirelessly charging instead of leaving it on the pad." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IZm1wZCoEScKpV1divVI9uCDB90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973754/dbohn_201019_4243_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The magnets mean you can use the phone while it’s wirelessly charging instead of leaving it on the pad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple’s wallet attachment holds three or so cards, but you need to remove it from the back of the iPhone to easily access them.&amp;amp;nbsp;" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nolQtxQAdxSHCc0qAlIGTeKjWXY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973756/dbohn_201019_4243_0001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s wallet attachment holds three or so cards, but you need to remove it from the back of the iPhone to easily access them. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lQUyhp"&gt;Apple’s puck is thin and light and attaches firmly enough that you can pick up the phone and use it without it getting disconnected. If anybody else wants to make a charging puck, they’ll need to use Apple’s “Made for iPhone” (MFI) program. Other fast wireless chargers still charge the iPhone at the usual rate; new ones will need to use that NFC handshake as necessary for the faster charging. (And no, apps can’t access this NFC chip directly, so payments and other uses are still more locked down than on Android.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWVr70"&gt;NFC also lets Apple do cute little things like light up a ring on the screen when it detects that an accessory has been attached. There’s a blue ring for a blue case, for example. Apple is selling a series of MagSafe cases that it claims are easier to snap on and off, but they’re not appreciably different than the silicone cases from prior years. There’s also a wallet that can hold three cards with special shielding to keep them from getting de-magnetized. It’s nice enough for what it is, but you have to take it off to get a card out or to wirelessly charge the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRQh2a"&gt;I’m excited to see what third-party companies come up with for these magnets. They don’t need to participate in MFI to simply make magnetic accessories, and car mounts are already on the way. I’m hoping to see a bunch of photography and video accessories, too. The magnets are strong enough to hold the phone up against light jostling, but stuff like bike mounts will still need a sturdier attachment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RJidc"&gt;One last word about charging while we’re on the subject. Apple has indeed taken the AC adapter out of the box and included a USB-C to Lightning cable, so if you don’t have a USB-C charger, you’ll need to get one. Even though the environmental benefits may not be huge, I am still in favor of this decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THMzJ9"&gt;I’m less in favor of the decision to stick to the Lightning port for charging. A major redesign is an opportunity to switch over to the more common USB-C port, the same port that Apple’s own computers and tablets use along with every other Android phone and many, many other gadgets. The fact that Apple didn’t have the courage to do so tells me that its long-term plans may have more to do with MagSafe than anything else. I don’t love Lightning, but I have to admit it’s better than literally nothing when it comes to wired charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="5G is great if you can find it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3GJYuXaxceWOiSdosrO_o1-IC1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973506/vpavic_4243_20201017_0216.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;5G is great if you can find it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DHswaI"&gt;5G on the iPhone 12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xpxb5l"&gt;Apple has joined the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511946/5g-iphone-12-upgrade-speed-network-mmwave-hype"&gt;5G Hype Industrial Complex&lt;/a&gt;. It is promoting 5G as the flagship feature on all of its new iPhone models and promising incredibly fast download speeds. The reality in the US is that getting those speeds is a matter of being in the right city and sometimes the right city block. Heck, the ultra-fast millimeter-wave (mmWave) version of 5G requires being literally on the right street corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuaaUz"&gt;The networks simply aren’t built-out yet, and despite lofty promises from carriers, I don’t know how long it will be until they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UM5vM7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Your experience with 5G will vary widely depending on your location, carrier, and data plan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mVaYAW"&gt;In my testing in Oakland and San Francisco on both T-Mobile and Verizon, I found myself with an LTE signal as often as I did 5G — if not more. When I did get 5G, my download speeds varied from just barely better than LTE to about two times faster. But when I consciously sought out the sidewalks where Verizon’s mmWave network is live, the speeds were mind-boggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnNY4m"&gt;All of which is to say that your experience with 5G is completely dependent on where you are, what network you’re on, and how lucky you are in finding the right signal. Getting 2,400Mbps and using it to download an entire Netflix season really is awe-inspiring. Walking half a block and seeing speeds drop down to plain old LTE speeds is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eo4zBs"&gt;As far as the iPhone itself goes, it performs as well or better than 5G Android phones. It can certainly handle the speed, and it appears to pick up signal without issue. It does get hot on mmWave, and it does impact battery life significantly if you overdo it. Apple is, however, doing a lot of work under the hood in iOS to tweak the 5G experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="R4Ssps"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9534129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="86nljc"&gt;By default, every 5G phone will have a “Smart Data mode” enabled. It drops the iPhone 12 down to LTE speeds unless Apple’s software believes you really need them. It’s a little unclear what circumstances will trigger a bump up to 5G speeds, but it’s some combination of what kind of data you’re downloading and perhaps what app you’re using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li4BGQ"&gt;What’s weird is that when the iPhone is limiting you to LTE speeds, it will still display the 5G icon in the status bar. It’s now an indicator of the best speed available to you, not the actual type of connection that’s actively in use. You can turn Smart Data off if you like, but I left it on and honestly never really felt like I was being throttled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFPyot"&gt;(As long as we’re talking about inaccurate status bar icons, I will point out that AT&amp;amp;T’s deceitful “5G E” indicator for its LTE Advanced network is sticking around. Shame on AT&amp;amp;T for this branding and on Apple for enabling it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJ7AFS"&gt;There are other nuances with 5G. Although Apple has done a remarkable job ensuring the iPhone 12 will work on any US network, there are some band differences internationally (where mmWave isn’t necessarily included), so double-check if you move or ever get to travel again. And if you use both the physical SIM and the eSIM on your iPhone, it turns out that the Dual SIM Dual Standby spec can’t handle having 5G lit up on both networks at the same time. If you have them both active, you’ll get 4G. But you can get 5G on either on its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JtcYf"&gt;Some networks — including Verizon — require you to get a new 5G-compatible SIM card. So if you’re not getting 5G and you think you should be, that may be the issue. You may also need to adjust your plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d42lPj"&gt;The iPhone will also try to be aware of your data plan, and if it knows you have unlimited, it will use 5G more freely for certain things. Apple will even allow it to download full iOS updates over 5G if you’re on unlimited. If you change your plan or don’t want it to do that, you might need to go diving through various settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUPYiN"&gt;Apple also says that you might get faster tethering speeds over Wi-Fi than tethering over a wired Lightning cable, thanks to optimizations it has made. Wi-Fi tethering could be as much as four times faster than before in optimal conditions (including, perhaps Wi-Fi 6 on the tethered device). Since it’s a hassle for me to even find an mmWave signal, I haven’t had a chance to fully test this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypFiFC"&gt;Finally, 5G won’t work on your iPhone if your carrier doesn’t directly work with Apple to light it up. Unlike previous networks, you can’t go in and just manually set an APN and MMS settings and be good to go on 5G. That shouldn’t be a problem for the vast majority of people, though. Apple has worked with over 100 carriers in 30 markets to enable 5G on the iPhone, including all three major carriers in the US — but if you use an MVNO, you should double-check that 5G will work before you buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtE4vw"&gt;You really shouldn’t have to worry about most of these 5G details. If you happen to get 5G speeds where you live and work, bully for you. If you don’t, they will hopefully come to you soon, and hopefully the networks will continue to be fast even after all these 5G iPhones start filling up the channels. Either way, right now, it’s not a good idea to buy an iPhone &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; because it has 5G. It’s a nice bonus, but not more than that yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The dual camera system on the iPhone 12." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_0HXP-a-NtttIs8YleL0wER-wtw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973499/vpavic_4243_20201018_0139.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6gSeAB"&gt;iPhone 12 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="frjRzm"&gt;The most important changes to the camera in the iPhone 12 aren’t in the sensors or the lenses. They are completely unchanged except for the main wide-angle camera going from an ƒ/1.8 aperture to ƒ/1.6 to allow in slightly more light. Instead, the bigger differences come from software and from unlocking new capabilities, thanks to the new A14 Bionic processor that runs everything on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hJvElo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 camera is a clear, though not massive, improvement on the iPhone 11&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NKcdcB"&gt;If you’re comparing iPhone 12 models, the key things to know is that the regular iPhone 12 and the 12 mini have the same camera system. The iPhone 12 Pro adds telephoto, LIDAR for low-light focusing and depth calculations, and some more encoding options for photo and video. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a bigger upgrade with a larger main camera sensor and improved image stabilization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5696GD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21288329"&gt;Nilay Patel’s review of the iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; has details on some of its distinct features and also goes more in-depth on video quality. Apple is making big claims around HDR, dubbing this a Dolby Vision camera. I’ll let Nilay give you all the nitty-gritty details on that. For my part, I’ll just say that video quality continues to be excellent and is challenged only by the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, but I give the edge to the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8B05Dt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9534162"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ur6miz"&gt;But back to the A14 Bionic. It has unlocked night mode for all of the cameras on the iPhone 12 (including the front selfie camera) and even a night portrait mode. Apple has also made some tweaks to its system for combining multiple frames into a single image, called Smart HDR 3. That system should also be better at recognizing things like faces or the sky and tweaking the photos to optimize their appearance. In fact, there’s even a new setting called “Scene Detection” if you want to toggle it.&lt;/p&gt;

Apple says this might be because it is applying its Deep Fusion algorithms in more situations this year. I still like the Pixel’s signature, contrast-y look, but Apple seems to be moving in its direction just a little. The iPhone 12’s photos seem to finally be stepping back from over-brightening shadows on faces. But it’s a minor tweak, the bigger changes come in more extreme conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZMW7Dq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9534177"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f4pZ8m"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 needs to drop into night mode less often, thanks to that faster lens. And even when it does, I’m getting clearer, brighter shots. In the very darkest conditions, the Pixel 5 still handles itself a little better, but it’s much, much closer than it’s ever been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Even in low light, the iPhone 12’s portrait mode passes the “glasses test,” properly keeping them in focus instead of blurring them." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-fQxccQg4Q3xjc7XkN7i6RcCSK4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973674/10_16_18_53_44_IMG_2023_jpg_iPhone_12.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9gdWz"&gt;Night mode portraits are one of the major new features, and they’re worth a try, but the range of lighting conditions where they’ll look good isn’t massively bigger. One nice thing is that the iPhone 12 passes the glasses test with flying colors; they never seem to get accidentally blurred. I’m less impressed with night mode selfies portraits. There’s no way to turn the screen flash off in this mode, which is a problem if you wear glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a7mnqc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9534181"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="62V8zZ"&gt;Many of those software enhancements have also come to the ultrawide camera, and so its quality is also improved. However, it is still a fundamentally worse sensor and lens combo, and you can see grain in the details if you look even a little closely. It’s good for landscapes, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple’s algorithms for its ultrawide camera are improved, but there’s only so much software can do." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GXqdaLW9Fv4ADslJrRF1lfS-hi8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973682/10_16_17_6_28_IMG_1963_iPhone_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s algorithms for its ultrawide camera are improved, but there’s only so much software can do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tAdgK9"&gt;Apple says that it has done more tuning to compensate for lens distortion at the edge of ultrawide shots, especially for faces and architecture. I do think it helps but only a little. This photo of the Golden Gate bridge still has a clear bend to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Why5fk"&gt;For me, the bottom line on the cameras is I definitely see a marked improvement over the iPhone 11, but they’re not enough to compel an upgrade. That doesn’t mean the iPhone 12 isn’t a massively good camera. It is, and the combination of performance, simplicity, and just plain good quality continues to impress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The rear of the iPhone 12 is glossy and it picks up both fingerprints and micro-scratches fairly easily.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear of the iPhone 12 is glossy, and it picks up both fingerprints and micro-scratches fairly easily. Use a case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZfJGud"&gt;iPhone 12 performance, battery life, and software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="GjxqAU"&gt;It should not come as any kind of surprise to you that the iPhone 12 is blisteringly fast. The new A14 Bionic chip is built on a new 5nm process — one that we expect will also power upcoming Mac computers. Games load fast and there’s no lag, webpages render without hassle, and I’m seeing fewer apps need to reload when multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0NonlC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life is acceptable but doesn’t quite live up to the iPhone 11 — and pay attention to your UWB 5G use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QkzNHV"&gt;But in actual day-to-day use, I suspect nobody will see an appreciable difference from the iPhone 11, which was and is very fast, too. The importance of the iPhone 12’s speed isn’t that it’s fast today; it’s that it’s likely to still be fast in three or even five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqhT9H"&gt;Battery life is good but does seem to be a small regression from the iPhone 11 (an absolute battery champion). The fact that Apple felt the need to create a special mode for silently turning off 5G is a little worrying in terms of battery life. Luckily, I don’t think the battery life on the iPhone 12 is bad at all. I can get through a full day without much issue. On the other hand, I have to admit that it’s easier to kill this thing with a full day of heavy use than the iPhone 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBfVpJ"&gt;As for iOS 14, I’ll point you to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;Chris Welch’s review&lt;/a&gt; as his thoughts mirror my own. I really like having widgets on the main home screen, although I wish there was a wider selection from my favorite apps. Speaking of wishes, I wish Apple would put much more effort into making Siri a little more competitive with the Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1QvgIG"&gt;The iPhone 12 is the first iPhone in several years that really does feel like something &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;. But I can’t point to any specific single feature that makes it feel that way. The 5G is fine. MagSafe is convenient, but we’ll have to see if there’s a real ecosystem there. The OLED screen is lovely but also kind of table stakes for smartphones these days. The new design is elegant and modern, but it’s hard to tell you to buy a phone because it’s pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="s5Ou2I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 is the new default choice — and it’s a good one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7n1QxH"&gt;The iPhone 12 is going to be the default choice for a lot of people buying an iPhone over the next year, and it’s frankly fortunate that the default iPhone is so good. I think most people should get this instead of the iPhone 12 Pro. But I also think if you have an iPhone that’s working for you just fine, there’s not a must-have gotta-get-it feature here to compel you to upgrade. That’s how default phones work: when you need one, get one, and it will be way better than what you were using. When you don’t need one, don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjaWfq"&gt;But when the time comes for you to get a new phone and if you end up with this iPhone 12, I think you’re going to love it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony Xperia 5 II review: the right tool for the right jobs</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Plenty of control, if you know how to use it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="9NSJwQ"&gt;More than any other smartphone I’ve used this year, the Sony Xperia 5 II feels like a tool. It’s not just that it has a very understated design (though this definitely plays a part), it’s that Sony’s whole approach is to give you as much control over the phone as possible. Control over how it looks, and sounds, and takes photos and video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCruOS"&gt;Like any tool, though, you get more out of the Xperia 5 II when you’re prepared to put more in. A good workman never blames their tools, after all. But I’d wager that most people who are paying $949 (£799 / €899) for a phone are probably looking for a device that’s prepared to meet them halfway, and can handle most jobs on default or automatic settings. That’s what I want to see if the Xperia 5 II can accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vS14TD"&gt;The Xperia 5 II goes on sale on December 4th in the US, and is available in Europe from this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nkBveN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9523546"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZOHw3B"&gt;I cannot overstate how much I like the Xperia 5 II’s design. The combination of Sony’s trademark 21:9 aspect ratio with a slightly smaller 6.1-inch display compared to the larger Xperia 1, makes for a pleasantly narrow phone that fits in the hand nicely without feeling cramped to use. This screen is only 1080p this time around, but at this size I don’t think you’re left wanting extra resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENmyt8"&gt;At the top and bottom of the display you’ll find bezels a little bigger than many other flagships opt for these days, and that means there are no notches or hole-punch cutouts to speak of. You get a stereo pair of capable front-facing speakers which sound less echoey than their downward-firing competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDc6Rk"&gt;Up top you’ll find a headphone jack, which is a great inclusion and almost unheard of in a premium-priced smartphone these days, and around back there’s an understated camera bump housing the phone’s main, ultrawide, and telephoto lenses. If you want a phone that’s guaranteed to &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;turn heads then this is probably it. Like I said, it’s a tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHAUWn3a5TS3UzF4vKGcZBmCf8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21957522/jporter_201010_4237_0009.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p6E9PbpGLp0il4o--reWPQeJOG4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21957526/jporter_201010_4237_0005.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7sVra_i-CqGxpZL6Vs-vnD_DBcg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21957524/jporter_201010_4237_0007.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plus a headphone jack up top.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CTWKDB"&gt;As well as volume controls and a side-mounted power and fingerprint sensor combo button, there are both dedicated camera shutter and Google Assistant buttons on the side of the phone. Given Sony’s photography ambitions for the 5 II, I’ll allow it the physical shutter control, but the Google Assistant button feels unnecessary — especially in a position that’s too low to be convenient to press. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnnp9e"&gt;The Xperia 5 II’s screen’s aspect ratio makes it hard to reach the top of the screen when using it one-handed, but you get a lot more useful screen real estate across many apps like Twitter or Gmail. Personally, I like that it gives me enough space to split-screen my &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.curtjrees.aeropressdice"&gt;Aeropress recipe generator app&lt;/a&gt; with a stopwatch app for making coffee, but I’m probably the only one doing that. Beyond its aspect ratio, the HDR-compatible OLED screen is bright, colorful, and a pleasure to watch videos on, and its 120Hz refresh rate means it feels smooth and responsive to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AECVT9"&gt;Internally, aside from the increasingly-rare microSD storage expansion, you’ll find a typical array of specs for the price, including a Snapdragon 865 processor, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage (there’s also a 256GB version, but it’s exclusive to Asia), and a 4,000mAh battery. There’s no support for wireless charging, an annoying omission at this price, and if you’re buying the phone in the US then there’s also no support for 5G (in Europe you get sub-6GHz support, but no millimeter wave).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SOWdcl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No wireless charging, and no 5G in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8bTZJp"&gt;Given the state of 5G coverage at the moment, our advice tends to be that it’s not worth paying extra for 5G if a less expensive phone otherwise fits your needs. But on the flip side, if you’re paying $949 for a phone at this point in 2020, then it seems a little ridiculous for it to not to support 5G. The phone has the specs to handle most of the jobs you’re going to need it for right now, but no 5G in the US means it could soon fall behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zcDkP"&gt;I didn’t encounter any battery problems with the Xperia 5 II. The phone easily got me through a day of working from home featuring plenty of Twitter, Slack, Gmail, and YouTube use, with around 40 to 50 percent of charge left when I plugged it in at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQMbLq"&gt;Sony’s take on Android 10 is restrained, and mainly consists of giving you extra settings to tweak. (The company was unable to confirm when an update to Android 11 might arrive.) Sony gives you a wild amount of control over the phone display’s white balance settings, for example, and there’s a Dolby Atmos EQ menu in the settings if you want to tune how the phone’s audio sounds. There’s a lot you can customize to make the Xperia 5 II the right tool for your needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ujecmh"&gt;I wasn’t a fan of the number of apps that come preinstalled on the phone, however. That includes apps like LinkedIn which can be disabled but not easily uninstalled. It’s especially annoying when so much of the Xperia 5 II is designed to put control into your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gaGewAURipInj-z8BYbNAfJTLRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21957525/jporter_201010_4237_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s one too many buttons on the phone’s right side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6jBWxWAdN-VDuNM-LRYOl_yjdFI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21957521/jporter_201010_4237_0010.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A 21:9 display gives you more options for split-screening.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eunOFe"&gt;Sony’s approach to smartphone photography is twofold. First, when left to its own devices, it tends to prioritize accuracy over vivid, colorful photographs. That often results in a less punchy looking image than you get from most phones, but you can always tweak the image in editing after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="z5wIxe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Xperia 5 II has three rear cameras: a main, ultrawide, and telephoto&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QPr4MO"&gt;If you want to fully do things your own way, Sony is also prepared to let you. Its pro photography mode gives you huge amounts of control over how you take photos, giving you an experience modeled after its standalone mirrorless Alpha cameras. There are a lot of controls to dig into if you want them, but they might feel too involved for someone who just wants to point their phone at a group of friends and get a nice photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bdl65P"&gt;First, though, let’s talk about hardware. The Xperia 5 II includes three rear cameras; a main camera with a large 1/1.7-inch sensor, an ultrawide camera with a 124-degree field of view, and a telephoto with 3x optical zoom. What’s nice here is that they all have the same resolution, 12 megapixels, which means you don’t see a marked change in detail when you switch between them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zqdJrB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9523560"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tIK3Nn"&gt;In daylight you get detailed photographs, but these can sometimes look a little flat. It’s accuracy over excitement. Weirdly, the exception to this seems to be people, where Sony’s handset seems to want to brighten your skin and smooth it out, even with the camera’s “Soft Skin Effect” option turned off. Even if you’re using the standard camera app, you still get a responsive eye auto-focus system, and burst shooting of up to 10fps. I found the combination of fast eye-tracked autofocus and burst photography great for photographing pets in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhG2Gy"&gt;Low light photography is where Sony’s approach to photography is most obvious. By default, the camera app won’t brighten your night shots so much that they look like they were taken in daylight. Instead, you get accurate photos that the camera takes a moment to process each time. It’s a very different experience from a phone like the Pixel 4, where you can tap the shutter button and immediately get a clear, bright photo, even at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IDz80xImwlTptWjCjBZCs051RE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21957523/jporter_201010_4237_0008.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pro photography mode gives you a wealth of controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SnxK5X"&gt;Swap over to the advanced photography mode and a whole wealth of options opens up. There are white balance, auto-focus, exposure, burst shooting, flash, and HDR settings aplenty, letting you control almost every aspect of your photography. It’s enough that you can get just about any look for your photos if you’re prepared to put the work in, including making night shots look clear as day. But the whole process can be a little involved, and it’s frustrating if you’re someone who just wants to whip out their phone and reliably get a crisp, clear shot every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJ8OwX"&gt;You get a similar level of control when it comes to filming video, where you have the option of recording at up to 120fps slow-motion in 4K. I was particularly impressed with the focus pulling settings, which are fun to play around with. For the most part, though, I think most people will be happy with recording video in the regular camera app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buhi7g"&gt;You can get good photographs out of the Sony Xperia 5 II, but you sometimes have to work to get them to look the way you want. Its cameras are powerful tools, but they’re not going to do the work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yXDslFTBsa7ToZ46qGKqZJkLtSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21957527/jporter_201010_4237_0004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not a phone that’ll turn heads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z9MqQEPo7utelbHk-jjxReno1TI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21957530/jporter_201010_4237_0002.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It can be hard to reach the top of the screen when using the phone one-handed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ev4YeZ"&gt;Sony has a very particular idea about the kind of phone it wants the Xperia 5 II to be. Although it matches many of its flagship competitors in terms of specs, its most interesting features surround the amount of control it gives you. There are advanced camera features and audio visual modes to really tailor the experience to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMWsNI"&gt;But I think you have to want these advanced settings to justify the Xperia 5 II’s relatively high $949 price tag in the US. At that price it should really include 5G support as well as wireless charging. These trade-offs might be more worthwhile at a lower price, but not with a near-thousand-dollar price tag. In Europe I think the €899 / £799 price makes a lot more sense given you get 5G support, but the lack of wireless charging remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="nsbOfE"&gt;Sony’s Xperia 5 II feels like a very capable tool, but it’s expensive and sometimes makes you work to get the most out of it. That makes it the right tool for plenty of jobs, but not necessarily the right tool for a &lt;em&gt;smartphone’s &lt;/em&gt;job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="AusPQF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9523542"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 5 review: new phone, old tricks</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Google goes back to its old tricks, mostly for the better&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xx4hjf"&gt;The amount of effort Google seems to put into its Pixel phones while simultaneously ensuring that they look and feel mundane never ceases to astonish me. The new Pixel 5 is the epitome of this trend, though it’s been present since the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0DlQx"&gt;The Pixel 5 is unassuming. Instead of pushing the state of the art forward, Google has seemingly retreated to simpler, more reliable, and less expensive technology. The Pixel 4 had face unlock, squeezable sides, and a literal radar chip. The Pixel 5 has a simple rear-mounted fingerprint sensor that harkens back to Android phones from 2018, not 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfclKT"&gt;And yet, it’s still a very good phone for $699. It’s not impressive or flashy. By spending just a little (or a lot) more money, you can get better specs, larger camera arrays, prettier screens, and fancier designs. The Pixel 5 is trying to sell something else, sometimes to a fault:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0AWAq"&gt;Simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4rRhji"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9524755"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5 in “Sorta Sage” green" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwtTHObhdNhcOLQIYTN5ZKz75zE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21955670/akrales_201012_4137_0117.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 5 in “sorta sage” green.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DU27tB"&gt;Pixel 5 hardware design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="BR4cme"&gt;Here are words I’ve used to describe Pixel hardware in past reviews, all of which apply to the Pixel 5: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13304090/google-pixel-phone-review-pixel-xl"&gt;utilitarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16486108/google-pixel-2-xl-review-android-phone-camera"&gt;humdrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;unassuming&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;premium&lt;/a&gt;. That last one seems like it doesn’t fit, but once you hold the Pixel 5, you’ll feel it. There’s so little hardware flash that it can be easy to miss some of the design substance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGX576"&gt;The Pixel 5 has a 6-inch OLED screen, rounded on the corners and interrupted only by a (somewhat large) hole punch for the selfie camera. There’s no XL version with a bigger screen, which might annoy some (and the Pixel 4A 5G isn’t so much bigger that it makes for a viable big-screen alternative). I personally love the size, but then I have always been a fan of something just slightly smaller than the Max / XL / Plus phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="IIGlma"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The design is right on the line between minimal and boring&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The power button is plain instead of having a pop of color" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wt8HLOb98NzAVmlR2bJz9QUDE5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21955669/akrales_201012_4137_0132.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The power button is plain instead of having a pop of color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The bottom speaker sounds much better than the panel audio speaker" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AvnzWxfV8qxs9tHALMLgUfFeShA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21955667/akrales_201012_4137_0151.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bottom speaker sounds much better than the panel audio speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Both the Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom) have regular and ultrawide camera" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QO-zOwaDRlgV1d-5U8yRBbMXK40=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21955674/akrales_201012_4137_0073.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom) have regular and ultrawide cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rB0KCZ"&gt;The bezels surrounding the flat screen are relatively small but still bigger than what you’d get on something like the Galaxy S20 with its curved display. But they’re perfectly symmetrical all the way around the phone. It makes for a pleasing look, but it’s achieved in a somewhat unfortunate way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Db3yiA"&gt;The Pixel 5 has stereo speakers, but the earpiece isn’t a traditional speaker at all. Instead, Google has used the technology it acquired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16877904/google-redux-acquisition-speaker-screen-vibrations"&gt;when it bought Redux in 2018&lt;/a&gt;: panel audio. The Pixel 5’s screen itself vibrates to create audio. It works well for phone calls (and it’s neat to not have to specifically position the top of the phone to hear), but for watching video or playing games, it kind of stinks. There’s zero bass and not enough volume on the left channel. (LG used similar technology in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18301982/lg-g8-thinq-review-android-phone-snapdragon-855-6-gb-ram-z-camera-sensor"&gt;G8 phone in 2018&lt;/a&gt; to similar results.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niA80c"&gt;Overall, though, I liken the Pixel 5 to a very well-made T-shirt: it’s comfortable and simple, but in a way that’s not really noticeable. The body is made of aluminum, but Google has covered it in a matte resin that’s easily mistaken for plastic. In what might be the only visual flourish on the entire phone, the black version has some sparkles in it. There’s also a “sorta sage” green color option. Because Google has apparently decided fun is bad, the power buttons just have a shiny metal finish instead of a pop of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAjjyZ"&gt;The aluminum saves weight and thinness while adding rigidity, but it’s invisible. Also invisible: a cutout in the aluminum to allow for wireless charging (and reverse wireless charging). The Pixel 5 has IP68 water and dust resistance, but there’s no headphone jack. Google also dropped the ability to squeeze the phone to call up Google Assistant, but I don’t miss that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn7wzL"&gt;The OLED screen is good, but it doesn’t quite live up to the flagship standards set by the Galaxy S20 or iPhone 11 Pro. It’s only 1080p, for one thing. And for another, the high refresh rate screen caps out at 90Hz. I think there’s a bigger perceptual difference between 60Hz and 90Hz than there is between 90Hz and the 120Hz on some flagship phones. But side by side, I can see it. Otherwise, color accuracy is good — though Google did drop its Ambient EQ tech that matches the screen temperature to the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyhWvN"&gt;Perhaps the most surprising — and some might say backward — decision Google made with the Pixel 5 was to go back to a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. Dropping the Soli radar sensor and face unlock makes sense for the price point Google was aiming for, but many Android phones have in-screen fingerprint sensors now. Google contends that they’re neither fast nor secure enough for its standards. The rear-mounted sensor is very fast and accurate, but it’s still odd to go back after using face unlock or in-screen fingerprint sensors on so many other devices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="3XI3gC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9524793"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UQynC1"&gt;Pixel 5 performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ctSbgC"&gt;The clearest signal that Google isn’t trying to compete directly with top-tier phones isn’t the $699 price; it’s the Snapdragon 765G processor. For all of 2020, the best Android phones have had Qualcomm’s fastest chip, but Google has chosen to go with something a little slower in the Pixel 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5zvm0"&gt;I don’t disagree with this choice. Although it doesn’t have the raw power of Qualcomm’s fastest chip, it’s still fast enough to not feel slow. I can detect a bit of a lag in rendering complex webpages or opening heavy apps like big games, but that’s mainly because I’ve reviewed so many flagship Android phones. In day-to-day use, I have had no problems with speed. There’s also 8GB of RAM for multitasking, which is enough to keep apps from closing in the background — a problem that frequently plagued older Pixel models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SuxsOE"&gt;There is one processor decision I do disagree with, though: removing the Pixel Neural Core processor for image processing. It means I’m waiting for photos to process way more often than I did with the Pixel 4. There’s a lag between shots when in portrait mode, which keeps me from shooting as quickly as I’d like, and I frequently have to wait for the HDR processing to finish when I review a shot after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfTIKX"&gt;As for battery life, I can happily report that Google has figured it out after the terrible battery life in last year’s Pixel 4. The Pixel 5 is easily able to stand up to a full day’s moderate — and even heavy — use. To stress-test it, I took it on a three-hour bike ride with GPS, streamed two hours of xCloud gaming, and used it throughout the rest of the day as intensively as I could. I got from 6AM to midnight before the battery conked out. It’s better than even the physically larger XL models of years past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxriZb"&gt;The story with 5G is much more mixed. Around the US, 5G speeds have been disappointing — unless you happen to be standing directly under one of the very few Verizon millimeter-wave towers scattered through major metro areas. It’s not a reason to avoid the Pixel 5, but 5G is certainly not enough justification to go out and buy one — same as any other 5G phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdDZjE"&gt;But there is a hidden tax to 5G: it makes phones more expensive. Google made the defensible decision to produce just one version of the Pixel 5 so that all models support Verizon’s mmWave flavor of 5G. That means it likely costs more than it otherwise would have. Many phones, including the Pixel 4A 5G, cost more on Verizon than they do on other networks. That cost is baked into the Pixel 5’s $699 price, even if you’re not a Verizon user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The hole punch selfie camera and thin bezels on the Pixel 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_cQDxvRfMTpx0hBhkIiYuuDMh0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21955668/akrales_201012_4137_0146.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hole-punch selfie camera and thin bezels on the Pixel 5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4nUdC1"&gt;Pixel 5 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lL0YE8"&gt;The Pixel 5’s camera is just as good as it has always been on Pixel phones. That’s great news because it means photos are sharp, contrasty, balance light and shadows well, and work incredibly well in low light. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a phone that can produce better photos in everyday use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28K8Og"&gt;But despite some improvements around the edges, the Pixel 5 doesn’t push the state of the art forward much compared to the Pixel 4 — or even the Pixel 3. Google is still using the same image sensor for the main 12-megapixel lens that it’s used since the Pixel 3. Google tells me that it hasn’t found a better one for its algorithms, but I was hoping for a bigger leap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hhsuF"&gt;The Pixel 5 does make forward progress, though. For one thing, Google has acceded to popular demand by swapping out the telephoto lens for an ultrawide (though including both would have been better). For another, Google has finally responded to the criticism that its video is subpar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LwG3pA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9524784"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0bpg4q"&gt;Let’s start with the main 12-megapixel camera. Google has kept things pretty much the same for photos. The most noticeable change is that it now has its Night Sight mode turn on automatically without requiring you to switch in dark situations. (You can manually turn it off.) That lines up with what other smartphones have been doing for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWbQ0o"&gt;Quality in both daylight and in the dark continues to be great. Samsung may try to wow you with high megapixel counts, but the Pixel 5 still produces more consistently good results with nice dynamic range and sharp detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="irVm5T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9524776"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HH2Wt7"&gt;In low light, another big change is the combination of Night Sight and portrait mode. It’s a good trick, and you can get some really nice shots — though, as with all portrait modes, you’ll find issues with the edges of people’s hair. Google says that it’s added an extra lighter frame to its HDR Plus algorithm for dark shots, and I can see that effect. In especially dark situations, some of the Pixel 5’s photos look a little over-processed, but they still come out better than the iPhone 11. (I obviously haven’t tested it against the iPhone 12.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F3HUXs2RMKs0uBJqSOQ3-IPgK2o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21957217/lighting.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O90eUY"&gt;Google seems to have taken another step in making its classic Pixel “look” look a little more like everybody else. There’s a little more yellow than I’ve come to expect from Pixels but not so much that it hurts color accuracy. Google also deserves credit for its stance on face smoothing: it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497587/google-pixel-phone-selfie-beauty-filter-retouching-camera"&gt;off by default&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to avoid causing self-image problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAUPaP"&gt;With portraits, my favorite new feature is actually a part of Google Photos: you can manually adjust a virtual light source’s position and intensity to change how faces are lit. It is much more natural-looking than I expected it to be. All phones default to brightening up faces since that’s what people usually want, but this feature lets me add some shadows back when I think they should be there. It’s different from Apple Portrait Lighting effects, which are more about dramatic looks than adjusting the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sv63TK"&gt;My least favorite part of the Pixel 5’s camera is that so many of its modes — from portrait to video stabilization — crop in on the shot. I have to step back to get the proper framing way more often than I do on other phones. On the bright side, the camera UI clearly shows what the crop will be when you start switching around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kF9Cl"&gt;The new 107-degree ultrawide camera is 16 megapixels and it’s good, but the quality doesn’t stand out. You can also shoot video with it, but, unfortunately, it caps out at 1080p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQUInZ"&gt;Video quality has long been the Achilles’ heel for the Pixel line, so Google put a lot of effort into it this year. In our testing, we found that it has better dynamic range, and my colleague Becca Farsace notes that it makes the right choices in terms of focusing and lighting. Quality is improved, but the Pixel 5 still can’t stand up to what flagships like the iPhone 11 Pro or the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra offer. At least it shoots in 4K 60 now, though, oddly, 4K 24 is still not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Pixel 5 ultrawide camera" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YfXERQXGzBS9vuI0j25Kg6EKgfs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21957316/PXL_20201012_003743103.MP.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5 ultrawide camera. It also supports Night Sight, but you can’t shoot 4K video with it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google says it applied specific algorithms to reduce distortion on the edges, but it can only do so much." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yokBM1SZHzkGOqsTiPI6AQZp_ec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21957317/PXL_20201012_003228253.MP.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google says it applied specific algorithms to reduce distortion on the edges, but it can only do so much.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PaCwSW"&gt;For me, though, the new video stabilization modes are much more useful. The standard stabilization is on by default and makes a notable difference with my shaky hands. There are other new modes that are useful if you’re an amateur like me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8U3PQX"&gt;“Locked” punches in and then keeps the shot locked as though the phone were on a tripod even if your hand wobbles a bit. “Active” keeps things steady when you’re walking or otherwise bounding around. Finally, “Cinematic Pan” essentially combines both slo-mo and aggressive stabilization so you can get some dramatic shots while moving the phone around (though, unfortunately, it drops the resolution down to 1080p).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLr7RN"&gt;All three of these modes won’t impress a videographer, but for a schlub like me, they meant I was able to get some interesting footage that otherwise would have been a jittery, jerky mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vxf8tV"&gt;At the end of the day, the Pixel 5 earned its place as my favorite smartphone camera for photos. I still love the Pixel look, the low-light performance, and the overall quality I can get without having to expend much effort. In years past, it was my favorite by a wide margin. This year, the margin is much smaller. Other phones have caught up on photo quality, surpassed it in versatility with multiple lenses, or are still better on pure video quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HcVvaxq7MveVDYTRswgVNsfrWVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21955676/akrales_201012_4137_0020.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UNnlyq"&gt;Pixel 5 software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="U4PUbl"&gt;Perhaps the biggest draw for Pixel phones is that they’re guaranteed to get software updates first. The Pixel 5 ships with Android 11 and will continue to have the latest version of Android as soon as it’s available for three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7o6ouw"&gt;And Google’s version of Android on the Pixel mirrors its hardware philosophy: simple but elegant. There are only a handful of customizations to the core experience — things like basic theming and the option to put suggested apps in your dock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xmKb-HIkI_VUJVpajwtsWOom5SY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21957342/Tuesday_at_5_37_PM_video.2020_10_13_17_40_47.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vGFP9s"&gt;Otherwise, the main benefit of the software on the Pixel 5 is that many of Android’s best features aren’t getting messed with. Long-pressing on the power button brings up a convenient menu of smart home controls and Google Pay. Notifications are organized into useful sections, and chat apps can be minimized into floating bubbles on top of other apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3uENP"&gt;Google has added a few software features inside the Pixel’s custom apps. In the phone app, you can set Google Assistant to sit on hold for you and alert you when a real human comes on the line. I didn’t want to hassle any actual customer service reps with it this week just to test, but I do wonder how many of them will bother to stay on the line when Assistant asks them to please hold on while it rings you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4G1tSq"&gt;Google’s Voice Recorder continues to be an underappreciated app. It accurately transcribes text live, but a new feature lets you export that audio in a little video clip that works better on social media. You can even delete words from the transcript, and the audio will automatically be edited to match. If Google didn’t insist on heavily branding the video with its own logos, I’d use it a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The body is made of aluminum but then encased in a “resin” coating." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0YfAQ7wdzRUQbUunZl6eTSNrhYk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21955666/akrales_201012_4137_0152.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The body is made of aluminum but then encased in a “resin” coating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ImlR3e"&gt;My favorite Google phone of all time isn’t actually a Pixel; it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504052/google-nexus-pixel-5-uravgconsumer-intervew-vergecast-podcast"&gt;the Nexus 5&lt;/a&gt;. That phone was less expensive than its competitors, had a very fast and clean version of Android, and was Google’s first foray into a new wireless standard (LTE). The Nexus 5 wasn’t the fanciest Android phone of its era, but it was the nicest one to actually use. You can see the parallel to the Pixel 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wgjNTd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smaller ambition with better execution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ijx29I"&gt;It may be disappointing to see Google shy away from the big leagues this year, but I think sticking to making a premium midrange phone is more true to the Pixel’s whole ethos. The Pixel 5 is not an especially exciting phone, but instead of overreaching, Google focused on the fundamentals: build quality, battery life, and, of course, the camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqgcOd"&gt;Some of its technological retreats are frustrating — I wish it had a chip for processing images more quickly — but most of them are no big deal. I quickly acclimated to the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and never got annoyed by speed in regular use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYwLJp"&gt;Instead of trying to make a flagship, Google aimed right down the middle — and it hit the bull’s-eye. &lt;/p&gt;
