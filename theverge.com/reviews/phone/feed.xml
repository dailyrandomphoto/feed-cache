    <title>Nokia G50 review: affordable but awfully average</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Why suffer for a $300 budget 5G phone?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AaZTJg"&gt;Finding a good budget 5G phone seems as elusive as finding a unicorn these days. Not only do manufacturers have to keep the price as low as possible, but the device also has to pull off some advanced 5G-compatible technologies. No wonder phone makers tend to compromise on other components, and the overall experience takes a hit as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiJZLo"&gt;This is where I find the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687760/nokia-g50-phone-battery-android-upgrades"&gt;Nokia G50&lt;/a&gt;, the $300 phone that Nokia pitches as an affordable 5G-phone alternative. While the Nokia G50 is a solidly built phone with a minimalist, no-nonsense Scandinavian aesthetic, it has many flaws that I haven’t experienced in a modern smartphone in a long time. Its entry-level 5G processor lags, its low-resolution touchscreen requires more effort to use than others, and I even had some connection issues with my 4G T-Mobile service on this phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hVCPW"&gt;These are significant trade-offs for a device that is not the only $300 5G phone in town, assuming you need 5G connectivity at all. There is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; that is a T-Mobile exclusive, the newer and cheaper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;$239.99 OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$279 Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hard to see how the Nokia G50 could possibly stand out from this increasingly crowded, budget 5G space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fTlwZX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10843493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="G4pAdw"&gt;Heavy. That’s the first word that comes to mind when holding this 6.84 x 3.06 x 0.35-inch phone that weighs 7.76oz (220g), which is heavier and taller than the Pixel 6 Pro (7.4 oz; 210g). While I appreciate that its stainless steel-framed body is a rarity in smartphones these days (other than the much more expensive Pro-model iPhones), this phone is too heavy to hold with just one hand for long. Its sharp edges dig into my palms due to its heft and make me eager to put the device down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R37XDV"&gt;As classy as that Ocean Blue matte ombre looks, the G50’s smooth polycarbonate coating is a sucker for finger smudges and makes the phone way too slippery to use without a case. I can’t tell you how many times the phone has slipped off a table or countertop, thanks to a combination of its slippery back and the vibrate mode. My review unit only survived the falls because it’s built like an indestructible tank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c6ATy29iSPGiUEvElKGocVnKQ2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940472/akrales_211015_4805_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On its right side, the Nokia G50 has a handy fingerprint sensor embedded into its power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tpVyMH"&gt;Its durability is definitely a plus since Nokia (and brand licensee HMD Global) expects you to keep this Android 11-running phone for longer and is committed to providing two years of OS updates and three years of security updates. This is not as impressive as it sounds: the $279 Samsung Galaxy A32 5G provides four years of security updates, which is the longest out of this class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TtDBy"&gt;Like other Nokia Android phones, the G50 has a non-customizable Google Assistant button and a combination SIM and microSDXC tray on its left side, a volume rocker, as well as a power button embedded with a fingerprint sensor on the right. It has a 3.5mm audio jack on top for your wired headphones or mic, as well as a USB-C port and a mono speaker at the bottom. Because the speaker is located on the bottom right corner, it’s easy for your hand to cover the sound. When listening to the &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; theme song from the HBO series, the opening percussion track sounds more muffled and buzzy on the Nokia, whereas each beat sounds clear and distinct on the OnePlus 9 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EdLwsX"&gt;One of the ways Nokia cut corners with the G50 is by using a 720p low-resolution display.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W6i4pg2LMUX2M-BzIsf-IFPoZiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940475/akrales_211015_4805_0051.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G50 comes with a pre-applied screen protector, which you can feel around the edge of the display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MYVXcF"&gt;The G50’s 6.82-inch, 720 x 1560 LCD display is simply too big for so few pixels to produce sharp, high-resolution content. Although its IPS LCD panel does offer good viewing angles with vibrant colors, it doesn’t make up for its low-resolution or 252ppi pixel density. It’s a fine screen for reading emails and social media posts, but there is a noticeable difference when looking at multimedia content. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gAOcTfVX5IHtCBRNm73e2-VGr8M=/0x0:2040x1360/1075x1075/filters:focal(857x517:1183x843):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073384/Verge10yearEditorsnote_homepage_2.0.jpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; 10th Anniversary image with the stacked motherboards&lt;/a&gt;, for example, looks pixelated and has blurred edges at maximum zoom on the Nokia phone, but lines still look sharp on the OnePlus 9 Pro, even when completely zoomed in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3NiUi"&gt;Not only does the G50 have a low-resolution screen, but it’s also not as touch-sensitive as other modern phones, where you only need to lightly brush the display to navigate the interface. When I was playing &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, for example, I had to exert more force with each of my swipes to move my character along the battlefield. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it makes this phone a little less enjoyable to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxZqd0"&gt;The G50 comes pre-installed with a screen protector, which explains the weird horizontal streaks that run across the screen when the phone is off, as well as the slightly raised edge around the display. The screen protector looks invisible when the phone is on, but if you’re looking at a video with a significant black frame around it, random sightings of this layer can be distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dmRuqRm8RX12tnBgeoQBkahDR1M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940476/akrales_211015_4805_0062.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G50 has a stainless steel framed body and a polycarbonate coating in a matte, ombre finish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="69kQoI"&gt;The Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor may be responsible for making the Nokia G50 one of the few $300 5G phones around, but it might just be too underpowered for its ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhgUC5"&gt;Despite the fact the processor is supported with 4GB RAM and 128 GB of internal storage, the G50 sometimes struggles with very basic tasks. It can take an extra second longer to open a link or an app, or a web page would crash, and I’d have to reload it. The G50 also seems to have trouble multitasking when using a resource-intensive app like &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt;. After I downloaded the game, I could not even open it until every single app I had running in the background was closed, and there were only three apps in the background. The game is playable on the G50, but the combination of its slower performance and less sensitive touchscreen can make it feel like you’re moving your character through molasses against faster opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JmyqV2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The $300 Nokia G50 is neither the cheapest nor the best budget 5G phone out there&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hAKozV"&gt;For a phone that is supposed to be future-proofed for 5G connectivity — at least on sub-6Hz 5G networks on T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T and not Verizon’s mmWave network — the Nokia G50 I was testing had some trouble connecting to 4G LTE cellular service. My T-Mobile SIM card worked fine until the one day I needed cellular access, and no amount of restarting the phone would fix it. After speaking with HMD Global’s PR representative, I realized I was missing an important system update but had trouble installing it until it just installed itself on another day. My G50 has had no problem accessing my T-Mobile 4G service since then. It’s unclear whether my connection issue is a known problem with the hardware, or I just got unlucky with an update or just this particular unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="LpiaR1"&gt;One place Nokia did not skimp on is the 5,000mAh battery in the G50. It is a nice luxury to have a large capacity battery in your phone, even for a $300 device. To test its battery life, I used only Wi-Fi to actively post on Twitter and Hangouts, read online articles, take photos, and check my two email accounts. All in, I was able to get about 28 hours of active use out of the G50 over two days, which tracks with other phones with 5,000mAh batteries like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;TCL 20S&lt;/a&gt;. The included 18W charging brick is definitely not a fast charger, though, because it took almost three hours to recharge this gigantic battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-BlXYnsiKNbUO7Oa7sw5etS0DVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940473/akrales_211015_4805_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can tell this is a Nokia phone by its iconic circular array of three rear cameras on the back of the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="4dY15x"&gt;You can tell this is a Nokia phone by its iconic circular array of three rear cameras on the back of the phone. This may be a budget phone, but Nokia did not compromise on photography — at least not on the main 48-megapixel wide camera. It also has a 5-megapixel ultrawide camera, 2-megapixel depth camera, as well as a front 8-megapixel wide camera embedded into the bezel of the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNs4Za"&gt;The main camera, with its wide lens, f/1.8 aperture, and auto phase detection autofocus, can capture some detailed shots during the day, as well as on clear nights. You can still see the bubbles in my boiling-hot Korean stew and the distinct lamination layers in the pastry. I was particularly surprised by the night photo of colorful graffiti against the backdrop of an office tower. Using the 5-megapixel ultrawide camera, I was able to capture One World Trade and the Oculus in one shot, though, of course, the lights from the towers are all blown out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EF4zyf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10843175"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z20ECC"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the Nokia G50.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtSog2"&gt;The biggest downside to the ultrawide camera is that its photos’ colors are not always accurate. For example, the pastries look significantly more yellow in the ultrawide photo compared to the photo of the mini cakes from the main camera. The photo with the two colorful doors is another example of how the ultrawide camera skews yellow in misleading ways. While the two doors look like they’re yellow and blue in the photo, in real life, the doors are actually orange and teal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlP9Jl"&gt;If you need to capture anything that’s far away on a dim day, I wouldn’t bother using the cameras on this phone with digital zoom. I took some waterfront photos on a cloudy evening, and all the photos were either blurry messes or way too saturated with yellow lighting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MN6C-xtnxBIrxlkSMIVSn0TvRzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940474/akrales_211015_4805_0039.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G50 is a $300 budget 5G phone that works on the sub-6GHz 5G network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sK98bD"&gt;The $300 Nokia G50 is neither the cheapest nor the best budget 5G phone out there, and you may be better served by its competitors. For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;$239.99 OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; uses the same Snapdragon 480 5G processor as the G50 but has a 1080p display with 90Hz refresh rate for less money. Or, if you’re already a T-Mobile customer, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; might be the better choice, as it uses the faster Snapdragon 690 5G processor and has the same HD display as its sibling. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is another popular choice at $279. It uses a faster MediaTek Dimensity 720 5G processor, has four years of security updates, and is compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;newer 5G C-band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJkgcM"&gt;Yet all these budget 5G phones suffer from the same problem: they all had to compromise in some way to make room for its more expensive 5G components. Since 5G isn’t ubiquitous yet and is hardly essential to our lives in 2021, I’m not sure it’s necessary to limit yourself to 5G phones when there is a world of 4G phones that already offers better value and user experience. For around $300, you can get a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Pixel 4a&lt;/a&gt; with a camera that will blow any budget 5G phone’s camera out of the water. Or you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;TCL 20S&lt;/a&gt; with premium looks and specs for just $250 and save some money toward your future 5G phone —  when the technology matures.&lt;/p&gt;

We also spoke with a HMD Global PR representative rather than a Nokia spokesperson, as previously stated. We regret these errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor 50 review: lose a Huawei, gain a Google</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Google’s software makes the Honor 50 a contender rather than competitive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="kUBDaT"&gt;It’s rare that you need to get into geopolitics at the outset of a smartphone review, but it’s impossible to avoid with the Honor 50. It’s the first Honor-branded device to release outside of China since the brand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;spun out from parent company Huawei last year&lt;/a&gt;. It means that despite Huawei’s continued presence on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;USA’s entity list&lt;/a&gt;, Honor is now able to include Google’s apps and services on a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bho8iK"&gt;Having access to these services, which include critical parts of the Android ecosystem like Google Play in addition to apps like Google Maps and YouTube, means that the Honor 50 is the first Honor phone in years to actually have a shot at being a viable purchase for customers outside of China. Its midrange starting price of €529 (about $616) doesn’t hurt, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVw4Hm"&gt;But while leaving its former parent company has opened a Google-shaped window for Honor, it’s also closed a Huawei-shaped door. Honor is now on its own, without the backing of one of the most well-resourced technology companies in the world. As a result, while not a bad phone, the Honor 50 ends up not feeling competitive with other handsets in its price range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MhIbgR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10834487"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7L1usZ"&gt;The Honor 50 starts at €529 (around $616) for 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, which is the version I’ve been using, but stepping up to €599 (about $698) gets you 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Regardless of which option you go for, you get the same Snapdragon 778G processor and a 4,300mAh battery that can be fast charged at up to 66W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NC0vPA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You get the choice of 6 or 8GB of RAM&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NjxZsU"&gt;Honor’s phones have always been available with loud designs, and the Honor 50 is no different. My model came in a shiny white colorway, with the letters “HONOR” tiled across its back, and there’s also a garish sparkly silver color option available alongside more conventional black and green options. While I don’t love the color options, I think Honor deserves credit for its approach to the dual-ring camera bump on the Honor 50, which is a lot more interesting than the generic rectangles found on the backs of most devices (Huawei’s Nova 9 uses a very similar design, which Honor says is because the design was developed before the split).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVMwc7"&gt;Around front, the Honor 50 has a 6.57-inch 1080p OLED display, with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a small centrally orientated hole-punch notch for the phone’s 32-megapixel selfie camera, which moderately curves around the left and right edges of the phone. I can’t fault the screen’s rich blacks or vibrant colors, and the under-display fingerprint sensor is fast and responsive. If you don’t like curved displays, then you won’t like the Honor 50’s, but at least the phone doesn’t suffer from any palm-rejection issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t82WZd3sISbJxPFlNaKC4jF-PuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963228/jporter_211025_4826_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A curved screen might not be to everyone’s tastes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d-r-IsZluIIa_rXonBd_Y9D03Ss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963226/jporter_211025_4826_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I like the camera bump more than the color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y7l4aF"&gt;The Honor 50’s screen has a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes it feel fast to use and smooth to look at, and the Snapdragon 778G processor happily keeps up, even while the screen quickly scrolling through visually intensive apps like Twitter. I had no problems with performance during my time with the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TjJhn1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no IP-rating and no wireless charging&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TggGOl"&gt;The rest of the specs are more basic. There’s no IP rating for dust and water resistance and no wireless charging, and when it comes to audio, the phone outputs sound from a basic downward-firing speaker. It’s loud enough for listening around the house, but you’ll be reaching for a pair of headphones in noisier environments. Honor includes a pair of USB-C headphones in the box, which is fairly unusual these days, and almost makes up for the lack of a headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulJlYu"&gt;Honor’s Magic UI software, which runs atop of Android 11 on the Honor 50, is broadly inoffensive. However, it has its annoyances and, by default, is set up in a way that I think most people are going to want to tweak. For starters, it uses Microsoft’s SwiftKey rather than Google’s Gboard keyboard that I think most Android users will be more familiar with. There are also a ton of stock Honor apps that I disabled in my first couple of days with the phone, and I don’t love the way Honor’s software defaults to eschewing Android’s typical app drawer for an iOS-like homescreen. It’s easy enough to rectify with some tweaks, but it feels a little cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone has four rear cameras in its camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tsf43s"&gt;I had no complaints with the battery life of the Honor 50, averaging a little over seven hours of screen on time between charges. I never had to put the phone on to charge at the end of the day with less than 40 percent charge remaining. The Honor 50 supports 66W fast charging via an included charger that’s branded as Honor’s own “SuperCharge” charging standard, which isn’t compatible with third-party chargers. Honor claims the included charger can get the phone from 0 to 100 percent charge in 45 minutes (unfortunately, my review sample came with an EU plug, so I was unable to verify this claim myself). But a full charge in under an hour is nothing to be sniffed at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S043nr"&gt;The headline camera specs of the Honor 50 appear to be impressive at first glance, but the devil’s in the detail. Yes, it’s a 108-megapixel quad-camera array, but there’s no telephoto camera, and beyond the main sensor, the three additional cameras are a comparatively low-resolution 8-megapixel ultra-wide angle, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e5rzBK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10834528"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AH69Sq"&gt;Things don’t get off to a great start with the Honor 50’s main camera. Even in daylight, there can be a distinct lack of detail in its shots, like in the shot of the black cat above, where there’s very little definition or texture in its fur. Colors are vibrant at the risk of being a little oversaturated, and faces come out looking a little too bright and textureless. White balance is at least pretty natural, and I think selfies come out generally looking OK, helped by the fact that there’s an easily accessible shortcut to turn on background blurring and a beauty mode slider (if that’s a feature you’re interested in). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caOsnn"&gt;Low light performance leaves a lot to be desired, where the Honor 50 produces shots that are dark and muddy. But the bigger problem is that the phone takes way too long to take photographs in low light. When trying to take a shot of a group of people at a party, the Honor 50 refused to take a photo for several agonizing moments, which is far longer than people at a party are willing to wait to have their photo taken for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVLEUhGmjx-P5x--gjLjWPl3NmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963229/jporter_211025_4826_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C and bottom-firing speaker, but no headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/648NqA0oDE6Rqeo032kNax-Cqm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963225/jporter_211025_4826_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 120Hz display is hard to fault.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9VgiQb"&gt;At its starting price, the Honor 50 is a comfortably midrange device. But there are a lot of accomplished smartphones available at similar prices. Phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt; (€499 for its step-up 12GB RAM / 256GB storage model) or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt; (€539 for its 128GB storage variant) are both excellent phones that offer a much more rounded experience than the Honor 50. And if you’re considering the Honor 50 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, then you’re just €50 away from the recently announced Pixel 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFEUIv"&gt;It’s a crowded part of the market, and simply having access to Google’s apps and services isn’t enough to make an impact. Honor’s software can feel bloated, and its camera is sluggish and lacking in detail. Speedy 66W fast charging and a slick 120Hz display aren’t enough to distract from the fact that the Honor 50 has some weak spots when compared against the best midrange handsets available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="jX6wqK"&gt;Honor might be a viable purchase now that it can once again include Google’s apps and services on its devices. But it has more work to do if it wants to be truly competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="VegvPD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10834541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro review: finally, more than just good cameras</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new Pixels are the best phones Google has ever made&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1M4A8y"&gt;It’s rare that a new smartphone feels all that &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;. The common refrain is that smartphones are all a “mature” technology and today’s new phone is only incrementally different from the prior one. There’s a lot of truth in that — Apple’s made 15 generations of iPhones! — and the newness you gain from plunking down hundreds of dollars every couple of years to upgrade rarely changes your day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBaQCn"&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, however, are a bit more new than the typical phone, even though they don’t fold in half or have especially unique designs. They come with new cameras, new materials, new hardware, new software, and new thoughts on what a smartphone should be able to do for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADueEq"&gt;But a lot of this is new &lt;em&gt;for Google&lt;/em&gt; and not necessarily different from what you can get from a litany of other smartphone makers right now. The $599 Pixel 6 and $899 6 Pro are a reset for Google’s smartphone ambitions, a fresh start for the company that has slogged through five generations of Pixel phones without so much as a dent in the smartphone world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YgXao"&gt;As a result, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are not perfectly refined devices, nor do they do everything Google claims as well as you might expect. But that doesn’t stop them from being among the best phones available and perhaps the best Android phones to buy right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WiVH9P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10832253"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="e1X4X7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10832861"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="U6xTbo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwpk-zXoSnjbk7Cl9atGkDmIE68=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934831/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The most distinctive part of the new Pixel 6 design is the camera bar on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="r91XGl"&gt;The design of the new Pixel phones is a change of pace for Google and follows the conventions of other popular Android phone makers for the past few years. Instead of quirky textured finishes with fun pops of color, they are the typical glass and metal sandwich slabs with aluminum frames and slippery backs. There’s less whimsy and character to their details than prior Pixel phones, something I miss. And if you look closely, they aren’t quite as polished as the best from Apple and Samsung at this point — it’s easy to find a rough edge or two along the seams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djgaYO"&gt;The front of both phones is hard to distinguish from lots of other big Android phones on the market; they mostly resemble a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 or Note 20 to my eye. And while the back has a distinctive bar toward the top that houses the cameras, the whole thing reminds me of a TCL phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13npwk"&gt;The Pixel 6 is available in three two-tone colors — black, red, or green — while the Pixel 6 Pro is only available in more staid variations of black, white, or gold. The aluminum sides of the regular 6 are chunky and matte black, while the 6 Pro’s sides are thinner and polished to a shine. Between the two, the 6 is certainly more fun, while the 6 Pro doesn’t quite match up to other phones within its price tier in terms of design or fit and finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5kOUDs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These designs have less character or whimsy than Google’s earlier efforts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RE29Ja"&gt;The most prominent design element is the camera bar that spans the back of each phone. It’s large, sticks out far, and doesn’t quite blend seamlessly into the rest of the phone. On the plus side, it doesn’t cause the phone to rock on a table or desk when you put it down, unlike the camera bumps on other phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OaFr5"&gt;A lot of these design critiques are purely academic, though, because in reality you’re going to put a case on either phone and cover up any of the rough edges or boring colors. That’s an extremely good idea, too, because both phones are capital-L Large and their smooth glass backs are extremely slippery. I’ve had them slide off my desk, wireless chargers, sofa arms, tables, my lap, you name it, and one of our sample units actually fell hard enough to crack the Gorilla Glass Victus glass panel covering its screen. (Side note: I’ve been testing Google’s translucent recycled plastic cases alongside the Pixel 6 and they are horrible — I recommend checking out third-party options.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kO5iLr"&gt;Really, my main problem with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s design is that they are just too big for my taste. They are challenging to use in one hand, they don’t fit comfortably in a lot of my pants pockets, and they are easy to drop. In prior years, Google offered both small and large versions of its phones, but for this sixth generation it’s big or bigger; the size difference between the two is negligible. These are iPhone Pro Max-size phones, which is fine if you want a big phone but leaves out those of us who aren’t fans of oversized slabs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZFY2OIMElXN-iNEcQuGV6bNN5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934833/bfarsace_211014_4802_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro both have big, spacious displays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gWyOXZ"&gt;The flip side of that is both phones have big, spacious displays. The Pixel 6’s is a 6.4-inch OLED panel with 1080p-wide resolution; the 6 Pro steps up to a 6.7-inch OLED screen with 1440p wide resolution. The Pixel 6’s screen is fully flat, while the 6 Pro has curved sides that taper into the frame. I prefer the flat screen of the 6, but the 6 Pro’s curves didn’t cause any errant touch issues in my testing, something that can make a curved screen difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjytBq"&gt;Both are sharp, vibrant, and colorful, with the 6 Pro being slightly brighter when outdoors in sunlight. Neither have any glaring problems that plagued older Pixel phones, like weird color reproduction or flickering at low brightness levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnzUBl"&gt;There are some issues if you look closely, like a slight color shift at oblique angles or a noticeable shadow under the curved sides of the 6 Pro when using a light background, things we don’t see on the best phones from Apple or Samsung at this point. If there’s one place where the cheaper price tag of these phones comes through, it’s these displays. They’re good, but not up to the level set by other flagship competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="1p0VNe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The displays are good, but not quite the best we’ve seen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O726Vq"&gt;They also have fast refresh rates — 90Hz on the Pixel 6, up to 120Hz on the 6 Pro — that make scrolling and interactions very smooth. Fast refresh screens have become table stakes on premium phones and it’s good to see Google follow suit here. I did not notice a difference between the 90Hz and 120Hz, either, unless I compared the phones side by side— both are smooth in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrcBYE"&gt;Less smooth is the fingerprint scanner under the screen. It’s located in a comfortable spot — about a quarter of the way up from the bottom — but it’s much slower than other fingerprint scanners, including the ones on the back of older Pixel phones. Because it’s optical, the screen lights up when you scan a finger, which can be really disruptive in dark rooms. The scanner also misread my finger from time to time, requiring multiple attempts to unlock the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6TiBM"&gt;Compounding this error is the fact that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro don’t have any sort of facial recognition unlock — the fingerprint scanner is the only biometric authentication available, and it’s just not very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p3b7AYz9iBasM0ZPVmyUI3fNSso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934841/bfarsace_211014_4802_0054.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even the regular Pixel 6 is still a very large phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="quBj6E"&gt;One of the most important things about the Pixel 6 pair is the processor inside of them, Google’s new Tensor chip. It’s the first custom processor from Google, which is following in Apple’s footsteps and leaving behind off-the-shelf processors from Qualcomm or MediaTek. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyZqY4"&gt;In addition to powering the phone, the Tensor processor also has a lot of AI-based customization to enhance features in the camera, speech recognition, and gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oikAff"&gt;Google says the new processor is competitive with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 for performance, and in my experience, that’s true. Apps open quickly, it’s easy to switch between them smoothly, and the interface is free of stutters and hang-ups. Twitter was the one app that stuttered on both phones, but it was an outlier. The Tensor chip will not benchmark as highly as Apple’s latest processors, but it’s far ahead of the processor that was in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5 last year&lt;/a&gt; and right up there with other premium Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1SiKk"&gt;The Pixel 6 has 8GB of RAM, while the 6 Pro is equipped with 12GB. In practical use, the 6’s lesser amount of RAM did not present issues — streaming apps do not aggressively close in the background like they did on older Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dnc0I"&gt;There also wasn’t an appreciable difference in battery life between the two phones. Both are easily able to cruise through a full day of use with plenty of juice left in the tank — most nights I went to bed with 35-40 percent battery remaining, even while using the camera a lot and enabling the always-on display feature. Light users can probably stretch this to two days without much effort. A big reason for this stamina is the fact that the batteries are just big — big phones bring big batteries and big battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DznWh20KyWGOdtuMs_kwV9Aw8XY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934884/bfarsace_211014_4802_0123.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fingerprint scanner is located about a quarter of the way up from the bottom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2YtMAz"&gt;Both models support wireless charging and fast wired charging, but neither come with a charger in the box. Google sells a &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_30w_charger?hl=en-US"&gt;$25 30-watt brick&lt;/a&gt; separately and will be releasing a &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen?hl=en-US"&gt;$79 fast wireless charger&lt;/a&gt; in the near future, but I haven’t been able to test that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2oSGn"&gt;Even if you do use a powerful enough charger, neither phone charges particularly quickly. Google aggressively slows down charging once it’s past 80 percent to preserve the battery cells’ longevity, and since these batteries are so large, getting to a full charge can take a long time. Fortunately, thanks to the long battery life, you will likely only have to charge when you’re sleeping anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="02eeNC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google nailed the haptic feedback in the Pixel 6 — it’s clicky, but subtle, with just the right amount of feedback&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HwjiZ1"&gt;Another area that the Pixels excel is in their haptic feedback. Bad, buzzy haptics can ruin a phone experience for me, but the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have subtle, clicky responses that provide just the right amount of feedback. It makes typing on the keyboard or interacting with the UI very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yra4ls"&gt;Both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have proper, dual stereo speakers that pump out a satisfactory amount of volume and sound clear for both streaming music or video and taking speakerphone or video calls. Good riddance to the vibrating screen pseudo-speaker Google used in the Pixel 5 last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgK76L"&gt;Google is advertising 5G connectivity for both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, but the details around it aren’t quite that straightforward. The unlocked and T-Mobile versions of the Pixel 6 are limited to sub-6 5G, while the Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T models are more expensive and support the faster but very limited millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhM5Xy"&gt;None of that confusion applies to the Pixel 6 Pro — no matter how you buy it, it will support both sub-6 and mmWave 5G. AT&amp;amp;T’s extra cost for its model relative to the unlocked, T-Mobile, or Verizon versions just buys you the privilege of being an AT&amp;amp;T customer, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCyh7F"&gt;I tested unlocked versions of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro on Google Fi, which uses T-Mobile’s 5G network. Performance was commensurate with other premium phones I’ve used on T-Mobile — I was able to reach speeds of 300 to 400Mbps in certain areas of New York City, which is a lot faster than I get on LTE in the same areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kQrh9lhcFjli9Nu9AT373ed2aQo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957770/akrales_211020_4802_0323.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro is the first Google phone with a wide, ultrawide, and telephoto camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XEfWev"&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro’s camera systems are also wholly new, with new sensors, new lenses, and new capabilities. Google has finally upgraded the camera hardware in the Pixel line for the first time since 2017, and it’s gone big — literally. The new main camera sensor is much larger than the one used in the Pixel 5 and earlier, and the Pixel 6 Pro is the first in the line to have ultrawide, wide, and telephoto cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="denxON"&gt;Both phones have the same main wide camera and ultrawide. The main camera is a 50-megapixel sensor that is hard-coded to produce 12.5-megapixel images behind an optically stabilized f/1.85 lens. That means you can’t actually capture the full 50-megapixel resolution and the images produced aren’t especially sharper or more detailed than other 12-megapixel cameras, including the Pixel 5’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="MOp3xB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The telephoto camera on the Pixel 6 Pro is the most fun to use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7vHaSy"&gt;Still, the images are very good in both normal and low light, and very competitive with the best from Apple. I won’t say there’s a clear winner here; some images from the Pixel 6 look better, some images from the iPhone 13 Pro look better, and which you prefer really comes down to your own personal preferences, something we’ve been saying about smartphone cameras for a few years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvCow0"&gt;The Pixel 6 images have the classic Pixel look: high contrast, slight overexposure, extreme sharpness, and cooler white balance. You can adjust the white balance easily enough using on-screen sliders in the camera app, but tweaking the sharpness requires a bit more post processing work. Google’s artificial portrait mode is also largely unchanged — it aggressively blurs the background to the point where it almost looks like the subject is a cardboard cutout placed in a diorama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCQX8d"&gt;One area I would like Google to improve is how long its vaunted night mode takes to capture a shot. It’s incredible how much detail the night mode is able to capture in dark scenes, but it takes quite a few seconds to do so, and oftentimes either the subject or the person taking the photo loses patience and things get blurry. The iPhone’s night mode frequently took half as long to capture night scenes as the Pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kAqCcN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10832288"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HcbUgX"&gt;Overall, though, the advancements in image quality from the main camera are not as big as you might expect from new, significantly better hardware. Oftentimes, it’s hard to tell the difference between it and what you could get with older Pixel phones, especially in good lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtNigz"&gt;The Pixel 6’s ultrawide camera is its weakest link — images are soft, it’s not as wide as others, and there’s a noticeable difference in color and processing between it and the main camera. It also lacks the macro focusing abilities available on the iPhone 13 Pro’s ultrawide camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUuZbc"&gt;On the other hand, the Pixel 6 Pro’s telephoto camera is excellent. It’s the first telephoto on a phone that I’ve actually enjoyed using and might be reason enough to spring for the 6 Pro over the regular 6. The 4x reach is noticeably longer than the 3x telephoto on the iPhone 13 Pro, but it’s much more usable day to day than the 10x zoom on Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwcarS"&gt;On top of that, the telephoto produces sharp, detailed images, with great subject separation that requires much less use of software-based portrait modes. It’s a lot of fun to shoot with and the kind of thing that changes what you can do with your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ciG9v6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Images have the classic Pixel look: high contrast, a little overexposure, and lots of detail&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vc6GtC"&gt;Google says it has upgraded the Pixel 6’s video recording abilities, but it’s still behind the iPhone, which remains the standard. You can shoot 4K 60fps as long as you want without the phone overheating, but there’s still noticeable artifacting and wonkiness with image stabilization, and the video image processing is weirdly different from how the Pixel processes still images. Highly saturated colors, like reds and oranges, are amped up to the extreme in video, almost like how Samsung used to process colors years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLY2sT"&gt;On the front of the phones, the cameras differ — the Pixel 6 has an 8-megapixel camera with an 84-degree field of view, while the 6 Pro has an 11-megapixel camera with a 94-degree field of view. Not only will you fit more people in the 6 Pro’s frame, the image quality is noticeably better, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PHozb87stxx869rcwgyj7_CQ6CY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957782/akrales_211022_4802_0839.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magic Eraser feature in Google Photos makes it easy to remove unwanted people or objects in images, but it can be hit or miss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I7my4c"&gt;The Tensor chip in the Pixel enables a couple of special software tricks in the camera and photos app. The new Magic Eraser tool lets you remove unwanted people or items from a captured photo with a single tap, or you can highlight things to remove. It’s very cool, but also hit or miss — it won’t be taking the place of any skilled Photoshop editors anytime soon. You can also accomplish similar things with third-party apps, so it’s not entirely necessary to buy a Pixel for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzdeVq"&gt;What’s more interesting to me are the new motion capture modes, which let you mimic a panning motion shot or a long exposure with just a single tap of the shutter button. You can make a moving object, like a car, freeze in front of a blurred background, or you can capture traffic light streaks without the need for a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EcJMb"&gt;These kinds of images typically take years of practice and lots of gear to do with a traditional camera, but the Pixel 6 makes it as easy as snapping a selfie.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_IgMtL_a_VAx4ipur-SOEIqYtJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957784/akrales_211022_4802_0876.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 makes capturing a panning shot as easy as snapping a selfie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KTok65"&gt;Google has also made a big deal about tweaks it made to its image processing algorithm this year to better handle darker skin tones, which it’s calling Real Tone. Bias in image processing is a problem that’s beset the photo industry for decades, dating all the way &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/9/18/9348821/photography-race-bias"&gt;back to film&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s encouraging to see Google address it. Google says the Real Tone processing is baked into the Pixel’s image processing pipeline and it’s not possible to turn it on or off at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYolzl"&gt;Both Nicole Nguyen &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-built-the-pixel-6-camera-to-better-portray-people-with-darker-skin-tones-does-it-11635177665?st=l805lxv5h4q9ve7&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;at the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Julian Chokkattu &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro/"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were able to test the camera with a range of darker skin tones and their conclusions are interesting; I encourage you to read their respective articles. Looking at all the photos, it’s clear the Pixel is still doing Pixel things: high contrast, with a dose of overexposure to compensate for that, and very sharp details. Some folks might like that look but not everyone will, even if you have darker skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D18tfaBTNzVe-giUTl3StbkE8bQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957781/akrales_211022_4802_0822.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro show off Android 12 well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UeOAsn"&gt;As you’d expect with a new Pixel, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro run the latest version of Google’s Android, the completely redesigned Android 12. We’ve already done a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;full review of Android 12&lt;/a&gt; — I’ll just add that it feels like the fun and whimsy that’s missing from the hardware design of the new Pixels was reserved for the software. It’s colorful and easy to read, with a lot of personalization options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ewnmh"&gt;Also unsurprising, there are a number of Pixel-specific software features, including things that are improved by Google’s new Tensor chip. The Pixel 6 has better voice dictation transcription, since it can do it all locally now, and it can translate foreign languages in messages and media faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/njVwf8sdV8dg2e4_3OByiOyCz20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962441/Screenshot_20211027_175036.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6’s ability to navigate an automated phone tree system is extremely clever but still needs work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XBTwB0"&gt;But the most impressive software features to me are found in the phone app. In addition to the spam routing features Google has had for a few years, the Pixel 6 can now help you with automated phone tree systems and tell you how long the wait time might be when you call a business. It can even wait on hold for you and then notify you when someone picks up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrG2iA"&gt;The automated phone tree feature will listen in on the call and transcribe the options presented, then give you big tappable buttons to make choices. It’s far easier than trying to listen to every word the system is saying only to miss something critical and have to wait for it to restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xd3qnx"&gt;But in testing, it’s clear this still needs work — it can’t recognize languages other than English (such as when you’re presented to “press two for Spanish”) and it often misses words and context that prevent it from giving you the right buttons on the screen to press. Still, it’s a novel idea and I hope Google continues to iterate and improve on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oIPds"&gt;Other additions are the ability to show boarding passes and other useful information right on the lock screen and support for select voice commands to the Assistant without having to say “Hey Google” first. It’s particularly convenient to just mumble “snooze” when an alarm goes off and have the phone obey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gshBVdQBcXY-fsgw38qruMxCe5s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957766/akrales_211020_4802_0082.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qpBvGh"&gt;One of the biggest questions surrounding the Pixel 6 announcement has been, did Google do it? Has it actually been able to produce a competent, flagship-level smartphone that doesn’t have any show-stopping bugs or big gotchas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhsiQo"&gt;And the answer is a resounding yes, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are excellent phones. They may not be the best in every category, but as a whole, they perform well, have great screens, excellent cameras, and reliably great battery life. The only real hang-up here is the size — if you don’t like large phones, they probably aren’t for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UXrBhK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 6 is an incredible phone for $600&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PI9Cff"&gt;Adding to their appeal is how much value is packed in. The Pixel 6 in particular is just a lot of phone for $600 — it’s hard to think of anything on the market that can compete with it at that price. Google is offering a better experience than basically any other Android phone maker in the markets where the Pixel is available, and often doing so for a lower price. It’s even undercutting OnePlus, which built its entire brand on selling premium phones for lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Imbs6s"&gt;Does that mean lots of people will actually buy the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro, when Google has long struggled to gain any market share? Frankly, I don’t really care, because those who do buy it will have a great phone at a great price. It’s hard to argue against that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="MiPiH4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10832275"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Surface Duo 2 review: Duo-over or strike two?</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s second attempt at a folding phone rights a lot of the original’s wrongs, but doesn’t fix everything&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8WNgdd"&gt;Folding phones may be the future, but right now, they are still in their infancy. And in this weird time period where companies are still trying to figure out the best way for a folding phone to work, there are two camps: Samsung and others that fold a big screen down to a smaller, pocketable size, and Microsoft, which joins two screens with a hinge to create a digital book-like device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKhOjN"&gt;Microsoft’s first attempt at this, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;2020’s Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;, was not very good. It had a head-turning design and plenty of &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt; factor, but the original Duo was, to put it bluntly, a hot mess. It lacked modern smartphone things like a proper camera, 5G, wireless charging, NFC, and an up-to-date processor. Even worse, the software was buggy and frustrating to use, with frequent crashes, poor touch response, and limited compatibility in third-party apps for its unique dual-screen features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajnX77"&gt;For this year’s attempt, the $1,499.99-and-up Surface Duo 2, Microsoft appears to have righted many of the original’s wrongs. It has an up-to-date processor, refined design, bigger battery, 5G support, NFC support, newer software, and an actual, honest-to-goodness proper camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yILKfZ"&gt;But once you get past all of those spec-sheet corrections, the Duo 2 still suffers from many of the same issues that plagued the first model. This is still very much a work in progress, one that I can’t recommend anyone buying until Microsoft figures it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IgeCAI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10819327"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JlJxTL"&gt;The good thing about the Duo 2 is that it still has the original’s wow factor. This is just a flat-out cool-looking device and is almost sure to turn heads when used in public. The general design remains the same: it’s effectively two, full-size, super-thin smartphones joined by a 360-degree hinge. The two halves are slightly thicker than last year’s model, but they are still remarkably thin, and their added thickness makes the whole thing feel more substantial. It also offers room for a larger battery, which doesn’t have trouble reliably lasting me a day. Also, this year you can get it in white or black. My review unit is black, but I’m partial to the white model, which hides the fingerprints that collect on the glass much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QOovoBL8HzRIsp3GwzKFyeGT5A8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943436/dseifert_211017_4814_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2’s hinge is strong enough to hold the screens in any position you may need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p7AopV"&gt;The hinge is very nice — it’s smooth yet firm, so it can hold its position however you want it, and it makes it easy to switch from using two screens to just a single screen. The sides of the screens that meet the hinge have a curve, making it possible to see them through the hinge when the Duo 2 is closed. Microsoft is taking advantage of that space to display  limited notifications (missed calls, messages, battery level, and volume level, but no third-party apps), but it’s still not as convenient as a screen on the outside of the phone would be. I’ve also pinched my fingers in the hinge when opening the phone numerous times due to the curve — I’m not hurt, just embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kE1m65"&gt;The screens are slightly larger now — 5.8-inches each, effectively an 8.3-inch screen when combined — and they have a 90Hz refresh rate for smoother interactions and scrolling. They are still OLED panels, which provide punchy colors and deep blacks, and I didn’t have any issues viewing the screens outdoors in bright light. Their slightly larger size doesn’t actually make the footprint of the Duo 2 any larger than the first Duo — the unsightly bezels above and below the screens are now slightly smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hEyeO76_JYx9u2C3jEci_reM824=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943440/dseifert_211017_4814_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2 is slightly thicker than last year’s model, but it’s still impressively thin when closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/twpiCUhtqW2j_cjVyOCknGRDDsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943432/dseifert_211017_4814_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The curve of the screens lets you see part of them through the hinge when it’s closed — Microsoft is using this to show limited notification information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gr1nrw"&gt;Yet the Duo 2’s unique two-screen design makes it a lot wider than normal smartphones. It’s harder to fit into a pocket, and it’s too wide to comfortably reach across the screen with your thumb. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; has an additional screen on the outside of the phone, and while that screen may be a little small for comfort, it’s a much easier device to use in one hand for quick tasks and fits in my pants pockets easier when it’s closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="cm8j1I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Using the Duo 2 in one hand is far from an easy experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="27F9bp"&gt;The Duo 2 is just really hard to use quickly or with one hand — that’s the main takeaway here. It’s not the kind of phone you can whip out of your pocket to pay for something or snap a pic; everything is much more belabored. Using the NFC chip to buy a snack with Google Pay requires opening the phone, unlocking it, folding the left screen back, and then tapping the phone on the reader. It’s not exactly fluid, but hey, last year’s model didn’t even have an NFC chip, so baby steps it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7apeZ"&gt;Microsoft made some other small but obvious tweaks to the external hardware. The fingerprint scanner is now integrated into the power button and the USB-C charging port is centered on the right half of the phone, which might be easier to use with certain charging docks. Sadly, the Duo 2 still doesn’t support wireless charging, which is an unfortunate omission at this price. It also doesn’t have any sort of water or dust resistance rating, something that Samsung has been able to add to its folding phones this year. You’ll want to be careful — that’s a lot of phone that can’t get wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83i3Vr"&gt;Last year’s Duo had a lousy, single speaker; the Duo 2 now has a louder, clearer dual-speaker system. It makes watching video more enjoyable and it’s easier to hear speaker phone or video calls, but the speakers are not nearly as nice as the ones on Samsung’s Galaxy Fold 3.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hov0QerFOj92l9Y6e8RGeeRGCAU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943445/dseifert_211017_4814_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can write notes on one screen while reviewing a website or document on the other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P8PNN5"&gt;The Duo 2 works with Microsoft’s various Surface Pens (sold separately), including the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686095/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-haptics-features-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pen Slim 2&lt;/a&gt;, for pen input. It doesn’t support the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710381/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-hands-on"&gt;Pen 2’s haptics&lt;/a&gt;, like you get with the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716121/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, but the writing experience with the new pen is much better than it was with the older models. The company is also selling a case that covers the front of the Duo 2 and lets you store and charge the Slim Pen or Slim Pen 2 through a magnetic attachment. The magnet is strong — the pen isn’t going to just fall off — but you do have to be careful when sliding the phone into a pocket to not dislodge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUYLf7"&gt;Unsurprisingly, pen input works best with Microsoft’s own OneNote and Sticky Notes apps. In other apps like Evernote, palm rejection and inking is not as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="niPOjU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Duo 2 has a camera system that the original lacked entirely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lyXtB8"&gt;The last big new hardware feature is the new triple-camera system on the back of the right screen. It’s comprised of a 12-megapixel, f/1.7 wide angle; 16-megapixel, f/2.2 ultrawide; and a 12-megapixel, f/2.4 2x telephoto camera. There are night and portrait modes and you can shoot 4K video up to 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aZ6Na"&gt;The camera housing sticks out from the back of the phone, like many other phone cameras do, which gets in the way when you try to fold back the left side and use just the right screen. So Microsoft cleverly angled the housing so the left screen sits flush against it. It doesn’t fold as flat as the first Duo in this position, but this is a fine compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WLUWR"&gt;Microsoft is also using the two screens to its advantage in the camera app to show you captured images on the left and your framing on the right. It’s easy to quickly see a full-size image right after you take it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MoFS_G_J8RRDIZ0mklpFteaPl_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943429/dseifert_211017_4814_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2 now has an actual camera system, but its output is not very good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G67ZEj"&gt;But beyond that, there aren’t many positive things to say about this camera. For starters, because of the Duo’s design, you can’t take pics without opening the phone fully, and it’s very awkward to try to do it one-handed. The camera also hunts for focus a lot, is slow to capture images, and is generally just not very pleasant to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMmz2v"&gt;Image quality is a low point, too. Pictures are over-sharpened and flat, low-light images have lots of watercolor noise reduction and little detail. While it’s certainly an upgrade to the complete lack of a proper camera system in the first Duo, the Duo 2’s camera is hardly competitive with phones at its price point or even hundreds of dollars less. Google’s $500 Pixel 5A runs laps around this camera for a third of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TPvwV6fTcOJqUgFAvRvLLh61QuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943437/dseifert_211017_4814_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multitasking on the Duo 2 is easier than on just about any other phone you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jie2Tb"&gt;Despite those frustrations with the hardware, there are absolutely some cool things you can do with the Duo 2’s unique form factor. The two screens make it far easier to run two apps at the same time compared to split-screen modes on other phones or iPads. You literally just open one app on one screen and the second on the other and boom, you’re in multitasking bliss. I was able to call in to a Zoom meeting on one screen and follow along in a Google Doc on the other screen without missing a beat or feeling like I should have taken the call from my laptop. I can easily see my calendar when I’m responding to an email asking for a meeting, or I can mainline two social media feeds at the same time when doomscrolling through one just isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01PJQy"&gt;Those are all things you can do on other phones or tablets, but the Duo 2 makes it much easier to multitask in that fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dms7ph"&gt;There are limits to what you can do. Neither Microsoft’s own Edge browser nor Chrome allow you to open two websites side by side, so if you want to compare two sites, you have to use two browsers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8j5l9n"&gt;You can “span” a single app across the two screens, but the apps that work best in that mode are primarily made by Microsoft, like Outlook, OneNote, and the Office suite. Most Android apps will just stretch themselves across the screens in an unsightly way, with a giant gap in the middle where the hinge is. Video is particularly bad when spanned across the two screens — you’ll want to stick to turning the phone on its side and just watching something on one of the screens in landscape. You can easily tent the phone to prop it up on a table or desk — no extra kickstand needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RmCzJBwaMQycJazUrCvzVonog3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943438/dseifert_211017_4814_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watching a video across two screens means dealing with a big gap in the middle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GKyA8a"&gt;Microsoft smartly worked with Amazon and Google to support the Kindle and Play Books apps on the dual screens, so when you span them you get one page on each screen, a digital facsimile of a book. A new feature in the Duo 2’s software (which Microsoft says will eventually be coming to the original Duo) is the ability to set an app to auto span every time you open it — so whenever I open the Kindle app, it automatically takes over both screens. It’s perhaps my favorite thing to do with a Duo and is more enjoyable to use than an actual Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qU4jR4"&gt;The original Duo launched with Android 10 and had countless bugs. Many months later, it has received numerous updates, but it’s still on Android 10 and still has many of the same bugs. (Microsoft says it will get Android 11 before the end of this year.) The Duo 2 is launching with Android 11 and the company promises three years of updates, including monthly bug fixes and security patches. But it stops short of committing to a specific number of Android OS platform updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Y8vbc"&gt;The software on the Duo 2 is undeniably better than it was on the original at launch, and even where the first model is today after many bug fix updates. It’s faster, likely thanks to the Duo 2’s newer processor and more generous amount of RAM, and it’s more reliable and predictable. It has more features, like the aforementioned auto spanning mode and hinge notifications, plus basic quality of life things like automatic dark mode and night light modes for the display.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKN_vzo7fu4EtEDLhN_K5haQpIQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943448/dseifert_211017_4814_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reading ebooks is one of the best experiences on the Duo 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W5EDpb"&gt;But it’s still in rough shape in a lot of ways and feels incomplete. The biggest issue by far is a familiar one to the Duo line: poor touch response. A lot of my taps on the screen just aren’t registered — I have to hit an icon twice to launch an app or send a message. Typing on the keyboard is particularly frustrating as a not-small percentage of my taps are ignored, slowing me down greatly. Even when writing with the pen, the screen will miss strokes, making my already bad handwriting look even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dWFNI"&gt;Microsoft says it has not seen these issues itself, but I spoke to a number of other reviewers who have been testing the Duo 2 and they all shared my experience. It’s baffling that such a core experience on a touch-based device isn’t flawless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQ9Kgd"&gt;There are other features missing, like tap to wake when the phone is open, or any sort of always-on display. Maybe those features don’t always make sense on the Duo 2’s form factor, but they are just more examples of things you give up, like easy one-handed use, in order to have a device like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m9S2zTEJ1pIDldjCQRc7iCZwe60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943428/dseifert_211017_4814_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2’s new black color option is very glossy and very fingerprint magnet-y.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FSR7Jb"&gt;It’s easy to see the potential in the Surface Duo line. You can dream up all kinds of different ways you’d put two screens to use, get more work done, and live in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BruA6D"&gt;But it doesn’t take long for those dreams to come crashing down to reality. Between the bugs and inherent awkwardness of the form factor, the Duo 2 is just a difficult device to live with day to day, much like its predecessor. Despite Microsoft addressing many of the omissions of the first generation — a proper camera, NFC, dual speakers, 5G, current processor — the Duo 2 still feels like a secondary device, something you carry alongside your primary phone for taking pictures, paying for things, and general phone stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="okKIaA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Duo 2 is far from the one device to rule them all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MGpXYL"&gt;If you do want a futuristic device that straddles the line between phone and tablet and has pen input, you’ll be better off with the Samsung Galaxy Fold 3, which has a better multimedia experience; can be used easier in one hand; and far fewer bugs. Or maybe you just wait, after all, this segment is still very much in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggL8Zm"&gt;At $1,500-plus, everything about the Surface Duo 2 is a tall ask. You could accomplish much of the same with an iPad Mini alongside your phone for a third of the price. If the first Surface Duo felt like it was 50 percent complete, the Duo 2 is perhaps maybe 75 percent of the way there. I can see the potential. But it does not live up to it, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL’s budget 20S and 20SE phones beat expectations</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Big phones with small price tags&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QTp9Ss"&gt;If the TCL 20S and 20SE phones were on &lt;em&gt;The Price Is Right&lt;/em&gt;, you would probably guess much higher prices than their retail ones. With the 20S retailing for $250 and the 20SE going for $190, these sub-$300 4G phones are the real deal. They check all the boxes for what you’d want in a smartphone: they have big and bright screens, large 5,000mAh batteries, 128GB of internal storage, and “good enough” cameras. You even get a free clear silicone case inside each box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqCcrM"&gt;TCL certainly knows a thing or two about manufacturing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;budget 4K Smart TVs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493125/tcl-alto-soundbar-9-plus-8i-6-plus-3-bluetooth-airplay-google-assistant-dolby-atmos-surround-sound"&gt;affordable soundbars&lt;/a&gt;, and many other gadgets. Heck, it was already quietly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21120107/tcl-blackberry-ends-phone-global-rights-date-2020"&gt;producing phones for the likes of BlackBerry, Alcatel, and Palm&lt;/a&gt; before starting its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21049747/tcl-10-pro-10l-5g-phones-brand-folding-prototype-ces-2020"&gt;eponymous line in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Now it’s taking those skills building other accessibly priced gadgets to its phone line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="da4rRU"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22560849/tcl-20-pro-5g-review-screen-battery-price-specs"&gt;the fancier TCL 20 Pro 5G&lt;/a&gt;, neither the 20S nor the 20SE has the latest and greatest processor, nor do they support 5G networking — those aren’t unsurprising omissions at these price points. But given TCL’s history, it’s no wonder the real stars of the TCL 20S and 20SE are their brilliant displays — though they each use different panels. Both phones look and feel more luxurious than they are because of their solid build quality, as well as attention to the details users really actually care about: long-lasting battery life, strong performance, ample storage, as well as ingenious design. Who says good things can’t come in budget-friendly packages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="AjyYRY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10805445"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="wvub5R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10805028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8TsFX1"&gt;The $190 20SE has a 6.82-inch display, which, at 720 pixels wide, is too low-resolution for a screen this large (720 x 1640 pixels; aspect ratio 20.5:9). I tried watching the 4K Dune trailer on YouTube, and it looked too dim and fuzzy at 720p for me to enjoy the video. Nevertheless, this display offers vibrant colors even at 50 percent brightness, whether or not you turn on the NXTVISION display optimization software (I did not see much difference either way). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qu6nF"&gt;The higher-priced 20S has a brighter yet slightly smaller 6.67-inch screen, with a higher-resolution FHD+ LCD display than the 20SE (1080 x 2400 pixels with 20:9 aspect ratio). When I watched the same Dune trailer at 1080p on the 20S, I could actually see sharper lines and more details this time around. Both displays look bright enough outdoors that I can read text if I boost the screen to 100 percent brightness. I also appreciate how unobtrusive the pinhole front camera is on the 20S compared to the 20SE’s tear-drop design, the latter of which actually cuts into the top of the display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I6H0ZSg1qQQL_QOlehzk-1_D9ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911279/gsin_190125_4797_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the TCL 20S and 20SE have relatively bright displays with vibrant colors, thanks to TCL’s television know-how.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ORMeyW"&gt;Of the two models, the 20S is slightly more manageable to use. But it’s still a big enough phone that I need two hands to use it safely. It can be a bit of a reach for my fingers to navigate different parts of the screen and hold it in the same hand, so I need my other hand to balance the device. At 0.23 inches (5.84mm) taller and 0.25oz (7.1g) heavier, the 20SE is physically bigger than the 20S, but its technical components are not in the same weight class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bhqb2d"&gt;With a price that is $60 less than the 20S, TCL had to find savings in the $190 20SE anywhere it could. For one thing, the 20SE uses the lower-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 chipset, whose slower processing speed can’t make up ground with 4GB of RAM. The 20S, on the other hand, is powered by the faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and is also supported by 4GB of RAM. The difference between the two isn’t very noticeable in basic texting and social media doomscrolling, but I would occasionally have to open an app or webpage twice on the 20SE because it wouldn’t load the first time around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y23HLKFT4D2eX5y-WPCxRJk6IUc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911281/gsin_190125_4797_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL 20SE’s 13-megapixel front camera and tear-drop design cuts into its display, but you don’t notice it after awhile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DaAVol"&gt;To see what these devices are capable of, I played a couple rounds of Pokemon Unite to see how they’d fare. Both TCL phones took about as long to load the game, whereas the OnePlus 9 Pro (with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip) loaded the same round in about half the time. Since the 20SE has a lesser quality display and processor, I was not surprised that my Pikachu moved with a bit of lag. It was only slightly more responsive on the 20S, however. The 20SE’s dual speakers are also louder and buzzier than the 20S speakers, which sounded quieter but produced a more nuanced sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTbqi4"&gt;Despite their differences, both devices offer plenty of internal storage at 128GB and give you the option to expand that storage via microSD. The 20S’ microSD slot accepts up to a 1TB card, while the 20SE only supports up to a 256GB card. Both phones run Android 11 out of the box, with a TCL skin called TCL UI. Since the 20S will get one major OS update (TCL won’t commit to the same for the 20SE) and both phones will get two years of security updates, you’ll have ample room to install these upgrades and stash your content for the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CTtJ7csyZMadmbrhuKLkxFMI55E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911285/gsin_190126_4797_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL 20S’ integrated fingerprint sensor in the power button was a delight to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbu5lC"&gt;The fingerprint sensors on the 20S and 20SE deserve a special mention as they’re quick to recognize my fingerprint and unlock the phones. I especially love the fingerprint sensor that is built into the 20S’ power button, located on the right side of the phone. With just one touch, you not only wake up your phone but also unlock it in an elegant and intuitive way. The 20SE has a more traditional round fingerprint sensor on the back of the device that works just as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6Zl0Q"&gt;Facial recognition on the 20SE can be rather useless. It either doesn’t recognize my face or asks me to touch an icon on the lock screen so that I can unlock the phone with my face, which entirely defeats the purpose of using a hands-free method to unlock. (Thankfully, you can disable this “feature.”) Facial recognition simply worked more consistently on the 20S than on the 20SE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvglcj"&gt;Both phones include a 3.5mm audio jack on top, volume rocker on the right side, non-customizable Google Assistant button on the left, plus a USB-C port and a pair of bottom-firing dual speakers. The 20S has an understated back that looks curved from various angles, but the layer of “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ actually makes the back cover really fingerprint-resistant. The 20SE’s back cover is the complete opposite: it’s a fingerprint disaster zone, thanks to its shiny, nano-photoetched back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KfWDPMO5nGAdmxi2MR5kDvnP_1w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911288/gsin_190126_4797_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both TCL 20S and 20SE include a free clear silicone case inside each box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U2FSO2"&gt;With a 5,000mAH battery inside both phones, it was a challenge to use up that much power on deadline without doing anything out of the ordinary. My normal phone diet includes: checking my two email accounts, texting on WhatsApp and Google Hangouts, tweeting on Twitter, visiting my usual slate of websites like Reddit, as well as listening to a podcast or two. Due to the pandemic, I was home during my testing but tried to use a mix of Wi-Fi and 4G service to mimic real-world use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40nTeP"&gt;I actually got results that are close to TCL’s claims. I used the 20S for about 31 hours on one charge (TCL suggested 36 hours on 3G/4G) and took around 2.5 hours to fully charge the device, which is hardly a “fast charge” as claimed by TCL’s product sheet. Similarly, the 20SE lasted around 32 hours on one charge, compared to TCL’s estimate of 31 hours of use on 4G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a33xGW"&gt;Don’t get too excited about the cameras on the 20S or the 20SE, though: they can take great snaps in natural light, but I wouldn’t hang these photos on my wall. Both phones have a quad-camera setup, but each model uses different sensors. While the 20S has a 64-megapixel main and a 15-megapixel front camera, and the 20SE has a 48-megapixel main and 13-megapixel front camera, these numbers don’t really say anything about the quality of their photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZeUT9L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10802883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDsaah"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the TCL 20S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTOxVs"&gt;I snapped a bunch of wide-angle and main camera shots (of the same area) using both phones. The ones from the 20S look more balanced with plenty of details, compared to the ones from the 20SE, where the water fountain area looks more over-exposed, especially at 4x cropped zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVI7ry"&gt;There’s a noticeable difference in color between the photos captured with the main cameras and the ultrawide angle cameras on both phones (8-megapixel on the 20S; 5-megapixel on the 20SE). There is also a problem with the Super Macro mode on both phones’ 2-megapixel macro cameras. Photos of the fuchsia flower look pixelated and flat, while the colors from the indoor photos of the blue hydrangea look way over-saturated in the yellow channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5newt"&gt;Based on the price point of these phones, I was surprised when any of the night shots came out somewhat presentable (I know they’re in varying degrees of blurriness). To be fair, even the photos from my Pixel 5 weren’t perfect. Both the 20S and 20SE struggled to focus with so many different light sources in the dark, and each photo required many awkward seconds to process. The 20S produced the sharper photo, while the 20SE’s photos look much less detailed, especially if you look at the lights from the office towers in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nn5y2T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10802941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9fTXeF"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the TCL 20SE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDTYKb"&gt;At first glance, both front-facing cameras captured decent selfies. But I have to give the edge to the 20S’ 16-megapixel camera for the more realistic colors and brighter photos. The selfie from the 20SE’s 13-megapixel front cam just looked more over-exposed: my sunglasses looked frosted, and my skin looked unnaturally pale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzmjQQKUh-mGOy2MMqKXfwEeRWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911280/gsin_190125_4797_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both TCL 20S and 20SE feel solid in-hand, with nice details like nano-photoetching and fingerprint-resistant crystal coating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TNF7iu"&gt;I can’t really think of a higher quality budget phone in the $250 range that can beat the TCL 20S. It’s got all the hallmarks of a more expensive device but with a more affordable price tag. Its vibrant 6.67-inch 1080p display doesn’t look out of place next to other flagship phones, and it feels luxurious with that fingerprint-proofed layer of “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="z0mh1i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll be hard-pressed to find a better phone for $250 than the 20S&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YvGFC9"&gt;Sure, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;$250 Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt; has an equally large battery and a slightly newer processor. In exchange, you get a meager 64GB of internal storage, which is a far cry from the 128GB plus microSD card slot that is offered by the 20S. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$269 OnePlus Nord 10&lt;/a&gt; (global GSM unlocked version) is also an option. It uses a newer Snapdragon chip that is 5G-compatible but still runs Android 10 when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; is ready to drop. If you don’t care about having a 5G-ready phone right now, then the TCL 20S makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gQL3S"&gt;If you’re looking for an unlocked phone that is compatible with Verizon and most 4G GSM networks like AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile, I don’t think you can go wrong with this unlocked TCL 20S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Us9CdG"&gt;If your budget is strictly sub-$200 and won’t be using Verizon as your carrier, then TCL 20SE is a smart choice. While the $180 OnePlus Nord N100 might save you $10, you’ll lose half the amount of internal storage for minimal savings (from 128GB on the TCL 20SE to 64GB on the N100) — that’s a terrible trade-off. You’ll be happier with a big bright screen, ample storage and battery life, as well as the ability to choose any GSM network (including AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile). If you don’t mind spending an extra $60, though, the 20S is worth the upgrade — your future self will thank you.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fairphone 4 review: the price of sustainability </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A modular smartphone that (mostly) feels like a modern device&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7LpNJK"&gt;It’s been hard to fault Fairphone’s sustainable credentials over the years, whether it’s the company’s lengthy support periods, easy repairability, or ethically sourced materials. But when it comes to the devices themselves, previous Fairphones have struggled to be competitive with similarly priced smartphones. They lacked modern features, used outdated designs, and generally had more quirks than you’d expect to get from a modern phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FW4E1n"&gt;The Fairphone 4 is a big step forward. It’s every bit as sustainable, with a modular repairable design that Fairphone now offers a five-year warranty for. But more important is that it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; much more like a modern smartphone. The huge top and bottom bezels of the Fairphone 3 have been stripped away, and there are also modern conveniences like an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAHhFB"&gt;With a starting price of €579 / £499 (around $669, though Fairphone has no plans to sell the Fairphone 4 in the states) for the 6GB RAM / 128GB storage model, the Fairphone 4 costs a premium compared to its competitors. It’s also getting a much more limited Europe-only release, with no plans for a US launch. But if you only need a smartphone to do basic smartphone stuff, and you’re prepared to pay a premium over other similarly capable competitors, I think the Fairphone 4 is up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdxhIV"&gt;The Fairphone 4 is available to pre-order now, and devices will start shipping on October 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="232Djm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10796788"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9iX5Fu"&gt;Compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/27/20834741/fairphone-3-release-date-news-specs-features"&gt;Fairphone 3&lt;/a&gt; that preceded it, it’s hard to believe the Fairphone 4 has been produced by the same manufacturer. The chunky and dated top and bottom bezels from the previous phone are gone, replaced with a sheet of Gorilla Glass 5 that stretches right from the top of the Fairphone 4 to the bottom. It feels like Fairphone has caught up with the rest of the smartphone industry, even if that’s because the rate of smartphone evolution has slowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Uo8jf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a choice of 6 or 8GB of RAM&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UsbqHK"&gt;Yes, the bezels are still sizable by modern standards, but they’re small enough that the phone is able to have a large 6.3-inch display without feeling too ungainly. It’s LCD rather than OLED, and viewing angles aren’t amazing, but I was happy with how it looked after I turned off its overkill image enhancement options in its Settings app and tweaked the color temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78jwf6"&gt;There are two versions of the Fairphone 4 available: one with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (the model I’ve been using for this review) and a step-up version with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which retails for €649 / £569. Both are otherwise identical and feature the same cameras, 3,905 mAh battery, and Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9r_np83cVAcREEdcoDAHzcrKGY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908020/jporter_071021__4794_0254.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back is easily removable to access the phone’s internals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GkClOpsb8buLEeQecJ_pB3cufI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908019/jporter_071021__4794_0257.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small philips head screws keep the phone’s components in place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TSDWKt"&gt;More important than the specs are what the internals of the Fairphone 4 are actually made of. In here, there’s Fairtrade-certified gold, ethically sourced aluminum and tungsten, and recycled tin, rare earth minerals and plastics. Fairphone also aims to turn these materials into a phone as ethically as possible, thanks to initiatives that aim to improve working conditions for the miners and factory workers involved in the phone’s supply chain. Each phone is also “e-waste neutral,” Fairphone claims, since the company will recycle either a phone or an equivalent amount of e-waste with each sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wRJxMJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The phone’s SIM card is inserted under its removable battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9QCyXk"&gt;Flip over the Fairphone 4, and you’ll see its back (made out of 100 percent recycled plastic), which can be easily removed without any tools to reveal the phone’s removable battery and the Phillips head screws that can be used to easily remove everything from its rear cameras to its USB-C port and loudspeaker. You’ll need to take this rear panel off to insert a SIM card underneath the battery during setup, a process which handily doesn’t require the use of a SIM tool — convenient given there isn’t one included in the box (though Fairphone tells me this may differ between release markets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0B1mm"&gt;iFixit is yet to pass its official judgment on the repairability of the Fairphone 4, but the company’s previous phones are the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FFairphone%2B3%2BTeardown%2F125573&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22716194%2Ffairphone-4-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FFairphone%2B2%2BTeardown%2F52523&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22716194%2Ffairphone-4-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; devices to have gotten perfect 10s from the repair specialists. As well as being easy to remove, the parts should also be easy to replace since Fairphone plans to have replacements available until at least 2027 (as a benchmark, the company still has some spare parts left for the almost six-year-old Fairphone 2). A five-year warranty should also keep the repair costs down over the life of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pOcEpqMpHU_kovXO_HlG3lv5e4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908018/jporter_071021__4794_0235.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fair enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4LNK8p"&gt;On the software side, the Fairphone 4 ships with Android 11, but the company hopes to provide at least two major Android updates, or four if it can manage it. It’s done a good job at delivering on these promises with previous phones… eventually. Earlier this year, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349953/fairphone-2-android-9-update-sustainable-long-term-support"&gt;finally released Android 9 for the Fairphone 2&lt;/a&gt;. Impressive given the Fairphone 2 was five years old at the time, less impressive given it came almost three years after Android 9’s original release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_Vg3R8uiFKzdQE2YS5JZCjAj50=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908021/jporter_071021__4794_0224.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone’s side-mounted fingerprint sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nHDj42"&gt;As you might expect from a phone that can ship without a SIM tool, the Fairphone 4 doesn’t come with anything in the way of accessories in the box as standard. There’s no charging brick, no included headphones, and no USB-C charging cable in the box. There’s also no miniature included screwdriver like we saw with the Fairphone 3. It may have been a cute indicator of its repairability credentials, but including it didn’t make much sense if you’re trying to minimize unnecessary accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugpMFN"&gt;On the right of the phone, there’s a side-mounted fingerprint sensor that doubles as a power button, which I prefer to rear-mounted sensors even if they’re not as convenient as under-display models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WdRgb"&gt;There’s no headphone jack next to the Fairphone 4’s USB-C port, which isn’t exactly surprising given it’s a smartphone released in 2021, but is a little more disappointing given Fairphone’s focus on being as consumer-friendly as possible. The team tells me the tradeoff was made to allow for the phone to have an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance. That means the phone should survive being used in the rain, but not full submersion, and it’s not an insubstantial achievement given the back of this modular phone can literally be unclipped without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EPt_lSvFDXxAg75ux_n1KXIq-DQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910248/IMG_20211002_125707.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust me, this phone can survive a bit of rain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9w7Cvv"&gt;As it turns out, I ended up using the Fairphone 4 to take photos during an exceptionally rainy walk while vacationing in the Welsh countryside, so I feel pretty confident saying that the company’s claims about the phone being rainproof are accurate. Here’s a selfie of me on the walk if you want to get an idea of just how rainy I’m talking about (it should also give you an indicator of how the phone’s 25-megapixel selfie camera performs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYVSZG"&gt;It’s great to see Fairphone using a more capable 7-series Snapdragon processor compared to the 6-series one used in the Fairphone 3. For the most part, the Snapdragon 750G keeps up with the demands I placed on the phone in everyday usage, but it wasn’t perfect. Waking up Google Assistant with a swipe up from the corner of the screen to ask a query took a beat longer than I’m normally used to, and there were sometimes hitches in the YouTube app when switching videos between normal and full-screen viewing. It’s capable rather than slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ybh4yM"&gt;But while overall performance is OK, the phone isn’t without its quirks. The most frustrating issue I found is that the Fairphone 4 isn’t great at palm rejection, so when you’re holding it one-handed and reach your thumb across, it’ll confuse your palm for an intentional tap. The Fairphone 4 also seemed to spend more time connected to 3G networks than other smartphones I’ve used, even in areas where I normally get a 4G signal. Other times, however, it happily connected to 5G networks. A strange quirk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y2LBahIIZUVpap1RqKYBPHzQbY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908014/jporter_071021__4794_0229.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That camera bump again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J0svpruwvdaJqFZTRZsrPIPU0_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908012/jporter_071021__4794_0226.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C port but no headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gGDD3W"&gt;I had no problems with battery life during my time with the Fairphone 4 and generally averaged around four and five hours of screen on time per charge. For me, this typically translated to putting the phone on to charge with between 10 and 50 percent of charge left in the tank at the end of the day. On one day of traveling, I used the Fairphone 4 for several hours of podcast and music listening via wireless headphones, a few hours of social media scrolling, and then for two hours of navigation while wirelessly connected via Android Auto, and I still had 10 percent of battery left when I put it on charge at 11PM that night. The phone supports 20W fast charging, which Fairphone says should refill half its battery in half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YUzqsf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life is good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xo0YDR"&gt;Performance is acceptable, battery life is good, and the phone’s screen is perfectly fine. But the only area of the Fairphone 4 that I think could be a real dealbreaker for some people is its camera, which, despite being based around a pair of 48-megapixel sensors (one for the main camera and one for the ultrawide), produces mediocre shots, even in broad daylight. It’s nice to have the versatility of dual cameras, which are a first for a Fairphone, but it’s a shame that the images they capture are disappointing in anything other than broad daylight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvmljv"&gt;I think the images in the gallery below speak for themselves. They often look uncomfortably grainy, and there’s a smudginess to most shots that had me searching through the camera app’s settings to make sure I didn’t have a weird setting turned on. But perhaps worse than the quality of the photos themselves is just how slow and laggy the camera app is. Even in daylight, tapping the shutter can cause a painstaking couple of moments before the camera is able to focus and take a photo, and it’s even worse at night. The Fairphone 4 is the only time I’ve regretted using a review phone for vacation snaps because I regret not coming home with nicer photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JTsaEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10796861"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NlmfCY"&gt;If you’re spending money on a Fairphone 4, your money isn’t being spent on performance. It’s being spent on that five-year warranty, the promise of years of software support, and the security of knowing that, when 2026 rolls around, you’ll still be able to buy a new battery and pop it into the back of the phone without having to learn what a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2BSE%2B2020%2BBattery%2BReplacement%2F133814&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22716194%2Ffairphone-4-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pentalobe screw&lt;/a&gt; is. And, of course, you’re paying to ensure that all these parts have been made from as responsibly sourced materials as possible in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TLVrB"&gt;Whether it’s Fairtrade or organic food or sustainably produced clothing, there’s the expectation that you’ll have to pay a price premium for ethically-produced goods, and that’s exactly the case with the Fairphone 4. Although it starts at €579, its performance, especially when it comes to its cameras, is arguably closer to phones that cost less than half as much, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; (which retails for the equivalent of roughly €170) or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Moto G Play&lt;/a&gt; (around €140). And it’s not at all competitive with smartphones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt; (€539 for 128GB) or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt; (€399), which are closer in price but still cheaper than the Fairphone 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Uw1WgG"&gt;But if you’re the kind of person that can live with the budget phones listed above, if you just need a smartphone for daily use and aren’t concerned about having the best camera or most premium-feeling device, then I think you’re the kind of person who can live with the Fairphone 4. It’s a decent €200 phone that happens to be priced at €579. That’s the price of sustainability. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Mini and 13 Pro Max battery life: better, and a beast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5bN9JrrWVoGrb85ECDRZSMH3Ehw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959185/vpavic_211004_4792_0005_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13 Pro Max | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NnSuEM"&gt;I wanted to spend more time with both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; before I weighed in with a final verdict on their respective batteries. I’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;updated my full reviews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;of each&lt;/a&gt; to reflect my impressions after using them for a couple weeks, but I figured it might be helpful to lay out what I’m seeing separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TRy85"&gt;The long and the short of it is that, in both cases, the batteries exceeded my expectations. Apple really did improve on the feature that matters most to most people: these phones last longer than their predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySnwSW"&gt;It’s easy to talk about the battery life on the iPhone 13 Pro Max. It’s ridiculous. It goes and goes, lasting so long that I had to actively work to kill the thing in less than a full day by just shooting a bunch of 4K video to drain it. I think the majority of people will be able to get well into their second day of use before the battery warnings pop up. And I’m talking devil-may-care use, doing whatever you want without concern kind of use. It is, as the headline implies, a battery beast.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro Max battery lasts a very, very long time. Screen-on time can clear 10 hours." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5dadgdYndc2z3NCqOCsESrVqQwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863261/akrales_210917_4760_0331.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro Max battery lasts a very, very long time. Screen-on time can clear 10 hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4DEch"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is a more complicated story. I think that if you’re the sort of person who isn’t completely glued to their screen for much of the day, you’ll find that at the end of that day, the 13 Mini will still have some juice. That’s a definite improvement over last year’s iPhone 12 Mini, but it nevertheless still doesn’t last as long as larger phones — including both the iPhone 13 or even last year’s iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vuqH3t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 and 13 Mini review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"},{"title":"iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2Dz1cz"&gt;In my initial review of the iPhone 13 Mini, here’s what I had to say: “The iPhone 12 and 13 Minis are meant to be minimalistic both in size and also in how much you use them.” The difference this year is, instead of having to make major changes in my phone habits, I only had to make modest ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRGkit"&gt;You may have seen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQQCoJiZj8w"&gt;this excellent battery rundown test&lt;/a&gt; from Arun Maini (aka Mrwhosetheboss). Maini’s video is excellent because through the entire timelapse, you can see exactly what activities the phones are doing as they drain down, and it’s a big array of stuff. His result has the iPhone 13 Mini outlasting last year’s iPhone 12. I don’t have the two to compare directly myself, but in my daily usage of the Mini this year, my battery life hasn’t been quite that good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lmOtVr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQQCoJiZj8w?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3STxh"&gt;This is all very fuzzy, but that’s the nature of battery testing in the real world. We all use our phones differently, and so predictions are necessarily vague. But the fact that we use our phones differently is the point: the iPhone 13 Mini is a phone that I believe &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be used differently.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini’s battery life is much improved, but not so much that you can use it as much as you would use a larger phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TtyHha"&gt;As with the iPad Mini, the smaller screen here subtly influences your behavior in ways that aren’t immediately obvious. Even though it runs the exact same software as the 13 Pro Max, the iPhone 13 Mini encourages more sporadic use for shorter periods just because it’s smaller and less immersive. If you can adapt your phone usage to fit, it’s great — and definitely better than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqdIXv"&gt;The same insight applies to the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Its gigantic screen also encourages a different kind of use — specifically more of it. But because it simply can have such a huge battery inside (and perhaps because it can vary the refresh rate of the screen), those behaviors don’t affect how long it lasts as much. Physics is physics, and the battery in the 13 Pro Max is physically huge. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;So are bigger cameras&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ar2R52"&gt;What, really, do you want out of a new phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAdrAJ"&gt;Assuming you’re starting with a good foundation, I think the list of what really makes a big difference in phone upgrades is actually short. The first thing on the list is improved battery life. The second is an improved camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmuVya"&gt;Those are the two things that make a fundamental difference in your day-to-day experience of a smartphone (assuming, again, that the basics don’t stink). Those are also exactly the things Apple tried to make better in the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLmhHh"&gt;Those two improvements come on top of the major changes the company introduced last year with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;. If you already have an iPhone 12, this year’s update looks iterative because it is. If you have an older iPhone, the full list of what’s better on the iPhone 13 is almost too long to enumerate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zm6VCR"&gt;The iPhone 12 brought new technologies and a fancy new design (and a new, Mini-sized version). The iPhone 13’s battery and camera updates aren’t so flashy, but they’re more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ca6nT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on October 5th, 2021 to include results from longer-term testing with the iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jTlL1X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10764114"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13, in pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IL8t4x"&gt;iPhone 13 and 13 Mini design and specs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5SAQtt"&gt;Unless you look very closely, it’s difficult to tell the difference between the iPhone 13 devices and their predecessors. The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini introduced a striking and new flat-edged design that I still believe is a massive improvement on what came before. And of course, the iPhone 12 Mini was the first phone in a long time to bring a truly great experience to a smartphone with a smaller form factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOAz8c"&gt;They also switched over to OLED screens, which offer a superior experience to the LCDs that came before in several ways: contrast ratio, brightness, and power efficiency. They added 5G. They added the MagSafe charging system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHf9VU"&gt;It’s worth revisiting all those big changes because people are hanging on to their smartphones for a longer time now — especially iPhones. I think it’s fair to give the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini credit for the design they’re based on since so many of the people that are likely to buy them will be new to what the iPhone 12 offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fnVRC3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini keep last year’s new design, which is still beautiful and modern&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ad7gks"&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some changes to that design, however. The newer iPhones are just a tiny bit thicker overall, with substantially bigger camera bumps. That means that cases designed for the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini are unlikely to fit the newer phones. The camera bump is not only thicker, but the lenses have been rearranged to accommodate the giant new sensor that’s in the main wide-angle camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOjSnL"&gt;The last change is that the notch housing FaceID and the selfie camera has been shrunk down by 20 percent — but don’t get too excited by that. It’s only been reduced on the horizontal axis, so the extra screen you get doesn’t amount to much (and Apple isn’t using it to show more info, like battery percentage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijCuBt"&gt;There is a new processor inside the iPhone 13: the A15 Bionic. As usual with iPhones, it’s difficult to discern significant speed improvements, but that is only because there’s so much headroom that iPhones tend to feel fast for longer. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;Pro&lt;/a&gt; models get one more GPU core than the regular models, but I haven’t noticed that make a difference at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGFILf"&gt;One difference that does matter this year: the base storage on the least expensive iPhone 13 and 13 Mini has been increased to 128GB. I’m frankly impressed that Apple actually managed to proactively increase the base storage on its own — historically, it’s always done it far too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNUALy"&gt;Finally, my favorite design improvement over the iPhone 12 is that there’s a new pink color option. Of all the colors offered on the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro lines, it is the best one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhbF73GPv-Zly2J-mcpTx4bMdD8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863274/vpavic_210916_4760_0323.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UzmY4E"&gt;iPhone 13 battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DyoBG1"&gt;Battery life on last year’s iPhone 12 wasn’t quite what I had hoped for. Battery life on last year’s iPhone 12 Mini was sadly exactly what I was expecting: not very good. So for this year’s iPhone 13, Apple did the obvious thing: it made the batteries bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7i3hCp"&gt;Those larger batteries (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;9 percent on the iPhone 13 Mini and 15.1 percent on the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;) are the main driver behind Apple’s battery claims this year. It says that the regular iPhone 13 should last for a whopping two-and-a-half hours of usage longer than the iPhone 12, while the Mini will last an extra one-and-a-half hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjzzSH"&gt;Of course, if you don’t have an iPhone 12, then the 13 lasting more than two hours longer is kind of meaningless. My takeaway for the regular iPhone 13 doesn’t require relative comparisons, though: battery life is &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="D80PRl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life on the regular iPhone 13 is excellent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The best iPhone 13 color is pink." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bz6C5n_5q6wqP6YwubUJe0TiFTs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865100/vpavic_210917_4760_0702.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best iPhone 13 color is pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SZq1pC"&gt;On one day of my testing, the regular iPhone 13 made it from 7AM to midnight before it tuckered out. That was with some camera testing, watching some video, the usual doomscrolling, emails, work, and some games. It was an intense set of work for the five hours of screentime that day, so that’s impressive. On another day with lighter usage, I didn’t see the battery warning until the following morning. But the iPhone 13’s battery isn’t magic. When we had a day of a lot more 4K video testing, I was looking for a charger by 7 or 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gpsctz"&gt;As for the iPhone 13 Mini, its battery life is much improved over last year’s 12 Mini, but not quite enough for me to throw caution to the wind and recommend it to anybody who wants a smaller phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG1uGw"&gt;With last year’s 12 Mini, I had to significantly change my phone usage to get it to last through an entire day. This year, I only had to modestly change my behavior. I think that if you’re not glued to your screen for many hours a day, the 13 Mini crosses a line of battery usability the 12 Mini didn’t quite manage to even approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDdZcZ"&gt;The iPhone 12 and 13 Minis are meant to be minimalistic, both in size and also in how much you use them. If you are constantly using your phone all day, the smaller battery in the Mini isn’t likely to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUdOYU"&gt;My takeaway on the Mini is to not assume the improvements are enough to overcome the fundamental physics of smaller batteries. My takeaway on the regular iPhone 13 is also based on fundamental physics: a big battery means good battery life.TKENDNEW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q72GubsK29ZL7erXjL73Erpry6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865101/vpavic_210918_4760_0703.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mx8zAg"&gt;iPhone 13 cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="we6MM5"&gt;Both the iPhone 13 and the 13 Mini have the same camera system: a regular wide-angle camera and an ultrawide. Both have been upgraded, but the major improvement comes to the wide angle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsoUUi"&gt;Just like the battery, the improvement to the wide-angle camera sensor is simple: make it bigger. A bigger camera sensor is able to take in more light more quickly and produce better results. Apple happened to have just such a sensor lying around: the one from last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fL0gC"&gt;That’s notable because the 12 Pro Max stood apart from all the other iPhones last year by having a larger sensor, and now that sensor is the new default this year. And from the moment the 12 Pro Max was released up until now, it has been the best smartphone camera on the market for both photos and video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In bright light, it can be difficult to see the improvement over last year’s iPhone 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VjTrGuWAMFmPyScPTB9djo0A8Yo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865823/reg_IMG_349707.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In bright light, it can be difficult to see the improvement over last year’s iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fs2dYr"&gt;I am happy to report that the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini match or improve on those results. Details are sharp and accurate, colors are rich without being oversaturated, focusing is fast and reliable, portrait mode is good enough to use day to day, and low light and night sight are both exceptional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Since the 13 and 13 Mini have the best camera sensor from last year’s 13 Pro Max, night mode performance is excellent" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wK3aL7SdxtoZdNYIDKstB8elqXI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865828/reg_IMG_353019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since the 13 and 13 Mini have the best camera sensor from last year’s 13 Pro Max, night mode performance is excellent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 has good color reproduction at night, though it can tend to yellows sometimes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JM7TdrsrLJYm9dbvXOZlnwz7cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865827/reg_IMG_352918.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 has good color reproduction at night, though it can tend to yellows sometimes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vOttW3"&gt;Video quality is great. The main camera has sensor stabilization, which helps when you’re walking around. It can do all the modes that matter in terms of 4K and slow mo and handles them all super well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZvLuN"&gt;Really, the only way to be unhappy with this camera is to compare it head to head with an iPhone 13 Pro — and even then, I think you’d probably need to do it on a big screen with images taken in low light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBEaB7"&gt;The ultrawide sensor was also updated for better low-light performance, but it’s fairly minor. What I mostly see is improved white balance and color when it’s in night mode. That’s something I’ve noticed across the board, actually. Especially in low light, colors are a bit more true to life than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultrawide is much less noisy in dark photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 13 and 13 Mini have the exact same camera system" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IATdIRnXlBrQ6psXbjhzPFBu__M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865825/reg_IMG_351411.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 13 and 13 Mini have the exact same camera system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lw3g2e"&gt;My main wish is that the selfie camera sensor had been updated. It has some software improvements just like the other cameras, and it’s inside a smaller notch now, but the selfie camera is too important for Apple to just leave the same this many years in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRzGOJ"&gt;Apple has also introduced two new camera modes with the iPhone 13: Photographic Profiles and Cinematic Mode. I have gone in depth on both of those features in the iPhone 13 Pro review, so you can read the full details on how they work there. But I’ll briefly describe each here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="diFHrJ"&gt;Photographic Profiles are a new option in the camera that change the default look of the picture you’re taking. You can customize the tone and contrast of how all the pictures you take look instead of doing it in edit after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJvyOk"&gt;You may know that Samsung phones take super vivid photos or that Google Pixel phones take photos that are more contrasty and blue. With Profiles, Apple is essentially admitting that people may prefer those looks and is providing an option to get them automatically.  You can also customize each one to your own personal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EAxJoO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10764403"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14G7Xz"&gt;Profiles aren’t like filters in that they don’t apply tone and warmth settings to the whole picture. The iPhone knows when it sees grass or faces or sky, and so it adjusts how it applies those color preferences accordingly, so you don’t get weird-looking skin tones or purple skies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s27evH"&gt;Photos taken with a Profile can’t have adjustments removed or changed (beyond normal editing) after the fact, and you can’t use RAW at the same time as profiles. It’s handy sometimes to think of them as presets, and I think I will use them from time to time. Apple claims that the A15 Bionic is necessary for the whole Profiles experience to work, but my feeling is that it ought to be possible to get this feature on older iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXGPhT"&gt;Cinematic Mode is a new feature that is essentially the equivalent of Portrait Mode but for video. It locks on to a face and blurs the rest of the scene, just like if you were using a lens with a big aperture. But it then tries to change the focus as it sees fit, shifting over to a face in the background if a face in the foreground turns away, for example. As you shoot the video, you can manually change focus yourself, or you can do it after the fact in the edit — but only inside Apple’s own apps like Photos or Final Cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSqAOZ"&gt;The results from Cinematic Mode are nowhere near as good as Apple’s own commercials would have you believe. It doesn’t work well (or really, at all) in low light, and it has the same problems you may remember from the early days of Portrait Mode photos: weird cutouts around hair and glasses. It also only works in 1080p at 30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="37B8pX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10764406"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="czKzIA"&gt;But don’t let the fact that Cinematic Mode doesn’t live up to the hype distract you. The camera systems on the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini are excellent. If there wasn’t also the iPhone 13 Pro in the world, they’d be the best you could get on a phone as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4G3eE5B21Pg_Xg9awwQwwBAsnHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863273/vpavic_210916_4760_0240.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RAOPHA"&gt;I think it’s all too easy to look at the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini and not think much of the updates this year. Cameras get better every year, and every company promises good battery life, after all. And compared to the massive changes we saw on the iPhone last year, the 13 looks iterative, more like an iPhone 12S than truly new models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KV4QJn"&gt;I won’t pretend that reading is totally wrong, but I also think it misses the point. Fancy new features are fun, but the fundamentals of battery life and camera are more important. Because if you focus on the fundamentals, your whole game gets better. And the iPhone 13 has got some good game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="llBFDZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10764169"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro review: a better display, the best camera, and incredible battery life</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Smooth operators&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lVLDlO"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max are phones designed for people who care about the details. The improvements over last year’s iPhones are significant but not obvious at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYOJiC"&gt;Just as with the regular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13 and 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, the most important upgrades on the 13 Pro are to battery life and the camera system. The 13 Pro adds a third major improvement with a high refresh rate screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZy42V"&gt;Upgrading the battery, camera, and screen sounds like an iterative, yearly update; they sound like the so-called “S” updates that Apple used to do for iPhones before its naming schemes became unpredictable. And it is true that the design is virtually identical to that of last year’s iPhone 12 Pros. But those assumptions — those words — don’t quite do justice to how big the changes really are.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gMdpOS"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6BiRNN"&gt;The change that’s most likely to make the biggest impact for the most people is battery life. Apple is happy to tell you that the battery improvements come from a constellation of updates, including increased efficiency in the new A15 Bionic processor and changes to how the new display uses power. I am sure all that is true, but I’m just as sure that the biggest contributor is simply that the batteries are bigger than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDhFmY"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;13 Pro has an 11 percent larger battery, and the 13 Pro Max’s battery is an astonishing 18.5 percent larger&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s quoted improvements over the 12 Pro models are one and a half hours more usage on the 13 Pro and two and a half hours on the 13 Pro Max — and the 12 Pro Max was &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; a battery life monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Scpobu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The battery life improvement isn’t complicated; it’s a bigger battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ln2RL"&gt;I’ve only had the phones for a little less than a week, so I focused most of my use on the smaller iPhone 13 Pro as a kind of worst-case test. And my results are in line with Apple’s claims. On a day when we really pushed the phone with lots of 4K video and max brightness on the screen, it still lasted from early morning to 11PM with 20 percent remaining — with somewhere north of four hours of very heavy use in the screen time tracking app. A day with less intense usage clocked me at seven hours of screen on time before the low battery warning kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B0meV"&gt;As for the iPhone 13 Pro Max: it is a beast. I can’t seem to kill this phone off in a day without intentionally shooting a ton of 4K video. It lasts even longer than last year’s Pro Max. I normally hesitate to enthuse about battery life because people’s phone usage can vary so much, but I can confidently tell you that the 13 Pro Max will get most people well into their second day. That extra battery adds some weight, but I think it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WII3Gv"&gt;Bottom line: I have much more confidence walking out of the house for a long day without carrying an external battery pack. For me, the line a smartphone needs to cross is that I trust I can get through a normal day without battery anxiety. Both the 13 Pro and the 13 Pro Max easily get there.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RQlOiN"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro design and specs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="occrhj"&gt;Last year was a big design update for the iPhone, with flat sides, 5G, and MagSafe charging. This year’s models inherit all of that, changing the design in only minor ways. The most obvious one is the notch on the screen. It’s slightly smaller, but only horizontally — it still pushes down into what you’re looking at to the same degree. Apple also didn’t do anything with that extra space at the top, meaning you still can’t see your battery percentage without pulling down the control center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JK7xVY"&gt;The other design change is that the new iPhones are almost imperceptibly heavier and also thicker across the entire body compared to last year’s models. But the camera bumps on both phones are significantly bigger, which means that 12 Pro cases are not going to fit on the 13 Pro. I think the tradeoffs are worth it for the improved battery life and camera system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="pcyWDI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The design is virtually identical to the iPhone 12 Pro models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The smaller notch on the iPhone 13 Pro Max (left) compared to the 12 Pro Max (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l2z2yR_DeXfOX9MEg6-o6IBv9j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863283/vpavic_210916_untitled_0004.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The smaller notch on the iPhone 13 Pro Max (left) compared to the 12 Pro Max (right)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PMFKfj"&gt;Unlike many Android phones with gently curving displays at the edges, Apple does still have a small bezel around the screen. The rails on the edges are glossy stainless steel that pick up fingerprints, the glass on the back is a smooth matte. The front uses Apple’s Ceramic Shield finish to prevent cracks, and the camera lenses are sapphire. It’s a beautiful phone, and I think it’s a huge step up from the curved sides we’ve seen on iPhones from the 6 all the way up through the 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpGUZC"&gt;The important spec outside of the camera system and the screen is the new A15 Bionic processor, which is indeed fast. But as always with iPhones, the primary purpose of that speed is ensuring the phone will still feel fast in years to come, not making it seem faster than last year’s device. There are a bunch of camera features that seem to be enabled by the A15, however. I’ll also just point out that the 13 Pro models get five GPU cores to the regular 13’s four, but that extra core doesn’t seem to enable anything specific beyond more speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l76YW8"&gt;Base storage still starts at 128GB, but at the top end, there’s a new 1TB option. That is a ridiculous amount of storage for a phone, but if you’re planning on shooting a bunch of ProRes video, then it might be something to actually consider. Screen sizes and resolutions are the same: 6.1 inches at 1170 x 2532 pixels for the 13 Pro and 6.7 inches at 1284 x 2778 pixels for the 13 Pro Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hoSEK"&gt;In terms of networking, Apple is focused on expanding support for Mid-Band 5G — the kind that will actually matter more than the UWB version that’s only really available on certain street corners. All that really means is that in the US, the 13 Pro is ready for a 5G future that could come if carriers keep their promises (they haven’t so far, but maybe next year). As usual, if you travel a lot, you should keep an eye on the bands available on the &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/watch-out-with-iphone-13-there-are-now-5-different-iphone-models-by-country"&gt;several variants that are sold in different regions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OPPFI"&gt;Finally, although I know it’s a lost cause and that I sound like a broken record, I still believe that Apple should switch the iPhone from the Lightning connector to USB-C. I also still believe Apple made a mistake by not taking advantage of the obvious opportunities to do so with the big iPhone X and iPhone 12 redesigns. I understand the reasons why it hasn’t switched, and I disagree with them. Especially on a “Pro” phone, the standard cable would be incredibly convenient and useful for both charging and connecting other accessories without adapters.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8HH3XY"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XjydBk"&gt;The camera systems on the iPhone 13 Pro and the 13 Pro Max are identical this year, which means you don’t have to buy the bigger and more expensive phone to get the best photos.  And I do mean best photos because there isn’t another phone on the market that can match the iPhone 13 Pro. (Google’s upcoming Pixel 6 hasn’t been released as of writing this, of course, but it will have its work cut out for it.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQNuIQ"&gt;Apple’s marketing for the camera system on the 13 Pro is that it’s the “biggest advancement ever.” I don’t know that I would go that far, but I also can’t remember the last time I’ve said “whoa, look at this photo” as many times as I have during this review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="f6FaKN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best cameras on a smartphone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BwoSXP"&gt;I will start, however, by pointing out that this camera system is one of the things I’m referring to when I say that the 13 Pro is a phone for people who pay attention to the details. In bright sunlight or normal light, the pictures these phones take are very hard to distinguish from the iPhone 13 or even the iPhone 12. In good lighting, almost any high-end smartphone is very competent these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tB58i"&gt;Where the Pro 13 camera system shines is in low light. The main wide-angle sensor has seen a massive upgrade this year. Unlike Android phones that are chasing big megapixel counts and then “pixel binning” to achieve low light performance, Apple is sticking with 12 megapixels, the same resolution it’s used since 2015’s iPhone 6S. The sensor itself is much bigger now and features 1.9 µm pixels, which are about as big as anything we’ve seen on a smartphone. And on top of all that, the lens now has an f/1.5 aperture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9snyn"&gt;All of that adds up to a camera that can very quickly take in a massive amount of light relative to other phones. Combined with some tuning and improvements to Apple’s computational photography, the low light performance on the 13 Pro is simply second to none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 13 Pro and Pro Max have much better low light performance, but it’s not immediately obvious on smaller screens" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xNiF1qTIUPjGNK0aDdI0Hg4KaOQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864637/pro_IMG_387230.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 13 Pro and Pro Max have much better low light performance, but it’s not immediately obvious on smaller screens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Color reproduction in darker scenes is much improved compared to last year" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qELZZp--7dGKjSn1RqYv3uJ8lTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864636/pro_IMG_384027.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Color reproduction in darker scenes is much improved compared to last year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xHDLat"&gt;There’s less image noise in low light and more dynamic range in low and even medium light. Apple also tells me it has adjusted how it handles the black point, so shadow exposure is more accurate now, too — the 13 Pro is just more willing to let darks be dark while accurately exposing lighter areas. In situations the 12 Pro would aggressively hop into night mode and lighten everything up, the 13 Pro often doesn’t need night mode. And when the 13 Pro does drop into night mode, it goes through that exposure process twice as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0qEtF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10763684"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JEN10O"&gt;We used this word last year in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;12 Pro Max review&lt;/a&gt;, but I think it applies even more this year. The camera on the 13 Pro is &lt;em&gt;confident.&lt;/em&gt; As computational photography has become the norm over the past few years, I have seen lots of camera systems — including on the iPhone — just sort of panic and do the wrong things with exposure or tone. The iPhone 13 Pro has almost never done that in my testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SsHBzJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10763672"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Is8rtY"&gt;Let’s bring things back to earth. Will most people notice the quality difference between the 13 Pro and the regular iPhone 13 or even last year’s iPhones? Most of the time, I think the answer is actually no. On phone screens, you really have to zoom in and pixel peep to see it. But if there’s any place where I think it makes sense to call an iPhone “Pro” as in “for professionals,” I think this main wide angle camera is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrLtfy"&gt;The ultrawide camera also got an upgrade in terms of taking in more light, but it’s not as dramatic a difference. A more interesting upgrade is adding autofocus to that camera, which allows it to pick up a new trick: macro photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Macro mode kicks in automatically at around 10cm from a subject" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idnl0a8E2FeczI16Oy53UzoyQbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864666/pro_IMG_022307.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macro mode kicks in automatically at around 10cm from a subject&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ultrawide camera has better low light performance, but not dramatically so" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JECJG9xniss22pVNWNxDdoZ_xlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864676/pro_IMG_388931.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ultrawide camera has better low light performance, but not dramatically so&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6Bqd7"&gt;When you bring the phone in close to a subject, you can see the camera frame switch over to the ultrawide when it’s about 10cm away. It tries to keep the same basic framing with a crop, but apparently, not everybody is enthused: Apple emailed us the night before the review to say it would ship a software update later with an option to disable the automatic switchover. Then you can keep pushing in until you’re as close as 2cm away and still have an in-focus shot. The photos it takes are better than the bespoke, throwaway macro lenses on many Android phones these days. It’s a fun feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6s3uz"&gt;The wide angle camera has gotten the most impressive upgrade, but my favorite is the new telephoto lens. Apple has set it to a 3X zoom, the equivalent of a 77mm focal length and up from the 2.5X / 65mm in the 12 Pro Max. That extended zoom does mean that it drops to an f/2.8 aperture (from f/2.2), but whatever low light losses that entails are more than made up for by the addition of night mode for this lens. Apple isn’t playing the superzoom 100X game; instead, it’s focusing on quality at the 3X optical zoom for things like portrait photography. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new telephoto lens takes amazing portrait photos, but takes some effort to get good shots in low light" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ylna0kEm-Pig_PHBswqpjhrljDE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864680/pro_IMG_016205.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new telephoto lens takes amazing portrait photos, but takes some effort to get good shots in low light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lxz8xA"&gt;And that quality is incredible. I simply love taking photos of people with the telephoto at 3X now, getting a natural bokeh effect without having to engage the software portrait mode. The telephoto lens gets the award this year for most improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V3fn2f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10763698"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8hwkE4"&gt;Apple has held the crown for best smartphone video for a very long time now, challenged (but not losing) only briefly by the Samsung Galaxy Ultra series phones in the last year or two. This year, video quality is simply amazing, at least on the wide angle camera. That larger sensor and the fact that it’s using sensor-based stabilization instead of just OIS makes for stable and beautiful footage even in low light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QxNQn"&gt;Apple will also let you shoot video in ProRes this year. I didn’t have much time to test that, and ProRes isn’t really a part of our video workflow. But it’s there if you buy an iPhone that has enough storage to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFmse8"&gt;I’ll state it plainly because it bears repeating: the iPhone 13 Pro has the best camera system on any smartphone available as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographic Profiles make the iPhone take photos that look more like what Samsung and Google’s phones take&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xNMM6c"&gt;Photographic Profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TUVWr1"&gt;Apple has added two new camera modes to this year’s iPhones, both Pro and regular. Each is fascinating in its own way. Cinematic Mode is essentially Portrait Mode but for video, while Picture Profiles change the default way the iPhone takes photos. Picture Profiles are particularly interesting because they serve almost as an admission that Apple is feeling competitive pressure from the likes of Samsung and Google, so let’s start there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5cJno"&gt;Profiles are a new setting in the camera app that change the way your photos look by default. So instead of applying a filter after the photo is taken, you can set your iPhone to have a specific kind of “look” right away. In fact, Apple insists that Profiles are not filters at all, for reasons I’ll get into shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1v5ctq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10764311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dad4CO"&gt;The default options for Profiles include Standard, Rich Contrast, Vibrant, Warm, and Cool. Each one has its own little sliders that you can manually tweak for both Tone and Warmth. If you tweak those sliders, the name of that profile cleverly changes to match your settings (my personal favorite name is “Rich Cool,” because I imagine that’s Apple’s target demographic). When you set one of these profiles, it becomes the new default way the camera takes pictures, though it will also pop up a button that lets you toggle it off. (The button is also clever, the way it looks changes based on what profile you’ve set). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlWvlf"&gt;The TL;DR for Profiles is that “Rich Contrast” makes the iPhone’s photos look more like a Google Pixel, with bluer tones and deeper contrast. And “Vibrant” makes the iPhone look more like a Samsung phone, with more extreme colors all around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WbYvA"&gt;Historically, Apple has insisted that what it aims for in photography is the “truth” of what your eye would see. I will (regretfully) set aside philosophical questions about the nature of objective reality and what a photograph is and instead just point out that it’s fair to say that when it comes to photography, Apple is much less opinionated than the competition. Samsung and Google are both more willing to tune their images to be more pleasing to their customers than Apple is. With Profiles, Apple is essentially giving its customers the option to get pictures they like better without having to edit them after the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographic Profiles on iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="usyFdq"&gt;Understanding how Profiles actually works is a little complicated. Apple’s computational photography process is called Smart HDR, and what it does is standard across many phones these days: it takes a bunch of photos at different exposures all at once and then combines them into a single, final image. Part of that process involves making choices about white balance, color, contrast, and so on. Another part of that process is the iPhone semantically recognizing different things in the scene — things like faces, people, grass, sky, cats, or whatever and exposing them differently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qspoht"&gt;When you set a profile, the iPhone makes different choices during the Smart HDR capture about white balance, color, contrast, and so on based on the preference you set. It also uses that semantic recognition to make better choices for things like skin tone. That’s why it’s not a filter — it’s not applied evenly across the entire image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye3iOb"&gt;Profiles are not something you can undo in the edit — though Apple does label them in the metadata when you view them in the Photos app. You should also know that you can’t shoot with profiles and have RAW output on at the same time. Unlike a RAW photo where you can make all sorts of choices in the edit, Photographic Profiles lock your choices in to the file as it’s saved. In theory, it might be possible for the iPhone to save all of that extra data, but Apple tells us that it would create huge files that it wouldn’t be worth it for ordinary use and that people who do want to edit after the fact can just shoot RAW.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pxIe2Z"&gt;Cinematic Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HkyZIA"&gt;Apple’s flashiest iPhone ads are for Cinematic Mode. It’s an entirely new mode for iPhone video that uses software to blur the background of a video, much as Portrait Mode does for photos. Unlike Portrait Mode, Cinematic doesn’t take advantage of the iPhone 13 Pro’s LIDAR sensor for creating a depth map — it just uses software to recognize human faces and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5BFX5"&gt;The reason Cinematic mode makes for such a great demo is that it can automatically shift the focus when something happens in the scene. It locks on to the biggest face that it sees, but if that face turns away, the iPhone can automatically shift focus to somebody else in the background. It is fun to play around with and works with both the rear and front-facing Selfie cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Es4aQ"&gt;You can also change the focus point as you’re shooting by tapping something in the background and lock focus by tapping again. And then, after you’re done shooting, you can change your focus decisions moment-to-moment in the Photos app and even change the amount of background blur for the entire video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cinematic Mode is limited to 1080p and doesn’t work in low light, despite what Apple’s ads show" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ANjnyRUm4phHT-0w1eXsBHm6Cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864316/cinematic.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cinematic Mode is limited to 1080p and doesn’t work in low light, despite what Apple’s ads show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tY3mZT"&gt;Because it’s the equivalent of Portrait Mode for video, it can have the same problems as Portrait Mode for photos — it rarely works in low light, for example. (Apple’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/apple/status/1438955425265696775?s=21"&gt;own ads for Cinematic Mode show it working in low light&lt;/a&gt;, which I find misleading.) It can also have weird or bad cutouts around hair, which is a little less noticeable because it’s video, but it’s still there. Finally, Cinematic Mode &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works in 1080p at 30FPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9nPrp"&gt;Cinematic Mode really only works well within Apple’s own ecosystem of apps. The depth map information is saved into an ancillary “sidecar” file that goes alongside the video, but only Apple apps like Photos or Final Cut can do anything with it right now. If you AirDrop it to a Mac that isn’t running macOS Monterey, the iPhone will bake all your depth choices into the file before sending it along. Apple tells us that it hasn’t worked with third-party companies like Adobe or Lumafusion to make that data editable in those apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPU6ht"&gt;I think Cinematic Mode is crazy fun, but I’m not sure how much value it really adds to people who want to use their iPhone for actual, professional video work. I’m not going to say it’s a gimmick, but it is gimmick-adjacent. Like Portrait Mode in photos was at the beginning, Cinematic Mode feels like it’s a few years away from being truly useful for anything beyond casual use. Despite Apple’s promos, I have a hard time believing real movies will be made with this in its present state.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LTPO displays on the 13 Pros have high refresh rates — finally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5NYQWg"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max displays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="T0cjec"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max finally offer iPhone users a screen feature that flagship Android phones have had for quite a long time: higher refresh rates. Apple’s branding for its screen is “Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion,” and the important part is the ProMotion, which previously has only been on the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCwRPY"&gt;Historically, the iPhone has been able to refresh its screen at 60Hz (or 60 times every second), but the new iPhone 13 Pros can vary the refresh rates from as little as 10Hz all the way up to 120Hz. Apple is using a type of OLED display called LTPO (&lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/666267/what-an-ltpo-display/"&gt;Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide&lt;/a&gt;) panel, technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;first seen on Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt;. It has a wide dynamic range, can get much brighter, and also uses less power because it can ratchet down the refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcoWDq"&gt;What all this means practically is that scrolling and animations look much smoother. It also has battery life benefits because if nothing’s moving on the screen, the screen needs to refresh less often and therefore uses less power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Ni8VQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple waited too long to introduce high refresh rate displays on its Pro phones, but it has implemented them well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T22XNY"&gt;None of this is news to Android users, but if you haven’t used a high refresh rate display on a phone before, it can be a little hard to explain why it makes a difference. This is doubly true on iPhones because Apple has gotten away with not putting a high refresh rate screen on an iPhone for so long because iOS is itself a very smooth OS without very much jank in its animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7on6Wr"&gt;When I scroll on the iPhone 13 Pro, the text stays readable instead of turning into a blur. Things moving on the screen are smoother. It feels more like a direct interaction with my finger because the iPhone can literally change its refresh rate to match my movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv2at6"&gt;Apple’s implementation is also smart: iOS keeps an eye on what activity is happening on the screen and adjusts the refresh rate to match. So the screen matches the 24FPS frame rate in video apps, for example. Apple tells me apps coded with its default tools like Swift will get these benefits for free and that developers will have access to tools to update their apps to support ProMotion if they like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ved8rg"&gt;I get if all this sounds very silly. It is very much a premium feature that is more about experience than anything practical. That’s exactly what ProMotion is, and it is exactly what I think we should expect from a phone that costs more than a thousand dollars. It was a similar story when Apple’s own high-density Retina Displays hit the scene. Once many people experienced the nicer thing, they were bothered by its lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59ronC"&gt;I have heard all the speculation about why Apple waited this long to implement this feature, and I don’t really buy any of them. I admit that high refresh rates are the epitome of “nice to have,” but part of the point of Apple’s extravagant Pro phones is to provide the nicest experience. Now, finally, they do. Crucially, Apple did an excellent job with its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro (left) and Pro Max (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ekFDxMXU0-GMcxYU4CYwEStQFpE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863288/vpavic_210916_untitled_0058.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qLs5Lq"&gt;The ProMotion display is the perfect example of what you get with the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max. It’s an improvement that may only matter explicitly to a few but will subtly make life nicer for everybody who uses it. The battery life upgrade isn’t quite so subtle, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4679X"&gt;As for the camera, I can see it both ways. When you’re sharing photos and videos to social media and looking at them on a phone, the differences &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; subtle at most — but they’re there if you look for them. And if you use your iPhone’s camera for more than just Instagram, you’ll appreciate the updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nf4R3E"&gt;The list of significant things I have to complain about with these phones is almost astonishingly short. (Though, as you might expect, I can quibble for days about little things like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;lack of a meaningful MagSafe ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, the lightning port, or how iOS 15 handles notifications). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ven5Ti"&gt;The story of the iPhone 13 Pro is a story of iteration, sure, but iteration &lt;em&gt;matters&lt;/em&gt;. iPhone 12 Pro owners will have to pay a lot of attention to see some of the differences, and an upgrade probably doesn’t make a lot of sense. But if you’re using something older, all that iteration comes on top of the major improvements from the iPhone 12 Pro — the upgrades will be very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tk2gK9"&gt;Either way, when you start to pay attention to the details, prepare to be impressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hi9GQZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10764169"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ar0Xom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 review: nearly normal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;As good as foldables get, but is that good enough?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xQB9CN"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the best possible case Samsung can make for a phone that unfolds into a small tablet. It’s the fourth iteration of the same basic idea, refined and repaired over the course of years following an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;embarrassing false-start failure&lt;/a&gt; on the first attempt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZNUhk"&gt;Because this is a story of refinement, the changes since the last model are minor. But added together, they make this the model that crosses that hard-to-define boundary between experimental and normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNu5wD"&gt;Although the Z Fold 3 feels like a refined, established product, it’s still not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; normal. It’s a marvel of material science that’s by turns wonderful and awkward. And its price is also still far from normal, too — even after a price drop, it starts a $1,799.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RcEeL"&gt;If you like the basic idea of the Z Fold but have been waiting for Samsung to fix its biggest issues, the steady and relentless refinement on display here is worth a look. If you think the whole idea is an extravagant and silly technical flex, none of these changes will change your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mc8Pwg"&gt;Even though those two opinions are almost diametrically opposed, I can’t really argue with either one. The Z Fold 3 is great &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YeDdPp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10715493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RRb1pC"&gt;When closed, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is still an extremely tall, narrow, and thick slab of a device that’s more akin to a remote control than a traditional phone. It’s awkward to fit into a pocket both because of its shape and its weight — although it’s slightly lighter than last year, fundamentally it’s still the size of two phones and it has the weight to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EvLSb"&gt;Samsung’s big addition to the hardware is IPX8 water resistance. I’ve dunked it in a vase and held it under a fountain without issue. I won’t speak to whether the durability improvements Samsung made this year will be enough to keep the phone intact long term, but at least initially it seems solid. I don’t feel like I need to baby this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVp6H0sYuZFLx34hLpwM1Vyynb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801025/dbohn_210820_4722_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There is still a gap between the two sides when closed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_SOyXM4kUAnemSG1_v1jplj080=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801028/dbohn_210820_4722_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is still a gap between the two sides when closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rzq5s"&gt;There’s still a gap at the hinge when it’s closed, but otherwise all the tolerances between the parts are tight. Samsung is still using tiny brushes inside the hinge to keep dust and debris out, but I’d still recommend keeping it away from any serious amount of grit or sand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRRJOd"&gt;The outer screen fills out the entire front of the display, and though it’s 6.2 inches diagonally, it feels much smaller because it’s so narrow. Samsung increased the refresh rate on the exterior display to 120Hz, so everything on it feels smooth; the main compromise when using it is that it’s just really hard to type on. Swipe-typing helps, but Samsung’s built-in keyboard still isn’t as good as Gboard at accuracy, and you’ll want to stick with Samsung’s keyboard since it has better options when in tablet mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtczAF"&gt;Open the phone up and you’re treated to the 7.6-inch display, which is bright, sharp, and has the same 120Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling with less of the “jelly effect” that plagued the earlier versions. It’s a great screen with one glaring problem: the interior selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i0qPO"&gt;Samsung opted for an under-display camera, one of the first to ship in the US. The camera itself is terrible, only 4 megapixels, and even those few are compromised by taking in light through a screen. Camera quality isn’t the problem, though — if I want to take a selfie, there are literally four other cameras I can use that are better. Think of it as a webcam for video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The under display selfie camera is more distracting and annoying than a hole punch." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jpVMUPRs-KkHsfU8l84P89IXTbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801091/dbohn_210820_4722_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The under-display selfie camera is more distracting and annoying than a hole punch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="btt3K1"&gt;Instead, the problem is how the screen looks when the camera is off. When there’s a brighter background over it — or text — it has a screen-door look that is both ugly and distracting. If I shift my head or the phone even a little, there’s a moire effect that instantly draws my eye — even after a week of use it’s still happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ehtMo"&gt;Samsung wants the Z Fold 3 to be a showcase of its technical prowess, but that desire has led it into putting a too-experimental feature on a premium device. The under-display camera literally mars the experience. Samsung needs to put a setting in to turn the screen over the camera off entirely and just revert this thing back to a hole punch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWYJuY"&gt;Surprisingly, that is my only real complaint about the interior screen. Which is saying something since it’s a giant, 7.6-inch display that folds in half. Samsung put a lot of emphasis on how it has made this screen stronger, thanks to how it re-layered the different internal components from the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The crease is still visible at an angle but not bothersome at all when you look straight on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aUwlAY86Tg80SJk418z7sH0zdOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801031/dbohn_210820_4722_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The crease is still visible at an angle but not bothersome at all when you look straight on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S Pen won’t work on the outer screen, but works fine on the main interior screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nVm5rOXMbsDkIDPjcicXaK2GEAc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801032/dbohn_210820_4722_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S Pen won’t work on the outer screen but works fine on the main interior screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T1mpI0"&gt;It still uses Samsung’s so-called “Ultra Thin Glass,” but that glass is still covered with layers of plastic. The top layer is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate"&gt;PET&lt;/a&gt; screen protector which feels much more like any other screen protector you’ve used on a phone. It radically changes the experience of the Z Fold 3 as it’s a lot more resistant to smudges and indentations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sz1Nxq"&gt;There is still a crease between the two halves, and I still am not too bothered by it. It’s mostly visible at an angle and largely goes away when you’re looking at the phone straight on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPPaLU"&gt;The other new layer on this screen is made up of a couple of Wacom digitizers so you can use a new kind of Samsung S Pen stylus with it. The Fold-specific S Pen is sold separately, and there’s no place to store it without a special case, which means you’ll be spending upward of $50 or even $80 more if you want to use stylus input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6Mkc0"&gt;Drawing and sketching with the S Pen on the large screen is nice — there’s not much lag, it seems accurate even across the crease (where algorithms detect position), and it glides cleanly across that new PET layer. Unfortunately, the Fold wobbles when you draw on a table, even with one of Samsung’s own cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcVgl6"&gt;You also can’t use the stylus on the outer display, which means it’s not as good at taking quick notes as the Galaxy Note. Hopefully Samsung won’t discontinue that line for people who really do depend on having quick and easy access to a stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Flex mode on the Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EAbQ9OfiFbggbG3dJGiF8tNPks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801034/dbohn_210820_4722_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flex mode on the Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="A8ga7P"&gt;Samsung has also refined the software that runs the Z Fold 3. Shockingly, One UI 3 has made the Android tablet experience halfway decent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch474o"&gt;That is a strange thing to type as I (and every reviewer I know) have been ragging on Android tablets for nearly a decade. But the subtle improvements Samsung made this year wrangle Android’s biggest tablet problems into flexible, usable little windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SN3N5i"&gt;Too many Android apps don’t re-form themselves to work better on tablet-size screens; they’re just stretched-out phone apps. That’s still the case this year, but some basics like getting multiple columns in Gmail or tabs in a browser work. Others, like Twitter or Slack, still look a little dopey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mbpn3W"&gt;However, Samsung’s multitasking system for windowing and managing apps has become adept at putting those recalcitrant apps in their place. You can drag and drop icons from a sidebar to put things into split screen or into a three-up layout. You can even pin that sidebar to be permanently visible for an even more tablet-like experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="SKr6Zb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Against all reason, Android on a tablet is good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The multitasking software on the Z Fold 3 is much more flexible than before." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S79WEKoUZ0TCUgJpSBFyqUC_56g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801132/Screenshot_20210823_123216_Twitter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The multitasking software on the Z Fold 3 is much more flexible than before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JDRRO3"&gt;Critically, you can more easily adjust the width and height of those various layouts now by simply dragging the dividers around. You can also tap those dividers to easily rearrange the various windows if you don’t want to deal with dragging them around. Saving those custom layouts to the sidebar is simple, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3aQ9C"&gt;Finally, there’s a “labs” feature that lets you strong-arm apps into playing nice with this new system if they haven’t been updated to resize properly on a modern Android device. You can set Instagram to fill the entire screen, for example, or resize TikTok into a little distracting-as-hell side rail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ht1jhh"&gt;Let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though. The iPadOS ecosystem of apps is still light-years ahead of Android when it comes to tablet options. But Samsung and Google have finally managed to push the Android tablet experience to the point where I am comfortable doing more advanced things than I can on a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXBhPn"&gt;But really, the thing about the big screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is that it is a &lt;em&gt;big screen&lt;/em&gt;. Big screens are great. They’re nicer for watching movies, playing games, reading books, and everything else. All the things that people like about outsized slabs like Samsung’s Ultra line or Apple’s Max phones are even better on this big screen. Hell: I can actually read and annotate PDFs on this device without having to tediously pan, pinch, and scroll around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zGMPW"&gt;It helps that the Z Fold 3 is excellent from a performance perspective. The Snapdragon 888 processor and 12GB of RAM keep up with multiple active windows at once. The 4,400mAh battery, however, isn’t quite what I would hope for in terms of longevity. I can get through a full day with four-ish hours of screentime, but getting more than that would require changing my usage in a way I wouldn’t want to. We’re used to tablets lasting forever, but this folding tablet is more akin to your average phone when it comes to battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f5OtsQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10715575"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fPBXJ4"&gt;The cameras are also more akin to what you’ll get on an average phone, not a flagship. The main selfie camera on the outside is 10MP and it’s perfectly serviceable. On the rear, you’ve got three 12-megapixel sensors for wide, ultrawide, and 2X telephoto. The only real change Samsung made since last year was adding optical image stabilization to the telephoto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zvu9kF"&gt;The results are classic Samsung: punchy, bright, sharp, and vivid — too often to a fault. Samsung tunes its camera to look great on Samsung screens, not to be true to what your eye might see in the moment. It’s a choice I don’t love, but at least on a technical level the images are good enough to work with. Similarly, the Z Fold 3 does a passable job with night photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JND4qs"&gt;For $1,800 I’d like something better, but that money is going toward the screen, the waterproofing, and all the rest. If camera quality is your top priority, this isn’t the phone for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="21V3bb"&gt;Samsung’s big goal for its folding phones this year is to make them “mainstream.” For the Z Flip 3, Samsung hopes it can become a premium alternative for people who would otherwise buy a “normal” phone. For the Z Fold 3, the goal is to creating an entirely new class of flagship that its competitors can’t match. In both cases, Samsung’s putting all this effort in because its more traditional flagship phones are plummeting in popularity as Xiaomi and others undercut it on price while matching quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JKNd6"&gt;Samsung’s goals aren’t our problem, but they do lead to a benefit: folding phones that we can simply judge on their merits instead of simply gawking at tech demos. They’re still too spendy in my opinion, but I wouldn’t second-guess anybody who decides to spring for one of them. You know how you’ll be using your phone and at some point you have to walk over to your laptop to actually get something done? With the Z Fold 3, it takes me longer to get to that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5K2FRk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As good as it gets, but that might not be good enough&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3pxu3"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is as good as it gets when it comes to a phone that unfolds into a tablet. Until there’s another technological breakthrough that can change the flexibility of glass or the size of batteries, I don’t see anything fundamentally better than this coming along for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4gd00n"&gt;However, it’s still an awkward thing to carry around and use one-handed, and it’s still super expensive. The tradeoffs just don’t seem worth it. Then again, once upon a time we all said the same thing about the tradeoffs for big-screened phones like the Note. For a small sliver of tech-savvy people who know what they’re getting into, I could actually recommend the Z Fold 3. But for most people, as good as it gets is still not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
