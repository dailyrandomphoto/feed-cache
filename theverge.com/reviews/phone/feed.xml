    <title>Xiaomi Mi 11 review: undercutting Samsung</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A great deal if you can get it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="xOHYgJ"&gt;Who is Samsung’s biggest mobile competitor? The first name that comes to mind is Apple, of course. But most people aren’t really in the habit of switching back and forth between iOS and Android with each phone purchase. So who is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7rtoAT"&gt;Samsung is consistently ranked as the biggest phone maker in the world. Huawei is usually number two, largely because of its sales in China where Samsung is a nonentity. And number three right now is Xiaomi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RmTVP"&gt;The reason I bring this up is because Xiaomi’s latest flagship phone, the Mi 11, is not only extremely good in its own right but a phone that arguably outflanks Samsung’s latest lineup. It costs less than the $799 Galaxy S21 in markets where it’s sold, but in many ways, it has more in common with the $1,199 S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtftQU"&gt;The Mi 11 would be a strong competitor to any S21 phone if you saw the two next to each other in a US carrier store. The only problem is you won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zA1dnA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10371499"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UB9Pg7"&gt;The Mi 11 isn’t particularly exciting to look at, but it’s well-built and solidly designed. It follows Xiaomi’s usual glass sandwich blueprint, with a frosted glass back panel and an iridescent but fairly understated gradient finish. The biggest visual flourish is the squircle-shaped camera bump, which features three distinct layers stepping up to the large primary lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWCLX6"&gt;With a 6.8-inch screen, this is not going to be a phone for people who prefer smaller devices, but it manages to feel relatively svelte all the same. The slight chin below the display is very thin, and the screen curves gently on the sides. At 8.1mm thick and weighing 196 grams, it’s noticeably thinner and a little lighter than last year’s Mi 10, with a slightly smaller (but still big) 4,600mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zSAt51"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Mi 11 more than passes the “feels like a flagship” test&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="klqqBv"&gt;That may well have something to do with its Snapdragon 888 processor, which is Qualcomm’s high-end chip for 2021; unlike last year’s 865, the 5G modem is integrated directly into the SoC, saving space and power. My Mi 11 review unit pairs the 888 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, though more expensive models have options for 12GB and 256GB, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dB5wnF"&gt;In use, the Mi 11 more than passes the “feels like a flagship” test. As expected based on the spec sheet, it’s as fast and responsive as any Android phone on the market. There’s a strong haptics system, and the Harman Kardon-branded stereo speakers sound good, though I’m not sure they have anything in common with my long-serving &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.harmankardon.com%2Fcomputer-speakers%2FSOUNDSTICKS%2BIII.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310843%2Fxiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SoundSticks&lt;/a&gt;. Xiaomi’s MIUI 12 software is based on Android 11, and it’s far more streamlined than earlier iterations; Xiaomi has come a long way with its software design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUBxP9"&gt;Battery life is strong: I got almost exactly five hours of screen time on one recent day of testing, and more than three of those hours involved using the phone to take photos and videos in bright, direct sunlight, all with the screen at its maximum 120Hz and 1440p settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DeWrvI4ucX_V5eUV_uZc2ZKJynk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341980/DSCF7528.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mi 11 has a nearly identical screen to the Samsung S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LqkdLs"&gt;That brings me to the display. If the Mi 11’s screen isn’t identical to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;much-vaunted OLED panel found in Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, it’s extremely similar. Both are 6.8-inch curved LTPO OLED panels with a 120Hz refresh rate, a 3200 x 1440 resolution, and a maximum brightness of 1,500 nits. What matters is that the Mi 11’s display is extremely good, which it is. It’s sharp and smooth, with excellent contrast and color reproduction, and the extra brightness is noticeable on sunny days. I know not everyone is a fan of curved screen edges, but these are about as subtle as it gets, and I didn’t have any issues with visual distortion or accidental touch input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzYiIO"&gt;My only complaint about the screen is a weird one: the corners are cut at a more dramatic angle than the edges of the phone itself, resulting in a bezel that intrudes more than it probably should. I’m not sure why Xiaomi designed the phone this way — the otherwise similar Mi 10 didn’t do this — but the effect is quite odd. Still, it’s not something I’ve really noticed since I first started using the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzcVNm"&gt;I’ll also add that the optical in-display fingerprint sensor in the Mi 11 is sometimes noticeably slower than what I tend to see in phones from competitors like Vivo and Oppo. It’s rarely inaccurate, but the half-second it normally takes to recognize my fingerprint can sometimes feel closer to a second, and those split-second delays do add up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nWq4WFe31gkIXYDVt8ncUjLqy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341984/DSCF7532.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mi 11’s main camera uses the same sensor as last year’s Mi 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tc8QRC"&gt;One area where Xiaomi seems to have saved money on the Mi 11 is its camera system. The primary sensor is the same 108-megapixel Samsung ISOCELL Bright HMX from the Mi 10, which Xiaomi says it co-developed with Samsung’s component division. It’s backed up by a 13-megapixel ultrawide and a 5-megapixel “telemacro,” meaning there’s no real telephoto capability unless you want to get really close to your subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNI7Ku"&gt;Despite the pedestrian hardware, I’m generally happy with how the Mi 11 cameras perform, particularly considering its price. Detail and dynamic range are strong in good light, with fairly neutral color rendition, and low-light performance also holds up well. The biggest weakness is dim lighting situations that fall between those two extremes, which can get noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ficAVj"&gt;The large, high-resolution sensor has its benefits, but there are clear drawbacks. You might value the fact that it offers shallower depth of field (without a portrait mode) than most other phones, for example, but you’ll also have to deal with occasionally busy bokeh or areas of the scene that appear unexpectedly out of focus. And while the 108-megapixel sensor can render a lot of detail, it’s absolutely not a substitute for a telephoto lens; pictures taken at even 2x digital zoom exhibit a lot of artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_L4ar3mORQuysQYWY4S8GG1vRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344505/IMG_20210211_175537.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sBdMuwrBwGQUfQVI7ynl3GArIjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344506/IMG_20210211_143734.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/20NxvunWA-68-_5gwgrJ2Ueekrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344507/IMG_20210221_124336_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8TfqCDHzhc5TUD_9rf68OAX8TsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344508/IMG_20210206_173725.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RDkFET"&gt;I wouldn’t normally even mention the macro lens, which is often a useless 2-megapixel sensor thrown at a phone just so the maker can claim a triple- or quad-camera system, but the Mi 11’s 5-megapixel 50mm-equivalent unit is a little better than most. It actually autofocuses, for one thing, which makes it much easier to capture what you’re trying to see close up. I still don’t feel the need for an extreme macro lens on my phone, but I was at least able to use it to check out the tiny &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;PlayStation icons texture on my PS5 controller&lt;/a&gt;. So there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0ZLtc"&gt;Overall, the Mi 11 camera system is more than fit for purpose, but it’s also perhaps the only thing about this phone that doesn’t go toe-to-toe with more expensive flagships. The lack of a telephoto lens hurts it, and the last-gen image sensor has its quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jAC2nqt2b4m5gwbic4vBnEiUlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341985/DSCF7534.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fit and finish of the Mi 11 are comparable to any premium phone you might find.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lB1wvq"&gt;My biggest takeaway from the Mi 11 is that Samsung is lucky Xiaomi doesn’t sell phones in the US. The Galaxy S21 starts at a full 100 euros more than the €749 Mi 11, despite having a smaller, lower-resolution screen and a plastic back. The same goes for the S21 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYqkqI"&gt;The €1,249 S21 Ultra is where the comparison gets interesting. Samsung’s highest-end phone is far more expensive, but Xiaomi matches or beats it spec-for-spec except on the battery and the camera. The S21 might be the better all-around phone for people who can afford it, but if I lived in Europe, I know which one I’d consider to be a better value for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZmGHw"&gt;That’s the rub, though. At this point, Europe is one of the few places where Xiaomi and Samsung actually compete with one another at the high end. Until that changes, flagship Android phone buyers in the US won’t have much reason to consider Xiaomi part of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KVnynN"&gt;The Mi 11 isn’t a phone so spectacular that I would urge you to jump through import hoops in order to acquire one. It’s just a very good phone that will be an extremely compelling option in any market where it’s sold. If you happen to live in one of them, it has my strong recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola Moto G Stylus (2021) review: the write stuff</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Your best bet for a budget phone with a stylus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eyIWAy"&gt;Calling the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-moto-g-stylus-gen-2%2Fp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311690%2Fmotorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 Motorola Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt; the best budget stylus phone feels a bit like a backhanded compliment. There’s more or less just one other contender for that title, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301223/lg-stylo-6-review"&gt;the LG Stylo 6&lt;/a&gt;, which is too underpowered to recommend. But the G Stylus doesn’t just win by default; it’s actually a well-rounded and capable phone for under $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrJn6O"&gt;It offers a big 6.8-inch 1080p screen, a generous 128GB of built-in storage, and a Snapdragon 678 processor with 4GB of RAM. Motorola &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218732/motorola-moto-g-stylus-power-play-2021-one-5g-ace-specs-price-release-date-budget"&gt;introduced it earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; with a $299 MSRP, though it’s now selling for $279 from the manufacturer and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERktRf"&gt;Other highlights include a 48-megapixel main camera accompanied by ultrawide and macro rear cameras, a 4,000mAh battery, a “water-repellant” design, and a fingerprint sensor embedded in the recessed power button. It’s a well-rounded set of features for a budget device, even without considering the G Stylus’ headline feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1CMXfG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10372411"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xMwyscYsaBk45_Mxu3BlvMy9hSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336738/ajohnson_210228_4453_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G Stylus includes apps for note-taking, doodling, and coloring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A24AIo"&gt;Moto G Stylus (2021) stylus features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Jio0dS"&gt;The main selling point is definitely the G Stylus’ stylus, so let’s cover that first. Like the Stylo 6, the G Stylus includes a built-in capacitive stylus tucked into the bottom-right corner of the device. Popping it out brings up a quick menu of shortcuts to stylus-friendly apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twmfhO"&gt;There’s a note-taking app and a shortcut to take and annotate a screenshot. You can also jot down a quick note without unlocking the screen. It’s a basic set of features — nothing too advanced like what the Galaxy Note series offers — but with a couple of neat bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GbZ0AIeUWlcJoEYrQ0CqKKtx11s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343035/Screenshot_20210301_163539_resized.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With AI, the phone can recognize what you’re trying to draw and turn it into a coloring book template.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i26b5z"&gt;First, messaging apps support handwriting-to-text conversion. This is a Gboard setting you can enable on any Android device, but it’s available by default on the G Stylus. Pressing the “globe” icon to the left of the spacebar opens up the handwriting panel. Write your message, and watch it appear in the text line above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEE9d9"&gt;The Moto G Stylus’ other trick is the ability to create cinemagraphs, still images with a moving element. To create one, you’ll basically take a short video clip, holding the camera still. Then you use the stylus to draw on the areas of the scene with motion. The rest will remain frozen as a still image. You don’t necessarily need a stylus for this, but the added precision is helpful. Results can be saved as an MP4 or a GIF. The app does a decent job of stabilizing a handheld image for a more convincing final product, though the resulting clip is fairly low-res. Still, it’s fun to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2wzF4"&gt;While the LG Stylo 6’s stylus features felt a little more fun and creativity-focused, the Moto G is a little more no-nonsense. Sure, there’s a coloring book app that does a neat trick of using AI to identify a rudimentary sketch of a cat and turn it into a template for your digital “crayons.” But where’s the animated GIF creator? Or an app that records as you sketch so you can text your friends and show off your mad doodling skills? These things exist in third-party apps, no doubt. But the native feature set feels, for better or worse, a little more grown-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jy_YBGfEcsjz-eNJ2sdY4-5mBxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336740/ajohnson_210228_4453_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Stylus features a big 6.8-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NH82aJ"&gt;Moto G Stylus (2021) screen and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nyPqnf"&gt;The Stylus’ screen is nothing fancy — standard 60Hz refresh rate LCD — but it’s a decently bright and large 6.8-inch 1080p display. The phone itself is, naturally, also large and on the heavier side, but the slightly rounded edges of its back panel make it more comfortable to hold than its dimensions suggest. It looks a little ridiculous peeking out of the top of a yoga pants pocket, but this stylus-packing device was never meant to be ultra pocketable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GsK6T"&gt;The G Stylus uses a Snapdragon 678 processor with 4GB of RAM, and this combination feels more than adequate for day-to-day tasks. Apps load quickly, and jumping between them feels snappy. There are some occasional hiccups and slight slowdowns when scrolling through media-rich apps like Twitter, but nothing that feels too frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y8eANu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I had no problem getting through a full day with plenty of battery life left to spare&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="spyXqe"&gt;Battery life is also good — not outstanding but thoroughly sufficient. Motorola claims the Stylus will get two days to a single charge, which feels like a little bit of a stretch in my experience. More importantly, I had no problem getting through a full day, including two-plus hours of screen time, with plenty of battery life left to spare. Motorola includes a 10W charger, which it calls “Turbo Power” when it’s connected. Charging speeds are more average than “Turbo”: 10 minutes of charge got me an extra 10 percent, and it took about 40 minutes total to bring an 80 percent battery up to full charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3Sirp"&gt;The Moto G Stylus ships with Android 10 and is expected to get an update to Android 11. Motorola doesn’t say exactly when, but G Stylus owners can keep an eye on the &lt;a href="https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/software-upgrade/g_id/1949"&gt;company’s software update page&lt;/a&gt; for more information. Motorola’s budget device support isn’t great; the phone will get just two years of security updates, ending in January 2023. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; that even its budget A-series Galaxy phones will now be guaranteed four years of security updates. Hopefully, that’s a policy more manufacturers like Motorola will consider adopting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F3eiDKGk5p3t3cGZ7uL5br-M_hs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336741/ajohnson_210228_4453_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylus includes standard wide, ultrawide, and macro rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DkYomP"&gt;Moto G Stylus (2021) camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dk909J"&gt;The triple camera on the G Stylus is the same found on the $400-ish &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22255202/motorola-one-5g-ace-review"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace&lt;/a&gt;, with the addition of a dedicated depth sensor. To recap, that includes a 48-megapixel f/1.7 main camera that produces 12-megapixel images, an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DV5N2C"&gt;There are no surprises here. Like the Ace, the G Stylus is capable of good-quality images in bright light, particularly from the main camera. Downsampling from 48 megapixels to 12 allows it to capture plenty of detail, but if you look close, you’ll see some crunchy-looking sharpening. Colors are reproduced well, without looking overly saturated. As an exception, the camera seems to boost saturation and warmth when it identifies a subject as food. The results are more appetizing, if a little unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y0nxv7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10372367"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NNoFvO"&gt;Unfortunately, the ultrawide camera is less good. Even photos taken in bright light show smeary details and some ugly noise. A photo I took of a city street has an unusual purple tint, while a photo from the main camera in the same spot looks much better. This is all evident even at smaller image sizes for social sharing, which is unfortunate. The macro camera is bad, but the selfie camera is a little sharper and better than expected from a budget phone. Win some, lose some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iP1sSz"&gt;While the camera system on the Ace was a bit of a letdown, it feels about right on the less expensive Moto G Stylus. You won’t find an amazing night mode or top-notch picture quality here, but for a sub-$300 phone, it does the job just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0JIEeXAt6iw_y6wEeLjcPgr3duc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336739/ajohnson_210228_4453_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G Stylus is a well-rounded budget device, even if you don’t care about its pen-focused features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qbxBxO"&gt;The Moto G Stylus is a well-rounded budget phone that also happens to have a stylus. Of Motorola’s 2021 budget devices that I’ve tested so far, this one offers the best balance of features and cost-saving measures. It has a big display, stylus features, good battery life, and solid everyday performance. The cameras, though flawed, are good enough to get by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NvcBBw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the obvious choice for someone looking for a budget stylus phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K8UcUv"&gt;This is the obvious choice for someone looking for a budget stylus phone, but I hesitate to recommend it to everyone else. The $299 OnePlus Nord N10 5G offers a faster refresh rate screen, a better camera, and slightly better performance for nearly the same price. If you can afford to spend a bit more, the $349 Google Pixel 4A will offer better software support and a great camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="X1RZZp"&gt;If you’re a stylus devotee or even just strongly stylus-curious, the Moto G Stylus is a good choice. But if you’re ambivalent toward the stylus, you might be better off with one of these other options.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG Stylo 6 review: great stylus features, sketchy performance</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Its built-in stylus is useful and enjoyable, but the Stylo 6 is too slow to recommend&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="h4S2g0"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733319724591682516" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG Stylo 6&lt;/a&gt; is a sub-$300 phone with a built-in stylus, which puts it in exclusive company: the $299 Motorola Moto G Stylus is more or less its only direct competition. For its $270 price, the Stylo 6 offers good battery performance; a big, bright screen; and the handy pen-derived features that stylus life offers. But as much fun as I had doodling on its generously sized screen, it’s just too slow to recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL5PdO"&gt;That’s a shame because I genuinely enjoyed aspects of using this phone. I couldn’t seem to drain the battery below the 30 percent mark even on a day of heavy usage, and I experienced real enjoyment texting my spouse a precisely drawn, animated doodle of a farting butt. Photos look good on its vivid, wide 6.8-inch screen, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover while rewatching &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; (don’t worry, I talk to my therapist about this) that it has stereo speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUhKMV"&gt;Unfortunately, that enjoyment was overshadowed every time the phone took an extra beat to switch between apps, open Twitter, load my Instagram feed, or start my Google Maps navigation. It’s not unusably slow, but it is quite noticeably slow. If you have the patience of a small insect like I do, there’s a fine line between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UqXxuN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10361691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BDKppqf5SpMvj0nAigrnc53mNuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320967/ajohnson_210222_4437__004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylo offers a large 6.8-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QjkepT"&gt;LG Stylo 6 screen and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8Uz8fQ"&gt;The Stylo 6 is a large phone, as you’d expect a phone with a stylus to be. It offers a 6.8-inch 1080p LCD with a standard 60Hz refresh rate and modest bezels. Its dimensions are similar to the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, also a large phone, except that it’s slightly taller. The screen itself is plenty bright and vivid, and the aforementioned stereo speakers make watching videos that bit nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNK9sC"&gt;I found the phone overall too big to use comfortably one-handed, and it felt awkward in even large coat pockets. That’s beside the point, though, if you’re considering the Stylo then you probably already know you want a large phone, so to each their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZOWPT"&gt;The Stylo 6 offers a Mediatek Helio P35 chipset and 3GB of RAM. Herein lies the Stylo 6’s troubles: this processor and RAM combination just doesn’t offer enough power for this phone. I noticed stuttering often as I scrolled through media-rich screens on Twitter and Instagram. Ditto the previously mentioned slowness opening and switching between apps, and the camera suffers from laggy processing speeds, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="y6tvY0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not unusably slow, but it is quite noticeably slow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ob9G3z"&gt;I sometimes tapped the screen, then wondered if the phone had recognized the tap a split second before it opened an app or whatever I was trying to do. Conversely, I’d tap the screen too lightly or quickly and wait an extra second before realizing it hadn’t registered, just because I’d gotten used to giving the phone a little extra time to do everything. This would all be more forgivable (if still frustrating) on a $200 phone, but depending where you get the Stylo 6, it’s pushing closer to $300 and should really do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2sAoc"&gt;If there’s a bright spot to the phone’s processing woes, it’s that battery life is great — possibly as a side effect. The Stylo 6 has a 4,000mAh battery, and after a typical day with two-plus hours of screen-on time, I was usually down to only 70 percent. I was sure a day of heavier use with Google Maps navigation, Spotify, and more social media scrolling than usual would challenge it, but nope. I didn’t even drain it enough for a low battery warning before plugging it in at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IYJSw"&gt;There’s just one configuration offered with 64GB of built-in storage, which isn’t great, but it’s expandable by way of microSD. It ships with Android 10 and, unfortunately, a lot of preloaded apps and games that you probably don’t want. LG isn’t known for a generous upgrade schedule so it’s very unlikely the Stylo 6 will see an Android 11 update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vRcl5BKl_rXx6u_nliCoGGMhhlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320964/ajohnson_210222_4437__001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Popping out the stylus brings up some shortcuts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aJgWhZ"&gt;LG Stylo 6 stylus features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rkox7W"&gt;Of course, the stylus features are a big (sorry) draw here. The stylus is tucked away and spring-loaded into the lower-right corner of the device, and it activates a set of shortcuts when it’s removed. You can take a quick note, grab a screenshot or a GIF of whatever’s on your screen, and mark it up with notes, or draw something immature to text to your partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdqUY1ak7gao0vM5Lb1VW1i4_AY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328590/IMG_20210225_092209.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can do useful, productive things with a stylus, but you can do this, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NzV0Qp"&gt;Despite Samsung’s Galaxy Note being the de facto stylus phone, LG has been making phones with styluses for ages, and it shows with little UI touches like automatically toggling off gesture navigation when you start a note so that you don’t accidentally swipe out of it. You won’t find advanced features like the (much more expensive) Galaxy Note series offers here such as handwriting-to-text conversion or the ability to use the stylus as a remote control. Basically though, it does all of the things you’d expect it to do, and these features work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLVOBQ"&gt;I was surprised by how much I enjoyed having the stylus available. It’s much easier to draw or write silly notes on images with the pen rather than your finger, which I had basically given up on doing because they always look terrible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qJM5e"&gt;The ability to also jot down a quick note without even turning the screen on is something I really appreciated. I feel like I’m always fumbling to unlock my phone, find the notes app, and open a new note just to type out something quick like an email address or a song title. None of this is unique compared to a Galaxy Note, of course, but the Stylo 6 has a set of genuinely useful features that aren’t very common, especially at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLKC-lmsKjADAsgqK63vIZ9GrSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320968/ajohnson_210222_4437__005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylo 6 features standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras, plus a depth sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P1fCne"&gt;LG Stylo 6 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cjD45v"&gt;The Stylo includes a 13-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel depth sensor, and a 13-megapixel selfie camera. That’s not a lot of resolution to work with, but it’s enough to allow the Stylo to take decent-quality images in good light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjHUA9"&gt;White balance occasionally leans a little too magenta or too green, which sometimes gave an effect I liked — kind of a nostalgic film-like quality. At other times, images just looked too cool and washed out. I like how the Stylo handles high-contrast scenes; the HDR effect doesn’t look too strong. Your preview image will look overly dark, but an HDR icon on the screen indicates that the final image will look much more balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mwvw8"&gt;Images in low light or moderate indoor lighting look okay for social media but show a lot of smeared detail if you look closely. The ultrawide lens is somewhat limited by its low-res sensor. Even in bright daylight shots details look smoothed over, and it’s just not up to low light photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UfnwHC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10361491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5cDMaZ"&gt;The camera is also a victim of the phone’s underpowered processor, particularly in portrait mode. The live preview is quite laggy, which gets worse once you push the shutter and wait for the phone to process the image. This can take as long as six seconds, during which you’re unable to take another image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1iNah"&gt;It’s hard to know if you got the right frame of your subject, and it’s a frustrating experience trying to photograph a subject that’s moving even just a little bit because you can’t “spray and pray.” The camera keeps shutter speeds relatively low, too, so blurry subjects can be a problem. By sheer luck I got a portrait mode photo of my cat mid-yawn, but I wouldn’t count on being able to do that again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfLINq"&gt;I captured a few images with the Stylo that I really like, but I felt like it was more in spite of the camera rather than because of it. The images this phone captures will look okay on Instagram and Facebook, but overall, the Stylo’s camera capabilities lag behind most other devices at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VhETtn7zE5XDblbQ0DDcTTKR-ME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320965/ajohnson_210222_4437__002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylo 6 offers a lot of likable stylus-based features, but it’s ultimately too slow to recommend.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="F0GltV"&gt;The Stylo 6 has a few good things going for it: an affordable price, built-in stylus, big screen, and great battery life. But factoring in its shortcomings, namely an underpowered processor, it’s not a device I can easily recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sgRTD8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even around its $270 price, there are many other more capable options&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="neYcAs"&gt;Even around its $270 price, there are many other more capable options. The $300 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; offers a better camera and processor. The 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; includes a massive battery and better processor performance for $200. Neither of those comes with a stylus, of course, but I don’t think the Stylo 6 is even your best bet for an inexpensive phone with a stylus: for just a little more, the 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218732/motorola-moto-g-stylus-power-play-2021-one-5g-ace-specs-price-release-date-budget"&gt;Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt; offers better performance and an upgraded camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCkXdH"&gt;If speed isn’t a concern, a stylus is a must-have, and the price is right, I think you can live a reasonably happy life with this phone. Maybe my patience is just too thin, and a more enlightened person can coexist peacefully with it. The rest of us would do best to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZYqwTfbX2vk4FqDWTzaFfIYSDU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67732462/vpavic_200805_4131_0086_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6vCZGK"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget, we’ve got good news: there are more great, affordable phones on the market than ever. Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with budget devices that make smart sacrifices to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16ya9R"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone that much harder. Bear in mind that it’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point; instead, prioritize the features that matter most to you. You’ll have an easier time deciding, and you’ll end up with a great phone that you should be able to use for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWHEzs"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s coming up on a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people.  While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXvGVa"&gt;If you’re looking for the best cheap Android phone, then we think the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a great option. It has an excellent camera and good software, though its screen is smaller than a lot of the competition at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHj2r3"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a more expensive model: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight A’s in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wu38Dv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556638"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2Gej3D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GatTSx"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="R7dgPY"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Even though it’s almost a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on your investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnYJlm"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4OnLv"&gt;It’s a familiar design and not one that screams “modern.” But in exchange, you get a lot of value. The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is a year behind the latest and greatest. (That would be the A14 chipset in the iPhone 12 lineup.) However, it’s still one of the fastest processors you can get on any phone, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; one in this price bracket. Normally, speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFxDqg"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XX01cV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BTqdjy"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBJCKR"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2021 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately, there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lM0nvh"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four or five years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s strong support network, and a huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lIP45s"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PmYbc8"&gt;The best inexpensive Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ndqid1"&gt;If you prefer Android, want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen is on the small side, and it doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android and is first in line for updates from Google. The 4A came out in August last year, but it’s still guaranteed to get software updates until at least August 2023. It comes in either black or baby blue with 128GB of storage for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlVUW4"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software. (The sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special.) That means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rrz5GM"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI4c7K"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it. That puts you first in line for Android updates and also guarantees you’ll get them for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkeXFo"&gt;Unfortunately, in a couple of years, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be on its last legs. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time, it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlXbHh"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord has very good specs for its price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWBCf6"&gt;The best all-around Android phone outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VceItk"&gt;Technically, saying the OnePlus Nord costs less than $500 doesn’t make much sense because it’s not available in the US, and the company doesn’t plan to sell it in the States. But if you live in a market where it’s available, the OnePlus Nord is the kind of phone that aims for a solid B grade in every category instead of trying to ace one or two. For £379 / €399, it’s a safe Android bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCe0u5"&gt;The OnePlus Nord has a couple of features that are normally reserved for much more expensive phones: support for sub-6 5G networks and a high refresh rate 90Hz display. If you live in an area where 5G is built out, you may notice faster download speeds. But it’s the display that’ll have a bigger impact on your day-to-day experience. It makes everything feel smoother and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdWibC"&gt;You will miss out on wireless charging and a headphone jack with the Nord, but they’re really the only big things that are lacking. Battery life is strong, the 6.44-inch screen is big and beautiful, and the software is less annoying than some competitors (though not as clean as Google’s). The £379 / €399 model comes with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, both plenty good for this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5llXq"&gt;As for cameras, there are a bunch of them — maybe even too many. There’s a standard, an ultrawide, and a macro camera on the back as well as a couple of selfie cameras on the front. As is the norm with most smartphone cameras these days, they will get you decent photos in decent light but fall down a bit in the dark. You’ll mostly want to use the main camera, as the ultrawide has a noticeable drop in quality, and the macro is only good for, well, macro or close-up shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;All too often, phones at this price point have some critical compromise you’re forced to make in order to get the feature you really want. With the OnePlus Nord, there’s no big flaw you’ll have to work around. Again, though, it’s not available in the US. You can import it, but it’s not recommended as it won’t work correctly on US LTE networks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even without considering 5G, the Pixel 4A 5G has other strong benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ARB606"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="L6XTYh"&gt;A big screen with timely software updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0TPXKd"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G is good for all the reasons that the Pixel 4A is good: it has a great camera, good battery life, and clean Google software. Maybe most importantly, it has a bigger 6.2-inch screen, which is spacious but doesn’t make the phone feel too gigantic. It also uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor, which means it’s faster than the Pixel 4A and nearly all the rest of the sub-$500 Android phones you can find. And there’s support for 5G, of course, which is largely underwhelming in the US right now, but might actually be good toward the end of this phone’s lifespan. It all adds up to a $499 price that’s just under the wire for this category, though the Verizon version, unfortunately, costs $100 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ll5Zxc"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G has a slightly better camera system compared to the Pixel 4A, thanks to the inclusion of an ultrawide sensor. Google has also made its excellent Night Sight mode automatic and improved video with some new stabilization modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0i98AR"&gt;Otherwise, it follows the standard low-cost Pixel formula. It has a plastic back with a fingerprint sensor and a headphone jack. Google doesn’t load down the software with extra crapware you don’t want, but it does include some nice little touches like a voice recorder that automatically creates a transcription as it records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvxYa1"&gt;Someday, not having 5G will be a serious downside for smartphones, but that reality is still at least a year or two away. Even if you ignore the potentially faster network speeds, the Pixel 4A 5G is a surprisingly great phone.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pPPrl"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qyzV16"&gt;If you want 5G for the least amount possible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0wGhHB"&gt;At $299, the N10 5G is well below the threshold for this category. Given its price, you might expect to see some significant sacrifices compared to a $400 or $500 phone, and OnePlus has made a few. But they’re smart sacrifices that add up to a device that’s really quite good for the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4uVX"&gt;You won’t find a fantastic screen here, although its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits. It also ships with Android 10, which OnePlus says it will update to 11, and is only offering two years of security updates in addition to that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXW2WO"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 4A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y00B08"&gt;If you can afford to spend a little more, you probably should. A device with better support in the long run will save you some money later. But if budget is a major consideration, the N10 5G is about as good as it gets at this price. It offers the future-proofiness of sub-6GHz 5G support, a thoroughly decent camera, good battery life, a capable processor, and a fairly clean implementation of Android. It’s not a standout in any one way, but as a total package, it’s very hard to argue with its capabilities at this price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="CzLtDJ"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A51&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KnMCx2"&gt;The best phone if you want a big screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="T9fywV"&gt;Samsung’s $399 Galaxy A51 Android phone may well turn out to be the bestselling phone of 2020. Its predecessor, the Galaxy A50, outshone all expectations. For the A51, Samsung focused on nailing a big screen, good battery life, and the camera. It got the screen just right; the other two are just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJX5CI"&gt;The 6.5-inch OLED display on the A51 is bright and vivid, and you’d have to be pretty persnickety to find fault in it. It doesn’t offer the same high refresh rate you can get on the OnePlus Nord, but it makes up for that with Samsung’s great quality. If there’s one weird thing about the screen, it’s that Samsung put a chrome bezel around the hole punch for the front-facing selfie camera. It’s distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCdhK7"&gt;The A51 sports nice build quality, though you can definitely feel that it’s plastic on the back. It has a headphone jack and 128GB of storage, which is the number you should be aiming for on any phone these days. Battery life should be superb, thanks to a 4,000mAh battery, but because it has to power that big screen, it nets out to being just so-so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jy99L8"&gt;As is becoming a (weird) standard on this class of phone, the A51 has a regular wide-angle, an ultrawide, a depth sensor, and a macro camera. And as is also standard, the regular wide-angle will get you the best images. The A51 can’t beat the Pixel 4A for quality, but the different lens options might be more fun for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryPHx5"&gt;Samsung recently committed to providing the A51 with three generations of Android software updates, which is great news. Less great is that it usually takes Samsung longer than you may like to get software updates out to the A-line of phones. Samsung has also started to junk up its previously elegant One UI software interface with ads and other junkware, so be prepared to do some cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNhSDh"&gt;On the whole, though, what the A51 gets you is a very big, very beautiful screen. If that’s your highest priority — and for many people, it is — the A51 is a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 Moto G Power offers days-long battery performance but makes a lot of sacrifices for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NSb4tw"&gt;The Moto G Power does exactly what it says it will: provide days and days of power on a single charge, thanks to its larger-than-average 5,000mAh battery. This is a slightly different version of last year’s phone with the same name, and it starts at a lower $200 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7tVXv"&gt;The lower price tag does come with trade-offs. It includes just 32GB of built-in storage, so adding a microSD card for some extra space is a must. There’s also a slightly slower processor on board, and while it’s capable enough for all of your daily needs, it’s a little laggy jumping between apps and opening the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8syWIE"&gt;As for the camera: it’s just okay. Motorola did away with the ultrawide in this year’s models, so you’ll just be working with the 48-megapixel standard wide and 2-megapixel macro cameras in addition to an 8-megapixel selfie cam. Photos in bright outdoor light look good with plenty of detail, though colors can be a little washed out. The camera struggles with high-contrast scenes and low light, but all things considered, it’s fine for a $200 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;If top-notch battery performance is an extremely important feature in your smartphone, then the Moto G Power should be on your shortlist. It’s capable, and you really will get multiple days of battery life on a charge. But if you’re fine getting by on a battery that’s just average, then we think you’ll be happier with a more well-rounded device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy S21 Plus, iPhone 12 Mini, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Pixel 4A 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xXWN-t57Q2UyqQv662Bj9KonMk=/158x0:1883x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_2021_2.7.png" /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OauOjO"&gt;In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLLWfM"&gt;Luckily, if you’re looking for a no-compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJpqAH"&gt;A great smartphone will last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. Believe it or not, all of those things are easier than ever to find in a phone — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wW82H0"&gt;Apple has released four different variations of the iPhone 12, more than it ever has at one time. Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycfOO"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgfddW"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpBRz"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJMCS"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Yr6F"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="2t2EER"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GxgXJO"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KXRoWF"&gt;If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it’s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0tSW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it’s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdn1U"&gt;Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOuzp6"&gt;That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it’s worth looking around for a deal before buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kVG4SO"&gt;Best Android phone to find a deal for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bwT4eg"&gt;Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don’t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7grLVJ"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We’ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it’s a minor refresh over last year’s Galaxy S20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EbSGE"&gt;However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;There are likely more great Android phones coming soon — especially from OnePlus — but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IZTX1K"&gt;Best small phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BP66"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is the only small phone on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNVbxg"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em0efZ"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l32PYT"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FUQpEY"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0d3Pt"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCe5L2"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MPtDpR"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="efDFTK"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3wWez"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn’t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. Depending on Samsung’s plans, this may be the last “Ultra” version of the Note, too — though rumors have been conflicting on that front. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7spKRS"&gt;Best budget phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4WMzav"&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A 5G starts at $500 and gets you access to several key features: a big-ish 6.2-inch screen, clean and uncluttered Android software, Google’s excellent Pixel camera, and of course 5G. Although buying a phone &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to get 5G is a mistake, all things being equal, it’s worth getting 5G if you can in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwyHDO"&gt;Even though the Pixel camera isn’t the very best you can get anymore, it still is competitive with phones that cost hundreds of dollars more. No other phone at this $500 ($600 on Verizon) price point can match the Pixel’s camera quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YRQbD"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a good-looking OLED screen. Just as importantly, it has the promise of getting timely software updates directly from Google. While other Android phones take forever to get the new versions of Android, Google’s get them right away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fqlnrb"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S20 FE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hEmpY9"&gt;Best midrange Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="eI71VU"&gt;Last year’s Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a Goldilocks phone. It is much more capable and powerful than budget phones like the Pixel 4A 5G, but it still costs significantly less than the newest flagship phones. Even though it came out in October 2020, it still is a completely competent device with an excellent screen, good cameras, and fairly good battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5nZhS"&gt;The “FE” in the name stands for “Fan Edition,” but the reality is that this is a phone for anybody, not just Samsung fans. To bring the price down from its flagships, Samsung changed the screen resolution to 1080p and simplified the build materials — it has a plastic back. Don’t let that last detail throw you, though, as the plastic back feels quite good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65JwyR"&gt;The successor to the S20 FE really is the “flagship” Galaxy S21, which has essentially the same camera system as this phone. As we’ve noted with most Samsung phones, the whole game is whether or not you can find a good deal. If the S21 and S20 FE are about the same price, go with the S21. If you can find a great price on the S20 FE, it’ll do right by you as a very solid Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s PIxel 4A is the best Android phone under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yteQuG"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 is expensive, extravagant, and the easiest way to fit a tablet-sized screen into your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mre8Bq"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than what you’re probably used to. It is also delicate; there’s no rated dust or water resistance, and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: at $2,000, the Fold 2 is literally twice as expensive as other high-end phones. You’re paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola Moto G Power (2021) review: power over perks</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The G Power’s massive battery lasts for days, but other features have suffered to make way for it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="N2DVeg"&gt;The Motorola Moto G Power is a $200 phone that does exactly what it claims — powers you through multiple days of use — but don’t expect any other bells or whistles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WilRjv"&gt;Battery is this phone’s whole deal. Its 5,000mAh battery is about as big as they come right now; it’s the same capacity you’ll find in top-of-the-line devices like the Galaxy S21 Ultra. Rather than making a more well-rounded phone, Motorola has pared back features here and there — a low-res screen, a slower processor — and gone all-in on its headline feature. Cheaper components allow Motorola to sell a $200 version of this phone, and they’re also less power-hungry, making the absolute most of that massive battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27KtjE"&gt;This device bears the same name as its predecessor from last year, but it differs in a few key ways. Rather than offering one model, this year the G Power is offered in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Unlocked-Motorola-Camera-Silver/dp/B08NWDMR9N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;aforementioned $200 variant&lt;/a&gt; with 3GB of RAM and a paltry 32GB of storage. There is also a 4GB RAM / 64GB storage option available for $250 (I tested the 32GB version). This year’s models drop the ultrawide camera and gain a slightly larger screen — 6.6-inch compared to 6.4-inch — with a lower 720p resolution than last year’s 1080p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6TH6s"&gt;If you choose to buy the Moto G Power, it will hold up its end of the bargain. The question is whether you can live with the significant sacrifices Motorola has made to get the biggest possible battery into the most affordable phone it could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qQXgVP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10333144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-brPctpoFkMIqYPDnfvL1B3Wmck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290841/ajohnson_210205_4399_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 6.6-inch display offers a relatively low resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TNamvm"&gt;Moto G Power screen and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PChwmX"&gt;The Moto G Power has a 6.6-inch LCD with 720p resolution. That’s not much resolution to stretch across a fairly large screen, and it shows. Images aren’t quite as sharp as they could be, and the screen overall looks a little dim and washed out to me. The phone itself is on the big side, though I find it a bit more comfortable to use one-handed than the slightly larger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22255202/motorola-one-5g-ace-review"&gt;6.7-inch Motorola One 5G Ace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9ku8bj"&gt;The G Power uses a Snapdragon 662 processor, and I felt the difference between this and the performance from a 700-series step-up chipset. It’s an extra beat slower jumping between apps and opening the camera. It requires more time to capture and process images in Portrait and Night Vision modes than the Ace does with the same main camera sensor. And heavier tasks like jumping in and out of Google Maps navigation shows noticeable stuttering. That said, you’ll be hard-pressed to find substantially better performance at the $200 price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RKyNWiILXnlRn8Rg89S4p3h9bfc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290843/ajohnson_210205_4399_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Power offers biometric unlocking by way of a fingerprint sensor on the power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rlQMbm"&gt;Bottom line, the Power handles day-to-day tasks, plays videos, and navigates adequately. I just felt myself noticing the delays as I was using the phone, which over the course of a day added up to a less than satisfying experience. But for a $200 phone, it gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6ESar"&gt;The G Power offers expandable storage by way of a microSD card slot, which feels necessary here. On the 32GB version I tested, 14GB of that storage is already occupied by Android 10 files. That’s simply not enough in 2021. You can pay $50 more for the 64GB model, but that also feels like spending too much to get too little. If you buy this phone, budget for a microSD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUGhmK"&gt;Motorola will offer an upgrade to Android 11 and says it will provide security updates for the G Power until January 2023. By then, years of updates will probably be slowing the phone down even more anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="14HxdS"&gt;Moto G Power battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oFQ9yX"&gt;The Moto G Power delivers on its headline feature. I started on Monday with a fully charged battery. I watched an episode of &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;, you know, for testing. I navigated across town and back. I scrolled through Instagram... a lot. Email, web browsing, rinse and repeat; by day three of moderate use, I was only down to 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnXkSG"&gt;Even after a trip outside of the house with a lot of picture-taking, I’m going on day four with a battery at 26 percent with just under six hours of screen-on time. I have charged my personal phone at least three times during this time span. We’ve been through roughly 12 news cycles. I myself have aged at least two years. But the Moto G Power carries on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ESF7d9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have charged my personal phone at least three times during this time span&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lYzJ1P"&gt;No doubt the slightly slower processor and low-powered screen help boost those numbers. I left the screen at its default brightness while I tested it, which is just a little dimmer than I’d prefer. It certainly doesn’t look &lt;em&gt;overly &lt;/em&gt;bright at its maximum setting, so an additional hit on battery life is something to take into account if you like a bright screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NJsxN"&gt;Bear in mind that I spent a good chunk of that time at home on Wi-Fi, which is easier on the battery. During non-pandemic times, I would have spent more time out of the house on cell data. And six hours of screentime doesn’t exactly make me a power user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nia2QJ"&gt;If you do spend more time on data and do more power-hungry tasks like watch a lot of videos, you’d probably be looking at more like two full days. In any case, Motorola’s claim of up to three days of battery life is entirely reasonable, and you might do even better than that if you spend the bulk of your time on Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wmtbxb979it3GBV4NpdMOLpuSkw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290839/ajohnson_210205_4399_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameras on the Moto G Power include a standard wide, ultrawide, and a depth sensor for portrait mode photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eIrKqL"&gt;Moto G Power Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gk9Doj"&gt;The G Power offers a 48-megapixel main camera that produces 12-megapixel images, a 2-megapixel macro camera, and a depth sensor to help create portrait mode photos. There’s also an 8-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXgBlW"&gt;The G Power uses the same main camera as the One 5G Ace, and similarly it takes nice photos in good light. It judges exposure well and captures plenty of detail, especially with close subjects. When its AI recognizes a scene like a landscape, colors look appropriately vibrant, but otherwise it tends toward flat, washed-out colors. In less good lighting conditions, things get a little messier where noise reduction smears a lot of detail. In high-contrast scenes where the camera has brightened shadows, there’s a fair amount of noise and / or noise reduction visible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zw3ol7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gYLMCB"&gt;As with the Ace, Night Vision tends to produce a washed-out looking image and in this case, it requires both you and your subject to hold still for several seconds. There’s some noticeable shutter lag in all photo modes — enough to make you wonder for a split second if you actually tapped the shutter button — and the display is laggy when panning around in portrait mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnOGxD"&gt;This camera is just okay, and that’s fine for a $200 phone. The Moto G Power doesn’t have the processing power to pull off more sophisticated HDR or low light photography — for that you’d need to step up to the $350 Pixel 4A. It also won’t be able to keep up with fast subjects, or even slow-moving subjects in low light, but that’s often a struggle for phones priced well above $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hqir7WeU1PEDah-vnyS6jq-17w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290838/ajohnson_210205_4399_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G Power makes good on its promise of multiday battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PL6gw6"&gt;If you’re on a strict budget and long battery life is a necessity, then look no further than the Moto G Power. However, I hesitate to recommend it to someone who doesn’t meet that description. You will be making sacrifices in order to get that $200 price and multiday battery life. The base storage is way too anemic and the speed is noticeably pokey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5KJid"&gt;If you have some flexibility in your budget, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 OnePlus N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; is a great upgrade pick with a better processor and camera. A bit more than that would get you a Pixel 4A with an excellent camera and a well-supported device with better longevity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GD1Vfm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Be aware of its limitations and pack a little patience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sdfsHk"&gt;If $200 is the limit of your budget, the G Power is a fine pick — more so because there are few other options at this price. In addition to its dayslong battery life, it has a better processor than the $100-150 competition and you’re unlikely to find a substantially better screen or camera at this price. Just be aware of its limitations and pack a little patience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola One 5G Ace review: a weak hand</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Ace offers a large screen and massive battery, but it falls short in some key areas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="9iZybh"&gt;The Motorola One 5G Ace is a $399.99 phone that does a somewhat convincing impression of a more expensive phone. It’s large, which feels like a flagship kind of thing, even if that’s not strictly true. It’s relatively heavy, which, in keeping with the wisdom of &lt;a href="https://jurassicpark.fandom.com/wiki/Donald_Gennaro"&gt;Jurassic Park’s unluckiest lawyer&lt;/a&gt;, means it’s probably expensive. It’s &lt;em&gt;shiny&lt;/em&gt;. I held it up for a friend to look at it from six feet away, and he described it as “sleek, like an old iPhone.” And of course, there’s 5G, which was (until somewhat recently) reserved for premium devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEL40T"&gt;It makes a great first impression, but once you look closer, you start to see where it lacks the polish of a high midrange or flagship phone. Its processor stumbles with heavy tasks, that big screen lacks the resolution or faster refresh rate commonly found on high-end devices, and its cameras can’t compete with the best. As is so often the case, you get what you pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50HpoH"&gt;Though $400 is affordable by 5G phone standards, it’s still more expensive than quite good non-5G alternatives. The Ace is one or two hundred dollars more than other capable budget options — some of which even offer 5G, too. The question, as always, is what compromises did Motorola make to offer this phone at $400, and are those acceptable trade-offs for someone considering it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v9LXdU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10309889"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oODc6g"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XLDGGB"&gt;The One 5G Ace features a generous 6.7-inch screen. Depending on how you feel about big phones, that might be one of this device’s best selling points. Battery is another strength: the Ace is equipped with a 5,000mAh battery (likely a contributor to its big size), which is head and shoulders above the 4,000 or 4,500mAh capacity typical in budget and midrange phones. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YVNuTxdHvjlfBf3XF0FWmyDay20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264374/ajohnson_210126_4384_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ace is a little big for my comfort, but your mileage may vary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fo0JnB"&gt;The Ace is a large phone that makes itself known; you won’t forget it’s in your pocket, for example. It’s a hair taller and wider than the Galaxy S21 Ultra and 1mm thicker. It’s on the heavier side, too, at 212g, probably owing to the battery. I found its size a little awkward. It feels like a strain to reach my thumb across the screen with the phone in one hand. I also fumbled it a couple of times, picking it up too quickly and forgetting how much it weighs. This is very likely a Me Problem, though; my husband thinks it’s comfortable to hold one-handed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EADeFo"&gt;The screen is a 1080 x 2400 LCD panel with a standard 60Hz refresh rate. It’s bright and viewable even in direct sunlight, but it lacks the nice contrast of OLED. Viewing it from slightly off angles results in a loss of contrast and slight color shift. Its resolution is stretched a bit thin on a screen this size, and if you’ve had higher-resolution phones before, you will probably notice it doesn’t look quite as crisp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErZaMtcrsEMzaXGUK-65WadTXZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264375/ajohnson_210126_4384_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ace is just shy of 10mm thick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RGWov3"&gt;Likewise with refresh rate: quick scrolling motions and animations are just a little choppy, particularly if you’ve used a 90Hz or 120Hz screen. If you &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; switching from a phone with better resolution or a faster refresh rate, you won’t feel like you’re missing out on anything, and you’ll probably just appreciate what is a very large, pleasant-to-use screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLXEjj"&gt;With moderate use, I generally got two days out of the Ace’s huge battery. Gaming or watching a lot of videos would cut that down, but it’s hard to imagine a real-world scenario where you wouldn’t get at least a day and then some on a full charge. A 15W fast-ish charger is included in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RV6i49"&gt;The Ace uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G 5G chipset. It had no problem handling my daily scrolling through Twitter and Instagram, and it generally felt pretty snappy cruising through Zillow and starting the camera. It struggles with certain heavier tasks, like using certain JavaScript features on a webpage (image sliders on this site, for example). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4LDD5_Td1ze13qj_6zYeiK5Z8fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264376/ajohnson_210126_4384_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll still find a 3.5mm headphone jack on the Ace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ERYS1M"&gt;The Ace is offered with either 4GB of RAM / 64GB of storage or 6GB of RAM / 128GB storage, both of which are expandable via microSD card. I tested the 6GB of RAM variant. Overall, it feels like an appropriate amount of processing power for a $400 phone. The rear-mounted fingerprint scanner is quick and mask-friendly as a bonus, and the Ace includes a 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgXUTT"&gt;Then there’s 5G. Worth noting: the Ace supports Sub-6GHz 5G only, which is the more widespread “nationwide” variety. We still have complicated feelings about the state of 5G in the US, but carriers are pouring resources into expanding and improving their existing 5G offerings. In that sense, choosing a phone that supports it now will mean your device is future-proofed for what 5G brings in the next couple of years. Don’t expect a night-and-day difference just yet, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DyAF-s3c3YanHVVaQBCo__kND_8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264370/ajohnson_210126_4384_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear camera bump includes a wide, ultrawide, macro, and a flash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cDUkfP"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CHlusT"&gt;Motorola has equipped the Ace with three rear-facing cameras: a 48-megapixel standard wide that kicks out 12-megapixel images, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro camera. Around front, there’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pDnzjV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When it stays in its lane, the Ace is capable of very nice photos&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EftzLm"&gt;Motorola also throws in a handful of useful software features. There’s an optional on-screen level, which I appreciate as a serial crooked photo-taker. You can opt for a very wide-format image using the main camera, turning the entire screen into a giant viewfinder, which is a fun creative exercise. There’s also a Pro mode if you want to take control of more settings. I didn’t use it much, partly because its insistence on displaying live Kelvin color temperature values stressed me out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8L3li"&gt;Like most others in this class, the Ace takes nice photos in good lighting conditions. I like its handling of color and white balance. Food looks appetizing, and it handles mixed lighting well. Overall, when it stays in its lane, the Ace is capable of very nice photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xDCdIc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10308631"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDp3lc"&gt;The Ace, unfortunately, does not always stay in its lane. Often, it tries to do too much with too little. In some high-contrast ultrawide shots, I saw a lot of noise where it tried to boost shadows — noticeable color noise like I haven’t seen since I was reviewing point-and-shoot cameras [redacted] years ago. Night Vision mode produces a very bright image that just looks strangely artificial and overcooked. Ultrawide photos in anything less than bright outdoor light look very smoothed-over from noise reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjlxAU"&gt;There’s also some noticeable shutter lag, which would definitely bother someone trying to photograph a moving subject like a child. It was more of a minor annoyance in my particular use cases of sleeping cat and street scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEGzx6"&gt;Even images taken in standard photo mode with the main camera look overworked with close inspection. The camera captures a good amount of detail, but sharpening can be aggressive and crunchy. A photo I took of the sunrise in my backyard was spoiled by some noticeable halo-ing around dark subjects in the foreground. If the Ace had just exposed for the sky and let shadows be, it would have been fine! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCMkdW"&gt;To be clear, it’s not a problem that a $400 phone can’t do all of the things the Ace is trying to do; it’s just that it probably shouldn’t try in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vWgMCo"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wjLxPl"&gt;The Ace ships with Android 10, and an update to 11 has been promised. That’s the only major platform update you’ll get. Beyond that, Motorola will provide two years of security updates, up until January 2023. Motorola is, unfortunately, behind the curve by offering just one major update, even for a budget device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tT8xW"&gt;Motorola’s take on Android includes customizable home screen fonts, icon shapes, and colors, along with a couple of annoying pre-downloaded apps that can be hidden but not uninstalled. I like Moto’s handling of lock screen notifications, or “peek notifications” as it calls them. They’re helpful without being intrusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KHOMy-SW8fE2606yTkwIu8RppVc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264368/ajohnson_210126_4384_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ace doesn’t have a lot of direct competition as a $400 phone with 5G, but that will change soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="WRppA1"&gt;“You get what you pay for” is an appropriate takeaway here, and I mean that in both a cautionary and a complimentary sense. Despite some resemblance, this isn’t a $1,000 phone, and you won’t get a $1,000 experience. But for $400, you should expect to get a phone that will get you through your day without giving you trouble. It should do the things you need it to do — even some things you &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;it to do — and it should see you through a couple of years at least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9fTv0"&gt;The One 5G Ace meets all of those requirements, even though it does fall short of good midrange and high-end devices. Though capable, its processor can’t quite hang with the best of them. The camera is a little clumsy. The screen, while plenty big and bright, isn’t going to offer the rich viewing experience of a competing device with an OLED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PYhLKg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Despite some resemblance, this isn’t a $1,000 phone, and you won’t get a $1,000 experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AYk6z9"&gt;For now, the Ace doesn’t have much direct 5G-capable competition for $400, but that will change quickly. If you plan to hang on to your phone for the next couple of years, it does make sense to pick a 5G model now. For a bit more, the $460 Google Pixel 4A 5G offers a superior camera, a nicer screen, and a slightly better processor. Or you could save some money and get the $300 OnePlus Nord N10 5G with a 90Hz screen that’s almost as big and a better camera, though it offers a less powerful processor. If it’s an option, you could wait things out for a few months. More affordable 5G devices are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="99Njdr"&gt;I don’t have a problem recommending the Motorola One 5G Ace if — and it’s an important &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; — a large screen and great battery are priorities for you above all else. But if you think you’ll want a better camera or a nicer screen, it would be best to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 review: nice for the price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The processor is updated. The rest? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="kH6i08"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 is a midrange phone with a flagship name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9QQQa"&gt;Rather than offer essentially the same top-tier phone at different sizes, Samsung has chosen to get aggressive on price this year. The Galaxy S21 starts at $799.99 for the smaller version with a 6.2-inch screen and $999.99 for the Plus version with a 6.7-inch display. Though in both cases, the smart move is to spend an extra $50 for the models with 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84zXoV"&gt;It helps that the S21 happens to be a very good midrange phone. Nevertheless, Samsung’s choices this year mean if you want to get the very best phone Samsung has to offer right now, you have to buy the very &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="em9jN5"&gt;If the Ultra is too big or too expensive for your needs, there’s nothing wrong with the regular Galaxy S21. Samsung has managed to cut the price without major sacrifices in either the experience or the features of this phone. However, avoiding massive failure isn’t necessarily the same thing as achieving great success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x6MAv8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10305775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZyXbMNC2UhUwsWa7wUsSa3j4ymE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258903/vpavic_210118_4378_0213.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="U6duVZ"&gt;The phones that aim to give you the best of everything tend to cost more than a thousand dollars. Below that, there are more noticeable trade-offs as each phone picks its priority. For the Galaxy S21, Samsung put its big bet behind just one part: the processor, Qualcomm’s high-end Snapdragon 888.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQcPkZ"&gt;In some markets outside the US, Samsung is using its own Exynos processor, and though I’ve heard Samsung has significantly improved it over last year’s, I haven’t been able to test it myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9duJp"&gt;On a basic level, prioritizing the processor means the S21 is a very fast phone with decent battery life. I am able to get through a full day with moderate to heavy use on the 4,000mAh battery, though with a little effort, I can drain it down. The bigger Galaxy S21 Plus — which I haven’t tested — has a 4,800mAh battery and presumably will last even longer despite its slightly larger screen. Both share the same resolution and features otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CArd0o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung prioritized putting in a fast new processor above all else&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8BaaoF"&gt;Just as importantly, the choice to go with the newest and best Qualcomm processor means the Galaxy S21 has a better chance of lasting you three or more years before the inevitable march of Android software bogs it down or leaves it behind. I’ve asked Samsung how many years of software updates it will guarantee for S21 users and will update this review if I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hci2fC"&gt;The Snapdragon 888 also means these phones support both kinds of 5G in the US. In my testing in the Bay Area, I still find that 5G often isn’t notably faster than LTE, and the mmWave version of 5G is still very difficult to find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KC4Rgl"&gt;However, I can also see some improvements over last year. My take on 5G has therefore shifted a bit. I still think that you should not upgrade your phone just to get 5G. However, if you’re due for an upgrade &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt; and you have the choice of getting a 5G phone, you probably should. The networks aren’t good enough yet, but if you’re keeping your phone for a while, you may regret not having it in the years to come. (It’ll be hard to buy a phone without 5G if you’re spending over $500 this year, anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21’s metal side rails curve into the camera bump" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A6m15bRQ0zZPq-LpOuRYucVqEJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258912/vpavic_210118_4378_0178.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21’s metal side rails curve into the camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FYZdAW"&gt;To go along with the priority you can’t see, Samsung’s other big change is the thing you can: the design. As with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, the regular Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus have metal rails that flow into the camera bump on the back. It looks as good here as it does on the Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ri1l39"&gt;However, Samsung went a step further on the smaller S21 by swapping out the usual rear glass panel with plastic (the Plus model still uses glass). It’s not a problem for me at all — in fact, in some ways, I prefer it as it’s one less thing that is able to shatter in a fall. It’s a way to cut costs, but one that makes me wonder whether I really want glass on the back of my phone in the first place. It feels great, with a matte finish and none of the cheap or flimsy associations plastic can bring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21’s screen is only 1080p, but it’s flat and looks great" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FuVCp4MuSJ0RkXiPvwGD4OYIVlQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258907/vpavic_210118_4378_0197.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21’s screen is only 1080p, but it’s flat and looks great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back of the base model is plastic, but it feels good." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E6VFHY1LDByk6XWrM61fGMp0iMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258895/vpavic_210119_4378_0238.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back of the base model is plastic, but it feels good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are three cameras on the back of the S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHnAtkSkPbgdAwQ2MqqUqDLYrF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258897/vpavic_210119_4378_0231.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are three cameras on the back of the S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKrLXB"&gt;While we’re on the subject, here are some of the other ways Samsung has cut costs on the S21 compared to last year’s Galaxy S20. It lacks MST, Samsung’s tech for paying at credit card terminals that can’t read NFC. There is no microSD card slot for expanding the storage, which stings a bit as Samsung was a bit of a holdout in keeping the microSD card around in its flagships until recently. Samsung also saved costs by standing pat with the cameras — they’re virtually unchanged from last year. (More on the cameras below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAqGCX"&gt;The S21 also drops the screen resolution down from last year’s 1440p panel to 1080p on both the regular and Plus versions. They’re flat, too, which many people prefer to curved edges. I don’t mind curved screens so long as they fit with the ergonomics of the phone, but here, I think Samsung made the right call to go flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rp1mQ5"&gt;The screen has an adaptive refresh rate that can run at up to 120Hz, so scrolling and animations are very smooth. Unlike the Ultra’s more advanced screen technology, this screen’s refresh rate bottoms out at 48Hz, and it also uses more traditional OLED tech instead of the newer LTPO version in the Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jan4WZ"&gt;To those screen spec downgrades, I say this: whatever. Samsung is consistently great at making screens, and even though the S21 doesn’t showcase the company at its best, it’s still a great display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3BVXO"&gt;But more than any other upgrade or downgrade this year, the spec that had the most tangible effect on my experience with the S21 was the new fingerprint sensor under the screen. It can read from a larger area, and to me, it feels faster than last year’s sensor did. For as often as we unlock our phones, even milliseconds make a difference in how responsive the phone feels. Also: it works with masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21’s camera hardware is essentially unchanged from last year" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ldH3g-82fT_EWqT4iskr_P52nFo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258892/vpavic_210122_4378_0249.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21’s camera hardware is essentially unchanged from last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Zphw1m"&gt;The only substantive difference between the camera systems on last year’s Galaxy S20 and this year’s Galaxy S21 isn’t in the hardware, but the software. Samsung has done some work to update its processing to improve photos in certain situations. I’ve noticed a small jump in low-light quality, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iesJXT"&gt;But outside a minor sensor swap on the ultrawide, the camera hardware is unchanged. The main sensor is 12 megapixels with OIS, the ultrawide is also 12 megapixels and has a 120-degree field of view, and the telephoto has a 3x optical zoom and does crop tricks with its 30-megapixel sensor to offer digital zoom up to 30X. The selfie camera is 10 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWFqPT"&gt;In the US, I think the most direct camera competitor in this price range is probably the $699 Google Pixel 5. Much to my surprise, the consensus among reviewers at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is that the Galaxy S21 takes better photos overall. I agree. The Pixel’s long-standing camera advantage has all but dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IE4UjG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10305812"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXtk4E"&gt;Now, I still prefer the Pixel’s aesthetics to Samsung’s. The Pixel keeps its contrast-y, bluer look compared to Samsung’s tendency to over-brighten and oversaturate everything. However, on a technical level, the Galaxy S21 just does a better job. There’s less noise in shadows and low light, more detail in decent light, and much better zoom performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbSmBB"&gt;Don’t think the regular Galaxy S21 stands up to the superior telephoto images you can get from the Ultra, which has a 10X optical lens. But at zoom levels from 3X to the Pixel’s maximum of 7X, the S21 simply does a better job than Google’s algorithms. Samsung also wins on video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Szqb2E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10305816"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9yGvL4"&gt;There is the usual array of new camera features, many of which I think most users can ignore. Shooting 8K video doesn’t make much sense on a camera of this caliber, but you can do it. I do appreciate Samsung’s Pro modes for both video and photos, though. In situations where you’re able to spend a little time composing your shot and adjusting the camera settings, you can get something much more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlgR6d"&gt;Samsung has also made it possible to turn off face smoothing completely. It makes for better images, but more importantly, it might also help &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497587/google-pixel-phone-selfie-beauty-filter-retouching-camera"&gt;make for a better self-image&lt;/a&gt; for some people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung’s One UI software on the Galaxy S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_fzsUmpelPMwTxNytg_CUH6t3GI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258901/vpavic_210119_4378_0228.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s One UI software on the Galaxy S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="X9ND6z"&gt;As I noted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;in my review of the Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung is heading in the wrong direction with its software. It’s a shame because the fundamentals of Samsung’s version of Android, One UI, are still great. It makes Android feel a little cleaner and brighter and gives it key features to help manage gigantic screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Iz3Go"&gt;But instead of building on that strength, Samsung is bogging it down. There are too many arcane settings and too many nearly meaningless icons in the quick settings panel. In the US, S21 users will have to be savvy enough to know to download and use Android Messages instead of Samsung Messages if they want unfettered, unbroken access to RCS messaging (most of the rest of the world gets Android Messages by default). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q0JNaz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One UI still has the right fundamentals but is heading in the wrong direction&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ziztFW"&gt;Also, Samsung’s digital assistant, Bixby, is only worth using if you’ve connected the rest of your digital life to Samsung’s ecosystem. I suspect most in the US have not, and so the whole thing just seems redundant next to Google Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxUqcd"&gt;Most egregiously of all, Samsung’s default apps often have ads at the top. Tapping the gigantic weather widget at the top of the default home screen reveals an ad in Samsung’s weather app. I don’t know what tiny marginal profit Samsung makes from these ads, but I don’t think the hit to its reputation is worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5xTyl"&gt;All of these hassles with Samsung’s software can either be avoided or undone by a knowledgeable user. And in general, I think most users will find their way to that knowledge — but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a hassle in the first place. I can be more productive on a well-configured Samsung phone than on virtually any other phone, but it shouldn’t require this much configuration and ad-dodging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21 is often available for less than full retail price" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CuDtdwJTwbMBxwvpw_1cGz7AwFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258914/vpavic_210118_4378_0170.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="t8u2Le"&gt;Add up all of the choices and components in the Galaxy S21, and you can’t avoid the conclusion that it is a rehashed Galaxy S20 with a faster processor and a nicer exterior. That’s a fairly dour way of looking at it, but it is the truth, and I don’t think it should damn the phone. Sometimes the year-over-year updates are minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eSqdNI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung brought the price down, but you should wait for carriers to discount it even further&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qF1o2d"&gt;That minor update means there’s little reason to rush out to buy the Galaxy S21. It’s a phone to get when you need to replace your old and busted phone, and if your phone is more than a couple of years old, it’ll make a huge difference. There’s another reason not to rush out to get the S21: Samsung’s phones are famous for getting deep discounts from carriers. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it would be a mistake to pay full price for an S21, but I would say you should look — or even wait — for a deal if you can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MnS8u"&gt;The most interesting choice Samsung made this year is instead of making a lower-cost “Fan Edition” of its flagship phone, it just made that flagship the lower-cost version. That’s a reasonable choice for Samsung to make, but it also means that you as a consumer have one less choice. Once again, if you want Samsung’s very best phone this year, you’re going to have to buy Samsung’s biggest phone — and this year, the differences are even more stark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="iFdWeP"&gt;But if you’re not interested in the latest, greatest, and biggest, and you don’t mind the way Samsung handles Android, the Galaxy S21 is a fine choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra review: the real deal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;More phone, less money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5nU2FD"&gt;Samsung’s “Ultra” phones are meant to be the absolute pinnacle of the company’s (non-folding) mobile technology. And so the Galaxy S21 Ultra — the third Ultra phone after the S20 and Note 20 Ultras — spares very few expenses. The price is lower than before, starting at $1,199.99, but the phone itself is a perfect example of what happens when Samsung goes all-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7yZKC"&gt;It’s also a perfect example of how Samsung often whiffs on its first attempt at something but presses on anyway, eventually achieving the original vision it couldn’t the first time. The original Galaxy S20 Ultra from last year promised much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155012/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review-5g-screen-camera-space-zoom-price"&gt;more than its parts could achieve&lt;/a&gt;. The Note 20 Ultra fixed the worst bugs but didn’t improve image quality. Thus far, the “ultra” line hasn’t been especially ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcKQIL"&gt;This year, I’m hard pressed to find major faults with the Galaxy S21’s hardware. (Software, unfortunately, is another story.) The S21 Ultra is a huge phone and an expensive one, so it won’t appeal to many — but if you’re okay with those qualities, then it is also the best Android phone right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTFr8V"&gt;I guess third time’s the charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mxblBx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10294570"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the most powerful Android phone you can get" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeqTG9TtdMdfvxPoil_iBKPmKfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248903/vpavic_210119_4377_0153.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has Gorilla Victus glass on the back&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PjLD7I"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KioJJN"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is another in a long line of truly massive Samsung phones. The screen measures 6.8 inches diagonally, which is basically tablet territory. If you are keeping score — and you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that Samsung is — the S21 Ultra’s screen spec is 0.1 inches bigger than the 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max. (If you account for the curved corners on the screen, the viewing area on both phones is technically smaller.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung kept the curved edges on the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra vs. the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The Galaxy is narrower and easier to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ub7Vke"&gt;Big Android phones are common now, though, so Samsung’s job is to not only make a powerful phone but to make one that feels well-made. Mission accomplished: the S21 Ultra looks great and feels better. It’s much more comfortable to hold than the iPhone 12 Pro Max because it is a little narrow and because it has curved edges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4P3DSB"&gt;Samsung’s main design change was to blend the metal rails on the sides into the camera array on the back. It looks as good as last year’s mesa-like camera bump looked bad. I’d become a little blind to just how weird and bad most camera bumps look, and the Ultra is a reminder that they can be better designed. Though, of course, there are five big holes (four cameras, one for the laser-focusing system) which are kind of a lot to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vf1R7"&gt;There’s no getting around that this is a massive, relatively heavy phone. But Samsung also has a ton of experience making gigantic phones, and it has applied everything it has learned here. For example, contrary to the current trend, the screen is still just a little curved on the sides. I think it was the right call — it narrows the bezels on the left and right just that much more, making the phone easier to hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWC08e"&gt;As you may have heard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230934/samsung-galaxy-s21-phantom-black-phone-color"&gt;Samsung is proud&lt;/a&gt; of its new, matted “phantom black” finish on the Gorilla Victus Glass on the back of the phone. It is indeed very black and it repels fingerprints well. However, I am a little worried about its durability. We have already put a tiny scratch on ours that shows through as silver simply by setting the phone down on concrete to take a photo of it. Something to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WyL0Dn"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra specs and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PwU1iw"&gt;Funny story: usually when Samsung introduces a new flagship phone, its reps will talk my ear off about the technology and quality of its new, big screen. This year, the company simply pointed out that it supports an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz at its native 3200 x 1440 resolution and left it at that. If there had been a mic to hold on the video conference call, it could have been dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="gkodi8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10294644"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="voXCV1"&gt;Left unsaid because Samsung rightly knew it could be assumed: this is the best screen on a smartphone. Samsung’s default color balance choice is a little intense, but there’s a Natural option and even the ability to custom tune the Vivid option to your liking. It can reach up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness in HDR video, as well. Samsung’s “Eye Comfort” setting for turning down blue light at night is still a little ham-fisted compared to the iPhone, but that’s my only real complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxYFFS"&gt;Internally, the S21 line is the first set of mass market phones with Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor. Samsung says it is utilizing the extra features in this chip to improve image processing and add the variable refresh rate (which runs from 10Hz up to 120Hz) at full resolution. It also supports Wi-Fi 6E and both flavors of 5G. The chip doesn’t benchmark as well as the iPhone’s A14 Bionic, but in single core marks it beats other Android phones with the older 865 chip handily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEnRZB"&gt;More important to me is that it feels fast. I never perceived any major lag anywhere in the phone. It also might be providing some battery efficiency improvements. For my testing, I turned on every bell and whistle: max resolution, adaptive refresh rate, high brightness, always-on screen. Even when shooting a ton of photos, 4K and 8K video, and playing games, the 5,000mAh battery lasted through the next morning consistently. With less intense usage this is easily a two-day phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmX1JV"&gt;If you’re looking at this phone, you will want to step up from the default 128GB of storage. The 256GB option only costs $50 more, while 512GB (which also has 16GB of RAM instead of 12) costs $180 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5QYh7"&gt;Getting more storage on this phone is important because unlike previous S-series phones, there’s no microSD card slot on the S21 Ultra. Perhaps it was inevitable as a cost-cutting measure (along with nixing the AC adapter and MST payment tech that worked with standard credit card readers), but it’s a bummer nonetheless. A phone that encourages you to take 8K video and 108-megapixel photos needs more than 128GB of storage, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Waqhzv"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is also the first S-series phone to get support for Samsung’s S Pen stylus, though it’s sold separately and you’ll need to figure out a way to carry it (Samsung will happily sell you a bundle with a case). Later this year, Samsung will sell an S Pen Pro that adds in Bluetooth so you can use it as a remote for you phone if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaOBGT"&gt;I didn’t get the S Pen to test so I can’t speak to whether it’s any good, but I don’t have any reason to expect it would be too different from the stylus experience on the Note line of phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUxWWM"&gt;But of all the specs I’ve listed — both good and disappointing — the one that had the biggest tangible effect on my experience was the new in-screen fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm. It’s both bigger and faster, and it means I can just quickly tap to unlock the phone without needing to aim that carefully. Because we unlock our phones so often, even tiny changes make a huge difference in reducing a sense of friction. It finally feels on par with rear-mounted fingerprint sensors. And of course, it works when you’re wearing a mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are five cameras on the S21 Ultra, plus a laser autofocus sensor on the back" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoWSDaQkXbibQNYSNs1u0nCpZ5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248894/vpavic_210118_4377_0068.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are five cameras on the S21 Ultra, plus a laser autofocus sensor on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qTt71x"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aUvczA"&gt;It should come as no surprise that Samsung can make a big phone with good specs and a great screen. What is really supposed to make the Galaxy S21 Ultra “ultra” is the camera system — it’s the most important differentiator from the other Galaxy S phones and the place where Samsung wants to rack up the biggest numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXrdLm"&gt;However, racking up megapixels and zoom lenses does not guarantee either good photos or a good experience. Look no further than the original Ultra phone, last year’s Galaxy S20 Ultra. It suffered from serious focusing issues and generally didn’t justify its higher price. The Note 20 Ultra added laser autofocus, but it still didn’t do as much as it should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eOnsL"&gt;To justify its price and size, the Galaxy S21 Ultra needed to overcome years of stasis and finally bring Samsung up to par with the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGCJVH"&gt;It has. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21 Ultra’s color is usually accurate, but sometimes a little brighter than the scene" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRLQcWk_QOs2kA5dXrdDNe9AJY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248967/05_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_20210115_20210115_161844.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 Ultra’s color is usually accurate but sometimes a little brighter than the scene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ACRGWL"&gt;The camera system on the Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best I’ve used on any Android phone and is extremely competitive with the iPhone 12 Pro Max. And with telephoto shots, it usually wins outright. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YyLohX"&gt;I came into this review with a lot of skepticism. Anytime a company promises camera improvements — especially when they are promised on the back of more megapixels and more cameras — skepticism is the right attitude. On both of those fronts, Samsung is not shying away from promises. There are five image sensors, none of them throwaways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="m4U46A"&gt;Main wide angle: 108-megapixel, OIS, f/1.8, 0.8μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6LTiHt"&gt;Ultrawide: 12-megapixel, 120-degree field of view, f/2.2, 1.4μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E20Cfr"&gt;Telephoto 1: 10-megapixel, Optical 3X, OIS, f/2.4, 1.22μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dKvA2i"&gt;Telephoto 2: 10-megapixel, Optical 10X, OIS, f/4.9, 1.22μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mFSNmO"&gt;Selfie camera: 40-megapixel,  80-degree field of view, f/2.2, 0.7 μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="k8JYGg"&gt;The fifth hole on the back of the phone is for the laser autofocus sensor, which was added to help with some of the focus issues on the main sensor. That main 108-megapixel sensor is also a second-generation sensor, capable of 12-bit color and featuring what Samsung says is a new “remosaicing” process for converting 108-megapixels into the default 12-megapixel images. (Getting 12-bit color requires diving into the settings and using Pro mode.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The San Francisco skyline, shot on S21 Ultra" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-i2k1W8B-bukc8aH95jdokoLNfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248987/20210116_20210116_144203.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco skyline, shot on S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1nvMyM"&gt;I am happy to report that nearly every problem I had with the original Galaxy S20 Ultra’s camera system has been resolved. Focusing is fast and accurate, the focal plane seems bigger, there’s no discernible shutter lag, and most of all: the pictures look better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRuNy3"&gt;The main sensor also simply feels more predictable. It focuses where I tap, and parts I’d expect to get some bokeh have a nice blur. In the dark, it switches over to night mode and produces images that have significantly less noise than before (though a touch more noise than the iPhone 12 Pro Max). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qdfmu0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10294696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDc9ce"&gt;Samsung continues to tune photos differently than I prefer. Compared to the iPhone, it aims to make things a little brighter and the colors a little more intense, while Apple seems to more confidently let shadows be shadows. However, the S21 Ultra often provides better sharpness and detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RokZzh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10294723"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BALGwk"&gt;Where the S21 Ultra really shines is on zooming. It has two telephoto lenses and I found myself believing in the utility of having both. Proper optical zoom at 3X makes a big difference, and Samsung uses data from multiple lenses up to 10X. Samsung still has its gimmicky “Space Zoom” that works up to 100X, but I couldn’t get anything usable beyond 30X and even then it required a lot of light to create something passable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gklCV5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10294711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s2rJyX"&gt;As for video, we are equally impressed. The S21 Ultra does a very good job with dynamic range and adjusting exposure on the fly as you pan the camera through a scene. Stabilization is improved, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccDt9N"&gt;Some of you might be surprised that I haven’t mentioned the Pixel 5 yet. Well, it has fallen behind. Both the S21 Ultra and the iPhone 12 Pro Max have switched to physically larger sensors and it has revealed the limits of computational photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cSoRMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10294732"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WufM3c"&gt;As for the head-to-head with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, here’s where I have landed. If you were to take 50 photos or videos, 30 of them would be a toss-up based on your personal preference, seven or eight would be clearly better on the S21, and 12 or 13 would be better from the iPhone. They’re very close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcGQ70"&gt;But Samsung has those telephoto options. And it also has compensated for the relative dearth of high-quality third-party Android photo apps by building in its own features. Samsung has added a “director’s mode” that lets you switch lenses on the fly while shooting video in 1080p, but I found that I preferred shooting in 4K. You can shoot in 8K and pull out a still photo, you can use “Single Take 2” to let the AI try to make a bunch of amusing photos and video effects. Samsung’s Pro modes for both photo and video are excellent. You can shoot in RAW, too, although it is a standard RAW, not an Apple-style ProRAW that has some of the benefits of HDR mixed in. (I’ll leave a full Samsung RAW vs. iPhone ProRAW competition for others.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Even in Portrait Mode, face smoothing can finally be fully disabled." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vjxf2Pc6F-HxO9kAmY_1u7Xe9kE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22249027/31_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_20210118_20210118_113001.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uYFCT9"&gt;Overall, there are just a thousand different ways you can work with this camera, and it can be a little overwhelming. But the good news is that the experience of just snapping a photo will yield better results than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWajv1"&gt;I’ve saved my favorite news for last: Samsung has finally, &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; given us the option to &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; turn off face smoothing. Behold, my wrinkles and blemishes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;No more Hamcam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eK90LX"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Aw49cl"&gt;Here’s how Samsung’s versions of Android work: they get way way too messy and complicated, everybody complains, and eventually Samsung simplifies things. Then the cycle starts again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLX0xk"&gt;Right now, we’re still heading toward the land of complication. Samsung’s One UI interface is still good for big screens, but there are just so many options in quick settings, many of which mean nothing to the average person. Unforgivably, there are still ads built into Samsung’s default apps. The biggest thing on the default home screen is a weather widget. Tap it and the next biggest thing you’re likely to see is the kind of ad that’s normally at the bottom of a crappy, overloaded website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7eHWoK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the Galaxy S21 Ultra has a downfall, it’s in how Samsung’s version of Android has become messy and displays ads in some apps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CvhqQQ"&gt;Bixby, Samsung’s digital assistant, is still the default, and it’s difficult to switch away from it (you need third-party software). Surprisingly, it’s somewhat better than the last time I used it, but it’s still brittle. When I asked it to set a second alarm for 15 minutes, it consistently canceled my first alarm and set one for one second. If you set it up and set SmartThings up for your smart home and live an entirely Samsung-based life, Bixby is passable. But it’s also not necessary. The Google Assistant is still here and still better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jE6yOU"&gt;Then there’s texting. In the US, Samsung ships these phones with Samsung Messages by default, whereas everybody else in the world gets Android Messages and therefore RCS. Some US carriers support RCS on Samsung Messages, but badly. AT&amp;amp;T’s version of RCS doesn’t interoperate with other carriers yet, for example. I know Samsung isn’t to blame for RCS’s problems, but as the biggest Android seller in the US, you’d like to think the company would try to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3OPDt"&gt;But if you know your way around Android, you can make the S21 Ultra a really amazing and powerful phone. Dodge or disable all those ads and install all the non-Samsung versions of software, and it’s a powerful and sometimes elegant experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8fd0L"&gt;Samsung is also better at letting customers customize its software for gigantic phone screens than Apple is. You can split-screen apps, convert apps to little pop-up floating windows, turn on a slide-over bar with access to your clipboard and calendar, and much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYtUfN"&gt;Getting to all that power requires wading through a lot of complexity, but I’ve always found it to be worth the effort. I just wish Samsung wouldn’t make it so difficult in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5oxfkCuVQEPp3NmhYJqj8Jl5nLU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248892/vpavic_210118_4377_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="t2V5QP"&gt;Usually, a review of a superpowered phone from Samsung consists of a bunch of promises and then a bunch of reality checks on those promises. With the Galaxy S21 Ultra, there are fewer caveats than before. The battery lasts beyond a full day. There’s a beautiful new design. It has the fastest speeds, best camera system, and nicest screen of any Android phone right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWSJ51"&gt;If you’re wondering how the smaller Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus compare, we’ll have follow-up reviews on those — but as a spoiler, I’ll just tell you both are much more iterative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rLSVCS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best Android phone right now, if you don’t mind the size and the price&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfLF1x"&gt;The biggest reality check is the software, which suffers from Samsung’s heavy-handed attempts to build its own ecosystem and further monetize an already expensive phone. I doubt that the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra will convince many iPhone users to switch — the ecosystem lock-in on iOS is too strong for that and getting the most out of Samsung’s version of Android is daunting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Wif2B"&gt;If you can navigate the software, the size, and the price tag, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best Android phone available today. I don’t know how long it will be able to hold on to that crown, but it’s got it now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="YGWnV0"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is finally worthy of the name.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord N10 5G review: tall phone, small price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;For $300, it’s right on the money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EO9rwg"&gt;The OnePlus Nord N10 5G does something unique: bring 5G to a $299.99 phone without cutting too many corners. That’s a full $200 lower than other budget-oriented competitors like the Google Pixel 4A 5G and Samsung Galaxy A51 5G. Alongside its lower-tier N100 sibling, it’s the first phone in OnePlus’ midrange Nord series to arrive in the US, available from T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, and unlocked from OnePlus.com and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5m2r0"&gt;It’s definitely noteworthy that the N10 5G will bring 5G to the under-$300 market. But at least for now, 5G isn’t something most people should care about, much less pay more for. Fortunately, the N10 5G has more going for it. It has a big screen with a high refresh rate, a tall aspect ratio that might make it easier for people with smaller hands to use, and OnePlus’ light-touch take on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziaFwm"&gt;So what sacrifices did OnePlus make to create a $300 phone? The quick version is this: it offers an LCD rather than an OLED screen, uses a less robust processor than midrange and flagship phones, and doesn’t include any water resistance. And you won’t find features that are becoming more common on midrange devices, like wireless charging and telephoto cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTe6sc"&gt;The question for the N10 5G is whether you’d be happy with a decent all-around device that doesn’t shine in any particular area, or if you should look to one of its budget competitors that goes all in on a feature like battery life or photo quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="39E53z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10267045"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HhPuLh"&gt;As you’d expect from a $300 phone, the rear of the device is plastic — a glossy, smudge-attracting panel. The phone itself feels appropriately weighty and while it doesn’t scream ‘flagship’ it doesn’t feel too cheap either. I actually kind of like the plastic finish; I feel like it’s a little easier to grip and not as prone to slipping as glass. There’s a fingerprint sensor on the back that was quick and reliable in my testing. Overall, it was pretty comfortable to hold and use, despite what its dimensions initially suggested to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81ztms"&gt;Somewhat unusually, the N10 5G offers a very tall 20:9 aspect ratio on its screen. It’s a 6.49-inch, 1080 x 2400 LCD, which makes for a device with a generous screen that doesn’t feel too bulky in your hand. Personally I like a small phone, but this felt like a bigger phone I could actually use. I don’t feel like I’m straining to like an Instagram post when I hold it in one hand. It’s a tight fit in my coat pocket but I could live with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PeP8IP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I like a small phone, but this felt like a bigger phone I could actually use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNm4BX"&gt;This screen offers a 90Hz refresh rate that’s faster than the 60Hz typically seen at this price point. This makes for smooth scrolling through apps and makes the phone that bit nicer to use than you might expect for $300. However, the screen does use LCD technology, which lacks the rich contrast of OLED panels you’ll find in many competitors that cost just a little more. It’s good enough in day-to-day use, and it’s viewable in direct sunlight, but it’s not your best option if you watch a lot of dimly lit period dramas on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QB1jgY"&gt;The N10 uses a Snapdragon 690 5G processor, one of Qualcomm’s budget 6-series chips, which includes support for the phone’s headline feature: 5G. It’s worth noting that the 690 supports low and mid-band 5G frequencies, but doesn’t offer mmWave connectivity (that’s the super-fast but hard to find variety of 5G). This is also a good time to remind you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511946/5g-iphone-12-upgrade-speed-network-mmwave-hype"&gt;not to buy a new phone just for 5G&lt;/a&gt;. But if you must, be sure to check your carrier’s coverage map before you opt for this or any other 5G phone, and temper your expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="k3QtPB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OnePlus has said it will update the N10 5G to Android 11, but that’s it for major updates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IZLjjy"&gt;The N10 5G ships with Android 10, which is one version behind the very latest update. OnePlus has said &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-n100-single-update-android-11"&gt;it will give the N10 and N100 an update&lt;/a&gt; to Android 11, but that’s it for major updates — users will have to settle for two years of security updates. That’s not uncommon at this price point, but it’s an important point to consider. If you plan to pay for it in installments and upgrade within a couple of years anyway, that’s no great loss. If you’d rather get a few solid years out of your device, then the N10 won’t be your best option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHx7Kb"&gt;OnePlus’ Oxygen OS brings a fairly clean implementation of Android to the N10 5G. You can customize the font and theme, and choose between full gesture control or a navigation bar with fixed controls for home, back and recents. It’s not the pure experience of a Pixel phone, but it doesn’t feel overly cluttered for my taste. I don’t love the OnePlus-themed clock widget on the home screen by default, but it’s mercifully removable, as are the handful of OnePlus-specific apps like Community that I’m not sure I would use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gOsD68"&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3Tdrt7"&gt;You can’t build a $300 phone without making some compromises, and a cheaper processor is one way to do that. The Snapdragon 690 at the heart of the N10 is a newer chip for budget devices, and in my use it turned in decent performance. Occasionally I noticed it stuttering when I scrolled quickly past some very image and video-rich screens, and the camera app sometimes took a few seconds to open. In the camera app itself I saw some slowdowns in the image preview when panning quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6mI1E"&gt;But for the most part I streamed videos, used Google Maps, played games, ordered coffee, and scrolled through Instagram without issue. Speed is definitely one area where OnePlus had to make some concessions, and though performance lagged noticeably at times, I wouldn’t call it a deal-breaker for most people who would consider the N10 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qfY-9ttE8I0k8ON-H9HxuxO1r0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214160/ajohnson200104_4354_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The headphone jack lives!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ByqJne"&gt;The N10 5G is configured with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage with a MicroSDXC slot for even more space. All three of those specs are more generous than many comparable devices at this price point, and for some may offset the relative pain of the slow processor. Dual speakers provide stereo sound for videos, but audio quality isn’t great. Wired headphones are an option, though, since the N10 5G includes a real, live headphone jack. (OnePlus aficionados should be aware that there’s no ringer switch here, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUCR3A"&gt;The N10 5G isn’t all about battery the way the battery-for-days N100 and Moto G Power are, but its 4,300mAh battery delivers a solid day’s worth of use — and often more than that. I usually got about a day and a half of moderate use out of a full charge. OnePlus includes a 30W fast charger in the box, which is also uncommon at this price point, and it is truly fast: it took the device from 7% to 50% in 20 minutes in my experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nvKZ3-57f7JmZbGR2-SzAORFbS4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214161/ajohnson200104_4354_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The N10 5G’s quad camera array&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ksbep7"&gt;Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="e4FOwl"&gt;You’ll find four cameras (plus a flash) on the N10 5G’s rear camera bump. Here’s a quick rundown of the phone’s cameras:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="s2CZqb"&gt;A 64-megapixel main camera with a f/1.79 lens and no optical stabilization (electronic only) that produces 16-megapixel images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JiQ1C5"&gt;An 8-megapixel ultrawide with a f/2.25 lens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="53DsHf"&gt;A 2-megapixel f/2.4 macro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CfUZDR"&gt;A 2-megapixel f/2.4 monochrome camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xpRtl1"&gt;A front-facing 16-megapixel f/2.05 selfie camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="5YxLvi"&gt;This seems like a lot of cameras, especially since two of them are unlikely to be used frequently. The monochrome camera only kicks in when shooting in black and white, which is accessed by scrolling through the filter options to the very last one. Likewise, the macro camera is activated via the main shooting screen by tapping the flower icon. It’s sort of fun to mess around with, but even in decent lighting image quality is pretty bad. Images from the ultrawide camera are a bit soft if you look closely, but it’s not noticeable enough to ruin an Instagram post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1la41a"&gt;The good news is that the main camera is just fine in decent lighting — good, even, considering this is a $300 phone. Colors are on the punchy side without straying into oversaturation, and detail is mostly acceptable in even moderately low light conditions like a well-lit interior. Things get a little noisy and smudgy in low light, but the 64-megapixel sensor (which kicks out 16-megapixel images) does a nice job of hanging on to at least some detail. Nightscape mode does bring back an impressive amount of light in darker situations, but you can’t get away with shooting in near darkness like you can with the Pixel’s Night Mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n1xacH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10267032"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LsTARh"&gt;I did find that it struggled to find focus at times, and it’s definitely not up to the task of capturing moving subjects in low light, like pets and children. It also lacks a true telephoto camera, and will instead use digital zoom if you switch to the tele setting on the main shooting screen. Resulting images are very soft and have an unpleasant, overprocessed digital look about them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnfF8f"&gt;Overall, it’s a camera that doesn’t try to do too much, which is a good thing. If you mostly photograph static scenes and don’t push it too hard, you can expect images that will look just fine on social media. But if you’re looking for any kind of modest zoom or top-notch performance in low light, you’d best look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The included fast charger for the N10" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8J9DgFd6y1oMe3nqpSh_CfUwOQ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214159/ajohnson200104_4354_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The included fast charger for the N10&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="LuXxtR"&gt;Bottom line: this is a very cheap 5G phone with a big screen and decent all-around performance. OnePlus has made some smart sacrifices to get to that $300 price point, and the result is a device with many nice attributes but without a major standout feature. If there’s a particular feature that you prioritize on your phone, like multi-day battery life or an above-average camera, then you can do better around the same price or a little more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="f5zlPJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you want a very inexpensive 5G phone that doesn’t have any deal-breaking flaws, the N10 5G is it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l7rOhH"&gt;If you can live without 5G for now (and we think you probably can!) you can get a phone with a little something extra for around the same price. For big battery life you could look to the N100 or Moto G Power. For an above average camera, look at the Google Pixel 4a. That phone is also a good candidate if device longevity or better performance are important to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="u9eprq"&gt;If you want a very inexpensive 5G phone that doesn’t have any deal-breaking flaws, the N10 5G is it. Even if you’re not interested in 5G, which most people probably aren’t, this $300 device still delivers in important ways: a good screen, acceptable performance, a good enough camera, and decent battery life. Not a bad deal at all.&lt;/p&gt;
