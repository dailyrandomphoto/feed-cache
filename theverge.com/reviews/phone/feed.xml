    <title>Motorola Moto G Play (2021) review: a fairly good phone for a very good price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A good phone for the price, but if you can spend a bit more you’ll get some worthwhile upgrades&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jijWOE"&gt;The Moto G Play is the least expensive of four phones that Motorola introduced for the US market earlier this year. Introduced at $169, it’s already enjoying an apparently permanent $10 mark down, placing it firmly in budget territory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLqMWm"&gt;Most of what you’ll find on the G Play’s spec list makes a lot of sense given that price point: a 6.5-inch 720p LCD with standard refresh rate, Snapdragon 460 processor with 3GB of RAM, and a generous 5,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQGEiE"&gt;There’s another factor that might sway some shoppers toward the G Play, too: as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;LG leaves the budget phone space&lt;/a&gt; and its remaining stock disappears from retailers’ shelves, Motorola’s budget-friendly phone will be one of a smaller number of options. In the US. we haven’t seen the kind of sub-$150 devices from Motorola that the company has introduced in other markets this year, so for now, the G Play is a likely candidate for the budget-oriented phone shopper’s consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yq02wW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10470952"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="abrA10"&gt;There are a couple of aspects of the phone’s feature set that feel underwhelming even considering the price: namely, a paltry 32GB of storage (though it can be expanded after the fact) and a 13-megapixel main camera when more advanced, high-resolution pixel-binning sensors are becoming the norm at every price point, for example. But in short, the G Play performs just fine for its price. Just know that you’ll need to bring patience and acceptance of a few shortcomings, and that spending an extra $50 to $100 if your budget allows would get you some meaningful upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Fj8ocXqWgKds7jM22tLsrhGO1c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446427/ajohnson_20210412_4525_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G Play’s 6.5-inch display is a bit low-res for its size and hard to see in bright outdoor light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4NdOM4"&gt;Moto G Play performance and screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TsNIGy"&gt;The G Play uses a Snapdragon 460 chipset which was introduced over a year ago and is an entry-level Qualcomm processor. Coupled with 3GB of RAM, it manages to keep up with routine tasks like jumping between apps and scrolling social media, albeit with subtle-but-noticeable stuttering along the way. Heavier tasks like starting and stopping Google Maps navigation take an extra couple of beats. It’s not as frustrating as my experience with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301223/lg-stylo-6-review"&gt;LG Stylo 6&lt;/a&gt; was, but it’s a step down from the kind of performance you can expect from a phone that’s $50-100 more expensive, including those in Motorola’s own G-series lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="STHUPi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The G Play includes a 5,000mAh battery, which is significantly bigger than the typical 4,000 or 4,500mAh&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AVK5Qk"&gt;The screen, likewise, gets the job done but doesn’t particularly shine. Its 720p resolution is stretched thin across the 6.5-inch display and images are noticeably pixelated. Colors are on the cooler side and the screen is a bit dim unless you max out the brightness. Even with the brightness cranked all the way up I had a hard time seeing it outdoors. We spend so many hours looking at our devices that this is one area where it might be worth upgrading. That said, there isn’t exactly anything wrong with the display — it’s just not very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJxSkW"&gt;There’s better news on the battery front. The G Play includes a 5,000mAh battery, which is significantly bigger than the typical 4,000 or 4,500mAh found in other comparably sized Android phones. Motorola claims it will get three days of battery life, which is probably true if you’re a light user and conservative with your screen brightness. I had no problem getting two days on a charge with a couple of hours each day of screen-on time. A full day and then some of heavy use is definitely reasonable to expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eUodGD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Storage is expandable via microSD card, so plan on that extra $10-15 as a necessary part of the purchase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dXVVyI"&gt;The Moto G Play includes just 32GB of storage — about as low as it gets in 2021. Considering roughly half of that will be taken up with operating system files, it’s just not enough. Storage is expandable via microSD card, so plan on that extra $10-15 as a necessary part of the purchase if you don’t already have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBBRcS"&gt;The G Play ships with Android 10 installed. While it’s on Motorola’s list to receive an Android 11 update, the timing is unclear and, given the company’s track record, could be many months away. The phone will receive security updates until January 2023. That’s an unfortunately short life span, so you might want to count on trading it in or cashing in your upgrade with your carrier after a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-0xKl-_nv-5ScC8ZHGcoPWpzV6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446426/ajohnson_20210412_4525_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s just one camera on the Moto G Play’s rear panel — plus a depth sensor and a flash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9xrLwx"&gt;Moto G Play camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="la0jKI"&gt;The G Play has just one 13-megapixel rear-facing camera (accompanied by a 2-megapixel depth sensor) and a 5-megapixel selfie camera. That’s it. Even in the budget class, that’s not many cameras in 2021. I don’t think anyone (myself included) will miss having the low-quality macro camera that manufacturers keep putting on their devices these days, but not having an ultrawide is a bummer considering it’s not hard to find a phone that offers one at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZrSppU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10470933"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lWH6dz"&gt;If nothing else, the G Play’s camera offerings are very straightforward. There are just two main shooting modes in the native camera app: photo and video. Portrait mode and a few other extras are available in the shooting menu, but there’s no night mode here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vICTq7"&gt;Outside in good lighting, this 13-megapixel camera does okay. Overall exposures are balanced and the camera doesn’t try to do too much HDR-ing, which I appreciate, but you don’t have to look too close to notice that details in grass and leaves are smoothed over. Things go downhill quickly in less good light — the G Play just isn’t up to low-light photography. The selfie camera is also guilty of aggressive over-smoothing at its default “Face Beauty Auto” setting that made my face look like a glazed donut. Thankfully, you can turn this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zPOT-4NqzEVGAxuJIn-F4NNXgcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446423/ajohnson_20210412_4525_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G Play is well-priced for what it offers, but spending a bit more would mean some valuable upgrades.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzJkNf"&gt;Clearly the G Play has its share of shortcomings — at $160, it has to. The question is whether these are trade-offs you can live with for a couple of years. If you enjoy a very casual relationship with your phone, the G Play will do all of the things you need it to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="APEtVk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you enjoy a very casual relationship with your phone, the G Play will do all of the things you need it to do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C9Vhl0"&gt;Everyday performance for the basics — light web browsing, social media, email, music — is sufficient. If you just use your phone camera for quick snapshots out and about and don’t expect too much from it, the G Play will do fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E238ck"&gt;If you suspect that you need a little more from your phone, or that you want the experience of using your phone to be a little more enjoyable, then I’d strongly encourage spending a bit more on something like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola’s own Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; for a better camera. Samsung and OnePlus have recent entries in the sub-$200 class that are worth looking at, too; I haven’t tested them, but they’re specced competitively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GJynXC"&gt;If your relationship with technology is less complicated than those of us who spend hours each day of our precious time on this Earth staring at the little glowing screen in our hands, jumping between social media apps, and pushing our phone cameras to their limits, then you’ll get along fine with the Moto G Play. Just spare a thought for the rest of us, please?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy A52 5G review: a midrange phone that will last</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not the cheapest budget phone, but it will go the distance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="q8E5E4"&gt;If a $100 budget phone is the fast-food dollar menu and a $1,000 flagship is a steakhouse dinner, then the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G sits comfortably halfway between the two: the laid-back all-day cafe with surprisingly tasty food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6762Rt"&gt;It’s good. More importantly, it’s good where it matters. Sure, you have to order your food at the counter and get your own water refills, but it’s worth it because brunch is fantastic and the prices are reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frUf4o"&gt;The A52 5G is the highest-specced of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;budget A-series Galaxy phones&lt;/a&gt; we’ll see in the US this year, offering all of the basics for its $499 price tag along with a few good extras. Its 6.5-inch screen comes with a fast 120Hz refresh rate that’s scarce at this price point. Its main camera includes optical image stabilization, something I missed when I used the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;more expensive OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;. The A52 5G is rated IP67 waterproof for some extra peace of mind. And hey, there’s still a headphone jack! In this economy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CbrcLy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10462503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r4ql9c"&gt;Still, this isn’t a flagship, and costs had to be cut somewhere. The device’s frame and back panel are plastic, and while I like the matte finish on the back, there’s a certain hollowness when you tap on it that’s not very reassuring. There’s also no telephoto to complement the wide and ultrawide cameras, just digital zoom plus a depth sensor and macro camera of dubious usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHb7bt"&gt;The important stuff is here, though. Samsung has the A52 5G on its list for monthly OS updates currently, and it says it will offer three years of major Android OS updates and at least some security support for four years. That will go a long way toward making the most out of your investment in this phone, and it will help you take advantage of its headline feature: 5G — Sub-6GHz, specifically, with hardware-level support for the C-band frequencies carriers will start using in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ags8Hc"&gt;It’s getting more common to see 5G offered in midrange and budget phones, but in this country, it’ll be a couple more years before our 5G networks are truly good. Healthy device support for the next few years makes it more likely that the A52 5G will actually last long enough to make it to that 5G promised land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N1lu981XZQQIMuwY7AbVUo_HWFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465665/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A52 5G offers solid everyday performance with a Snapdragon 750G chipset and 6GB of RAM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vTC01h"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G performance and screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xBcTmE"&gt;The A52 5G uses a Snapdragon 750G processor with 6GB of RAM, and the combination feels like a good fit here. You can certainly push it out of its comfort zone with heavier tasks like webpages with JavaScript, and I noticed it hesitating a moment too long when opening the camera app from the lock screen. But for day-to-day tasks and social media scrolling, it keeps up well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHF1lS"&gt;As in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;last year’s model&lt;/a&gt;, the screen is where the A52 5G (and Samsung generally) really stand out. This is a 6.5-inch 1080p OLED panel that’s rich, bright, and generally lovely to look at. Plus, it offers all of the velvety smoothness that comes with its 120Hz refresh rate. Swiping between home screens, opening apps, scrolling through Twitter — it all just feels nicer with a fast refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TlJgv3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One feature I continue to fight a losing battle with on the A52 5G is the in-display optical fingerprint sensor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5WXx6D"&gt;Even considering the additional power needed for the 120Hz screen, the A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery consistently lasted well into the next day in my use. I managed to get two full days out of it when I forgot to charge it overnight and decided to embrace chaos and just plow through on the remaining charge. This was with light to moderate use, and I was down to low double-digit battery percentage by the end of day two, but my gamble paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jvn5CE"&gt;One feature I continue to fight a losing battle with on the A52 5G is the in-display optical fingerprint sensor. I’ve been chastised by the phone many times for not leaving my finger on the sensor long enough, and I almost always need at least two tries to get it to register. That hit rate goes down significantly outside in bright light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gO7BU8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I see enough ads throughout my day as it is, and I do not appreciate seeing one more when I check the weather&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3s0y6"&gt;These problems aren’t unique to this device, and you can just opt to use (less secure) facial recognition or a plain old PIN to lock and unlock the phone. But there are nicer in-display fingerprint readers in pricier phones like the OnePlus 9 and Samsung’s own S21, so it’s a trade-off to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vk5IWZ"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G ships with Android 11, which is great. The less good news is, as we saw in the S21 devices earlier this year, Samsung’s latest take on the OS stuffs a lot of unwanted apps, ads, and general clutter into the UI. I see enough ads throughout my day as it is, and I do not appreciate seeing one more when I check the weather on my phone’s own weather app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPpfpU"&gt;If there’s a positive way to look at this situation, it’s that it feels more forgivable on a budget phone than on a $1,000-plus flagship. But I’d rather not have the ads at all. If you buy the similarly priced Pixel 4A 5G, you give up a lot of other features from the A52 5G, but you get an ad-free experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZhUR-qGtJB0ABj4ns-AbLqIMuEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465664/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Housed in the rear camera bump are a standard wide, ultrawide, macro, and depth sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HaqLe9"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TGVjuj"&gt;The A52 5G includes three rear cameras, plus a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You get a 64-megapixel standard wide with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, and the seemingly obligatory 5-megapixel macro camera. There’s also a front-facing 32-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1n9yk3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10462184"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LfMrMu"&gt;The 64-megapixel main camera produces 16-megapixel images in its standard photo mode that are bright with the very saturated colors you’d expect from a Samsung phone. Sometimes the look is pleasant, but more often than not, it’s a little much for my taste. The good news is that this sensor is capable of capturing lots of fine detail in good lighting, and it even does well in dim to very low-light conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmGCNi"&gt;I put its night mode up against the Google Pixel 4A, which is still the low-light champ in the midrange class. There’s more noise visible in the A52 5G’s night mode shot, and details have a watercolory look, but while the 4A hangs on to its title, the A52 5G is quite close behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="muSVAD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10462353"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fL9uTL"&gt;The Pixel 4A is still the better camera in good lighting, too, but the differences are more subjective here. The 4A goes for more subdued color rendering, and the A52 5G’s images lack a little contrast in comparison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b2waOI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10462360"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEZCg3"&gt;So the A52 5G can’t beat the generation-old imaging tech in the 4A, but that might say more about the Pixel than anything else. Aside from that, the A52 5G turns in good all-around camera performance. Images from the ultrawide sometimes have a little cooler color cast but are generally good. The selfie camera offers two zoom settings: a slightly cropped-in standard wide view and an ever-so-slightly wider angle. The “focal length” difference between the two is almost laughably small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4meBPd"&gt;At its default settings, the selfie camera does a fair amount of face smoothing and brightening. I don’t think it quite crosses the line into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;hamcam territory&lt;/a&gt;, but it certainly has that telltale “maybe it’s AI, maybe it’s Maybelline” smoothed look to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhpTk3"&gt;If you want to go full hamcam, there’s a new mode just labeled “fun” in the camera app with AR face filters brought to you by Snapchat. There’s a different selection of them every day, and you don’t need a Snapchat account to use or share them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rqpRt"&gt;I’m tempted to dismiss them as “for the youths,” but maybe this is really for the olds like me who would rather not join another social platform if I can possibly avoid it, thank you very much. At last, I can transform my face into a piece of broccoli and share it with the world without logging in to Snapchat — three years after the kids have all moved on to something else. Anyway, it’s there, it works, and you can indeed turn your face into broccoli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1oKBK3JdgYUcwZh5b6fILyiLJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465662/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good hardware and healthy software support make the A52 5G worth spending a little more on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8blwo0"&gt;There’s a lot that the Galaxy A52 5G gets right. Maybe the most important feature is one that sounds much less exciting than cool headline specs: security updates for at least the next few years. At $500, this is the higher end of the budget market, but a few extra hundred dollars is likely easier to swallow if you know you’ll get a couple more years out of your investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxfsaW"&gt;Samsung has invested in hardware in all the right places: the 120Hz screen makes for an elevated user experience, battery life is good, camera performance is strong, and a healthy processor / chipset combination handles daily tasks well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pVgjzT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The A52 5G is a good midrange phone today — but just as importantly, it will be a good phone a few years from now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fXjffS"&gt;What I didn’t love — the cluttered software, fussy fingerprint sensor, a tendency toward oversaturated color in photos — feels more forgivable when the phone gets the nonnegotiable stuff right. The Pixel 4A 5G is probably this device’s closest competition, and it beats the A52 5G on camera quality and a cleaner UI, but it’s a smaller device without a fancy fast refresh rate screen. Depending on how you feel about either of those things, the 4A 5G might be the better pick for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="w7Ybue"&gt;In any case, the A52 5G is a good midrange phone today. But just as importantly, it will be a good phone a few years from now. With solid hardware and a software support system to back it up, this is a pricier budget phone that’s worth budgeting a little extra for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy S21 Plus, iPhone 12 Mini, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Pixel 4A 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xXWN-t57Q2UyqQv662Bj9KonMk=/158x0:1883x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_2021_2.7.png" /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OauOjO"&gt;In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLLWfM"&gt;Luckily, if you’re looking for a no-compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJpqAH"&gt;A great smartphone will last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. Believe it or not, all of those things are easier than ever to find in a phone — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wW82H0"&gt;Apple has released four different variations of the iPhone 12, more than it ever has at one time. Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycfOO"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgfddW"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpBRz"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJMCS"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Yr6F"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2t2EER"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GxgXJO"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KXRoWF"&gt;If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it’s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0tSW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it’s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdn1U"&gt;Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. However, we can’t say we like Samsung’s software as much, which at the moment is a bit cluttered and features ads in places like the weather app. For a sleeker experience the OnePlus 9 Pro would be a good choice; the Ultra beats it on screen and camera quality, but it’s a good device all-around and offers a more grown-up take on Android OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOuzp6"&gt;That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it’s worth looking around for a deal before buying.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wFbUhR"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 / S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kVG4SO"&gt;Best Android phone to find a deal for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bwT4eg"&gt;Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don’t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7grLVJ"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We’ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it’s a minor refresh over last year’s Galaxy S20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EbSGE"&gt;However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;There are likely more great Android phones coming soon but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QzSdip"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FUQpEY"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0d3Pt"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCe5L2"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini is small enough to be used in one hand by almost anybody.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hvSkHC"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IZTX1K"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BP66"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is the only small phone on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNVbxg"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em0efZ"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MPtDpR"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="efDFTK"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3wWez"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn’t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. Depending on Samsung’s plans, this may be the last “Ultra” version of the Note, too — though rumors have been conflicting on that front. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a step down from the 9 Pro, but it only gives up a few features at a significantly lower price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ofDQRV"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZJWuDD"&gt;If you want an excellent ultrawide camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uUgURs"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is the step-down model from the OnePlus 9 Pro, which is itself an excellent phone. But you don’t give up too much by opting for the 9, and you save a ton of money. Like the 9 Pro, it offers great performance with a Snapdragon 888 processor, fast 65W wired charging, and something that will appeal especially to the landscape photographers out there: a great ultrawide camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa2S7w"&gt;The sensor behind the OnePlus 9’s ultrawide camera is physically larger than most and offers a healthy 50-megapixel resolution. A unique lens design corrects distortion without introducing the funhouse mirror-type stretching you’ll often see in the corners of ultrawide images. And if super-wide photography isn’t your thing, know that the main camera turns in solid image quality, too. Images are well-exposed, and colors look pleasantly vibrant. OnePlus makes a big deal of the Hasselblad color science at work here, which does a fine job but isn’t as mind-blowingly good as the company suggests.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O804KE"&gt;Unfortunately, you do miss out on a couple of good camera features opting for the 9 rather than the 9 Pro. The main camera on the 9 Pro offers optical image stabilization, which isn’t included on the 9, and is useful for its ability to keep subjects looking sharp in lower light conditions. There’s also no telephoto lens — just digital zoom, which isn’t as good as the 9 Pro’s optical zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The OnePlus 9 also doesn’t work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. (It works on both T-Mobile and Verizon’s 5G networks, however.) That’s no great loss right now (honestly, it might be for the better), but in a couple of years, this will probably become a downside. Bearing this in mind and a couple of camera feature omissions, the OnePlus 9 is an excellent device. It offers a flagship feel and performance for a bit less than the highest-end Android options and a seriously good ultrawide camera for wide-angle photo fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7spKRS"&gt;Best cheap phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4WMzav"&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A 5G starts at $500 and gets you access to several key features: a big-ish 6.2-inch screen, clean and uncluttered Android software, Google’s excellent Pixel camera, and of course 5G. Although buying a phone &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to get 5G is a mistake, all things being equal, it’s worth getting 5G if you can in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwyHDO"&gt;Even though the Pixel camera isn’t the very best you can get anymore, it still is competitive with phones that cost hundreds of dollars more. No other phone at this $500 ($600 on Verizon) price point can match the Pixel’s camera quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YRQbD"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a good-looking OLED screen. Just as importantly, it has the promise of getting timely software updates directly from Google. While other Android phones take forever to get the new versions of Android, Google’s get them right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KdXXRK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503882"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9V9anG"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A has a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGSyayDrR2mXPWMiM9i0d_4YCk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21691996/vpavic_200728_4113_0127.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A is the best Android phone under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yteQuG"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 is expensive, extravagant, and the easiest way to fit a tablet-sized screen into your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mre8Bq"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than what you’re probably used to. It is also delicate; there’s no rated dust or water resistance, and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 2 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. Since it debuted for $2,000, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364162/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-5g-price-cut-announced-1800"&gt;permanently marked down by $200&lt;/a&gt;, but you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme 8 Pro review: a peek at what’s next in midrange smartphone imaging</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The 8 Pro uses a new 108-megapixel image sensor that could bring better photo capabilities to the midrange class&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OubfId"&gt;The Realme 8 Pro is a good, inexpensive Android phone that you probably shouldn’t buy right now — at least if you’re in the US. But it’s also a preview of positive things to come to the midrange class, especially in terms of camera hardware. I have seen the future of smartphone imaging around the $400 price point, and it is good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcAQ4u"&gt;If you’re not familiar, Realme is a Chinese company that started off as a sub-brand of Oppo; like OnePlus, it was founded by a former Oppo vice president. Its phones are sold in China, India, and Europe. Although, you can technically &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F1005002356767813.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22372644%2Frealme-8-pro-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a global version of the phone&lt;/a&gt; and use it in the US, but we wouldn’t recommend it. It’s not compatible with many of the 4G bands we use in the states, so coverage won’t be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rlknuc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10434729"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OpH1Ga"&gt;The 8 Pro uses a relatively new 108-megapixel Samsung sensor. It’s the same pixel count as the main camera in the Galaxy S21 Ultra, but a different, smaller chip designed for budget-friendlier phones. As in the S21 Ultra, the point of this technology isn’t to take 108-megapixel images (though you can do that if you want). It’s to combine information from groups of pixels to create a better optimized 12-megapixel final image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9rJ6T"&gt;There are other reasons to like the Realme 8 Pro. Considering its £279 (about $380) price, performance is very good, owing to a strong combination in its Snapdragon 720G processor and 6GB of RAM. Battery life is healthy and the phone supports 50W fast wired charging. Depending on how you feel about inspirational corporate branding, I guess the “DARE TO LEAP” printed on the back of the phone could be a plus (not my thing, personally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZOVxs"&gt;But the camera impressed me the most, and it’s a component that will likely make its way into many more midrange phones sold around the globe. Let’s take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Realme 8 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zYL68vwQZ04q6a7Q9V0H5pE8grQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422677/ajohnson_20210330_4501_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8 Pro offers standard wide and ultrawide cameras, plus macro and depth-sensing modules.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9Deyjj"&gt;Realme 8 Pro camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KseLY8"&gt;In case you need a reminder at any point of how many pixels the main camera offers, you can simply look at the back of the phone where you’ll find “108 MP QUAD CAMERA”  etched on the camera bump. Specifically, it’s Samsung’s 1/1.52-inch Isocell HM2 sensor coupled with an f/1.9 lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpIrz3"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no optical image stabilization here, but maybe owing to the image processing tricks this high-res sensor can pull off, I didn’t notice a significant number of blurry shots that OIS might have corrected. Other rear cameras include an 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth-sensing camera. There’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera on the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PqSNY9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In low light, the camera uses binning to combine pixels into groups of nine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2WslDc"&gt;The main camera is able to do a couple of interesting things. In bright daylight, it can use all 108 million pixels individually, using different pixels to capture your scene at multiple exposure levels at once, and combining the information into a 12-megapixel final image. In low light, the camera switches things up and uses binning to combine pixels into groups of nine, effectively turning relatively small individual pixels — 0.7μm to be precise — into much larger 2.1μm sized pixels, which helps produce less noisy images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm4ceZ"&gt;Photos in bright light look good as expected. There’s an impressive amount of detail captured, though some overzealous sharpening is evident if you zoom in to 100 percent. Colors are a bit too saturated for my liking; there’s no amount of lawn fertilizer in the world that would make my yard look as green as the 8 Pro thinks it is. It seems more prone to this oversaturation with landscapes and is thankfully less aggressive with portrait mode photos. Portrait mode photos look good, and I appreciate that the camera doesn’t crop in when switching to this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rs3ppK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10434785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="chzFwG"&gt;Dim indoor lighting and low light are where phone cameras typically struggle, but the 8 Pro turns in an impressive performance in these conditions. In moderate lighting, images are surprisingly detailed and show little noise. The camera’s night mode will bring out even more detail, though it does apply a distracting amount of sharpening and contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="smeJnG"&gt;I had, frankly, low expectations for the 8 Pro’s digital 3x zoom, but I’m pleased to report that it’s much better than I feared. In good light and even moderate indoor lighting, images show a lot of detail and I’m hard-pressed to find the unpleasant artifacts that usually appear in digitally zoomed images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nOR1WW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10434810"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3JoPTF"&gt;The camera isn’t just cropping in on a 108-megapixel image, either. Comparing them side by side at 100 percent, a photo taken with 3x digital zoom shows more detail and looks less noisy than a crop of a 108-megapixel image. The Samsung HM2’s pixel binning powers are being put to work here, too, and the result is digital zoom that is actually worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNLxwM"&gt;There’s not as much exciting news to report about the 8 Pro’s other cameras; they do just fine. The ultrawide is prone to some subtle but unpleasant color shifts: white balance can skew too warm and blue skies sometimes look a little gray. The macro camera is a low-resolution sensor that is little more than a gimmick, and the selfie camera thankfully avoids over-smoothing faces at its default setting. All fair for a phone at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggsQ0wf8_f25IqWpW3y0u9KmD00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422682/ajohnson_20210330_4501_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8 Pro’s processor and RAM combination are more than sufficient for everyday tasks and scrolling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QIXP6V"&gt;Realme 8 Pro performance and screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KwndvP"&gt;Outside of cameras, the Realme 8 Pro is a thoroughly capable midrange phone. Battery life is sufficient to get through a day of moderate to heavy use and the aforementioned processor / RAM combo handles day-to-day app scrolling and tasks with ease. The 6.4-inch 1080p OLED with standard 60Hz refresh rate is fine but nothing special, and I had to fight with auto brightness insisting on making the screen too dim on a couple of occasions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RkSqzm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;this processor / RAM combo handles day-to-day app scrolling and tasks with ease&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wg2ih4"&gt;There’s the flashy branding on the rear of the device, which is either your kind of thing or not. The Realme 8 Pro doesn’t support 5G at all, which is something to consider if you’re in the UK and thinking of buying the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYsb1B"&gt;My biggest gripe, though, is with the optical in-display fingerprint sensor. I’d say at least a third of the time when I unlocked the phone it required more than one try to read my finger. A couple of times — both outside in bright daylight — it gave up and had me enter my PIN instead. If this was going to be my forever phone, I’d probably skip the fingerprint sensor and just stick with a PIN, personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YChxijF9TJL3frDe23zO-C6xCgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422679/ajohnson_20210330_4501_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Te32ls"&gt;The Realme 8 Pro is the kind of midrange phone that we don’t see very often in the US: great performance and decent all-around specs combined with an excellent camera, all for what would equate to a sub-$400 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zm37iP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the 8 Pro is (hopefully) a sign of good camera hardware coming our way soon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o4Z3xk"&gt;Phones that meet this description are surprisingly scarce stateside; in fact, its closest equivalent is probably the Pixel 4A, which we’ve recommended as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;best low-cost Android phone&lt;/a&gt; essentially since it became available last summer. The 8 Pro goes a step beyond the 4A in some respects by offering an ultrawide rear camera and fast charging. If it came down to it, though, we’d probably still favor the Pixel for its very good device support and excellent lone rear camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3ZY0XQ"&gt;If you live in the UK and you don’t care much about class-leading display specs and the lack of 5G doesn’t bother you, the 8 Pro has a camera and a processor that will keep up for many years to come. For the rest of us, the 8 Pro is (hopefully) a sign of good camera hardware coming our way soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Fast charging and elegant software offset a so-so camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KqtAyf"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is a legitimate flagship phone that is genuinely competitive with the best Android phones on the market — at least from a features and quality perspective. Yet in terms of market and mind share, it’s still destined to be a niche device for a small group of enthusiasts looking for a specific kind of elegance in their Android device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAjS4O"&gt;And that’s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0Ns9M"&gt;If you live in the US and you’re buying an Android phone, chances are very high that you’ll end up with a Samsung Galaxy phone. Samsung has the carrier relationships, quality, and marketing that have led directly to market share. LG, Motorola, and even &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america"&gt;sell more phones here than OnePlus does&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4shcPS"&gt;But after nearly seven years and dozens of phones, OnePlus has established itself as a brand that can make great phones that are serious alternatives to the mainstream. The $969 OnePlus 9 Pro achieves that goal with only a handful of notable compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2jYBg"&gt;OnePlus’ flagship phones always come with a laundry list of top-of-the-line specs, but what makes the OnePlus 9 Pro good isn’t the numbers; it’s how well those specs translate into one of the best experiences you can get using Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AHu1Vy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi-pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"This $159 OnePlus Watch is OnePlus’ first smartwatch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22334322/oneplus-watch-smartwatch-features-price-specs-battery"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro announced with Hasselblad-branded cameras ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hpoEZD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10406462"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro has an elegant design, but won’t support 5G on all networks" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjdZe-bk4k4KgMTns8qChqCoZ-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388892/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0068.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has an elegant design but won’t support 5G on all networks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bQiCrq"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro hardware design and 5G support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rZIXVc"&gt;The hardware design on the OnePlus 9 Pro is the most seamless, elegant phone that the company has designed to date. It is, of course, big. It has a 6.7-inch screen that goes from edge to edge in a body that’s narrow enough to make it just barely usable for me in one hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MZ4NI"&gt;What I can’t help but notice is how far OnePlus has come in build quality. The glass on the front and back curves into the aluminum rail on the edges with no seams at all. It’s well-balanced, beautiful, and solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Top: OnePlus 9 Pro; bottom: Galaxy S20 Plus. Both phones have similarly curved glass and molded aluminum rails." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTvlAj6Darv2g-R9N0QJ9O44UZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389264/oneplus9progalaxys20plus.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top: OnePlus 9 Pro. Bottom: Galaxy S20 Plus. Both phones have similarly curved glass and molded aluminum rails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It has a three-stage ringer switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAp70uBpGGWtFpcHUizuZRTE4QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388880/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0054_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has a three-stage ringer switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYWqZR"&gt;It’s also the spitting image of a Galaxy S20 Plus. Shift a couple of buttons around, move the selfie camera to the middle, and swap out the logo, and it’s the same design. I get that there are only so many ways to sandwich curved glass and aluminum together, but it’s uncanny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSjJvc"&gt;To be fair, OnePlus does keep some of its identity in the three-stage ringer switch, which easily lets you toggle between a ringer, vibration, and fully silent. It may still be my favorite feature on OnePlus phones, and I remain baffled as to why more Android phone makers don’t adopt a physical ringer switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVSttu"&gt;Speaking of vibration, the haptics on the OnePlus 9 Pro aren’t sloppy at all, unlike many Android phones. Unfortunately, the trade-off is that they aren’t very strong; I often can’t feel it vibrate in my pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6vr0E"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has the top-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is paired with eight gigs of RAM on the 128GB model. You can’t get it in a smaller screen size, but you can spend $100 more to get 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. There’s no microSD card slot for storage expansion in either model. What you get is what you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMXoXr"&gt;It supports both Sub-6 and millimeter-wave (mmWave) styles of 5G, but there’s a significant caveat: the phone supports it, but OnePlus has only managed to land 5G certification from its carrier partner, T-Mobile. If you buy it unlocked, as of now, it will only work with T-Mobile’s 5G network. Everything else will be LTE. AT&amp;amp;T 5G support doesn’t appear to be in the cards at all, and as for Verizon, OnePlus says that it “continues to work with Verizon to certify both the 9 and 9 Pro on its 5G network.” Later, on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353052/oneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified"&gt;March 26th, Verizon announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would support 5G on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="OnePlus’ wireless warp charger can fully charge the phone in under 45 minutes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyFkyRjI2k4qCPN085Bz4kQTDBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388875/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus’ wireless warp charger can fully charge the phone in under 45 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w5puLi"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro battery and charging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zfl3AK"&gt;For OnePlus, the standout spec is its proprietary charging technology. There’s a 65W charger included in the box, and it can charge up the phone ridiculously fast. The phone’s 4,500mAh battery is actually split in two, which helps further speed charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 65W charger comes in the box (pictured with the regular OnePlus 9)." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bYtldbablBg79ONjjiRExDVLu8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388874/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 65W charger comes in the box (pictured with the regular OnePlus 9).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJcrVY"&gt;If you like, you can spend an additional $69 on OnePlus’ new Warp Charge 50 wireless charger. It charges at 25W, but since the battery is split, it’s essentially the same as charging at 50W, wirelessly. It also works if you set the phone on the charger in landscape mode. With the phone fully dead, it charged completely in 45 minutes. With ambient mode in Google Assistant on, it took a bit longer — but it was still wicked fast compared to other wireless chargers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1P12A6"&gt;That 4,500mAh battery was enough to get me through a full day and a half of moderately heavy usage. However, OnePlus phones do tend to be a little more variable in their battery life depending on use. Spending a day shooting 4K video and pushing the processor with games meant I could kill it with less than four hours of screen-on time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fG6qV"&gt;So while the battery life might not be best in class, the way OnePlus has built its ecosystem for charging means I’m able to top off faster than I can with other phones — provided I use OnePlus’ proprietary chargers, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro has an LTPO OLED screen, which can help with battery life" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5cHhLu_Wn4xSxFlJ9pZp5KWWUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388890/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0066.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has an LTPO OLED screen, which can help with battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X8qQlG"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="OAFOOG"&gt;After wireless charging, the next standout spec on the OnePlus 9 Pro is that 6.7-inch screen. Like Samsung, OnePlus has switched over to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;an LTPO style of OLED&lt;/a&gt;, which can be more power efficient and allows the company to have more control over the refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ9Qor"&gt;The screen can go all the way from 120Hz on down to 1Hz, depending on what’s happening on the display. OnePlus has branded the touch response rate on the screen as “Hyper Touch,” clocked at 360Hz for certain games, and though I am dubious it makes that big a difference for gamers, OnePlus says it could. More consequential is the screen resolution: 1440 x 3216 at 525ppi. You can leave it at that high resolution and have the high refresh rate screen going at the same time. Doing so probably hits battery life, but to me, the point of this max-spec phone is to max the specs, so I didn’t turn down the resolution or the refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yI05D4"&gt;Those are the specs on the screen, but it’s the experience that matters. And again, I think OnePlus has done a remarkable job here. Something about the tuning of the animations in OxygenOS makes this phone feel just a little bit smoother than even Samsung phones. I also appreciate the color tuning — although it’s not as subdued as an iPhone or even a Pixel, it’s more restrained than Samsung’s default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBNXzq7K6YNBtQHo8bKFRoCNvZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388879/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid but has room to improve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0avD9X"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bt7aQC"&gt;Without delving into a lot of history, I will just point out that until very recently, camera quality has been the main downfall for OnePlus phones. It’s a particularly bad way to fall down, too, because often, the clearest and simplest way to compare phones that otherwise look and perform nearly equivalently is to look at the photos they take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95RI9o"&gt;OnePlus knows all of this and wants to position the OnePlus 9 Pro as a heads-up competitor — or at least a viable alternative — to the very best Samsung and even Apple have to offer. So it did a thing a lot of challenger brands do: called in a ringer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G9j19S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Hasselblad partnership is only about color tuning and interface design this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xt3br"&gt;That ringer is Hasselblad, which OnePlus is partnering with to improve its camera results. It will be a multiyear effort, and it’s far from guaranteed it’ll be a fruitful partnership. In fact, most of these sorts of deals don’t really do anything notable when it comes to the camera’s quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhWaA4"&gt;This year, Hasselblad’s participation with OnePlus’ development process amounted to helping the company tune the colors from the camera and lending a bit of its interface to the camera’s Pro mode. Oh, and most importantly for OnePlus, Hasselblad allowed its logo to be stamped next to the lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOkITZ"&gt;I do think there’s some credit due to this color-tuning influence. In the same way that other smartphone brands have a “look” to their photos, I think OnePlus is developing its own. iPhone photos are generally flat and neutral, tending to the warm side of color; Pixel photos contrasty and blue; and Samsung photos have the vibrancy slider set to max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus 9 Pro: indoor with mixed lighting handles color well" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AsREolMsK8SMr90RWIWvZnhRREM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389337/17_LE2125_IMG_20210313_111817.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro: indoor with mixed lighting handles color well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus tends to ramp up blue colors, which is usually fine but can sometimes get the camera into trouble" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6FOH5Nw3MjM6-pT0VtzW7ay7do8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389338/20_LE2125_IMG_20210313_113526.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus tends to ramp up blue colors, which is usually fine but can sometimes get the camera into trouble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus does a good job not adding too much vibrancy when it’s not there in the first place" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XaIF0PK3g-pGh0OMJy-SxrBH9XU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389336/15_LE2125_IMG_20210313_110553.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus does a good job of not adding too much vibrancy when it’s not there in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vFHBSJ"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro’s image output lands mostly in the middle. It tends toward blue, and it definitely lifts up shadows to create more even lighting. Its photos are more striking but less accurate than what you’ll get out of an iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yYysn"&gt;The camera system is good, but it can’t quite match the quality you get from an iPhone 12 Pro Max or Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra — both of which cost more than the OnePlus 9 Pro. It handles a variety of conditions quite well, but sometimes I just had to take an extra beat to compose my shot. It let me better judge what the viewfinder was showing and, honestly, gave me time to try the shot again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ps0XCc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10406526"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GnGiG3"&gt;As usual with smartphone cameras, I think the difference comes down to software. I like the colors the 9 Pro produces, but sometimes it just tries too hard and whiffs. Similarly, OnePlus seems to want to bring a little of that Pixel contrast magic to bear but instead just oversharpens. And lightening shadows is sometimes laudable, but not when it adds completely unnecessary and distracting image noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera can try too hard to brighten shadows, introducing noise" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CF7YOM7t6e5tB0A06yC8faoLao4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389355/18_LE2125_IMG_20210313_112304.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera can try too hard to brighten shadows, introducing noise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera oversharpens sometimes, too. Take a look at the fringing around the runners on the lake in this ultrawide shot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDooOLmKNWq0aQR0K3UtcKZlt6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389354/06_LE2125_IMG_20210311_160459.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera oversharpens sometimes, too. Take a look at the fringing around the runners on the lake in this ultrawide shot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jmns55"&gt;The main camera uses a new 48-megapixel Sony sensor with OIS, though when I pressed OnePlus to tell me what exactly that sensor brings to the table, I didn’t really get a clear answer. You can shoot 12-bit RAW images in the Pro mode (which is two bits more than last year, if you’re keeping count). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noaYb1"&gt;That’s all nice, but the interface on Pro mode is what gets me. You can clearly see what’s set to manual and what’s in auto mode. It’s simple and easy to use, too. Best of all is focus peaking, which draws little lines over the part of the image that’s in focus. It is a lot clearer and more fun to use than the tap-to-focus you need to use on other phones. (You can do that here, too, of course.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qMoum"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro’s other cameras include a big, 50-megapixel ultrawide with a sensor that’s quite a lot nicer than the usual step-down sensors ultrawides get stuck with. I loved using it right up until it went haywire with sharpening. OnePlus put in a custom lens to help with distortion at the edges, and it works as well or better than pure software fixes at keeping straight lines from bowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGBpJb"&gt;The telephoto camera is 3.3x, and it’s not anything special at that zoom level. Beyond it, digital zoom is kind of a mess. It gets pantsed by the S21 Ultra with its periscope-style lens. There’s also a monochrome camera that serves only as a helper for the rest of the system, but I suspect it’s not doing anything especially important. OnePlus did drop the gimmicky and pointless “color filter” camera from last year’s 8 Pro this time around. It will probably drop the monochrome camera next year, if I had to guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="exkR3H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10406545"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TReqrH"&gt;OnePlus’ software-focused Nightscape mode works really well for capturing nighttime shots, although to my tastes, it over-brightens the image. Portrait mode is a mixed bag; heads often look artificially cut out from the blurry background. Again, I can get good shots, but portrait mode was often one of those situations where I needed to try the shot a second time. The selfie camera is passable in good light but falls down fast in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkqOPE"&gt;Unfortunately, video is equally messy. The OnePlus 9 Pro will let you shoot up to 8K 30 or 4K 120, but neither looked good. In fact, regular old 4K 30 has that overprocessed and oversharpened look you see so often from smartphones. The big new feature is improved HDR for backlit subjects, but the effect is minimal at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uC8chD"&gt;That’s a whole pile of critical takes compared to phones that cost more than this phone. But despite the price difference, I think the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera should be held to as high a standard as possible — it’s a flagship phone. It can sometimes hang with the best of the best, and that’s a win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pLQs9q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10406554"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can put all your widgets in a drop-down menu instead of on your home screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vp8Inx-tnSjKoH9h7Te9rzY7t28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388878/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0052_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can put all your widgets in a drop-down menu instead of on your home screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZN4UWi"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro performance and OxygenOS 11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iYZu5Q"&gt;Even though the camera is often the main differentiator for an Android phone, it’s not necessarily everybody’s highest priority. When I’m not pixel-peeping photos, the OnePlus 9 Pro is the best Android phone I’ve used so far this year. The performance is great. I’m especially impressed with the optical in-screen fingerprint sensor, which is super fast and doesn’t seem to be thrown by weird lighting conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHyiSQ"&gt;OnePlus’ version of Android is called OxygenOS, and it’s now at version 11. The company has borrowed Samsung’s idea of shifting content down to meet your thumb and added in support for an always-on ambient display. The animations feel smooth, and OnePlus has learned its lesson about how annoying it can be to have apps close in the background too often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bWqNDM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OnePlus has a more elegant version of Android than Samsung&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOb2Eg"&gt;OnePlus has committed to two major OS updates and three years of bimonthly security updates, which puts it ahead of brands like LG but behind Samsung and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpxgUZ"&gt;You can customize a few things like the font and icons, too. My favorite customization is an ambient display mode that displays a colorful bar that shows how often you’ve been using your phone throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXAAvg"&gt;One feature borrowed from Apple and / or Microsoft is the ability to put your widgets into a separate panel so they’re not littering your main home screen, accessible via a quick swipe down. I love it, but I wish it wasn’t mapped to the same thing other Android phones use to quickly bring down notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIRq8d"&gt;Mostly, though, OxygenOS just feels &lt;em&gt;chill&lt;/em&gt;, especially compared to Samsung. OnePlus isn’t pushing its own ecosystem of apps and services (though with a new OnePlus Watch coming, perhaps that may change). It’s also not festooning its own apps with advertisements, unlike Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="waqTIv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10406439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro (top) and OnePlus 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 has a slightly smaller screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7cetFjAfrRKtYErNsip_4ScK7t4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388898/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0077_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 (right) has a slightly smaller screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="p8uB5Z"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is not a “flagship killer.” It’s a flagship. Although it still costs a little less than its top-tier competitors, it nevertheless is a pricey phone that makes a lot of promises. Mostly, it delivers on them. Even though a tiny fraction of customers buy OnePlus phones compared to Apple and Samsung, the company has built a track record long enough to deserve its status as an established brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GhSKH3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The regular OnePlus 9 is a fine choice for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NA5uRY"&gt;If you’re considering one of the new OnePlus phones, I am actually hard-pressed to make the case for the OnePlus 9 Pro over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;regular OnePlus 9, which Allison Johnson reviewed.&lt;/a&gt; The regular OnePlus 9 is $240 less, and the things you lose are mostly the nice-to-haves that justify the Pro’s existence: fast wireless charging, OIS, a telephoto lens, mmWave 5G, and the slightly larger screen. The cheaper OnePlus 9 lacks telephoto, but its other cameras take photos that are nearly equivalent to the pro. It has a high refresh rate screen, fast wired charging, wireless charging (though it’s not as fast), and most importantly, a nice OnePlus software experience with great performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mMX9ur"&gt;The reason to opt for the 9 Pro over the regular 9 is in some ways the same reason you’d opt for a OnePlus phone over a Samsung phone in the first place: it’s just a little nicer and a little different than what everybody else has in their pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iuxd2s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 26th, 2021 5pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353052/oneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon announced&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; it would support 5G on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro and OnePlus confirmed they will not work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. The review has been updated to note the new information. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The OnePlus 9 gives up a few of the 9 Pro’s features but costs $240 less&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="IFjJBH"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a very good phone that holds its own against other (often more expensive) flagships. It has all the things that truly matter: a great screen, excellent performance, good battery life, and a capable camera. But for better or worse, it still doesn’t feel quite like a device that’s well-suited for the mainstream. It misses a couple of features present on the competition like a stabilized main camera and broad 5G support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9PITs"&gt;Instead, it offers some neat but arguably not as useful extras, like really fast charging and an excellent ultrawide camera. It leaves this device in somewhat unusual territory: it’s good and well-priced, but it’s not the Android flagship I’d recommend to just anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6QDFvf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10406322"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WeBHsj"&gt;What’s here is good; it’s what’s missing that gives me pause. For example, it’s a 5G phone that, at launch, won’t work on two of the three major US carriers’ 5G networks: Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T. OnePlus says it’s working with Verizon on 5G certification, and on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353052/oneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified"&gt;March 26th Verizon announced&lt;/a&gt; it would support 5G. However, OnePlus says that the OnePlus 9 will not support 5G on AT&amp;amp;T. (T-Mobile is selling the OnePlus 9 directly, and as a result, it has no problems with the carrier’s low and mid-band 5G service.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ge5BFF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HDWb3J"&gt;Likewise with the main camera’s lack of optical image stabilization, you may end up with photos that look a bit soft due to camera shake in moderate to dim light. Taking a few extra shots will usually ensure that there’s a tack-sharp one in the bunch, but that workaround doesn’t suit everybody or every situation. OIS would also be a big help with keeping video steady; the 9 offers decent electronic stabilization for this, but results aren’t as smooth as when both technologies are used together. You might know already if you can live with these quirks, but they’re too significant to make this a top all-around pick for the average smartphone buyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qLAqX"&gt;If you’re curious how the 9 stacks up against the higher specs of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;9 Pro sibling&lt;/a&gt;, I have better news: if you opt for this less expensive model, you give up very little. The 9 offers the same Snapdragon 888 processor, top 120Hz refresh rate, 50-megapixel ultrawide camera, and Gorilla Glass back panel as the 9 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0XHjwE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It adds up to a phone that feels like a small step forward, rather than a confident stride into mainstream flagship territory&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HIz4ke"&gt;Here’s what you don’t get versus the more expensive model: a newer 48-megapixel Sony IMX789 main camera sensor, a telephoto camera, main camera stabilization, fast wireless charging, a higher-res screen, millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G, and in some cases, an official IP water and dust resistance rating. Sure, some of those features would be nice to have, but for an additional $240? Personally, I’d save the extra cash and go with the 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oS8IAs"&gt;Compared to last year’s OnePlus 8, the 9 is a little more expensive but also a little better equipped. While you do gain some useful features including 15W Qi wireless charging, a refresh rate boost from 90Hz to 120Hz, Qualcomm’s latest processor, and a bit bigger battery, these feel like necessary evolutions. It adds up to a phone that feels like a small step forward, rather than a confident stride into mainstream flagship territory. That’s a shame because OnePlus had an opportunity to own this premium midrange category that it helped create with a clear standout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 has a slightly smaller screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7cetFjAfrRKtYErNsip_4ScK7t4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388898/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0077_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 (right) features a slightly smaller 6.55-inch screen compared to the 6.7-inch 9 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c4SfW0"&gt;OnePlus 9 screen and build quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="H9XEPs"&gt;OnePlus likes to make a big phone, and the 9 is no exception. It has a 6.55-inch screen with a 20.1:9 aspect ratio, giving it somewhat tall proportions that make it a little more comfortable to use one-handed. The 1080p OLED display is slightly lower-res than the 1440 screen on the 9 Pro, but it offers the same excellent 120Hz refresh rate. This makes animations and scrolling appear very smooth. If you’re coming from a phone with a standard 60Hz display, using the OnePlus 9 will feel a little more slick and polished. Fancy, even. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vEhMG3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a grownup-looking device with fit and finish well-suited to its $730-plus price&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2FmbMm"&gt;You’ll find Gorilla Glass on the front and back panels of the phone, meaning there’s no step down in build quality from the Pro in that sense — the frame is plastic rather than aluminum, but it’s not something I noticed or minded in my time using the device. The 9 does use a flat display rather than the slightly curved screen on the Pro, but that feels like a matter of aesthetics to me and I don’t find it to be a great loss. The flat design is also less prone to accidental touches at the edges of the screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"&gt;like we saw on the OnePlus 8 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. As on the 9 Pro, there’s an optical in-screen fingerprint reader that’s generally quick and reliable. I noticed some failures but not at a high enough rate to bother me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWi63x"&gt;Overall, it’s not a bold or groundbreaking design, but it’s a grownup-looking device with fit and finish well-suited to its $730-plus price. Glass on both the front and back make it feel suitably premium, and the branding on the black unit I tested is tasteful and understated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USYqcV"&gt;The OnePlus 9 sold through T-Mobile — the only US carrier that will offer it directly — will include an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, which is the standard in this flagship class right now. The unlocked version will not have that official rating, but OnePlus tells us that the hardware is all the same. I used the 9 in some of Seattle’s ever-present drizzle and nothing bad happened. So depending on how you buy it, the 9 may not have that stamp of approval, but you can rest assured it’s just as robust as its peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRMyA05Rd4BDDSKSx5GMGL4lo0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388897/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0073_Edit.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mAOYOJ"&gt;OnePlus 9 performance and UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="49bvOd"&gt;The OnePlus 9 uses a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 888 processor and either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. It’s as good as you’ll find in an Android phone at any price right now, so its presence in a $730 phone is a major pro for the 9. I tested the version with 12GB RAM, which is $830, so bear that in mind. But let me tell you — this thing is slick as all heck. Apps load quickly, and jumping from app to home screen and back is seamless. I couldn’t really throw anything at it to slow it down. This is a spot where the OnePlus 9 shines, and it’s an important one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSSAxH"&gt;The 9 turns in good battery performance, too. The 120Hz screen draws more power than last year’s 90Hz display, but this year’s battery is a tad bigger, too: 4,500mAh compared to 4,300mAh. I don’t have any battery complaints, though my typical use is on the moderate side. It’ll get most users through a day and then some, and for those whose use is heavier, OnePlus has another feature to help out: fast wired charging. The included fast charger will take the battery from 1 to 100 percent in a scant 29 minutes. That’s fast enough for you to leave it unplugged overnight and just charge it up during a typical morning routine. Wireless charging is supported, too, which is a nice addition over last year’s model. The 9 is compatible with standard Qi chargers for up to 15W speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="JlRkCs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Being confined to 4G on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon right now isn’t a big deal, but it would be a significant drawback when the carriers start deploying their C-band frequencies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KQENoy"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a 5G phone, as all 2021 flagships must be, but it has a complicated relationship with the technology. The phone supports the more widely used Sub-6GHz frequencies and is certified for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;C-band when it starts arriving in late 2021&lt;/a&gt; but not ultra-fast, super-scarce mmWave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I58Eem"&gt;Not having mmWave is no great loss, but there’s the aforementioned incompatibility with Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G networks. If you buy the phone unlocked, it’ll be LTE only on either of those networks, at least for now. OnePlus says it’s actively working with Verizon on 5G certification, but it couldn’t say if AT&amp;amp;T 5G compatibility would be added with a future software update. Being confined to 4G on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon right now isn’t a big deal — honestly, it’s probably for the best since their 5G networks aren’t very good yet — but it would be a significant drawback when the carriers start deploying their newly acquired C-band frequencies and 5G performance improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="On5Mzo"&gt;The OnePlus 9 ships with the company’s OxygenOS UI built on Android 11. It feels modern and clean, with a few pre-downloaded apps but otherwise not much bloatware. It’s a grownup UI that doesn’t make you look at an ad to check the weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajrcLl"&gt;OnePlus will supply the 9 and 9 Pro with two major Android upgrades and three years of security patches — a healthy life span, but not exactly best in class. Samsung’s flagships get a minimum of four years of security updates, though they slow down toward the end of the device’s life span, while Google provides three years of updates and security patches for Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vJcm5i8ToUvTwCsSFLeezfrkhok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388885/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0060.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 9 features main and ultrawide rear cameras, plus a monochrome sensor for additional black-and-white information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7P6B0H"&gt;OnePlus 9 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZTcSsk"&gt;The OnePlus’ rear camera array, relocated to the upper left of the back panel this year, includes a 48-megapixel main camera, 50-megapixel ultrawide, and 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. On the front is a 16-megapixel selfie camera. It’s a lot of cameras, but not outside the norm for phones in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXxeIG"&gt;The main camera sensor is the Sony IMX689 used by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"&gt;OnePlus 8 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. We liked its image quality in that device, and that’s still generally the case here. Combined with the new Hasselblad color tuning, the OnePlus 9 takes very nice images in good light, and I think does a particularly good job with landscapes. This much-touted “natural” color is fine but didn’t blow me away; it seems prone to occasional oversaturation and white balance misses just as much as any other smartphone’s image processing. It’s certainly not a reason on its own to run out and buy the 9 or 9 Pro, but it hasn’t hurt the output either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FHb2BJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not a reason on its own to buy the 9 or 9 Pro, but it hasn’t hurt the output either&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3fvxDK"&gt;For those who want to get hands-on with image processing rather than leaving it up to the camera, RAW shooting is available. The 9 and 9 Pro shoot 12-bit DNG files via the Pro mode in the camera app. These files contain more color information than the typical 10-bit RAW file you’ll get from most other phone cameras, which is helpful for post-processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYr2sw"&gt;But unlike with a traditional camera, shooting RAW on a phone misses out on the multi-frame image processing that it applies in its standard JPEG mode, which is often better for the final image than editing a single RAW file — even a 12-bit one. It’s a feature that sounds good on paper, and some dedicated mobile photographers might appreciate it, but not one that I can get excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VtOCBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10406484"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="opIP1R"&gt;The 50-megapixel ultrawide chip puts out very nice 12-megapixel images. This camera uses  a new freeform lens featuring a nontraditional design to provide a wide view with minimal distortion. It also uses a 1/1.56-inch sensor that is substantially bigger than what you’ll find on the iPhone 12 and Galaxy S21’s ultrawide cameras. Ultrawide cameras can sort of feel like an afterthought, and this one doesn’t, which I really appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNKmz0"&gt;Back to the main camera, though: it’s good in bright light, but darker conditions like dusk or dim interiors are a challenge. These are the kinds of conditions where optical image stabilization can be a big help keeping things sharp, but unlike the 9 Pro and virtually all of its competitors, the 9 only offers less robust electronic image stabilization. I saw this crop up in a set of portrait mode shots taken outside in dim light that came out a little soft. I got one sharp photo out of the bunch, but I suspect OIS would have helped improve my hit rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y5mU3i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What’s missing from that stack of cameras and sensors is a telephoto camera&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j6ifaR"&gt;On the video side, the 9 supports 8K recording at 30p for up to five minutes per clip. Recording at 4K and 1080 is also offered at 60p or 30p. At 30p in either 4K or 1080 mode, you can enable HDR, though I didn’t see a meaningful difference in dynamic range with it on or off. The OnePlus 9 Pro includes a newer DOL-HDR mode that combines frames of different exposures, which should give better performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNgY3g"&gt;What’s missing from that stack of cameras and sensors is a telephoto camera, which puts the OnePlus 9 on par with the iPhone 12, but behind what Samsung’s S21 and a lot of other phones offer now. There’s still a 2x digital zoom shortcut in the camera app interface. Photos taken this way work okay in a pinch, but there’s an obvious softness if you look closely at them — it really isn’t a great substitute for an actual telephoto camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtPUw9"&gt;Oh, and that 2-megapixel monochrome camera isn’t one you can shoot with directly. As in previous OnePlus phones, its job is to supply additional information when using the monochrome filter mode with the main camera. If it makes a difference, we can’t tell and would much rather just have a telephoto camera next year instead, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yBzo6LDD11ablHx1NwbHiWKMKXc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388873/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0041_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9’s included fast charger is one of its unique features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JtZil6"&gt;The OnePlus 9 checks all the boxes required of a 2021 flagship phone: Snapdragon 888 processor, great high-refresh screen, good battery performance, and cameras aplenty. You’ll get top-of-the-line performance for about $100 less than the other base model flagships. That in itself is a great reason to consider the OnePlus 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNkZBX"&gt;But it’s not the phone I would recommend to absolutely everyone. Its unique propositions feel a little niche to me. Fast charging is neat, with lots of appeal to heavy phone users and travelers, but I think a lot of people are just fine with their overnight charging routine. I love that there’s an above-average ultrawide camera, but I’m probably in the minority here. And the Hasselblad color tuning is fine but nothing remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F9UdGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll get top-of-the-line performance for about $100 less than the other base model flagships&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9of1pT"&gt;What should be easy to recommend — a well-priced phone with great performance — instead carries some significant ifs. &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; extremely fast charging or the bigger screen are especially appealing, then the 9 is a great option. But &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you’re on AT&amp;amp;T and you’d like to keep your phone for a few years, proceed with caution. &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; you want top-notch camera capabilities, or &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; fast charging feels more like a nice-to-have than a must, then you might want to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hzZKs1"&gt;I think with a little tuning, the OnePlus 9 could have been an absolutely killer premium midrange device. And I still think it’s a great device for a subset of the smartphone-buying population. There are just one too many ifs for it to earn the title of class-leader. The OnePlus 9 is very good, but it isn’t a runaway winner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="E25vZ9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10406439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J3SgkP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 23rd, 11:15AM PT: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added detail about the OnePlus 9’s use of plastic rather than metal in the device’s frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSVkUk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 26th, 2021 5pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353052/oneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon announced&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; it would support 5G on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro and OnePlus confirmed they will not work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. The review has been updated to note the new information. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi Mi 11 review: undercutting Samsung</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A great deal if you can get it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="xOHYgJ"&gt;Who is Samsung’s biggest mobile competitor? The first name that comes to mind is Apple, of course. But most people aren’t really in the habit of switching back and forth between iOS and Android with each phone purchase. So who is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7rtoAT"&gt;Samsung is consistently ranked as the biggest phone maker in the world. Huawei is usually number two, largely because of its sales in China where Samsung is a nonentity. And number three right now is Xiaomi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RmTVP"&gt;The reason I bring this up is because Xiaomi’s latest flagship phone, the Mi 11, is not only extremely good in its own right but a phone that arguably outflanks Samsung’s latest lineup. It costs less than the $799 Galaxy S21 in markets where it’s sold, but in many ways, it has more in common with the $1,199 S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtftQU"&gt;The Mi 11 would be a strong competitor to any S21 phone if you saw the two next to each other in a US carrier store. The only problem is you won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zA1dnA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10371499"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UB9Pg7"&gt;The Mi 11 isn’t particularly exciting to look at, but it’s well-built and solidly designed. It follows Xiaomi’s usual glass sandwich blueprint, with a frosted glass back panel and an iridescent but fairly understated gradient finish. The biggest visual flourish is the squircle-shaped camera bump, which features three distinct layers stepping up to the large primary lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWCLX6"&gt;With a 6.8-inch screen, this is not going to be a phone for people who prefer smaller devices, but it manages to feel relatively svelte all the same. The slight chin below the display is very thin, and the screen curves gently on the sides. At 8.1mm thick and weighing 196 grams, it’s noticeably thinner and a little lighter than last year’s Mi 10, with a slightly smaller (but still big) 4,600mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zSAt51"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Mi 11 more than passes the “feels like a flagship” test&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="klqqBv"&gt;That may well have something to do with its Snapdragon 888 processor, which is Qualcomm’s high-end chip for 2021; unlike last year’s 865, the 5G modem is integrated directly into the SoC, saving space and power. My Mi 11 review unit pairs the 888 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, though more expensive models have options for 12GB and 256GB, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dB5wnF"&gt;In use, the Mi 11 more than passes the “feels like a flagship” test. As expected based on the spec sheet, it’s as fast and responsive as any Android phone on the market. There’s a strong haptics system, and the Harman Kardon-branded stereo speakers sound good, though I’m not sure they have anything in common with my long-serving &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.harmankardon.com%2Fcomputer-speakers%2FSOUNDSTICKS%2BIII.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310843%2Fxiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SoundSticks&lt;/a&gt;. Xiaomi’s MIUI 12 software is based on Android 11, and it’s far more streamlined than earlier iterations; Xiaomi has come a long way with its software design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUBxP9"&gt;Battery life is strong: I got almost exactly five hours of screen time on one recent day of testing, and more than three of those hours involved using the phone to take photos and videos in bright, direct sunlight, all with the screen at its maximum 120Hz and 1440p settings.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mi 11 has a nearly identical screen to the Samsung S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LqkdLs"&gt;That brings me to the display. If the Mi 11’s screen isn’t identical to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;much-vaunted OLED panel found in Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, it’s extremely similar. Both are 6.8-inch curved LTPO OLED panels with a 120Hz refresh rate, a 3200 x 1440 resolution, and a maximum brightness of 1,500 nits. What matters is that the Mi 11’s display is extremely good, which it is. It’s sharp and smooth, with excellent contrast and color reproduction, and the extra brightness is noticeable on sunny days. I know not everyone is a fan of curved screen edges, but these are about as subtle as it gets, and I didn’t have any issues with visual distortion or accidental touch input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzYiIO"&gt;My only complaint about the screen is a weird one: the corners are cut at a more dramatic angle than the edges of the phone itself, resulting in a bezel that intrudes more than it probably should. I’m not sure why Xiaomi designed the phone this way — the otherwise similar Mi 10 didn’t do this — but the effect is quite odd. Still, it’s not something I’ve really noticed since I first started using the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzcVNm"&gt;I’ll also add that the optical in-display fingerprint sensor in the Mi 11 is sometimes noticeably slower than what I tend to see in phones from competitors like Vivo and Oppo. It’s rarely inaccurate, but the half-second it normally takes to recognize my fingerprint can sometimes feel closer to a second, and those split-second delays do add up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nWq4WFe31gkIXYDVt8ncUjLqy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341984/DSCF7532.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mi 11’s main camera uses the same sensor as last year’s Mi 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tc8QRC"&gt;One area where Xiaomi seems to have saved money on the Mi 11 is its camera system. The primary sensor is the same 108-megapixel Samsung ISOCELL Bright HMX from the Mi 10, which Xiaomi says it co-developed with Samsung’s component division. It’s backed up by a 13-megapixel ultrawide and a 5-megapixel “telemacro,” meaning there’s no real telephoto capability unless you want to get really close to your subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNI7Ku"&gt;Despite the pedestrian hardware, I’m generally happy with how the Mi 11 cameras perform, particularly considering its price. Detail and dynamic range are strong in good light, with fairly neutral color rendition, and low-light performance also holds up well. The biggest weakness is dim lighting situations that fall between those two extremes, which can get noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ficAVj"&gt;The large, high-resolution sensor has its benefits, but there are clear drawbacks. You might value the fact that it offers shallower depth of field (without a portrait mode) than most other phones, for example, but you’ll also have to deal with occasionally busy bokeh or areas of the scene that appear unexpectedly out of focus. And while the 108-megapixel sensor can render a lot of detail, it’s absolutely not a substitute for a telephoto lens; pictures taken at even 2x digital zoom exhibit a lot of artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_L4ar3mORQuysQYWY4S8GG1vRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344505/IMG_20210211_175537.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sBdMuwrBwGQUfQVI7ynl3GArIjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344506/IMG_20210211_143734.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/20NxvunWA-68-_5gwgrJ2Ueekrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344507/IMG_20210221_124336_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8TfqCDHzhc5TUD_9rf68OAX8TsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344508/IMG_20210206_173725.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RDkFET"&gt;I wouldn’t normally even mention the macro lens, which is often a useless 2-megapixel sensor thrown at a phone just so the maker can claim a triple- or quad-camera system, but the Mi 11’s 5-megapixel 50mm-equivalent unit is a little better than most. It actually autofocuses, for one thing, which makes it much easier to capture what you’re trying to see close up. I still don’t feel the need for an extreme macro lens on my phone, but I was at least able to use it to check out the tiny &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;PlayStation icons texture on my PS5 controller&lt;/a&gt;. So there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0ZLtc"&gt;Overall, the Mi 11 camera system is more than fit for purpose, but it’s also perhaps the only thing about this phone that doesn’t go toe-to-toe with more expensive flagships. The lack of a telephoto lens hurts it, and the last-gen image sensor has its quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jAC2nqt2b4m5gwbic4vBnEiUlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341985/DSCF7534.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fit and finish of the Mi 11 are comparable to any premium phone you might find.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lB1wvq"&gt;My biggest takeaway from the Mi 11 is that Samsung is lucky Xiaomi doesn’t sell phones in the US. The Galaxy S21 starts at a full 100 euros more than the €749 Mi 11, despite having a smaller, lower-resolution screen and a plastic back. The same goes for the S21 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYqkqI"&gt;The €1,249 S21 Ultra is where the comparison gets interesting. Samsung’s highest-end phone is far more expensive, but Xiaomi matches or beats it spec-for-spec except on the battery and the camera. The S21 might be the better all-around phone for people who can afford it, but if I lived in Europe, I know which one I’d consider to be a better value for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZmGHw"&gt;That’s the rub, though. At this point, Europe is one of the few places where Xiaomi and Samsung actually compete with one another at the high end. Until that changes, flagship Android phone buyers in the US won’t have much reason to consider Xiaomi part of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KVnynN"&gt;The Mi 11 isn’t a phone so spectacular that I would urge you to jump through import hoops in order to acquire one. It’s just a very good phone that will be an extremely compelling option in any market where it’s sold. If you happen to live in one of them, it has my strong recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola Moto G Stylus (2021) review: the write stuff</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Your best bet for a budget phone with a stylus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eyIWAy"&gt;Calling the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-moto-g-stylus-gen-2%2Fp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311690%2Fmotorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 Motorola Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt; the best budget stylus phone feels a bit like a backhanded compliment. There’s more or less just one other contender for that title, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301223/lg-stylo-6-review"&gt;the LG Stylo 6&lt;/a&gt;, which is too underpowered to recommend. But the G Stylus doesn’t just win by default; it’s actually a well-rounded and capable phone for under $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrJn6O"&gt;It offers a big 6.8-inch 1080p screen, a generous 128GB of built-in storage, and a Snapdragon 678 processor with 4GB of RAM. Motorola &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218732/motorola-moto-g-stylus-power-play-2021-one-5g-ace-specs-price-release-date-budget"&gt;introduced it earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; with a $299 MSRP, though it’s now selling for $279 from the manufacturer and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERktRf"&gt;Other highlights include a 48-megapixel main camera accompanied by ultrawide and macro rear cameras, a 4,000mAh battery, a “water-repellant” design, and a fingerprint sensor embedded in the recessed power button. It’s a well-rounded set of features for a budget device, even without considering the G Stylus’ headline feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1CMXfG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10372411"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xMwyscYsaBk45_Mxu3BlvMy9hSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336738/ajohnson_210228_4453_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G Stylus includes apps for note-taking, doodling, and coloring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A24AIo"&gt;Moto G Stylus (2021) stylus features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Jio0dS"&gt;The main selling point is definitely the G Stylus’ stylus, so let’s cover that first. Like the Stylo 6, the G Stylus includes a built-in capacitive stylus tucked into the bottom-right corner of the device. Popping it out brings up a quick menu of shortcuts to stylus-friendly apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twmfhO"&gt;There’s a note-taking app and a shortcut to take and annotate a screenshot. You can also jot down a quick note without unlocking the screen. It’s a basic set of features — nothing too advanced like what the Galaxy Note series offers — but with a couple of neat bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GbZ0AIeUWlcJoEYrQ0CqKKtx11s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343035/Screenshot_20210301_163539_resized.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With AI, the phone can recognize what you’re trying to draw and turn it into a coloring book template.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i26b5z"&gt;First, messaging apps support handwriting-to-text conversion. This is a Gboard setting you can enable on any Android device, but it’s available by default on the G Stylus. Pressing the “globe” icon to the left of the spacebar opens up the handwriting panel. Write your message, and watch it appear in the text line above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEE9d9"&gt;The Moto G Stylus’ other trick is the ability to create cinemagraphs, still images with a moving element. To create one, you’ll basically take a short video clip, holding the camera still. Then you use the stylus to draw on the areas of the scene with motion. The rest will remain frozen as a still image. You don’t necessarily need a stylus for this, but the added precision is helpful. Results can be saved as an MP4 or a GIF. The app does a decent job of stabilizing a handheld image for a more convincing final product, though the resulting clip is fairly low-res. Still, it’s fun to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2wzF4"&gt;While the LG Stylo 6’s stylus features felt a little more fun and creativity-focused, the Moto G is a little more no-nonsense. Sure, there’s a coloring book app that does a neat trick of using AI to identify a rudimentary sketch of a cat and turn it into a template for your digital “crayons.” But where’s the animated GIF creator? Or an app that records as you sketch so you can text your friends and show off your mad doodling skills? These things exist in third-party apps, no doubt. But the native feature set feels, for better or worse, a little more grown-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jy_YBGfEcsjz-eNJ2sdY4-5mBxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336740/ajohnson_210228_4453_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Stylus features a big 6.8-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NH82aJ"&gt;Moto G Stylus (2021) screen and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nyPqnf"&gt;The Stylus’ screen is nothing fancy — standard 60Hz refresh rate LCD — but it’s a decently bright and large 6.8-inch 1080p display. The phone itself is, naturally, also large and on the heavier side, but the slightly rounded edges of its back panel make it more comfortable to hold than its dimensions suggest. It looks a little ridiculous peeking out of the top of a yoga pants pocket, but this stylus-packing device was never meant to be ultra pocketable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GsK6T"&gt;The G Stylus uses a Snapdragon 678 processor with 4GB of RAM, and this combination feels more than adequate for day-to-day tasks. Apps load quickly, and jumping between them feels snappy. There are some occasional hiccups and slight slowdowns when scrolling through media-rich apps like Twitter, but nothing that feels too frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y8eANu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I had no problem getting through a full day with plenty of battery life left to spare&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="spyXqe"&gt;Battery life is also good — not outstanding but thoroughly sufficient. Motorola claims the Stylus will get two days to a single charge, which feels like a little bit of a stretch in my experience. More importantly, I had no problem getting through a full day, including two-plus hours of screen time, with plenty of battery life left to spare. Motorola includes a 10W charger, which it calls “Turbo Power” when it’s connected. Charging speeds are more average than “Turbo”: 10 minutes of charge got me an extra 10 percent, and it took about 40 minutes total to bring an 80 percent battery up to full charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3Sirp"&gt;The Moto G Stylus ships with Android 10 and is expected to get an update to Android 11. Motorola doesn’t say exactly when, but G Stylus owners can keep an eye on the &lt;a href="https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/software-upgrade/g_id/1949"&gt;company’s software update page&lt;/a&gt; for more information. Motorola’s budget device support isn’t great; the phone will get just two years of security updates, ending in January 2023. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; that even its budget A-series Galaxy phones will now be guaranteed four years of security updates. Hopefully, that’s a policy more manufacturers like Motorola will consider adopting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F3eiDKGk5p3t3cGZ7uL5br-M_hs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336741/ajohnson_210228_4453_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylus includes standard wide, ultrawide, and macro rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DkYomP"&gt;Moto G Stylus (2021) camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dk909J"&gt;The triple camera on the G Stylus is the same found on the $400-ish &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22255202/motorola-one-5g-ace-review"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace&lt;/a&gt;, with the addition of a dedicated depth sensor. To recap, that includes a 48-megapixel f/1.7 main camera that produces 12-megapixel images, an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DV5N2C"&gt;There are no surprises here. Like the Ace, the G Stylus is capable of good-quality images in bright light, particularly from the main camera. Downsampling from 48 megapixels to 12 allows it to capture plenty of detail, but if you look close, you’ll see some crunchy-looking sharpening. Colors are reproduced well, without looking overly saturated. As an exception, the camera seems to boost saturation and warmth when it identifies a subject as food. The results are more appetizing, if a little unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y0nxv7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10372367"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NNoFvO"&gt;Unfortunately, the ultrawide camera is less good. Even photos taken in bright light show smeary details and some ugly noise. A photo I took of a city street has an unusual purple tint, while a photo from the main camera in the same spot looks much better. This is all evident even at smaller image sizes for social sharing, which is unfortunate. The macro camera is bad, but the selfie camera is a little sharper and better than expected from a budget phone. Win some, lose some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iP1sSz"&gt;While the camera system on the Ace was a bit of a letdown, it feels about right on the less expensive Moto G Stylus. You won’t find an amazing night mode or top-notch picture quality here, but for a sub-$300 phone, it does the job just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0JIEeXAt6iw_y6wEeLjcPgr3duc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336739/ajohnson_210228_4453_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G Stylus is a well-rounded budget device, even if you don’t care about its pen-focused features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qbxBxO"&gt;The Moto G Stylus is a well-rounded budget phone that also happens to have a stylus. Of Motorola’s 2021 budget devices that I’ve tested so far, this one offers the best balance of features and cost-saving measures. It has a big display, stylus features, good battery life, and solid everyday performance. The cameras, though flawed, are good enough to get by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NvcBBw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the obvious choice for someone looking for a budget stylus phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K8UcUv"&gt;This is the obvious choice for someone looking for a budget stylus phone, but I hesitate to recommend it to everyone else. The $299 OnePlus Nord N10 5G offers a faster refresh rate screen, a better camera, and slightly better performance for nearly the same price. If you can afford to spend a bit more, the $349 Google Pixel 4A will offer better software support and a great camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="X1RZZp"&gt;If you’re a stylus devotee or even just strongly stylus-curious, the Moto G Stylus is a good choice. But if you’re ambivalent toward the stylus, you might be better off with one of these other options.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG Stylo 6 review: great stylus features, sketchy performance</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Its built-in stylus is useful and enjoyable, but the Stylo 6 is too slow to recommend&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="h4S2g0"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733319724591682516" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG Stylo 6&lt;/a&gt; is a sub-$300 phone with a built-in stylus, which puts it in exclusive company: the $299 Motorola Moto G Stylus is more or less its only direct competition. For its $270 price, the Stylo 6 offers good battery performance; a big, bright screen; and the handy pen-derived features that stylus life offers. But as much fun as I had doodling on its generously sized screen, it’s just too slow to recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL5PdO"&gt;That’s a shame because I genuinely enjoyed aspects of using this phone. I couldn’t seem to drain the battery below the 30 percent mark even on a day of heavy usage, and I experienced real enjoyment texting my spouse a precisely drawn, animated doodle of a farting butt. Photos look good on its vivid, wide 6.8-inch screen, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover while rewatching &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; (don’t worry, I talk to my therapist about this) that it has stereo speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUhKMV"&gt;Unfortunately, that enjoyment was overshadowed every time the phone took an extra beat to switch between apps, open Twitter, load my Instagram feed, or start my Google Maps navigation. It’s not unusably slow, but it is quite noticeably slow. If you have the patience of a small insect like I do, there’s a fine line between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UqXxuN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10361691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BDKppqf5SpMvj0nAigrnc53mNuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320967/ajohnson_210222_4437__004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylo offers a large 6.8-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QjkepT"&gt;LG Stylo 6 screen and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8Uz8fQ"&gt;The Stylo 6 is a large phone, as you’d expect a phone with a stylus to be. It offers a 6.8-inch 1080p LCD with a standard 60Hz refresh rate and modest bezels. Its dimensions are similar to the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, also a large phone, except that it’s slightly taller. The screen itself is plenty bright and vivid, and the aforementioned stereo speakers make watching videos that bit nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNK9sC"&gt;I found the phone overall too big to use comfortably one-handed, and it felt awkward in even large coat pockets. That’s beside the point, though, if you’re considering the Stylo then you probably already know you want a large phone, so to each their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZOWPT"&gt;The Stylo 6 offers a Mediatek Helio P35 chipset and 3GB of RAM. Herein lies the Stylo 6’s troubles: this processor and RAM combination just doesn’t offer enough power for this phone. I noticed stuttering often as I scrolled through media-rich screens on Twitter and Instagram. Ditto the previously mentioned slowness opening and switching between apps, and the camera suffers from laggy processing speeds, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="y6tvY0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not unusably slow, but it is quite noticeably slow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ob9G3z"&gt;I sometimes tapped the screen, then wondered if the phone had recognized the tap a split second before it opened an app or whatever I was trying to do. Conversely, I’d tap the screen too lightly or quickly and wait an extra second before realizing it hadn’t registered, just because I’d gotten used to giving the phone a little extra time to do everything. This would all be more forgivable (if still frustrating) on a $200 phone, but depending where you get the Stylo 6, it’s pushing closer to $300 and should really do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2sAoc"&gt;If there’s a bright spot to the phone’s processing woes, it’s that battery life is great — possibly as a side effect. The Stylo 6 has a 4,000mAh battery, and after a typical day with two-plus hours of screen-on time, I was usually down to only 70 percent. I was sure a day of heavier use with Google Maps navigation, Spotify, and more social media scrolling than usual would challenge it, but nope. I didn’t even drain it enough for a low battery warning before plugging it in at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IYJSw"&gt;There’s just one configuration offered with 64GB of built-in storage, which isn’t great, but it’s expandable by way of microSD. It ships with Android 10 and, unfortunately, a lot of preloaded apps and games that you probably don’t want. LG isn’t known for a generous upgrade schedule so it’s very unlikely the Stylo 6 will see an Android 11 update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vRcl5BKl_rXx6u_nliCoGGMhhlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320964/ajohnson_210222_4437__001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Popping out the stylus brings up some shortcuts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aJgWhZ"&gt;LG Stylo 6 stylus features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rkox7W"&gt;Of course, the stylus features are a big (sorry) draw here. The stylus is tucked away and spring-loaded into the lower-right corner of the device, and it activates a set of shortcuts when it’s removed. You can take a quick note, grab a screenshot or a GIF of whatever’s on your screen, and mark it up with notes, or draw something immature to text to your partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdqUY1ak7gao0vM5Lb1VW1i4_AY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328590/IMG_20210225_092209.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can do useful, productive things with a stylus, but you can do this, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NzV0Qp"&gt;Despite Samsung’s Galaxy Note being the de facto stylus phone, LG has been making phones with styluses for ages, and it shows with little UI touches like automatically toggling off gesture navigation when you start a note so that you don’t accidentally swipe out of it. You won’t find advanced features like the (much more expensive) Galaxy Note series offers here such as handwriting-to-text conversion or the ability to use the stylus as a remote control. Basically though, it does all of the things you’d expect it to do, and these features work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLVOBQ"&gt;I was surprised by how much I enjoyed having the stylus available. It’s much easier to draw or write silly notes on images with the pen rather than your finger, which I had basically given up on doing because they always look terrible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qJM5e"&gt;The ability to also jot down a quick note without even turning the screen on is something I really appreciated. I feel like I’m always fumbling to unlock my phone, find the notes app, and open a new note just to type out something quick like an email address or a song title. None of this is unique compared to a Galaxy Note, of course, but the Stylo 6 has a set of genuinely useful features that aren’t very common, especially at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLKC-lmsKjADAsgqK63vIZ9GrSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320968/ajohnson_210222_4437__005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylo 6 features standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras, plus a depth sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P1fCne"&gt;LG Stylo 6 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cjD45v"&gt;The Stylo includes a 13-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel depth sensor, and a 13-megapixel selfie camera. That’s not a lot of resolution to work with, but it’s enough to allow the Stylo to take decent-quality images in good light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjHUA9"&gt;White balance occasionally leans a little too magenta or too green, which sometimes gave an effect I liked — kind of a nostalgic film-like quality. At other times, images just looked too cool and washed out. I like how the Stylo handles high-contrast scenes; the HDR effect doesn’t look too strong. Your preview image will look overly dark, but an HDR icon on the screen indicates that the final image will look much more balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mwvw8"&gt;Images in low light or moderate indoor lighting look okay for social media but show a lot of smeared detail if you look closely. The ultrawide lens is somewhat limited by its low-res sensor. Even in bright daylight shots details look smoothed over, and it’s just not up to low light photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UfnwHC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10361491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5cDMaZ"&gt;The camera is also a victim of the phone’s underpowered processor, particularly in portrait mode. The live preview is quite laggy, which gets worse once you push the shutter and wait for the phone to process the image. This can take as long as six seconds, during which you’re unable to take another image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1iNah"&gt;It’s hard to know if you got the right frame of your subject, and it’s a frustrating experience trying to photograph a subject that’s moving even just a little bit because you can’t “spray and pray.” The camera keeps shutter speeds relatively low, too, so blurry subjects can be a problem. By sheer luck I got a portrait mode photo of my cat mid-yawn, but I wouldn’t count on being able to do that again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfLINq"&gt;I captured a few images with the Stylo that I really like, but I felt like it was more in spite of the camera rather than because of it. The images this phone captures will look okay on Instagram and Facebook, but overall, the Stylo’s camera capabilities lag behind most other devices at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VhETtn7zE5XDblbQ0DDcTTKR-ME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320965/ajohnson_210222_4437__002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylo 6 offers a lot of likable stylus-based features, but it’s ultimately too slow to recommend.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="F0GltV"&gt;The Stylo 6 has a few good things going for it: an affordable price, built-in stylus, big screen, and great battery life. But factoring in its shortcomings, namely an underpowered processor, it’s not a device I can easily recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sgRTD8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even around its $270 price, there are many other more capable options&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="neYcAs"&gt;Even around its $270 price, there are many other more capable options. The $300 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; offers a better camera and processor. The 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; includes a massive battery and better processor performance for $200. Neither of those comes with a stylus, of course, but I don’t think the Stylo 6 is even your best bet for an inexpensive phone with a stylus: for just a little more, the 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218732/motorola-moto-g-stylus-power-play-2021-one-5g-ace-specs-price-release-date-budget" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt; offers better performance and an upgraded camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCkXdH"&gt;If speed isn’t a concern, a stylus is a must-have, and the price is right, I think you can live a reasonably happy life with this phone. Maybe my patience is just too thin, and a more enlightened person can coexist peacefully with it. The rest of us would do best to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZYqwTfbX2vk4FqDWTzaFfIYSDU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67732462/vpavic_200805_4131_0086_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6vCZGK"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget, we’ve got good news: there are more great, affordable phones on the market than ever. Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with budget devices that make smart sacrifices to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16ya9R"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone that much harder. Bear in mind that it’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point; instead, prioritize the features that matter most to you. You’ll have an easier time deciding, and you’ll end up with a great phone that you should be able to use for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWHEzs"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s coming up on a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people.  While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXvGVa"&gt;If you’re looking for the best cheap Android phone, then we think the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a great option. It has an excellent camera and good software, though its screen is smaller than a lot of the competition at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHj2r3"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a more expensive model: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight A’s in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GatTSx"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="R7dgPY"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Even though it’s almost a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on your investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnYJlm"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4OnLv"&gt;It’s a familiar design and not one that screams “modern.” But in exchange, you get a lot of value. The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is a year behind the latest and greatest. (That would be the A14 chipset in the iPhone 12 lineup.) However, it’s still one of the fastest processors you can get on any phone, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; one in this price bracket. Normally, speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFxDqg"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XX01cV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BTqdjy"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBJCKR"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2021 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately, there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lM0nvh"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four or five years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s strong support network, and a huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ykrqeX"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uGMHIJ_EFkQE2rMcf3ISzHc3EYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21691927/vpavic_4113_20200721_0041.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lIP45s"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PmYbc8"&gt;The best inexpensive Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ndqid1"&gt;If you prefer Android, want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen is on the small side, and it doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android and is first in line for updates from Google. The 4A came out in August last year, but it’s still guaranteed to get software updates until at least August 2023. It comes in either black or baby blue with 128GB of storage for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlVUW4"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software. (The sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special.) That means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rrz5GM"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI4c7K"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it. That puts you first in line for Android updates and also guarantees you’ll get them for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkeXFo"&gt;Unfortunately, in a couple of years, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be on its last legs. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time, it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlXbHh"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWBCf6"&gt;The best all-around Android phone outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VceItk"&gt;Technically, saying the OnePlus Nord costs less than $500 doesn’t make much sense because it’s not available in the US, and the company doesn’t plan to sell it in the States. But if you live in a market where it’s available, the OnePlus Nord is the kind of phone that aims for a solid B grade in every category instead of trying to ace one or two. For £379 / €399, it’s a safe Android bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCe0u5"&gt;The OnePlus Nord has a couple of features that are normally reserved for much more expensive phones: support for sub-6 5G networks and a high refresh rate 90Hz display. If you live in an area where 5G is built out, you may notice faster download speeds. But it’s the display that’ll have a bigger impact on your day-to-day experience. It makes everything feel smoother and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdWibC"&gt;You will miss out on wireless charging and a headphone jack with the Nord, but they’re really the only big things that are lacking. Battery life is strong, the 6.44-inch screen is big and beautiful, and the software is less annoying than some competitors (though not as clean as Google’s). The £379 / €399 model comes with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, both plenty good for this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5llXq"&gt;As for cameras, there are a bunch of them — maybe even too many. There’s a standard, an ultrawide, and a macro camera on the back as well as a couple of selfie cameras on the front. As is the norm with most smartphone cameras these days, they will get you decent photos in decent light but fall down a bit in the dark. You’ll mostly want to use the main camera, as the ultrawide has a noticeable drop in quality, and the macro is only good for, well, macro or close-up shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;All too often, phones at this price point have some critical compromise you’re forced to make in order to get the feature you really want. With the OnePlus Nord, there’s no big flaw you’ll have to work around. Again, though, it’s not available in the US. You can import it, but it’s not recommended as it won’t work correctly on US LTE networks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even without considering 5G, the Pixel 4A 5G has other strong benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ARB606"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="L6XTYh"&gt;A big screen with timely software updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0TPXKd"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G is good for all the reasons that the Pixel 4A is good: it has a great camera, good battery life, and clean Google software. Maybe most importantly, it has a bigger 6.2-inch screen, which is spacious but doesn’t make the phone feel too gigantic. It also uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor, which means it’s faster than the Pixel 4A and nearly all the rest of the sub-$500 Android phones you can find. And there’s support for 5G, of course, which is largely underwhelming in the US right now, but might actually be good toward the end of this phone’s lifespan. It all adds up to a $499 price that’s just under the wire for this category, though the Verizon version, unfortunately, costs $100 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ll5Zxc"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G has a slightly better camera system compared to the Pixel 4A, thanks to the inclusion of an ultrawide sensor. Google has also made its excellent Night Sight mode automatic and improved video with some new stabilization modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0i98AR"&gt;Otherwise, it follows the standard low-cost Pixel formula. It has a plastic back with a fingerprint sensor and a headphone jack. Google doesn’t load down the software with extra crapware you don’t want, but it does include some nice little touches like a voice recorder that automatically creates a transcription as it records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvxYa1"&gt;Someday, not having 5G will be a serious downside for smartphones, but that reality is still at least a year or two away. Even if you ignore the potentially faster network speeds, the Pixel 4A 5G is a surprisingly great phone.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pPPrl"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qyzV16"&gt;If you want 5G for the least amount possible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0wGhHB"&gt;At $299, the N10 5G is well below the threshold for this category. Given its price, you might expect to see some significant sacrifices compared to a $400 or $500 phone, and OnePlus has made a few. But they’re smart sacrifices that add up to a device that’s really quite good for the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4uVX"&gt;You won’t find a fantastic screen here, although its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits. It also ships with Android 10, which OnePlus says it will update to 11, and is only offering two years of security updates in addition to that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXW2WO"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 4A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y00B08"&gt;If you can afford to spend a little more, you probably should. A device with better support in the long run will save you some money later. But if budget is a major consideration, the N10 5G is about as good as it gets at this price. It offers the future-proofiness of sub-6GHz 5G support, a thoroughly decent camera, good battery life, a capable processor, and a fairly clean implementation of Android. It’s not a standout in any one way, but as a total package, it’s very hard to argue with its capabilities at this price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A51 offers an excellent screen for the price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CzLtDJ"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A51&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KnMCx2"&gt;The best phone if you want a big screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="T9fywV"&gt;Samsung’s $399 Galaxy A51 Android phone may well turn out to be the bestselling phone of 2020. Its predecessor, the Galaxy A50, outshone all expectations. For the A51, Samsung focused on nailing a big screen, good battery life, and the camera. It got the screen just right; the other two are just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJX5CI"&gt;The 6.5-inch OLED display on the A51 is bright and vivid, and you’d have to be pretty persnickety to find fault in it. It doesn’t offer the same high refresh rate you can get on the OnePlus Nord, but it makes up for that with Samsung’s great quality. If there’s one weird thing about the screen, it’s that Samsung put a chrome bezel around the hole punch for the front-facing selfie camera. It’s distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCdhK7"&gt;The A51 sports nice build quality, though you can definitely feel that it’s plastic on the back. It has a headphone jack and 128GB of storage, which is the number you should be aiming for on any phone these days. Battery life should be superb, thanks to a 4,000mAh battery, but because it has to power that big screen, it nets out to being just so-so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jy99L8"&gt;As is becoming a (weird) standard on this class of phone, the A51 has a regular wide-angle, an ultrawide, a depth sensor, and a macro camera. And as is also standard, the regular wide-angle will get you the best images. The A51 can’t beat the Pixel 4A for quality, but the different lens options might be more fun for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryPHx5"&gt;Samsung recently committed to providing the A51 with three generations of Android software updates, which is great news. Less great is that it usually takes Samsung longer than you may like to get software updates out to the A-line of phones. Samsung has also started to junk up its previously elegant One UI software interface with ads and other junkware, so be prepared to do some cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNhSDh"&gt;On the whole, though, what the A51 gets you is a very big, very beautiful screen. If that’s your highest priority — and for many people, it is — the A51 is a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 Moto G Power offers days-long battery performance but makes a lot of sacrifices for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NSb4tw"&gt;The Moto G Power does exactly what it says it will: provide days and days of power on a single charge, thanks to its larger-than-average 5,000mAh battery. This is a slightly different version of last year’s phone with the same name, and it starts at a lower $200 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7tVXv"&gt;The lower price tag does come with trade-offs. It includes just 32GB of built-in storage, so adding a microSD card for some extra space is a must. There’s also a slightly slower processor on board, and while it’s capable enough for all of your daily needs, it’s a little laggy jumping between apps and opening the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8syWIE"&gt;As for the camera: it’s just okay. Motorola did away with the ultrawide in this year’s models, so you’ll just be working with the 48-megapixel standard wide and 2-megapixel macro cameras in addition to an 8-megapixel selfie cam. Photos in bright outdoor light look good with plenty of detail, though colors can be a little washed out. The camera struggles with high-contrast scenes and low light, but all things considered, it’s fine for a $200 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;If top-notch battery performance is an extremely important feature in your smartphone, then the Moto G Power should be on your shortlist. It’s capable, and you really will get multiple days of battery life on a charge. But if you’re fine getting by on a battery that’s just average, then we think you’ll be happier with a more well-rounded device.&lt;/p&gt;
