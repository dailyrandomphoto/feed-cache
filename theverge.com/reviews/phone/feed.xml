    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="J5m9NK"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget, we’ve got good news: there are more great, affordable phones on the market than ever. Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with budget devices that make smart sacrifices to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWFA5k"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone that much harder. Bear in mind that it’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point; instead, prioritize the features that matter most to you. You’ll have an easier time deciding, and you’ll end up with a great phone that you should be able to use for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JHLP0"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s well over a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people. While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gY4Mp"&gt;If you’re looking for the best cheap Android phone, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; is our top choice right now. You won’t find a big, show-stopping screen here, or bells and whistles like a fast refresh rate screen. Instead, you get a phone that covers the basics really well, plus IP67 waterproofing and timely software updates — all at a lower price than last year’s model.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQUJ3j"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a more expensive model: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight A’s in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bkDOPH"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Even though it’s over a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on your investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZnehD"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market. High refresh-rate screens with smoother animations and scrolling have been trickling down into the budget class recently, and you definitely won’t find one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOgwn4"&gt;It’s a familiar design and not one that screams “modern.” But in exchange, you get a lot of value. The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is a year behind the latest and greatest. (That would be the A14 chipset in the iPhone 12 lineup.) However, it’s still one of the fastest processors you can get on any phone, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; one in this price bracket. Normally, speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LjWN"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5TvHua"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tETMb0"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAfzxG"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2021 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately, there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nB1ZXR"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four or five years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s strong support network, and a huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="smYbEU"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OsDX3SyDEYXfF58kJLK4zYKEcXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781446/ajohnson_210813_4713_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A’s 6.34-inch screen isn’t huge, but it’s just big enough to not look out of place next to the 6.5-inch competition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="B9aQm4"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MeddEq"&gt;The best budget Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VAnoi0"&gt;The $449 Pixel 5A features a 6.34-inch OLED screen that’s on the smaller side for the budget class, but it’s bigger than the previous-gen 6.2-inch panel on the Pixel 4A 5G. There’s a bigger battery too, a 4,680mAh cell that will last through a full day of heavy use and well into day two if you’re a lighter user. The 5A also offers IP67 water resistance for added peace of mind in the event of accidental spills or tumbles into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMgcHa"&gt;That’s more or less the extent of the 5A’s improvements over its predecessor, and that’s fine. The 4A 5G was already a well-equipped midrange device and the 5A makes some strategic updates to its foundation. The dual standard / ultrawide rear-facing camera, Snapdragon 765G processor, and 6GB RAM / 128GB storage combination served the 4A 5G well and still deliver solid performance in this iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hdocxa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 5A is also getting somewhat of a limited release — it’s only available in the US and Japan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iQBwQn"&gt;Another thing we can count on Pixel phones to do well is software, and the 5A is no exception. It ships with Google’s own Android 11 OS and is refreshingly free of the added clutter that other manufacturers sometimes pile onto it. The Pixel 5A is also guaranteed three years of OS platform upgrades and security updates, which isn’t quite as long as Apple or Samsung’s standard software support timespan, but is certainly better than a lot of the Android competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQGX8e"&gt;There’s also, of course, 5G connectivity. You won’t get the super-fast mmWave flavor of 5G support, but that’s a highly range-limited network that’s still pretty hard to find. That’s fine, but there’s a weird question mark over whether Google will support another set of frequencies that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will start using later this year called C-band. The company isn’t committing to making the necessary software update to use it, despite supporting it in hardware. It’s a strange blemish on the 5A’s otherwise strong feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHUScD"&gt;The 5A is also getting somewhat of a limited release — it’s only available in the US and Japan, and isn’t being sold through any of the major US wireless carriers. Taking all of that into consideration, the Pixel 5A is still the inexpensive Android phone that we’d recommend to most people. It’s not flashy, but it’s well priced and has it where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ykrqeX"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7jGjKdcssyDUAL1Vc67gH-WoCNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465667/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G offers a 120Hz fast refresh-rate screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qyhaRs"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7CPw9a"&gt;The best budget Android phone with a fast refresh-rate screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="GW6KVJ"&gt;On the Android side, the Galaxy A52 5G is a great option, albeit at the very top of the price range considered in this guide. It includes some features that aren’t too common in a budget phone, like its fast-refresh rate screen, an IP67 water resistance rating, and for now at least, monthly security updates for fast access to bug fixes and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s379P4"&gt;The A52 5G’s 6.5-inch screen is an OLED panel that’s bright with good contrast that’s generally nice to look at. But its best feature is a subtle one: a 120Hz refresh rate that gives a much smoother appearance to animations and content as you swipe and scroll through menus and social feeds. We’ll likely see this feature make its way into more budget phones soon, but for now the A52 5G is one of only a few to offer better than the standard 60Hz screen in its class, and it makes the experience of using the phone that much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grIaTf"&gt;The phone overall performs well for its class with a Snapdragon 750G processor and 6GB of RAM. You may notice the occasional hesitation or stutter with heavy tasks, but otherwise everyday scrolling, app switching, and navigating is handled easily. And even with a power-hungry display, the Galaxy A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery should get you through at least a day of moderate to heavy use before needing another charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RSNCy0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;if you want to make an investment in a phone that you can keep using years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwHMHO"&gt;One of the A52 5G’s not-so-bright-spots is Samsung’s current take on Android, which puts a lot of pre-downloaded apps on your phone that you probably don’t want, and it even includes the occasional ad in places like the native weather app. For a cleaner or more grown-up Android skin, look to the Pixel or OnePlus. The Galaxy A52 5G’s camera is another consideration: it’s capable, but it tends toward an oversaturated look. If you prefer a more natural look to your photos, then the Pixel 4A is the winner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFmNNo"&gt;There’s also 5G, which we still don’t think is a feature you should run out and buy a new phone for, but it is nice to have the support here — particularly if you plan to hold on to your phone for a few years. This device doesn’t support super-fast mmWave 5G, but it’s hard to come by so that’s not a huge loss. Importantly, it supports more widely available sub-6GHz bands and should be able to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOCh8W"&gt;You can buy a much less expensive device to get you through the next couple of years, and that’s just fine. But if you do want to make more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mjpWjB"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nCclP5"&gt;The best “get it while you can” affordable Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Uc3Oon"&gt;If you want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt; Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen is on the small side, lacks 5G support, and it doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android and is first in line for updates from Google. The 4A came out in August last year, but it’s still guaranteed to get software updates until at least August 2023. It comes in either black or baby blue with 128GB of storage for $349 but you’ll have to act fast if you want one — with the Pixel 5A and Pixel 6 debuting this fall, Google won’t be selling the 4A for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Huw9Ph"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera. It’s based on generation-old technology at this point, but it’s still the best in this class and it can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,000 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software. (The sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special.) That means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g65TGg"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrF1h5"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it, putting you first in line for Android updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XggNCE"&gt;Unfortunately, in a little over a year’s time, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be slowing down. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time, it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7VV1d"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for well under $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal — while you can still find it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord 2 covers the essentials with a couple of nice touches, like a 90Hz screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Oj4ljX"&gt;A great midrange option if you’re outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hMRHe3"&gt;The OnePlus Nord 2 isn’t sold in the US, and that’s our loss because this follow-up to the original Nord checks all the right boxes for its £399 / €399 price. Even more so than last year’s model, the Nord 2 feels like a pared-down flagship that covers all of the basics well, with (almost) nothing that you don’t need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8pZjK"&gt;The Nord 2 offers a 6.43-inch display with 90Hz refresh rate — a bit faster than the standard 60Hz, but not quite the buttery smoothness of a 120Hz screen. We were a little apprehensive of the MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI chipset that OnePlus has opted for in favor of proven Snapdragon processors, but in testing, it was more than adequate for daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfaweu"&gt;The 4,500mAh battery will comfortably get you through a full day’s use, and although there’s no wireless charging included (not a surprise at this price), OnePlus’ signature fast wired charging is supported. With the included charger, you can power the phone from zero to fully charged in well under an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZKaIkM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Nord 2 ships with OxygenOS 11.3, and is the uncluttered, unfussy experience we’ve come to expect from OnePlus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xdTWar"&gt;OnePlus’ unfussy UI is another strong point. The Nord 2 ships with OxygenOS 11.3, and is the uncluttered, unfussy experience we’ve come to expect from OnePlus. The company says it will offer two OS upgrades and three years of security support for the Nord 2, which is a good, if not great update policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir7jlU"&gt;You won’t find the Hasselblad branding of the OnePlus 9 flagships on the Nord 2’s cameras, and that’s no great loss. What you do get is a capable camera system consisting of a 50-megapixel main stabilized rear camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a questionably useful 2-megapixel monochrome sensor, along with a 32-megapixel selfie camera. Image quality is good all around — photos from the main camera lean into a slightly saturated, punchy look, but nothing distracting. Low-light photos aren’t up there with the Pixel’s, but they work in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;It’s a shame that US customers can’t pick up the Nord 2 (technically you can import it, but it won’t work properly on our wireless bands so it’s not recommended), because it’s an ideal midrange device in a lot of ways. Our loss is the rest of the world’s gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FtL0ba"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711336"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pPPrl"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0wGhHB"&gt;If you want an inexpensive 5G phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zVN77Q"&gt;At $299, the N10 5G is well below the threshold for this category. Given its price, you might expect to see some significant sacrifices compared to a $400 or $500 phone, and OnePlus has made a few. But they’re smart sacrifices that add up to a device that’s really quite good for the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4uVX"&gt;You won’t find a fantastic screen here, although its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits. It also ships with Android 10, which OnePlus says it will update to 11, and is only offering two years of security updates in addition to that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXW2WO"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 4A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y00B08"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is also well worth considering in this price bracket for two very good reasons: it’s a bit less expensive and will be supported with security updates for the next four years. However, it lacks some of the N10’s nice features like a faster refresh rate screen, the camera isn’t as good, and its software feels more cluttered and bloated. The A32 5G is a better pick if you want to hang on to your phone for as many years as possible, but the N10 is a more likable device overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5Ppnc"&gt;If budget is a major consideration, the N10 5G is about as good as it gets at this price. It offers the future-proofiness of sub-6GHz 5G support, a thoroughly decent camera, good battery life, a capable processor, and a fairly clean implementation of Android. It’s not a standout in any one way, but as a total package, it’s very hard to argue with its capabilities at this price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 Moto G Power offers days-long battery performance but makes a lot of sacrifices for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The budget phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NSb4tw"&gt;The Moto G Power does exactly what it says it will: provide days and days of power on a single charge, thanks to its larger-than-average 5,000mAh battery. This is a slightly different version of last year’s phone with the same name, and it starts at a lower $200 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7tVXv"&gt;The lower price tag does come with trade-offs. It includes just 32GB of built-in storage, so adding a microSD card for some extra space is a must. There’s also a slightly slower processor on board, and while it’s capable enough for all of your daily needs, it’s a little laggy jumping between apps and opening the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8syWIE"&gt;As for the camera: it’s just okay. Motorola did away with the ultrawide in this year’s models, so you’ll just be working with the 48-megapixel standard wide and 2-megapixel macro cameras in addition to an 8-megapixel selfie cam. Photos in bright outdoor light look good with plenty of detail, though colors can be a little washed out. The camera struggles with high-contrast scenes and low light, but all things considered, it’s fine for a $200 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;If top-notch battery performance is an extremely important feature in your smartphone, then the Moto G Power should be on your shortlist. It’s capable, and you really will get multiple days of battery life on a charge. But if you’re fine getting by on a battery that’s just average, then we think you’ll be happier with a more well-rounded device.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Play covers all of the basics for well under $200.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0rkwQp"&gt;The best phone under $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8w9H"&gt;There are plenty of options for those shopping on a tighter budget, but the Motorola Moto G Play is the one that stands out to us. It covers the basics well with a big 5,000mAh battery and a Snapdragon 460 processor that does a good enough job handling daily tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwHIya"&gt;The G Play has a generously sized 6.5-inch screen. It’s a lower-resolution panel at 720p and is difficult to see outside in direct light, but it’s more or less just fine. Camera specs are likewise basic: there’s just one rear-facing 13-megapixel camera that performs well in bright light but isn’t well suited for low-light photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTXRvU"&gt;You’ll also want to strongly consider a microSD card purchase with this phone. It only includes 32GB of built-in storage, a lot of which is already occupied by system files. Motorola has only promised security updates for two years, but realistically, the G Play isn’t built to last much longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhtEOa"&gt;It has its shortcomings — the G Play’s performance doesn’t keep up with many phones that are just $50-100 more expensive, for example — but it’s hard to argue with what it does offer for its price: good, basic performance without any major flaws. If there’s flexibility in your budget to spend a little more, you’ll get some meaningful upgrades, like a better camera or a longer-lasting device. But for its price, the G Play does just what it needs to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 review: flipping into the mainstream</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Third time is maybe the charm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="CaJyux"&gt;The story of folding phones thus far has been one of compromise. Choosing a folding phone over a standard slab design has generally meant you compromised on performance, durability, and most of all, price. They’ve been the domain of early adopters, the people willing to put up with those compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6JkBO"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 3 is the first folding phone to challenge all that. It has the same processor as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21 released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen runs at a smooth 120Hz, just like Samsung’s other flagships. It has a new, allegedly more durable construction, plus IP water resistance, just like you’d expect on a modern phone. And most importantly, its starting price is $1,000, $450 less than the launch price of the Z Flip 5G it replaces. That puts the Flip 3 on the same price level as many high-end, non-folding phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpD4D5"&gt;The Flip 3 isn’t necessarily a sure bet, though. There are things it’s not as good at as other, standard phones. Using a folding phone like this is a different experience than many of us are used to. But increasingly, those differences boil down to personal preferences and choices, not compromises. And that means this is the first folding phone that can appeal to mainstream phone buyers, not just early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="O4Rqre"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10708004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OREo3N"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AAOtj_R1-bXv-TGUBnmLE_Gtu5g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790768/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flip 3’s design is very similar to the earlier versions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nLiS6W"&gt;The design of the Flip 3 is largely the same as the first Galaxy Flip and the Flip 5G that both came out last year. The goal of this folding phone is not to turn a normal-sized phone into a tablet, like the Galaxy Fold series, but go the opposite direction: turn a large phone into something that fits easier in your pocket or purse. When closed, the Flip 3 is roughly the size of my wallet, but open it up and you’ve got a spacious, though tall, 6.7-inch screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJePdD"&gt;Also like the earlier Flips, the Flip 3 is rather thick when it’s closed — it’s effectively twice the thickness of normal phones. But that didn’t make it hard to handle or slide into my pocket. Since the Flip 3 is only half as tall as other phones, there’s no concern of it poking out the top of my pants pocket. If anything, it stayed in my pants and jacket pockets &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than tall, thin phones — I never was concerned about it sliding out when I sat down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6O9Kq"&gt;The Flip 3’s hinge is mostly unchanged from last time — it’s still quite stiff and difficult to flick open with one hand, though satisfying to snap shut. (Samsung recommends using two hands to open the phone.) It can be positioned halfway open and stay there, so you can prop the phone up and take selfies, make a video call, or watch a video using only half the display. I never did this and don’t suspect many people outside of Samsung’s marketing materials would either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lZUkZvRj8QPuTjkjFi5r289Ly1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790758/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hinge design is largely unchanged, but Samsung is using a new lubricant and aluminum alloy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YvA0HvTSiaY1G8slJ2HGNcr8mfY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790756/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Flip 3 is about as thick as two phones when closed and yes, there’s still a slight gap when it’s closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGbP2M"&gt;Most of the durability improvements Samsung made are under the hood, including self-curing gaskets to keep out water. You can read about those changes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;more detail in my colleague Dieter Bohn’s piece&lt;/a&gt;, but the takeaway is this: you don’t have to worry about getting the Flip 3 wet, which is quite an accomplishment for a delicate piece of electronics that literally folds in half. You do still have to be conscious of dust and debris — the Flip 3 has no official dust protection rating — and there’s still a visible gap in the hinge when it’s closed. TL;DR: the Flip 3 is good for the pool, not for the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DfnZ5V"&gt;Otherwise, the fit and finish of the Flip 3 is on par with other flagship phones. The cream-colored review unit I have has a unique retro appeal, and its aluminum side rails and hinge have a soft, matte finish to them. (Samsung’s also providing a variety of other color options if cream isn’t your thing.) It doesn’t creak or grind disconcertingly when you open or close it, and the seams and tolerances are nice and tight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EC-gGx42ewCVd9PT6Voq6ODfxNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790754/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flip 3’s cover screen is four times larger than before, but it’s still too small to do most things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wannr1"&gt;The big, visible change Samsung made with the Flip 3 is increasing the size of the cover screen from a scant 1.1 inches out to 1.9 inches (measured diagonally), which translates to a roughly four times larger display. It’s much more useful for checking notifications and controlling media than the miniscule ticker screen on the prior Flips, but it’s still quite limited. Though the interface mimics a smartwatch, including swipeable panels for calendar appointments, weather, alarms, and timers, you can’t reply to an incoming message without using Bixby voice commands (no thanks) or opening up the phone fully. You can use the screen to frame up selfies, and the clock is customizable with different animations, but the cover screen itself could stand to be quite a bit larger still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDfqOe"&gt;The cover screen’s limitations highlight how using the Flip 3 is different from a standard smartphone. You can’t just pick the Flip up and quickly do what you want one-handed — you almost always have to open the phone up, which often requires two hands. It’s less convenient than a standard phone and takes longer to do simple tasks because of this. I got around these limitations by just leaving the Flip open and treating it like a normal phone when I’m sitting at my desk or just hanging around the house, only bothering to close it when I wanted to put it in my pocket. But that largely defeats the reason you’d buy a folding phone in this style to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYU8hW"&gt;Samsung has a suite of colorful and fun cases for the Flip 3 that include built-in finger straps or rings to make it easier to hold the phone when it’s open. I got to try one of the strappy models and while the neon colors looked great and it was like having a built-in PopSocket on the phone, it doesn’t make it any easier to get the Flip 3 open with one hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uZpEft"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 display&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Uzk3pFkgD3Bs-_Ipt1hYZj9kws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790770/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Flip 3’s display has all of the specs for a top-tier phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YErFFb"&gt;Once the Flip 3 is open, you’re treated to a 6.7-inch, 1080 pixel wide OLED display that gets brighter and has a faster refresh rate than the prior models. It looks and feels just as nice as Samsung’s other OLED screens, with fast touch response, punchy colors, deep blacks, and smooth scrolling. It’s easy to see outdoors, looks great when watching video, and is right up there in performance and quality compared to other flagship phones. The Flip 3’s 9:22 aspect ratio is taller than most phones, but other than that, it works just like any other modern smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmUONa"&gt;On top of that upgraded display is a new factory-installed screen protector that’s made from a harder material than what Samsung used in the past. It’s much more difficult to dent or scratch than the old Flip’s gummy-feeling screen protector, and it feels much nicer to tap and swipe on. It’s basically indistinguishable in feel from the screen protectors many people put on top of normal phones and Samsung says it should last longer and bubble less than the old one. (In my week or so of testing I haven’t seen any bubbles form.) The company still does not recommend you remove the screen protector and if you need to get it replaced, it expects you to go to a certified repair center to have a new one installed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n5IPY3HprDoL0NxlX7g8SH1jY5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790740/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you look for the crease, you will see it, but it’s not a problem in normal use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o0fGda"&gt;You can still feel the crease in the center of the screen and if you look at the phone from an oblique angle, you can absolutely see it. But it never got in the way of actually using the phone and after a day or two, I just forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YJhqG"&gt;Despite Samsung’s claims of improved durability with last year’s Flip phones, a disconcertingly large number of them still &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mgAKSnMH0s"&gt;cracked right at the crease&lt;/a&gt;, even if they weren’t dropped or damaged. Samsung is putting a lot of weight on how it rearranged the screen’s layers to make them more durable this time around and claims the new screen protector makes the screen 80 percent stronger than before. The company is also giving away a year of its $12.99 per month extended warranty to those who preorder the Flip 3, which lets you get the screen fixed for a $249 fee. But I can understand why you might want to wait a few months and see how things shake out with the Flip 3’s screen durability before taking the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xaH9V2"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ULyMLN"&gt;The Galaxy Flip 3 has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM as the Galaxy S21, and its performance is as quick and snappy as any other flagship phone released this year. It’s also fully compatible with all of the 5G flavors available in the US, including the still-rare-but-fast-if-you-can-find-it millimeter wave networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1Ff263"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Performance and battery life are right in line with what you’d expect from a flagship phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mA4tpB"&gt;Battery life is also just fine, providing between four and five hours of screentime between charges. That’s enough to last me a full day without concern and the wireless charging makes it easy to top up the battery on my nightstand or when I’m at my desk. You can get phones that last longer between charges, but most people won’t have a problem with the Flip 3’s stamina. One note: the Flip 3, like many other high-end phones released in the past couple of years, does not come with a charging brick in the box. It supports up to 15W fast charging, but you’ll have to BYOB (bring your own brick).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyLBeM"&gt;New for the Flip 3 is a set of stereo speakers, a noticeable upgrade over the mono speaker on the older Flips. The new speakers are much louder and make watching video more enjoyable, though I noticed the earpiece speaker was noticeably louder than the bottom speaker when I watched YouTube, as if the stereo balance was shifted. That could be because the speaker is facing directly at me, while the bottom speaker fires off to the side, but Samsung wasn’t able to immediately explain it when I asked. Still not available is a headphone jack, so you’d better like those speakers or use Bluetooth headphones with the Flip 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZdjPP8"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rnZ1xtoE1DTQTp5_g40ehw9JnEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790746/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flip 3’s cameras have the same specs as last year’s models and don’t quite hang with the best camera phones available now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dQZiHa"&gt;Perhaps the area where Samsung made the least forward progress is with the Flip 3’s camera array. The 12-megapixel standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras and the 10-megapixel front-facing selfie camera have the same specs and lenses as last year’s Flip 5G. It’s an area where you are required to make different choices about your priorities compared to standard flagship phones that have more capable or versatile camera systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qtlAP"&gt;That isn’t to say the Flip 3’s cameras are &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, it’s just that if camera quality or features are the primary concerns for you in a phone, it’s not the best one to choose. Pictures from any of the cameras are characteristically Samsung, with vibrant, almost oversaturated colors, lots of sharpening, and noticeable smoothing of faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qUaBjd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10708526"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mJeV99"&gt;The results are images that many people will find pleasing and want to share right away, without making many edits or adjustments or zooming in to compare fine details. The Flip 3 is not as good in low light as an iPhone 12 Pro Max or Pixel 5, nor does it have the versatility of the Samsung S21 Ultra’s long telephoto lens. But for everyday snaps and casual picture taking, the Flip 3 is plenty capable. Plus, you can use the cover screen to frame selfies with the main cameras, though it’s still too small for me to do that comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BIgrdQ"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 software and other stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VJk7Y2"&gt;The rest of the Flip 3’s story is typical Samsung. It’s running Android 11 with Samsung’s OneUI interface on top of it. It’s fine, if a bit cluttered, and Samsung is still using its stock apps as places to jam unwanted ads, which is gross and annoying. (At least, at launch there will be ads. Samsung says it will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630332/samsung-ads-default-stock-apps-weather-pay-theme-confirmed"&gt;removing them later this year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fvxLle"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Once it’s open, the Z Flip 3 is just like any other Samsung&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GjPvwR"&gt;Unlike the Fold line of phones, the Flip 3 isn’t trying to replace a tablet or come up with any new multitasking paradigms, and it doesn’t have any issue displaying popular apps like Instagram. Once it’s open, it basically just works like any other Samsung phone, complete with Samsung’s app store, browser, mobile payments, notes app, health app, and more. Samsung has committed to delivering four years of security updates and three generations of new Android platform updates on its phones, which means your folding phone’s software support might last longer than its screen does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="JWwT28"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aN3p0a_7xpmXNtuAlmyXHaAtK28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790742/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flip 3’s entire appeal is being a big phone that fits easily in a pocket or purse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CuzRNb"&gt;The original Galaxy Z Flip showed that a folding phone can feel like a normal phone, once you get over its wow factor. It can be the kind of thing that you just get used to day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ds6N79"&gt;The Z Flip 3 is Samsung applying its relentless iteration to that idea and making it something that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a normal phone, right down to the price it charges for it. Samsung has systematically checked off the boxes that made earlier Flip models purely curiosities: performance, features, price, and durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6kR0R9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Z Flip 3 is the first foldable that’s also a normal phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JS0SoR"&gt;I don’t think the Flip 3 is for everyone — there are still people out there who want the absolute best camera or aren’t intrigued by the idea of what the Flip offers. And how well its improved durability holds up over the long term is still an open question. But it’s the first folding phone where I can see a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people choosing it, particularly when it’s the same cost as a phone that looks the same as what they’ve been using for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oCGGRt"&gt;Just a few years ago, it seemed like folding phones were just a futuristic experiment. With the Z Flip 3, the second phase of the experiment begins, the one where we find out if folding phones can appeal to more than just early adopters. It’s an important proving ground for the concept and fortunately the Z Flip 3 appears up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YSOVJf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this review stated the Z Flip 3 supported 25W fast charging. Its fast charging is actually limited to 15W. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Smart updates and a lower price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KnsKmq"&gt;Google is revealing a phone this year where it’s pulling out all the stops and going big on a cutting-edge, in-house designed SoC, upgraded camera specs, and a bold new look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoPVNC"&gt;That phone is not the Pixel 5A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsYSkQ"&gt;If those kinds of show-stopping improvements are what you’re looking for, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;I’d like to point you to the Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;, coming this fall. The new Pixel 5A on the other hand, is kind of a boring update by comparison. The screen is a bit bigger this time around, there’s an IP rating for water resistance, and the battery gets a decent boost. That’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZbJNX"&gt;Here’s the thing, though: the Pixel 4A and 4A 5G were already really good midrange phones, and rather than messing with a winning formula, Google has made some strategic tweaks to keep the 5A at the top of its class. Even better, the 5A costs $449 — $50 less than the 4A 5G’s introductory price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uVHzk2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10704989"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ePfjnI"&gt;The Pixel 5A is good, but it’s not exactly a slam dunk. There are a few drawbacks to note: its security support policy is good but not class-leading. It’s also weirdly missing software-level support for C-band 5G frequencies that US carriers will start using over the next few years. It’s only being released in the US and Japan, and even in the US it’s not being sold through the major carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WU5k3Z"&gt;But all things considered, Google has managed to address some of the weak points in its previous A-series models while also bringing the price down. Not bad for a boring update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YY4e3eGvmohaCLt274ewkXE5ciY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781449/ajohnson_210813_4713_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 5A’s screen is slightly bigger than the 4A 5G’s, at 6.34 inches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KXnfgn"&gt;Google Pixel 5A screen, performance, and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FSHisY"&gt;The Pixel 5A uses a 6.34-inch 1080p OLED screen, which is a bit bigger than the 6.2-inch screen on the 4A 5G. That’s not huge by any means, especially compared to the 6.5-inch-and-beyond panels that are common on budget Android phones. It also uses a standard 60Hz refresh rate, so you don’t get the smoother scrolling experience of faster 90 or 120Hz rates. That’s a feature that’s been steadily trickling down from the flagship class and is available in devices around the 5A’s price, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 OnePlus N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;’s 90Hz screen up to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;$500 Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;’s 120Hz panel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3g8b52"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you don’t get the smoother scrolling experience of faster 90 or 120Hz rates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mor8Ca"&gt;So the 5A’s screen isn’t a standout, but it is big enough that it doesn’t look quite as out of place next to the competition compared to the 4A and 4A 5G. It’s also just a good quality screen — the OLED technology delivers rich contrast, and it’s bright enough to be viewable outside in direct sun without too much effort. The same can’t be said of some of its competitors’ screens, big as they may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsOr5p"&gt;There’s no change to the processing or memory specs from the 4A 5G: the Pixel 5A uses the same Snapdragon 765G chipset with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Apps open quickly, and I didn’t notice any significant delays or hiccups going about my daily tasks and social media scrolling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2azxqq"&gt;Complex image processing tasks are also carried out in a second or two, and that happens in the background so you can keep taking portrait mode photos without having to wait for every frame to finish processing. As someone who takes too many portrait mode photos of her cat in hopes of getting just the right shot, I truly appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WK1pFO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Heavy users should comfortably get a day out of the battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u5hnWn"&gt;The jump in battery life compared to its predecessor is a bigger story for the Pixel 5A. It gets a 4,680mAh cell compared to the 4A 5G’s 3,885mAh. That’s much closer to the 5,000mAh batteries that are common among the competition. Google calls it “all day” performance, with up to 48 hours of stamina if you turn on extreme battery saver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMXlTs"&gt;I got better results in my real-world testing — a day of moderate use including around three hours of screentime typically drained it down to only 70 percent. Heavy users should comfortably get a day out of the battery, and if you’re a lighter user who spends more time on Wi-Fi, you can expect to get 48 hours even without battery saver enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRT6Cioy99RuDTQeSgk1t2zJ9Jc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781452/ajohnson_210813_4713_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of this year’s case options, “likely lime,” features bright green accents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uOHC5R"&gt;Google Pixel 5A IP rating and build quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CelYOt"&gt;The Pixel 5A includes an IP67 dust and waterproof rating, meaning it can be submerged in about three feet of water for up to 30 minutes. Official IP ratings are rare in the $500-and-under bracket outside of the Samsung A52 5G and iPhone SE, so this is one area where the 5A rises to the top of the class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlGnl2"&gt;On the front panel there’s Gorilla Glass 3 for screen protection and underneath, the phone’s outer plastic shell is a metal unibody. The plastic panel features a matte finish that I appreciate — it’s less slippery than a glossy finish and doesn’t show smudges as easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jjdv9d"&gt;There’s just one color option this year: black. You can spice things up with one of the colorful case options, which are designed for added protection against drops and bumps. Some are more neutral, like “black moss” and “maybe moon” (and also sound like Neko Case song titles?), but I opted for “likely lime” with my review unit and, reader, I do not like it. There’s a subtle 1990’s Nickelodeon vibe about it. Give me the fabric case back, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OsDX3SyDEYXfF58kJLK4zYKEcXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781446/ajohnson_210813_4713_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At launch, the 5A is only available in black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="f16XWo"&gt;Google Pixel 5A software and 5G connectivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FgoLkh"&gt;The 5A ships with Android 11 and is backed by Google’s typical three-year OS and security update policy. That’s a longer shelf life than most budget phones, but Samsung recently started offering four years of security updates with its budget A-series devices, and Apple will offer its latest OS upgrade to the six-year-old iPhone 6S this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0is7E"&gt;There’s also, of course, 5G connectivity on the Pixel 5A. It supports sub-6GHz 5G on all of the major US carriers, and unlike the 4A 5G, won’t be sold in a mmWave-compatible variant. Verizon insists on selling phones that can connect with its super-fast, hard-to-find mmWave 5G network so, like many other device manufacturers, Google came up with a more expensive version of the 4A 5G compatible with the network for Verizon’s retail shelves. That’s not happening this time around and nobody will miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PKkuru"&gt;&lt;q&gt;mmWave 5G is no great loss, but the 5A’s lack of C-band support at launch is more worrisome&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="naBJWN"&gt;mmWave 5G is no great loss, but the 5A’s lack of C-band support at launch is more worrisome. C-band is the good mid-band stuff that carriers will gradually begin adding at the end of this year and over the next few years. The Pixel 5A has the hardware support and FCC certification to use C-band, but Google hasn’t enabled software-level support for these frequencies. It could add support in the future, but isn’t committing to doing so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4YlkP"&gt;There are numerous budget and midrange phones on sale right now that fully support C-band, starting as low as the $279 Galaxy A32, so it’s odd that Google won’t commit to supporting it. T-Mobile customers don’t need to worry as much since it won’t be relying much on C-band. But if you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T and you plan to keep using your phone for the next two to three years, this could become a real drawback as those carriers enable C-band and (in theory) strengthen their 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYsXtUkyrZ9VBEPTlXHiaI1Ts34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781450/ajohnson_210813_4713_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel camera is still the low light champ of the budget class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YkYEJw"&gt;Google Pixel 5A camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cfk49Y"&gt;The 5A’s camera hardware is another place where it doesn’t look especially exciting on paper, but it adds up to much more than the sum of its specs. The 12.2-megapixel main rear camera includes optical image stabilization, which is hard to find under $500. This kind of lens-based stabilization helps ensure more of your shots are sharp, which is especially handy in dimmer light conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojhMFB"&gt;That camera is accompanied by a 16-megapixel ultrawide, and there’s an 8-megapixel selfie camera. This might not seem like much next to the triple- and quad- rear camera arrays on other phones, but those third and fourth cameras are usually low-quality macro and depth sensors that aren’t actually very useful anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VmbMsE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10704996"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mSQsTJ"&gt;If those specs sound familiar, that’s because it’s the same hardware as the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4A 5G, and that’s actually fine for this model. Even without new sensors or lenses, the 5A still offers the best photo quality in the midrange class, thanks largely of course to Google’s smart image processing. Plenty of the Pixel 5A’s competitors can take good photos in bright outdoor light, but Google is still the low light champion in the budget class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7GnfQ"&gt;Unsurprisingly, what was true of the 4A and 5’s image capabilities is also true of the 5A. It handles high contrast scenes well, and colors are rendered a bit more naturally than you’ll get from a Samsung phone. Portrait and night mode photos are among the best you can get from a midrange phone, though you can certainly spot their limitations with trickier subjects. Google has more work cut out for itself in equipping the Pixel 6 to stay competitive with the Samsung and Apple flagships of the world. In the budget class, it can afford to stand still for another year just because it got such a good running start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TamQFmgoPzsQwYDmuZj0BqSq-WM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781448/ajohnson_210813_4713_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s no wireless charging here, and the 5A will be the last Pixel sold with a charging brick in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nPFt5r"&gt;There are $400 and $500 phones with flashier standout features than the Google Pixel 5A. The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G features a big 6.5-inch screen with 120Hz refresh rate. The TCL 20 Pro offers a flagship-esque curved display and wireless charging. The Motorola Moto G Stylus includes a huge display and (of course) a stylus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYSwnL"&gt;But the Pixel 5A is just a good all-arounder with a great UI, speedy software updates, and all of the basics covered at a reasonable price. The 4A 5G was already a good phone, and the 5A’s smart improvements like waterproofing and a bigger battery make it easier than ever to recommend this phone to a wide range of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VPsBq7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;this is a very boring, very good phone that I think a lot of people would like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H5gTI3"&gt;There’s the unfortunate case of C-band 5G and whether Google will add support for it in the future. It’s hard to imagine the company refusing to support it once the frequencies are in wide use, but we’re firm believers that you shouldn’t buy a gadget today based on a potential update tomorrow. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers should take that into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmMMP7"&gt;It’s a shame that the Pixel 5A will see such a limited release, both in terms of countries where it will be available and where it will (and won’t) be sold in the US, because it’s a phone I’d recommend to a lot of people. It exceeds the competition in a few ways, like its class-leading camera and waterproofing, and meets it in others, like its just-big-enough screen and improved battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OpKsT7"&gt;With its more limited availability, it seems likely to become an “if you know you know” kind of device rather than the phone you tell your uncle to buy when he asks you what to get with his two-year carrier upgrade deal. That’s too bad, because this is a very boring, very good phone that I think a lot of people would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="RrVULK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10705020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8HHNjA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A has Gorilla Glass 3 as its front cover glass, Google confirms. A previous version of this review, based on information distributed by Google to reviewers, stated that it offered Gorilla Glass 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy A42 5G review: stuck in the middle</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A midrange phone with a big screen, huge battery, and all kinds of 5G connectivity&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Wk9ckH"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A42 5G is a thoroughly decent midrange phone that doesn’t really need to exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYZIbn"&gt;Taking it at face value, it’s fairly priced at $400 with a big 6.6-inch OLED screen, generous 5,000mAh battery, and a healthy support policy that will see it receiving security updates through the next few years. That’s a pretty good deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G08byP"&gt;In the context of Samsung’s Galaxy A lineup, it’s situated between the Galaxy A52 5G and the A32 5G, two very good options in their own price brackets. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;$499 A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; offers a few more high-end bells and whistles than the A42 5G, like a fast refresh screen and an IP67 waterproof rating. At $279, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;the more basic A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; includes an LCD rather than OLED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ZGoAx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10695334"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x0BQxc"&gt;But if you’re shopping for a new device with Verizon, you won’t see either the A52 5G or the A32 5G on the retailer’s shelves (digital or otherwise). Instead, you’ll only find the A42 5G, thanks to one feature it has and the others don’t: mmWave 5G support. Until recently, this was a feature reserved for premium phones, and the A42 5G is one of the least expensive devices that can connect with the network. Verizon in particular has been pushing this super-fast flavor of 5G hard over the past couple of years. Despite its efforts, mmWave is still scarce and highly range-limited, but the carrier is still heavily biasing its stock toward devices that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRDgF6"&gt;That’s why the A42 5G exists, at least in the US, but I’m not convinced that’s a good enough reason for anyone besides Verizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L9JiJoZsAjtaPj1oGPEMZAPbtnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766364/ajohnson_210804_4696_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A42 5G’s glossy, plastic back features a gradient pattern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uClYAU"&gt;Samsung A42 5G screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MvQd48"&gt;The Galaxy A42 5G offers a big 6.6-inch 720p OLED screen. That’s not a lot of resolution stretched across a fairly big panel, and it shows — if you look closely at images you’ll see some pixelation. The screen gets bright enough for indoor use, but I had a hard time seeing it outside even with brightness maxed out. The OLED panel shows nice contrast compared to an LCD (i.e., what you’ll get in a less expensive model like the A32 5G), but otherwise the display is a little underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5h1TCr"&gt;The A42 5G offers an in-display fingerprint sensor for biometric unlocking and it’s one of the better ones I’ve come across in this budget-to-midrange class — it’s responsive and only occasionally fussy. Budget phones often have sensors that are less precise and require additional scans more frequently, and that is a real pain considering how many times we unlock our devices every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z8BnPi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The screen gets bright enough for indoor use, but I had a hard time seeing it outside&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xacy1I"&gt;Battery life is excellent thanks to a large 5,000mAh cell — most days I only drained it to 70 percent by bedtime, but even a day with heavy use that included a Zoom call on cellular data only brought it down around 50 percent. A power user would definitely get a full day and a little extra from it, and with moderate use it can easily be stretched to two days on a charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcXOlT"&gt;Overall performance from the A42 5G’s Snapdragon 750 processor and 4GB of RAM (there’s a healthy 128GB of storage, too, and it’s expandable via MicroSD) is good for day-to-day tasks. The only slowness I noticed was a little bit of lag starting the camera app, and slight delays using more processing-intensive camera features like portrait mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1VuWye"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung has guaranteed two additional OS upgrades and four years of security support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfJI3i"&gt;The US version of the A42 5G ships with Android 11. Beyond that, Samsung has guaranteed two additional OS upgrades and four years of security support. In terms of device longevity, that puts it ahead of a lot of the midrange Android competition, which often only sees a couple of years of security support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCUOuO"&gt;Samsung’s current implementation of Android is a little more cluttered than we prefer, and activating it on Verizon’s network means you’ll end up with even more pre-downloaded apps on top of that. It’s a lot. There’s some sort of game featuring a cartoon bear on the phone I’ve been using for the past few weeks, and I do not care for it but I haven’t been able to summon the energy to uninstall it either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d2zXRM1cK2ypkrBKxhXMfqgCU94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766365/ajohnson_210804_4696_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A42 5G’s rear camera array is headlined by a 48-megapixel f/1.8 standard wide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XiXEPl"&gt;Samsung A42 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="t8CC3A"&gt;The A42 5G includes a 48-megapixel f/1.8 main rear camera, accompanied by an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, and 2-megapixel depth sensor, which is all par for the midrange class. There’s also a 13-megapixel selfie camera around front. A version of the phone sold in the UK and Europe included a 5-megapixel macro and a slightly higher-res 5-megapixel depth sensor, but we’re not missing out on anything important by not having those cameras on the US version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZWgmyz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10696319"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0oTt15"&gt;In good light outdoors, the Galaxy A42 5G takes vibrant, detailed photos. Like other Samsung devices before it, the A42 produces colors that lean toward oversaturated, which can be distracting if a more natural look is your thing. Portrait mode photos are convincing enough, and the camera can sometimes struggle deciding on white balance and exposure in mixed lighting situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dft8Ej"&gt;Photos in very low light show a lot of smeared detail thanks to noise reduction, but outside of the Pixel phones in this price bracket, that’s not something we’d expect a midrange device to excel at. All told, the A42 5G’s photo capabilities are on par with its class. Spending a bit more on the A52 5G will get you a stabilized main camera that will get more sharp shots in dim lighting and slightly better low-light performance in general, but in the $400 range the A42 measures up well against most of its peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dy92tpG9UhCaE0Hl3mo_tRvIlgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766363/ajohnson_210804_4696_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A42 5G’s unique selling point — mmWave 5G support — is of limited value for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yE4FDO"&gt;The Galaxy A42 5G is a fine phone for $400, and if you’re committed to buying from Verizon, it’s one of the better options at that price. But if you’re able to buy an unlocked phone or you aren’t on Verizon, then there are other options, including in Samsung’s own midrange lineup, that are well worth your consideration. Unless you live in an area with good mmWave coverage and spend a lot of your time outside where the signal can actually be reached, the A42 5G’s unique feature is of limited value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjDO3T"&gt;If you’d like to save a little money, the A32 5G is a viable alternative for $280. You’ll get the same security support longevity as the A42 5G along with similar photo capabilities, a huge battery, and 5G support that’s ready for upcoming improvements to Verizon’s and AT&amp;amp;T’s networks. Its processor is a little less robust and the LCD isn’t as nice to look at as the A42 5G’s OLED, but if these things aren’t priorities then you might as well save a little and go for the less expensive device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="cgUeJD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;don’t get too excited about mmWave&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yezL84"&gt;If you think you’ll want a little more than the A42 5G has to offer, then the $500 A52 5G is a good step-up option with a bit of a better camera, a great high refresh rate screen, and the added peace of mind of IP-rated waterproofing. If you can find a Pixel 4A 5G in stock anywhere, that would be another good alternative at $500 with a better camera, faster processor, and cleaner software. It offers a smaller 6.2-inch screen, though, and again, you’ll have a hard time finding one new at this point since its successor, the Pixel 5A, will likely be arriving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569798/google-pixel-5a-fcc-listing-leak-features-specs"&gt;in the near future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="P6mHSC"&gt;If none of the above suits you, then the A42 5G really isn’t a bad choice. Its healthy support policy, decent overall performance, and robust battery life make it one of the best options from Verizon for around $400. Just don’t get too excited about mmWave.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Fast charging and elegant software offset a so-so camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KqtAyf"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is a legitimate flagship phone that is genuinely competitive with the best Android phones on the market — at least from a features and quality perspective. Yet in terms of market and mind share, it’s still destined to be a niche device for a small group of enthusiasts looking for a specific kind of elegance in their Android device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAjS4O"&gt;And that’s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0Ns9M"&gt;If you live in the US and you’re buying an Android phone, chances are very high that you’ll end up with a Samsung Galaxy phone. Samsung has the carrier relationships, quality, and marketing that have led directly to market share. LG, Motorola, and even &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america"&gt;sell more phones here than OnePlus does&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4shcPS"&gt;But after nearly seven years and dozens of phones, OnePlus has established itself as a brand that can make great phones that are serious alternatives to the mainstream. The $1069 OnePlus 9 Pro (the only option in North America, other parts of the world have access to a slightly less expensive model) achieves that goal with only a handful of notable compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2jYBg"&gt;OnePlus’ flagship phones always come with a laundry list of top-of-the-line specs, but what makes the OnePlus 9 Pro good isn’t the numbers; it’s how well those specs translate into one of the best experiences you can get using Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AHu1Vy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi-pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"This $159 OnePlus Watch is OnePlus’ first smartwatch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22334322/oneplus-watch-smartwatch-features-price-specs-battery"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro announced with Hasselblad-branded cameras ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hpoEZD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10406462"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro has an elegant design, but won’t support 5G on all networks" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjdZe-bk4k4KgMTns8qChqCoZ-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388892/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0068.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has an elegant design but won’t support 5G on all networks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bQiCrq"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro hardware design and 5G support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rZIXVc"&gt;The hardware design on the OnePlus 9 Pro is the most seamless, elegant phone that the company has designed to date. It is, of course, big. It has a 6.7-inch screen that goes from edge to edge in a body that’s narrow enough to make it just barely usable for me in one hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MZ4NI"&gt;What I can’t help but notice is how far OnePlus has come in build quality. The glass on the front and back curves into the aluminum rail on the edges with no seams at all. It’s well-balanced, beautiful, and solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Top: OnePlus 9 Pro; bottom: Galaxy S20 Plus. Both phones have similarly curved glass and molded aluminum rails." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTvlAj6Darv2g-R9N0QJ9O44UZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389264/oneplus9progalaxys20plus.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top: OnePlus 9 Pro. Bottom: Galaxy S20 Plus. Both phones have similarly curved glass and molded aluminum rails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It has a three-stage ringer switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAp70uBpGGWtFpcHUizuZRTE4QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388880/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0054_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has a three-stage ringer switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYWqZR"&gt;It’s also the spitting image of a Galaxy S20 Plus. Shift a couple of buttons around, move the selfie camera to the middle, and swap out the logo, and it’s the same design. I get that there are only so many ways to sandwich curved glass and aluminum together, but it’s uncanny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSjJvc"&gt;To be fair, OnePlus does keep some of its identity in the three-stage ringer switch, which easily lets you toggle between a ringer, vibration, and fully silent. It may still be my favorite feature on OnePlus phones, and I remain baffled as to why more Android phone makers don’t adopt a physical ringer switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVSttu"&gt;Speaking of vibration, the haptics on the OnePlus 9 Pro aren’t sloppy at all, unlike many Android phones. Unfortunately, the trade-off is that they aren’t very strong; I often can’t feel it vibrate in my pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6vr0E"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has the top-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is paired with eight gigs of RAM on the 128GB model. Unfortunately, this configuration isn’t sold in North America — OnePlus originally expected to make it available, but later said that supply constraints led it to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577770/oneplus-base-9-pro-north-america-us-canada"&gt;only the more expensive version&lt;/a&gt; with 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. There’s no microSD card slot for storage expansion in either model. What you get is what you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMXoXr"&gt;It supports both Sub-6 and millimeter-wave (mmWave) styles of 5G, but there’s a significant caveat: the phone supports it, but OnePlus has only managed to land 5G certification from its carrier partner, T-Mobile. If you buy it unlocked, as of now, it will only work with T-Mobile’s 5G network. Everything else will be LTE. AT&amp;amp;T 5G support doesn’t appear to be in the cards at all, and as for Verizon, OnePlus says that it “continues to work with Verizon to certify both the 9 and 9 Pro on its 5G network.” Later, on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353052/oneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified"&gt;March 26th, Verizon announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would support 5G on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus’ wireless warp charger can fully charge the phone in under 45 minutes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyFkyRjI2k4qCPN085Bz4kQTDBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388875/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus’ wireless warp charger can fully charge the phone in under 45 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w5puLi"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro battery and charging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zfl3AK"&gt;For OnePlus, the standout spec is its proprietary charging technology. There’s a 65W charger included in the box, and it can charge up the phone ridiculously fast. The phone’s 4,500mAh battery is actually split in two, which helps further speed charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 65W charger comes in the box (pictured with the regular OnePlus 9)." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bYtldbablBg79ONjjiRExDVLu8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388874/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 65W charger comes in the box (pictured with the regular OnePlus 9).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJcrVY"&gt;If you like, you can spend an additional $69 on OnePlus’ new Warp Charge 50 wireless charger. It charges at 25W, but since the battery is split, it’s essentially the same as charging at 50W, wirelessly. It also works if you set the phone on the charger in landscape mode. With the phone fully dead, it charged completely in 45 minutes. With ambient mode in Google Assistant on, it took a bit longer — but it was still wicked fast compared to other wireless chargers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1P12A6"&gt;That 4,500mAh battery was enough to get me through a full day and a half of moderately heavy usage. However, OnePlus phones do tend to be a little more variable in their battery life depending on use. Spending a day shooting 4K video and pushing the processor with games meant I could kill it with less than four hours of screen-on time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fG6qV"&gt;So while the battery life might not be best in class, the way OnePlus has built its ecosystem for charging means I’m able to top off faster than I can with other phones — provided I use OnePlus’ proprietary chargers, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro has an LTPO OLED screen, which can help with battery life" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5cHhLu_Wn4xSxFlJ9pZp5KWWUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388890/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0066.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has an LTPO OLED screen, which can help with battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X8qQlG"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="OAFOOG"&gt;After wireless charging, the next standout spec on the OnePlus 9 Pro is that 6.7-inch screen. Like Samsung, OnePlus has switched over to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;an LTPO style of OLED&lt;/a&gt;, which can be more power efficient and allows the company to have more control over the refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ9Qor"&gt;The screen can go all the way from 120Hz on down to 1Hz, depending on what’s happening on the display. OnePlus has branded the touch response rate on the screen as “Hyper Touch,” clocked at 360Hz for certain games, and though I am dubious it makes that big a difference for gamers, OnePlus says it could. More consequential is the screen resolution: 1440 x 3216 at 525ppi. You can leave it at that high resolution and have the high refresh rate screen going at the same time. Doing so probably hits battery life, but to me, the point of this max-spec phone is to max the specs, so I didn’t turn down the resolution or the refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yI05D4"&gt;Those are the specs on the screen, but it’s the experience that matters. And again, I think OnePlus has done a remarkable job here. Something about the tuning of the animations in OxygenOS makes this phone feel just a little bit smoother than even Samsung phones. I also appreciate the color tuning — although it’s not as subdued as an iPhone or even a Pixel, it’s more restrained than Samsung’s default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBNXzq7K6YNBtQHo8bKFRoCNvZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388879/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid but has room to improve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0avD9X"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bt7aQC"&gt;Without delving into a lot of history, I will just point out that until very recently, camera quality has been the main downfall for OnePlus phones. It’s a particularly bad way to fall down, too, because often, the clearest and simplest way to compare phones that otherwise look and perform nearly equivalently is to look at the photos they take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95RI9o"&gt;OnePlus knows all of this and wants to position the OnePlus 9 Pro as a heads-up competitor — or at least a viable alternative — to the very best Samsung and even Apple have to offer. So it did a thing a lot of challenger brands do: called in a ringer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G9j19S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Hasselblad partnership is only about color tuning and interface design this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xt3br"&gt;That ringer is Hasselblad, which OnePlus is partnering with to improve its camera results. It will be a multiyear effort, and it’s far from guaranteed it’ll be a fruitful partnership. In fact, most of these sorts of deals don’t really do anything notable when it comes to the camera’s quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhWaA4"&gt;This year, Hasselblad’s participation with OnePlus’ development process amounted to helping the company tune the colors from the camera and lending a bit of its interface to the camera’s Pro mode. Oh, and most importantly for OnePlus, Hasselblad allowed its logo to be stamped next to the lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOkITZ"&gt;I do think there’s some credit due to this color-tuning influence. In the same way that other smartphone brands have a “look” to their photos, I think OnePlus is developing its own. iPhone photos are generally flat and neutral, tending to the warm side of color; Pixel photos contrasty and blue; and Samsung photos have the vibrancy slider set to max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus 9 Pro: indoor with mixed lighting handles color well" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AsREolMsK8SMr90RWIWvZnhRREM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389337/17_LE2125_IMG_20210313_111817.jpg"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vFHBSJ"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro’s image output lands mostly in the middle. It tends toward blue, and it definitely lifts up shadows to create more even lighting. Its photos are more striking but less accurate than what you’ll get out of an iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yYysn"&gt;The camera system is good, but it can’t quite match the quality you get from an iPhone 12 Pro Max or Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra — both of which cost more than the OnePlus 9 Pro. It handles a variety of conditions quite well, but sometimes I just had to take an extra beat to compose my shot. It let me better judge what the viewfinder was showing and, honestly, gave me time to try the shot again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ps0XCc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10406526"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GnGiG3"&gt;As usual with smartphone cameras, I think the difference comes down to software. I like the colors the 9 Pro produces, but sometimes it just tries too hard and whiffs. Similarly, OnePlus seems to want to bring a little of that Pixel contrast magic to bear but instead just oversharpens. And lightening shadows is sometimes laudable, but not when it adds completely unnecessary and distracting image noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera can try too hard to brighten shadows, introducing noise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera oversharpens sometimes, too. Take a look at the fringing around the runners on the lake in this ultrawide shot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDooOLmKNWq0aQR0K3UtcKZlt6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389354/06_LE2125_IMG_20210311_160459.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera oversharpens sometimes, too. Take a look at the fringing around the runners on the lake in this ultrawide shot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jmns55"&gt;The main camera uses a new 48-megapixel Sony sensor with OIS, though when I pressed OnePlus to tell me what exactly that sensor brings to the table, I didn’t really get a clear answer. You can shoot 12-bit RAW images in the Pro mode (which is two bits more than last year, if you’re keeping count). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noaYb1"&gt;That’s all nice, but the interface on Pro mode is what gets me. You can clearly see what’s set to manual and what’s in auto mode. It’s simple and easy to use, too. Best of all is focus peaking, which draws little lines over the part of the image that’s in focus. It is a lot clearer and more fun to use than the tap-to-focus you need to use on other phones. (You can do that here, too, of course.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qMoum"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro’s other cameras include a big, 50-megapixel ultrawide with a sensor that’s quite a lot nicer than the usual step-down sensors ultrawides get stuck with. I loved using it right up until it went haywire with sharpening. OnePlus put in a custom lens to help with distortion at the edges, and it works as well or better than pure software fixes at keeping straight lines from bowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGBpJb"&gt;The telephoto camera is 3.3x, and it’s not anything special at that zoom level. Beyond it, digital zoom is kind of a mess. It gets pantsed by the S21 Ultra with its periscope-style lens. There’s also a monochrome camera that serves only as a helper for the rest of the system, but I suspect it’s not doing anything especially important. OnePlus did drop the gimmicky and pointless “color filter” camera from last year’s 8 Pro this time around. It will probably drop the monochrome camera next year, if I had to guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="exkR3H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10406545"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TReqrH"&gt;OnePlus’ software-focused Nightscape mode works really well for capturing nighttime shots, although to my tastes, it over-brightens the image. Portrait mode is a mixed bag; heads often look artificially cut out from the blurry background. Again, I can get good shots, but portrait mode was often one of those situations where I needed to try the shot a second time. The selfie camera is passable in good light but falls down fast in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkqOPE"&gt;Unfortunately, video is equally messy. The OnePlus 9 Pro will let you shoot up to 8K 30 or 4K 120, but neither looked good. In fact, regular old 4K 30 has that overprocessed and oversharpened look you see so often from smartphones. The big new feature is improved HDR for backlit subjects, but the effect is minimal at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uC8chD"&gt;That’s a whole pile of critical takes compared to phones that cost more than this phone. But despite the price difference, I think the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera should be held to as high a standard as possible — it’s a flagship phone. It can sometimes hang with the best of the best, and that’s a win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pLQs9q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10406554"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can put all your widgets in a drop-down menu instead of on your home screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vp8Inx-tnSjKoH9h7Te9rzY7t28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388878/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0052_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can put all your widgets in a drop-down menu instead of on your home screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZN4UWi"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro performance and OxygenOS 11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iYZu5Q"&gt;Even though the camera is often the main differentiator for an Android phone, it’s not necessarily everybody’s highest priority. When I’m not pixel-peeping photos, the OnePlus 9 Pro is the best Android phone I’ve used so far this year. The performance is great. I’m especially impressed with the optical in-screen fingerprint sensor, which is super fast and doesn’t seem to be thrown by weird lighting conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHyiSQ"&gt;OnePlus’ version of Android is called OxygenOS, and it’s now at version 11. The company has borrowed Samsung’s idea of shifting content down to meet your thumb and added in support for an always-on ambient display. The animations feel smooth, and OnePlus has learned its lesson about how annoying it can be to have apps close in the background too often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bWqNDM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OnePlus has a more elegant version of Android than Samsung&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOb2Eg"&gt;OnePlus has committed to two major OS updates and three years of bimonthly security updates, which puts it ahead of brands like LG but behind Samsung and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpxgUZ"&gt;You can customize a few things like the font and icons, too. My favorite customization is an ambient display mode that displays a colorful bar that shows how often you’ve been using your phone throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXAAvg"&gt;One feature borrowed from Apple and / or Microsoft is the ability to put your widgets into a separate panel so they’re not littering your main home screen, accessible via a quick swipe down. I love it, but I wish it wasn’t mapped to the same thing other Android phones use to quickly bring down notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIRq8d"&gt;Mostly, though, OxygenOS just feels &lt;em&gt;chill&lt;/em&gt;, especially compared to Samsung. OnePlus isn’t pushing its own ecosystem of apps and services (though with a new OnePlus Watch coming, perhaps that may change). It’s also not festooning its own apps with advertisements, unlike Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="waqTIv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10406439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 has a slightly smaller screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7cetFjAfrRKtYErNsip_4ScK7t4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388898/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0077_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 (right) has a slightly smaller screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="p8uB5Z"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is not a “flagship killer.” It’s a flagship. Although it still costs a little less than its top-tier competitors, it nevertheless is a pricey phone that makes a lot of promises. Mostly, it delivers on them. Even though a tiny fraction of customers buy OnePlus phones compared to Apple and Samsung, the company has built a track record long enough to deserve its status as an established brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GhSKH3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The regular OnePlus 9 is a fine choice for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NA5uRY"&gt;If you’re considering one of the new OnePlus phones, I am actually hard-pressed to make the case for the OnePlus 9 Pro over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;regular OnePlus 9, which Allison Johnson reviewed.&lt;/a&gt; The regular OnePlus 9 is $240 less, and the things you lose are mostly the nice-to-haves that justify the Pro’s existence: fast wireless charging, OIS, a telephoto lens, mmWave 5G, and the slightly larger screen. The cheaper OnePlus 9 lacks telephoto, but its other cameras take photos that are nearly equivalent to the pro. It has a high refresh rate screen, fast wired charging, wireless charging (though it’s not as fast), and most importantly, a nice OnePlus software experience with great performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mMX9ur"&gt;The reason to opt for the 9 Pro over the regular 9 is in some ways the same reason you’d opt for a OnePlus phone over a Samsung phone in the first place: it’s just a little nicer and a little different than what everybody else has in their pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iuxd2s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 26th, 2021 5pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353052/oneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon announced&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; it would support 5G on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro and OnePlus confirmed they will not work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. The review has been updated to note the new information. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWkLOE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 27th, 2021 4pm ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus has stated that despite its original intention to do so, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577770/oneplus-base-9-pro-north-america-us-canada"&gt;&lt;em&gt;it won’t sell the base model OnePlus 9 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in North America.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord 2 review: focused on the essentials</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;From its screen to its fast-charging, the Nord 2 has it where it counts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QP7RPd"&gt;From the start, OnePlus has positioned its midrange lineup of Nord phones as a less expensive, entirely separate lineup to its flagship devices. But with the Nord 2, which comes as a direct successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;original Nord&lt;/a&gt; released last year, the line between the two seems blurrier than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd6ENN"&gt;While the original Nord had its own character, such as a unique design and exclusive features like an ultrawide selfie camera, the Nord 2 feels more like a stripped down flagship. It’s got a very similar camera bump to the OnePlus 9, for example, and although the specific sensors are different, its cameras fill the same functions. But all the core essentials are still there: a vibrant high refresh rate screen, good battery life, and easy-to-use software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdYBz8"&gt;A more affordable, non-flagship starting price means it’s hard to argue with these tradeoffs. The OnePlus Nord 2 costs £399 / €399 for its 8GB RAM / 128GB storage model, rising to £469 / €499 for a 12GB RAM / 256GB storage version. (OnePlus isn’t selling the Nord 2 in the US, but those prices roughly convert to $470 and $588, respectively.) For this review, I’ve been using the 12GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kczner"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10662161"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uOChn3"&gt;With its 6.43-inch display, the OnePlus Nord 2 is a hair smaller than the OnePlus 9 (which has a 6.55-inch display), but otherwise this is a very similar-looking device. There’s a rectangular camera bump on the back containing three cameras, a hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera on the top left on the front, and a USB-C port on the bottom (but sadly, no headphone jack). Biometrics are handled via a snappy in-display fingerprint sensor, and there’s a physical slider to switch between silent and vibrate on the right of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmod5R"&gt;You’ll find Gorilla Glass on the front and back of the phone, but since its frame is plastic you might want to use a case if you’re particularly worried about the frame’s finish wearing off. Otherwise I didn’t notice the phone flexing any more than a typical aluminum framed phone. Like the original Nord, the Nord 2 doesn’t have an official IP rating for dust or water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2F0vrl"&gt;Oh, and this is also a 5G phone: you get sub-6GHz support, but no mmWave. Given the latter high-speed, low-range network type has &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/5G-mmWave-connectivity-is-finally-making-its-way-Europe-wide-with-promises-of-Gigabit-speeds.548139.0.html"&gt;barely started to roll out&lt;/a&gt; in the Nord 2’s release markets, it’s not something many people are likely to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neMCas"&gt;The most notable sign that this isn’t a flagship OnePlus device is its processor, which is a MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI rather than one of Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 888 chips. Considering MediaTek is a brand more commonly associated with budget devices, I was apprehensive about its inclusion on the OnePlus Nord 2, but I came away pleasantly surprised by performance overall. Yes, you miss out on Qualcomm-exclusive features like high quality AptX Bluetooth audio, but otherwise switching between apps was hitch-free, and the processors’ GPU happily made the most of the phone’s smooth 90Hz display while scrolling through even a relatively graphically intensive Twitter feed (which, in comparison, stuttered on the original Nord). I noticed the phone being slightly slow to wake up on a couple of occasions, however, but overall performance was on a par with, if not slightly better than the original Nord in everyday usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ipx1ZhE-EHjm4X0xIzPN5Ol4yPA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726845/jporter_210719_4669_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squint, and you could believe the Nord 2 is a OnePlus 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v1w9x3"&gt;The Nord 2’s 1080p screen is generally hard to fault. It does everything well that you’d expect from an OLED display. Whites are crisp and bright, colors are punchy, and blacks are, well, black. Its 90Hz refresh rate is technically a step down from the 120Hz panel that you’ll find on phones like the OnePlus 9, but in practice I didn’t notice a downgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xztwe"&gt;As a bonus, this time around the Nord 2’s screen is actually flanked by stereo speakers (one downward-firing and one from the phone’s earpiece), as opposed to the original Nord, which only ever played media audio out of its downward-facing speaker. You’ll still want to use headphones for proper listening, but the speakers’ volume meant I had no trouble hearing podcasts played out of the phone’s speakers while cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOcGqr"&gt;I got a little under five hours of screen-on time out of the Nord 2’s 4,500mAh battery, easily enough to last through a full day with a little to spare. But I was more impressed by the inclusion of Warp Charge 65 fast-charging here. When charging from zero, I hit 89 percent after a half hour, and 99 percent after 35 minutes, which felt remarkably quick. You have to use one of OnePlus’ proprietary chargers and the cable it comes with to get these speeds, but at least you get both in the box. The Nord 2 doesn’t support wireless charging, which isn’t entirely surprising at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kjLKKz7Xz8c1jP-lSq8gSOGTn9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726843/jporter_210719_4669_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a small hole-punch for the 32MP selfie camera on the top left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rSF9yoYjvHTO6az1G4XJDEhrq0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726846/jporter_210719_4669_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A physical slider lets you put the phone into silent mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SLy64y"&gt;The Nord 2 runs on OxygenOS 11.3 out of the box, which is notable for being the first version of OnePlus’ software to reflect its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;integration with Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-2-oliver-zhang-interaction/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. But despite the under-the-hood changes, the phone didn’t feel radically different in everyday usage. I found a few changes in the Settings menu, though, where several controls have been renamed and shifted positions slightly. It meant I struggled initially to find OnePlus’ standard screen calibration options, for example, but they’re still there in a slightly different sub-menu. It bodes well for the future of OxygenOS, which continues to be an uncluttered take on Android that I mostly appreciate for its ability to keep out of my way. In terms of ongoing support, the company promises you get two major Android updates and three years of security updates with the Nord 2, though it declined to say how regular these security updates would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GZmTk"&gt;Around the back of the Nord 2, you’ll find three rear cameras. Its main camera uses a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor (which OnePlus previously used for the ultrawide cameras on the 9 and the 9 Pro), which is flanked by a much lower-resolution pair of cameras: an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor of questionable utility. On its front there’s a 32-megapixel selfie camera, but it’s not paired with an ultrawide camera this time around, which makes me, personally, a little sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmRMZC"&gt;I generally liked the shots I got out of the Nord 2, and OIS on the main sensor means it’s easy to get consistently sharp shots every time you hit the shutter button. That said, they definitely have OnePlus’ typically punchy look, which prioritizes vibrancy over accuracy. It’s most obvious when you look at landscape photograph shots: I can promise you the grass in the photographs below was much less green and much more yellow in reality. Edges also tend to have a slightly over-sharpened look to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A9Uh0epNtadAvXUQRGIFHtFOFqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726847/jporter_210719_4669_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord 2 includes three rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eL8cN1"&gt;At night, the Nord 2’s standard photography mode automatically takes photos that are almost as bright as the Google Pixel’s Night Sight mode, and if you head into the phone’s dedicated Nightscape Ultra mode you get photos that almost look like they were taken in daylight were it not for how washed out they appear. In its standard photography mode, this brightness hides the fact that low-light shots aren’t particularly detailed, like in the photo below of an apartment block where the dividing lines between wooden slats have been smoothed out of existence. You’ll be able to make out your friends if you photograph them in a dimly lit bar, but their skin might come out looking a little smooth and plasticine-y in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GtA5eV"&gt;Oddly, this vibrancy doesn’t carry over to the ultrawide camera, where shots seem much more muted and arguably more color-accurate in comparison. There’s also less detail thanks to the lower resolution sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fvkvFT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10662184"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XTa70A"&gt;When it comes to people, the OnePlus Nord 2 can’t seem to resist the temptation to brighten skin tones, raise shadows, and make everything look a little flat. Even with its beautification mode turned off, I still got the impression the Nord 2 was avoiding showing me every last wrinkle and pore in my face. To its credit, the effect means you can barely tell I took the shots below while sweating my way through a horrid UK heatwave, but I think the overall photographs end up looking blander as a result. It’s a similar story with the phone’s selfie camera, although this is partially offset by the extra detail from defaulting to 32-megapixel shots, while the main camera on the rear defaults to around 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWQLwq"&gt;OnePlus’ continued insistence on including low-resolution monochrome sensors on the backs of its phones is baffling. The black and white photography option that makes use of it is still buried all the way at the end of the camera’s list of filters, and even once you go to the trouble of using it, I’ve yet to notice any difference it makes compared to a software-based filter. You can even cover up the monochrome sensor on the Nord 2 while you take a black and white shot, and the phone seemingly continues on unperturbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obmHyO"&gt;But complaints about the easily ignorable monochrome sensor aside, I think the Nord 2’s cameras get a lot of things right if you share its preference for bright, colorful shots. OIS on the main camera means it’s relatively easy to get crisp photographs, and you could do a lot worse at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Q86Vsv"&gt;A month ago, OnePlus announced the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22543244/oneplus-nord-ce-5g-review"&gt;Nord CE&lt;/a&gt; or “Core Edition,” an affordable phone which was pitched as offering the essential features of a OnePlus smartphone without any extra bloat. But the more I use the OnePlus Nord 2, the more I think that this is the phone that fits that description much more accurately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCZ2uz"&gt;From its screen, to its cameras, its processor, and its software, the Nord 2 feels like a flagship phone stripped of any unnecessary features. There’s no Hasselblad-branded cameras, just a reasonably specced set of sensors. There’s no flagship Qualcomm chipset, but instead you get a processor that has no trouble handling the day-to-day duties of a modern smartphone. No wireless charging, but fast wired charging that more than makes up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="dIZhB2"&gt;All of this adds up to a compelling device if you’re looking to spend between £400 and £500 and you’re in a market when OnePlus is actually selling the Nord 2. A stripped down flagship it may be, but it’s hard to argue with what’s been left.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s Xperia 1 III is pricey, performant, and perplexing</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A good camera system and top-notch features, but it’s priced too high to recommend&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="dfjjAK"&gt;The Sony Xperia 1 III is a great phone that I won’t recommend to many people. Once again, Sony has created a beautiful device with some unique, marquee features like a 4K-ish OLED 120Hz screen, great photo-taking amenities like a physical shutter button and a high-quality manual camera app, and top-notch hardware for entertainment consumption, like dual front-facing speakers and an honest-to-god headphone jack. You won’t find that combination among the other big-name flagships on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCxImC"&gt;But reader, it is $1,300. That’s a $100 increase over last year’s model, and more than an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; ($1,199) or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; ($1,249, but often on sale for less) with an equivalent 256GB of storage. That is simply a lot to ask someone to pay for a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d6JQED"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10655594"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5jQQEl"&gt;For that $1,300, you get a top-notch experience on basically every level (except for its relatively short security-support timeline), but I struggle to see any one way in which it sets itself apart from the established competition. There are serious photo and video recording capabilities within the native camera apps, but nothing that could be considered unique to Xperia or a must-have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9gD3D"&gt;It all amounts to a very expensive device that does a lot of things well, but without a strong value proposition for any one kind of person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 6.5-inch OLED offers a fast 120Hz refresh rate." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/40QEc54OgGSoyHWpbJVK_9DltRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721851/ajohnson_210712_4667_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 6.5-inch OLED offers a fast 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sEOx0N"&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III screen, battery, and ergonomics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="togdaC"&gt;The Xperia 1 III’s screen stands out among its fellow flagships both in terms of its slimmer 21:9 aspect ratio and its higher 1644 x 3840 resolution, which Sony calls 4K (it’s close). It’s also an OLED panel, and this year’s version offers a 120Hz maximum refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rozvbw"&gt;There’s no variability, unfortunately, so you’ll need to choose between locking it in at a standard 60Hz (the default) or that higher 120Hz rate for the smoothest of smooth scrolling experiences. Opting for 120Hz comes with a warning that the battery will drain faster, and it does, but not unreasonably so. I kept it enabled throughout my time using the phone. Overall, it’s a lovely screen, with a couple of notes: Auto brightness is sometimes a little squirrely indoors, and the panel itself doesn’t get terribly bright outdoors. It’s still usable outside in bright light, but it can feel like a strain to see what’s on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6oFm7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322518/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-smartphone-new-camera-photo-pro"&gt;Dieter was a fan of the Xperia 1 II’s look when he reviewed it&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m in agreement about the III: it’s a sophisticated, understated design and I dig it. I like the slight matte treatment for the back panel glass, and all-around build quality (including its IP65/68 durability rating) measures up to the flagship class with a metal frame and Gorilla Glass Victus on the front. The Sony branding is so unobtrusive it practically disappears into the back panel, until the light catches it, and the whole thing looks at home next to an RX100 series camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DgBdAZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I both like and dislike the phone’s unique tall-and-slim profile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ImnDmd"&gt;The Xperia 1 III gets an upgraded 4,500mAh battery compared to the previous-gen’s 4,000mAh, likely a necessary move given the 120Hz display. Battery life is adequate, not stellar. I averaged two hours of screen time on a day of lighter use, which drained the cell to only about 50 percent by the end of the day. I was concerned about how it would hold up on a day of heavier use recording some 4K video clips, but even in that case, the battery lasted through the end of the day. I’d pack a charger or a backup if I planned on shooting video extensively, or on a long travel day where I anticipated more than four hours of screen-on time, but for day-in-day-out use, the Xperia 1 III does fine. There’s also support for 30W wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJX0hJ"&gt;I both like and dislike the phone’s unique tall-and-slim profile. It fits my hand more easily, and it is possible to reach your thumb across the screen in one-handed use (forget about reaching the far upper corner, though). But it’s also more prone to slipping out of pockets. I do like the fingerprint sensor embedded in the on / off button on the side; it’s quick and it doesn’t care if I’m wearing a mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9MHt9B"&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III performance and software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="f95l9Q"&gt;Spec-wise, the Xperia 1 III is a flagship through and through. It uses a Snapdragon 888 processor with 12GB RAM and 256GB of built-in storage. There’s 5G connectivity here, and unlike last year’s model, those in the US will be able to take advantage of it — as long as you’re on Verizon or T-Mobile. The Xperia 1 III doesn’t support AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G, and there’s no mmWave support, just sub-6GHz on T-Mobile and Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FxIJz"&gt;Sony doesn’t have a firm security-support timeline for the Xperia 1 III but tells us that owners can expect two years of support. The phone ships with Android 11, and the company doesn’t have plans for future OS version upgrades. That puts it well behind Samsung’s and Apple’s support policies, both of which offer at least four years of security updates and multiple OS version upgrades. Considering its high price tag, this is a significant shortcoming against its peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgTU1v"&gt;Sony has equipped the Xperia 1 III with dual front-firing speakers and says they’re louder than those in the 1 II. Paired with the high-res OLED screen, it makes watching videos a high-quality experience. I was delighted when I heard a car offscreen and the audio tracked as it passed through the scene from the left to right speakers. Maybe I’m easily impressed by these things, but I can see myself genuinely enjoying watching a movie or a show on the Xperia 1 III, rather than as a last resort to stave off boredom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Xperia’s rear panel includes three cameras and a time-of-flight sensor." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXKsDD5HelikwPsT6w2NkRxN1Y4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721853/ajohnson_210712_4667_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia’s rear panel includes three cameras and a time-of-flight sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KiwB8t"&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gr0Vh8"&gt;Sony is a highly regarded maker of mobile imaging sensors, and in the past few years has gotten more serious about the camera hardware in its own Xperia phones. This year’s iteration includes a total of three 12-megapixel rear-facing cameras, including a telephoto lens with a folded-optic design that includes two focal lengths: 70mm and 105mm equivalents. All three cameras, including that telephoto unit, use a sensor with dual phase-detection autofocus, a technology that helps Sony Alpha cameras achieve class-leading autofocus speeds. If you’re a numbers kind of person, here’s the quick rundown on the rear-facing camera hardware in the Xperia 1 III:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ifAERS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10655682"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="idAAgP"&gt;The Xperia’s Photography Pro camera app now includes a “basic,” auto-everything shooting mode as the default. Switching over to one of the semi-auto or manual modes brings up an interface resembling an Alpha camera’s quick menu. The basic mode is refreshingly minimal — there are quick shortcuts to different focal lengths, to turn bokeh mode on or off, enable continuous shooting, and access flash settings, but not much more than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCrGBF"&gt;Manual modes introduce a lot more control and more display options like a big, beautiful (to me, at least) horizon level. It will all feel very familiar to anyone who’s used a conventional camera, especially if that camera is a Sony. I like both the basic and advanced shooting mode experiences, and a two-stage shutter button is a very welcome addition, but my one complaint is that there’s no real on-screen indication when a photo is taken. I live with all of my phone’s notifications and audio signals on mute, so without the audio cue, I missed it when I only half-pressed the shutter on a few occasions, thinking I’d fully pressed it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Switching to manual mode in the camera app brings up an Alpha-camera-esque interface." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RxNFFZfF_vVxqUomxKr0ZAR8jNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722492/Screenshot_20210713_110258.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switching to manual mode in the camera app brings up an Alpha-camera-esque interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U74oaP"&gt;I’ll admit that it took a minute for me to warm up to the Xperia’s telephoto camera. I tend to like a wider lens, and I’ve used too many bad or mediocre smartphone telephoto cameras to get too excited about them. But once I started trusting it — especially at the 70mm focal length — I started to really enjoy using it to layer foreground and background elements, or bring more attention to a subject I can’t get closer to. You know, stuff you use a telephoto lens for. The image quality won’t put your dedicated zoom lens out of work, but it’s good enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnARwU"&gt;There’s a tendency for smartphone telephoto lenses to just amplify the shortcomings of the small-sensor-small-lens combo working to create them, which manifests as ugly purple fringing or obviously smeary details. The images I took at 70mm are blessedly free from these artifacts, especially if you’re looking at them at social media sizes. The 105mm focal length starts to look a little artifact-y, and details are noticeably soft, but as long as there’s plenty of light, images don’t look distractingly bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u7gKYP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10655721"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cN5UIu"&gt;That’s the good stuff. I’m a little less excited about one of the other marquee camera features on the Xperia: autofocus. Namely, Sony’s dual phase-detect and tracking AF technologies, which it has imported to the Xperia series from its Alpha range. Don’t get me wrong, Sony autofocus is amazing. It’s why I own a Sony camera. You can see it at work in the Xperia 1 III when it effortlessly identifies a human or animal subject and tracks it around a scene, keeping up even when the subject turns away or becomes obscured behind something else. I’m just not convinced that it does much good here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7beOL"&gt;First, it seems to contribute to some distracting autofocus fluttering between near and distant subjects in some situations with the telephoto lens. Combined with the inherently less stable ergonomics of taking pictures with a phone versus a dedicated camera, it can make for a real challenge trying to get a photo of something in the distance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMlzUT"&gt;Taking closer-range photos of moving kids and pets in dim conditions is probably a more common use case for many people, and it’s one that no phone manufacturer has been able to crack just yet — including Sony. In these situations, dual phase-detect will keep up with your subject, but that doesn’t mean you’ll get a sharp shot. Just like every other phone camera system, it’s bound by the laws of small-sensor-small-lens physics. Situations where there’s just not enough available light to keep shutter speed high enough will still result in some blur, no matter how well the subject tracking is keeping up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bIKqBG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Just like every other phone camera system, it’s bound by the laws of small-sensor-small-lens physics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lurjns"&gt;In very low light, the camera will assemble data from multiple frames to create a brighter, less noisy image. This actually happens automatically in darker conditions, and doesn’t require a trip to a separate night mode, which I appreciate. But it does require you to hold the camera steady for a second or two, and isn’t well suited for moving subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQg3aa"&gt;Sony has included a darn good camera system on the Xperia 1 III, and it’s one I enjoyed using. I got to flex some creativity that I’d normally avoid with a smartphone and reserve for when I have a dedicated camera on hand. But it hasn’t found a way yet to bend the laws of optics and physics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sEq1s"&gt;We noted in our Xperia 1 II review that rather than leaning into computational photography the way Apple and Google have, Sony seems to be leaning into its traditional camera chops, applying the technology that has pushed the company’s mirrorless cameras to the top of the game. That approach has paid off in some ways — a great native camera app, a surprisingly good telephoto lens — but it doesn’t always translate, and I’m not sure how much further Sony can take that approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QSr8BE"&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III video recording&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JoT4PE"&gt;The Xperia 1 III is also well equipped for the serious mobile video shooter, with up to 4K / 60p recording and a native video app that includes plenty of manual control over video settings. You can set shutter angle, manually set points for pull focus, and apply one of Sony’s pro-video-esque color profiles. I have no problem telling you that this was all way over my head, but I played with it anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utMOBC"&gt;Your video files are associated with projects, and certain parameters like frame rate are preserved from clip to clip within a project. You also have the choice of recording to internal storage or directly to a microSD card if you don’t want to burn up your storage space with 4K video files. I’m happy to report that the SIM tray where the microSD card slot lives simply pops out of the side of the device, so you won’t have to hunt down a safety pin every time you want to grab your card to transfer files. That’s a nice touch, especially if you’re going to be taking that card out often to transfer footage to a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sony’s Cinematography Pro app offers plenty of manual control and the ability to set points for pull focus." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h24D8LTqCd5810QQd_drApEhcN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722485/Screenshot_20210714_122747.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s Cinematography Pro app offers plenty of manual control and the ability to set points for pull focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1x1d09"&gt;There’s not much you can do in the way of editing files — you can trim them or grab a still frame — so they’ll need to be exported for anything more than that. It’s also possible to use the Xperia 1 III as an external monitor for video recording with a dedicated camera (doesn’t need to be a Sony), or to use it for live-streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFhbYh"&gt;This is all much more robust than any native video-recording options you’ll find on a Samsung, Google, or Apple flagship. For someone who’s entrenched in the Alpha camera ecosystem, it could make sense as a compact, lightweight option for recording clips, or as part of a live-streaming setup. But there are also strong third-party apps and accessory options for mobile video shooters, especially those using iOS, that have benefited from years of development and use in the field. While the Xperia packs more of this into its native app experience, it’s not exactly a unique proposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qTmg7XSGoePrqQ6MrvdlJjeJPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721849/ajohnson_210712_4667_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia 1 III doesn’t offer enough above and beyond the established flagships to justify its high cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="q9JTBb"&gt;In the Xperia 1 III, Sony has created a sophisticated device that both looks good and delivers flagship-level performance. It offers sophisticated camera hardware and software and a lovely high-resolution OLED that’s not quite like anything else in its class. And yet I’m struggling to think of anyone who should buy this phone over an iPhone 12 Pro Max or a Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H41KPh"&gt;There’s the basics: for $1,300, you’d be getting a device that’s likely to only see a couple of years of security updates. And if you’re on AT&amp;amp;T, you’re paying top dollar for a 5G device that can’t access the carrier’s 5G network. It’s hard to make a case for the Xperia just based on those facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MvGfsc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;things just don’t add up in the Xperia 1 III’s favor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uEnGxD"&gt;But suppose you plan on trading in your phone in a couple of years anyway, and you’re not on AT&amp;amp;T or don’t care about 5G (still a reasonable response to have toward 5G right now). The Xperia 1 III will deliver a very good picture-taking experience with camera hardware as good as anything else out there right now. You’ll get a great entertainment consumption device, with good audio and a lovely screen. And if you’re interested in shooting video, you’ll have a powerful tool in your hands right out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rg4v1c"&gt;But none of these features go far enough above and beyond what you can get with an iPhone or Galaxy flagship to make the Xperia stand out. Factor in the shorter time frame for device support and uncertainty of any OS platform updates, and things just don’t add up in the Xperia 1 III’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL 20 Pro 5G review: good looks aren’t everything</title>

  &lt;p&gt;The 20 Pro 5G includes premium features you’d be hard-pressed to find in another $500 phone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jSGHyq"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G is a good-looking budget phone that works out some of the first-gen kinks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257398/tcl-10-pro-review-release-date-specs-features-camera-screen"&gt;we encountered in the 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but it isn’t quite ready to take on the category heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMAQQq"&gt;Much like its predecessor, the 20 Pro 5G combines a high-end look with a budget price tag — $499 for 6GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in this case. That’s $50 higher than the 10 Pro’s starting price, but this time you get more storage and 5G, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6klsf"&gt;It’s worth stating again: this is a very good-looking phone for just $500. Its huge curved-edge display boasts very slim bezels, and build quality is top-notch with an aluminum frame and glass on the front and back. The rear-facing cameras are neatly arranged under a vertical strip that sits flush with the rear panel. It’s tidy, and kind of retro cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eWAn76"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10634905"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nudokf"&gt;Good looks aside, I wouldn’t recommend the 20 Pro 5G to most people. There are a few usability quirks that make it feel like the second-gen device that it is. But more importantly, the 20 Pro 5G’s network compatibility and security support policy just aren’t as strong as the Pixels and Galaxy A-series phones in the category. It’s slated for two OS upgrades (decent for a midrange phone) but only two years of security patches (less good). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jINwzQ"&gt;It also lacks compatibility with AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network and isn’t certified to use C-band frequencies that will likely make Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G networks much better over the next couple of years. It’s yet another device that may be best suited for T-Mobile customers who will get full 4G and 5G connectivity and don’t need to worry about C-band as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxxRtx"&gt;There’s a lot to like about the 20 Pro 5G, and TCL has made some steps in the right direction with this device, but it still comes up short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ma3dxXAld7tygbzrq0GE5sXHAZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693979/ajohnson_210630_4655_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rather than offering a faster refresh rate, TCL has opted to include its second-gen Nxtvision display technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FEU2ls"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G screen, performance, and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CDOuhY"&gt;A lot of the credit for the 20 Pro 5G’s premium look goes to its curved 6.67-inch 1080p OLED screen with slim bezels — you just won’t find another screen like it in this class. It offers a standard 60Hz refresh rate, bucking the trend toward faster 90Hz and 120Hz displays, so you won’t get that smooth-scrolling goodness here. I noticed a little bugginess in the screen’s color temperature jumping between warm and cool, particularly after leaving the camera app, but overall it’s a pleasure to look at. And thankfully, it seems much less prone to registering touches accidentally on the curved sides than in the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leyDBH"&gt;TCL has included its second-generation Nxtvision 2 technology here, which aims to make standard images and video look more like high dynamic range content, with deeper blacks and brighter whites. You can choose from a few different profiles, with “vivid” as the default, or turn it off entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjQ7ch"&gt;We thought the first generation of this tech was a little heavy-handed, and I can’t say I’m impressed this time around either. The effect is often so subtle that I’m sure I wouldn’t notice it if I didn’t know it was there. When I could see a noticeable difference with it turned on versus off, it made images look too unnaturally processed for my taste. That said, I don’t think it will negatively impact anyone’s experience using this phone, it’s just not the impressive feature that TCL makes it out to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xa93z0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TCL seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2mQ5WZ"&gt;The company seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates, and it’s starting to feel like a weird choice. A faster refresh rate screen is an obvious benefit that many more users will see and appreciate. The advantages of viewing HDR content on an HDR screen are real, but the effect is hard to mimic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlygzZ"&gt;TCL has equipped the 20 Pro 5G with a Snapdragon 750G 5G processor and 6GB of RAM. It’s certainly up to day-to-day tasks, and stutters only occasionally with heavier tasks. The customizable smart key from last year’s model makes an appearance again here, and there are a ton of functions you can map it to, from opening a particular app to launching the camera in a specific mode, like night or portrait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zoKYr"&gt;It’s really useful, but unfortunately, it’s still easy to bump unintentionally. It’s positioned out of the way so that I don’t hit it while I’m using the phone; it’s just when I pick up the device or my hand brushes against it that I press it by accident. This is how you end up with multiple photos of your couch cushions in your camera roll, which nobody needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DMLv2y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s another premium feature on board here, too: wireless charging at up to 15W&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4HAibz"&gt;Moving along to the top edge of the device, there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is great! The phone’s mono speaker isn’t very good, but I wouldn’t expect it to be at this price, and anyway: headphone jack! The optical in-display fingerprint sensor is also good — one of the faster and more accurate I’ve encountered in the midrange class. I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate this after struggling with some finicky fingerprint sensors in lower-end devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOVzUo"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery. It will get you through a day of moderate use, but overall battery life doesn’t seem quite as robust as it could be. If you’re a heavy user, you may be pushing your luck by the end of a long day of use. There’s another premium feature on board here, too: wireless charging at up to 15W. That’s something that’s still hard to come by in the $500-and-under class, and it’s only a little slower than the phone’s 18W wired charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1910Q"&gt;On the software side, the 20 Pro 5G ships with Android 11 and TCL has promised it two OS upgrades. One (or god forbid, none) is common in this class, so that’s great to see. However, it will get just two years of security updates, which lags behind Samsung and Google’s four- and three-year policies, respectively. You should get more than a couple of years of support out of a $500 phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JH6614"&gt;Otherwise, TCL’s take on Android is a good one. It’s highly customizable but doesn’t feel overly busy, with handy features like a tray for frequently used apps tucked away on the right-hand side of the screen, and the option to rearrange the order of system navigation buttons during setup. It’s a lot, but it feels like useful stuff rather than customization overkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pc-uvEmcDX2EsQ0JR-ebB7ndNm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693982/ajohnson_210630_4655_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are four camera sensors on the rear of the device, including a stabilized 48-megapixel main camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CF7tGL"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oDC2iD"&gt;The 20 Pro 5G includes a 48-megapixel f/1.8 main camera with optical image stabilization, which isn’t guaranteed at this price and is a real benefit in dim lighting conditions. There’s also a 16-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, and 2-megapixel depth sensor as well as a 32-megapixel selfie camera around front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40vSfH"&gt;The camera hardware is clearly capable of good things. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail in photos I took outside in good light — there’s some aggressive sharpening going on, but it’s not too distracting. However, there’s still room for improvement. Colors like greens and blues look a little unnatural and bright. Photos can look flat and washed out, and I spotted more lens flare in my images than I’d expect to see. It’s possible that this is an effect from the cameras’ recessed position rather than on a protruding bump, which would be a real shame — I’ll gladly take an uglier camera bump than flare in my photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D94MRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10634994"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="66E3QV"&gt;Portrait mode does a convincing enough job of separating subjects from a blurred background, though a disappointing number of my photos showed a little subject blur even with OIS assisting. “Super Night” mode is a bit of a miss. It seems to retain more detail in very low-light images compared to standard auto mode, but it also employs some heavy noise-reduction. Images show some unnatural smoothing and can skew a little too warm — personally I’d stick to auto mode for low-light shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDA8fP"&gt;All in all, the 20 Pro 5G’s camera capabilities are underwhelming. There are some real positives — OIS helps you get more steady shots and detail retention is good — but as a total package it’s not quite on par with the likes of the Pixel 4A 5G and Galaxy A52 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwa5VdasTJagR-lQ2UjV1gCvLJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693981/ajohnson_210630_4655_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While it offers some premium features for its price, the 20 Pro 5G is hard to recommend to just anyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YaZVgv"&gt;There’s a whole lot to like about the TCL 20 Pro 5G, but it still feels like a device that’s still shaking off some early-generation quirks. While it does offer some features and hardware you’d be hard-pressed to find on any other $500 phone, it’s not quite the total package that it should be for that price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBQNV5"&gt;There have been some important improvements over the first generation. The curved sides of the screen are less prone to accidental touches, and there have been some nice additions like the inclusion of wireless charging. Yet some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device: the Smart Key is still easy to press accidentally, the camera is basic, and Nxtvision is underwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jdEFyR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3c8nC"&gt;And then there’s network compatibility — in the US, it’s kind of a jigsaw puzzle to which only the established players have all of the pieces. Thanks to some of these missing pieces, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers won’t get the most out of this device and its 5G capabilities. And with only two years of security updates promised, it lags behind the competition in terms of longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CwH3IS"&gt;If you’re on T-Mobile and you’d really like a budget device with a flagship look and feel, then the 20 Pro 5G is a good option, with a strong caveat that you’ll be putting up with some issues that competitors have already figured out. Most others would do best to consider one of those $500 midrange heavyweights. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; offers a fast refresh rate screen, better network compatibility, and a solid four-year security support policy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;The Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt; is a good option, too, with a better camera — if you can find it still in stock. You won’t get a fancy curved display or the high-end build quality with either of those alternatives, but depending on your priorities, they may serve you better in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ZenFone 8 review: an Android iPhone mini</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The ZenFone 8 delivers flagship-level build quality and performance in a small package&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4C38dH"&gt;After a couple of generations making phones with flip-out cameras and increasingly large displays, Asus has taken the ZenFone 8 in a totally different direction: small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSrT9H"&gt;The flipping camera concept lives on in the also-new ZenFone 8 Flip, but it’s no longer a standard feature across this year’s ZenFone lineup. Instead, starting at $629 for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the ZenFone 8 lands in the upper-midrange class with a conventional rear camera bump and a much smaller 5.9-inch display. An 8GB RAM / 256GB storage configuration is also available for $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwwRdC"&gt;Rather than an attention-grabbing camera feature, the focus of this design has been to create a smaller phone that’s comfortable to use in one hand, which Asus has done without skimping on processing power or higher-end features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1hmwn"&gt;It’s an Android iPhone mini, and it’s fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u3cT9V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10494874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Go0J86tAcMmzjPPXSpyPncCJlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499353/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus designed the ZenFone 8 with one-handed operation in mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FW7hIJ"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 screen and design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IhH9SM"&gt;The ZenFone 8 may be small, but that hasn’t kept it from offering the latest flagship processor: a Snapdragon 888 chipset, coupled with 6, 8, or 16GB of RAM (my review unit has 16GB). I can’t find fault with this phone’s performance. It feels responsive, animations and interactions are smooth, and it keeps up with demanding use and rapid app switching. This is performance fitting of a flagship device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cElERS"&gt;The display is a 5.9-inch 1080p OLED panel with a fast 120Hz refresh rate that makes routine interactions with the phone — swiping, scrolling, animations — look much more smooth and polished than a standard 60Hz screen or even a 90Hz panel. By default, the phone will automatically switch between 120 / 90 / 60Hz depending on the application to save battery life, but you can manually select any of those three refresh rates if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EFkcZ"&gt;The display’s 20:9 aspect ratio was carefully considered by Asus. The company says it settled on this slightly narrower format so the phone would fit more easily into a pocket, and it does. I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits. More importantly, it fits well inside a jacket pocket and doesn’t feel like it’s going to flop out if I sit down on the floor to tie my shoes. The ZenFone 8 is rated IP68 for dust protection and some water submersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2grdcK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o69ULu"&gt;The front panel is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus and houses an in-display fingerprint sensor, while the back uses Gorilla Glass 3 with a frosted finish that’s on the matte side of the matte / glossy spectrum. The front panel is flat, but the rear features a slight curve on the long edges for an easier fit in the hand. At 169 grams (5.9 ounces), it’s heavy for its size, and it feels surprisingly dense when you first pick it up. The phone’s frame is aluminum, giving the whole package a high-end look and feel. There’s even a headphone jack on the top edge as a treat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8XM4b"&gt;The power button (an exciting shade of blue!) is well-positioned so my right thumb falls on it naturally with the phone in my hand. Same for the in-screen fingerprint sensor: the target appears to be positioned higher on the screen than usual, but that actually puts it within a comfortable reach of my thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w8VC5"&gt;I’ll admit up front that I have a personal bias toward smaller phones, but the ZenFone 8 just feels great in my hand. I’ve spent a lot of time using big devices over the last six months, and I’ve gotten used to it. But the ZenFone 8 is the first device that feels like it was adapted to &lt;em&gt;me,&lt;/em&gt; not something I’ve had to adapt to using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UuUZnwxRe3j921AYa4ifsE1k5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499355/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A smaller phone means a smaller battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kpaymP"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 battery and software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8mbHH8"&gt;The phone’s small size makes a smaller battery a necessity — 4,000mAh in this case, much smaller than the ZenFone 6 and 7’s 5,000mAh. I felt the difference in using this phone versus a battery-for-days budget or midrange phone, but I had no problem getting through a full day of moderate use. I even left Strava running for 20 hours by accident, and the battery still had some life in it the next morning. The ZenFone 8 supports 30W wired charging with the included power adapter, which takes an empty battery to 100 percent in a bit more than an hour. Wireless charging isn’t supported, which makes the ZenFone 8 a bit of an outlier in the flagship class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPNxId"&gt;Asus offers a ton of options to help stretch day-to-day battery life as well as the overall lifespan of your battery. There are no fewer than five battery modes to optimize phone performance or battery longevity on a daily basis, and different charging modes let you set a custom charging limit or stagger charging overnight so it reaches 100 percent around the time of your alarm for better battery health. You won’t find class-leading battery capacity here, but rest assured if you need to stretch the ZenFone 8’s battery, there are plenty of options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kj8abO"&gt;The ZenFone 8 ships with Android 11, and Asus says it will provide “at least” two major OS with security updates for the same timeframe. That’s on the low side of what we’d expect for a flagship phone, especially compared to Apple’s typical four- or five-year support schedule. An important note for US shoppers is that the ZenFone 8 will only work with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s LTE and Sub-6GHz 5G networks; you can’t use this phone on Verizon, and there’s no support for the fast, but extremely limited, millimeter-wave 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctgUaWF69tS9vSVEdPG5w8MwvQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507533/DSC00661_rear.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 offers standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8l2mPu"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MbIlch"&gt;There are just two cameras on the ZenFone 8’s rear camera bump, and they are both worth your time. Rather than cram in a depth sensor, macro, or some monochrome nonsense, Asus just went with a 64-megapixel main camera with OIS and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. They’re borrowed from last year’s model, minus a telephoto camera and the flipping mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5utE4G"&gt;As in the ZenFone 7 Pro, the 8’s main camera produces 16-megapixel images with vibrant color and plenty of detail in good light. Images can lean a little too far into unnatural-looking territory, and some high-contrast scenes look a little too HDR-y for my liking. But overall, this camera does fine: it handles moderately low-light conditions like a dim store interior well, and Night Mode does an okay job in very low light, provided you can hold the phone still for a few seconds and your subject isn’t moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bFBXWG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10494947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xx4klZ"&gt;A skin-smoothing beauty mode is on by default when you use portrait mode, and it is not good. Skin looks over-smoothed, unnaturally flat, and brightened, like your subject is wearing a couple of layers of stage makeup. Turning this off improves things significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBkFNw"&gt;The ultrawide camera also turns in good performance. Asus calls it a “flagship” grade sensor, and while that might have been true in 2018, it’s at least a step up from the smaller, cheaper sensors often found in ultrawide cameras. Likewise, the front-facing 12-megapixel camera does fine. Beauty mode is turned off by default when you switch to the selfie camera, and thank goodness for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maIBzp"&gt;There’s no telephoto camera here, just digital zoom. On the camera shooting screen, there’s an icon to jump to a 2x 16-megapixel “lossless” digital zoom to crop in quickly, which works okay, but it isn’t much reach, and it just makes the limitations of the small sensor and lens more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wAwwx"&gt;On the whole, the camera system is good but not great. The lack of true optical zoom or a telephoto camera is a disappointment, but you can’t have everything on such a small device, and I’d personally take an ultrawide before a telephoto any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2yyJwz2m9mIkB8t4cUpzDgDLbuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499354/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 doesn’t sacrifice a flagship experience to achieve its small form factor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZDiMQY"&gt;The ZenFone 8 fills a void in the Android market for a full-specced, small-sized device. The Google Pixel 4A is around the same size, but it’s decidedly a budget device with a step-down processor, plastic chassis, and fewer niceties like an IP rating or a fast-refresh screen. Aside from battery life, which is manageable, you give up very little in the way of flagship features to get the ZenFone 8’s small form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzbIbh"&gt;You have to look to iOS for this phone’s most direct competition: the iPhone 12 mini, which it matches almost spec-for-spec from the IP rating down to the camera configuration. The 12 mini is actually a little smaller than the ZenFone 8, and when you factor in storage capacity, it’s the more expensive choice at $829 for 256GB. However, when you consider that the 12 mini will probably get a couple more years of OS and security support, it may be the better buy in the long run, if you’re flexible in your choice of operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jc0CEI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEL2JQ"&gt;I like the ZenFone 8 a lot, but I’m not sure it’ll find a big audience, at least in the US. Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;having trouble selling the iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, and if there’s one thing Apple is good at, it’s selling phones to US customers. As much as I hate to entertain the idea, maybe we’ve gotten used to giant phones. I love how the ZenFone 8 feels in my hand and in my pocket, but I do notice how much smaller the screen and everything on it seems compared to the bigger phones I’ve used recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Etfrj"&gt;There are also a few important considerations, like the lack of compatibility with Verizon and the comparatively short support lifespan of the phone. If you need the absolute best in battery life the ZenFone 8 can’t offer that, and if you want a class-leading camera, you’ll need to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OIO7v3"&gt;All that said, the ZenFone 8 will be the right fit for a specific type of person, and I can heartily recommend it to my fellow small phone fans. You’ll get flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord N200 5G review: T-Mobile’s best phone under $250</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re on the Un-carrier, the N200 offers 5G and a high-quality screen for the right price.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6BOFeg"&gt;The answer to whether you should buy the $239 OnePlus Nord N200 5G depends a lot on who your wireless carrier is. If you’re on T-Mobile — and thanks to a generous trade-in offer and a carrier exclusive, you probably are if you’re considering the N200 — then this is a fine, basic device that will allow you to take advantage of the company’s good 5G network at a very low price. The N200 5G will only work on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 4G networks, however, so if you’re with either of those carriers, it’s not your best option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Z2160"&gt;Why does your carrier make such a difference? Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G networks aren’t great at the moment, so using the N200 as a 4G-only device isn’t actually a big deal right now. But they’ll start getting much better over the next couple of years thanks to some newly acquired spectrum, and when that happens, being stuck on LTE could become a real drawback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIgNgq"&gt;The N200 5G has a few things going for it aside from 5G connectivity, starting with a big 5,000mAh battery. It has a large 6.5-inch display with a faster refresh rate that’s one of the best available in this class. You’ll also get three years of security updates, which isn’t &lt;em&gt;stellar&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but is an improvement over the two years more common among sub-$300 phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZaQMw8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10620908"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OQOFEo"&gt;On the downside, the camera system is basic. While overall phone performance is fine for day-to-day email and browsing, it’s a little slow with more processing-intensive tasks. And while you can get by on the 64GB of built-in storage, most people will need to add in the cost of a MicroSD card to their purchase for expanded storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OHbxB"&gt;The N200 is an acceptable, inexpensive 5G device, and it’s even a relatively good deal as a 4G device at the moment. But your mobile carrier and your inclination toward keeping your phone for more than one or two years makes recommending the N200 5G complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hF4edUedso0aYhx715Y3XtHFSZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677496/ajohnson_210623_4644_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N200 5G is one of few devices in its class to offer a screen with 90Hz refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cwU1sh"&gt;OnePlus N200 5G screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sMDXOX"&gt;As far as screens on budget devices go, the N200 5G has one of the nicest out there. It’s a big 6.5-inch LCD panel with 1080p resolution, which is an upgrade from 720p that’s more typical in this class. It also stands out with a faster 90Hz refresh rate, making scrolling and animations look just a little smoother than usual. The screen is usable even in very bright, direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pP5DfO"&gt;The N200’s battery life is very good, thanks to a big 5,000mAh cell. It also supports 18W charging with the included wired charger — not &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; fast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;like OnePlus’ pricier devices&lt;/a&gt;, but good enough to take it from 12 percent to a full charge in about two hours. With moderate use I got two days out of the N200 before I dipped into low battery territory; a full day of heavy use should be no problem, and many will see it last well into the second day, if not longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oBPkla"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most people will need to add a MicroSD card for more space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5gxBHT"&gt;The N200 uses a Snapdragon 480 5G processor, which is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;relatively new chipset designed for budget 5G phones&lt;/a&gt; like this one. It’s coupled with 4GB of RAM and keeps up well in day-to-day use switching apps and scrolling social media. It doesn’t take a lot to push it outside of its comfort zone where you’ll notice slight hesitations and stuttering, especially with intensive tasks like zooming in and out of Google Maps and starting navigation. But considering the price, it feels appropriately equipped to provide usable daily performance over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwKCyE"&gt;While you might be able to get by on the N200’s 64GB of built-in storage, it’s on the lower side and a healthy chunk of that is occupied by system files. Most people will need to add a MicroSD card for more space, so consider that extra $20 or so part of the overall cost of the phone unless you’re really frugal with your storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yjFr7J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the N200’s 5G connectivity works on T-Mobile, but on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon the phone is 4G-only&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8OAKrz"&gt;As noted above, the N200’s 5G connectivity works on T-Mobile, but on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon the phone is 4G-only. It supports sub-6GHz 5G only — no super-fast mmWave, but that’s not a big deal since it’s hard to find and T-Mobile doesn’t offer much of it. There’s also no support for the C-band spectrum that will be put to use for 5G starting early next year, but that would be a bigger deal if the phone could use AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon 5G. It can’t, so it’s not. What you do get access to is T-Mobile’s 5G sub-6 5G network, which is good and has broad coverage, even if it’s not mind-bogglingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTYZKp"&gt;Android 11 is loaded on the N200 out of the box, and OnePlus says it will provide one more major OS platform update during the phone’s life span. It will also get the aforementioned three years of security update support, which is a better-than-average policy for a budget Android phone. OnePlus’ implementation of Android is less fussy than most and is mercifully low on clutter and pre-downloaded apps. It’s a grown-up-looking interface that’s about as close as you’ll get to a “pure” Android experience outside of Google’s own Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHgFURqjsIIuX5f-FJa0V9wrf6M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677497/ajohnson_210623_4644_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N200’s main rear-facing camera uses a 13-megapixel sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vhpB9d"&gt;OnePlus N200 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="m4NjF8"&gt;The N200’s camera performance is acceptable, if a bit disappointing even considering the phone’s price. Included are a 13-megapixel f/2.2 main camera, 2-megapixel f/2.4 macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Around front there’s a 13-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3weoTJ"&gt;That 13-megapixel main camera will do fine for snapshots in good lighting, but it quickly reaches its limits with high-contrast scenes, like landscapes with deep shadows and bright highlights. Noise starts to creep into shots taken in moderate lighting conditions, like interiors, and dark scenes show a lot of smeared details and noise. Night mode works well enough to preserve a little more detail, but it’s only suitable for scenes without moving subjects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cnALW6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10621086"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DWs5CO"&gt;The N200’s camera system may be more of a disappointment considering that the higher-tier Nord N10 5G’s 64-megapixel camera is surprisingly good. The N10 costs $60 more than the N200 (a full 25 percent higher) so it’s not a totally fair comparison, but I can’t help feeling that the N200 could have been a little better equipped. Pixel count isn’t everything, but in this case, a newer, higher-resolution sensor would probably have made a significant difference in detail retention and its handling of high-contrast scenes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xsuqtRm9MA0ww26SXO3QNUW-LRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677495/ajohnson_210623_4644_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re on T-Mobile, the N200 is a good pick for a nice screen and 5G at a low price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XqudbD"&gt;If you’re considering the OnePlus N200 5G because T-Mobile is offering you a good deal on one, then I think there’s a good argument for this phone. It doesn’t offer a lot in the way of nice extras and features, but you will get a good screen, long battery life, and a 5G device that should last a few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHGDJZ"&gt;If you live in an area with poor T-Mobile 5G coverage, or you’re with another wireless carrier, then you’ll be better served by another option. You could save some money and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;go with the $179 4G-only N100&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a lot of the same features. The screen isn’t quite as detailed (720p vs. 1080p) but you still get that 90Hz refresh rate, big battery, and nice OnePlus user interface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NRBOsJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you’ll get a good screen, long battery life, and a 5G device that should last a few years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ABv6hi"&gt;On the other hand, if you can spend a little more, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$279 Samsung A32 5G is worth considering&lt;/a&gt;. The interface is more cluttered and its screen isn’t as nice with its 720p resolution and standard 60Hz refresh rate, but almost every other aspect of the device is meaningfully upgraded, from the camera to wider 5G compatibility to a stronger four-year security support policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2h8CDU"&gt;All of that said, if you’re comfortable with the N200’s shortcomings and you’re tempted by a sweet deal from T-Mobile, I won’t be the one to stand in your way.&lt;/p&gt;
