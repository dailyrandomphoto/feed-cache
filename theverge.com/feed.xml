  &lt;p id="OdLFlF"&gt;Samsung Electronics has released its second-quarter earnings, reporting 20 percent higher revenue and 54 percent higher operating profit year-on-year despite its mobile division taking a hit due to component shortages. The company made an operating profit of 12.57 trillion won (~$10.97 billion) off 63.67 trillion won (~$55.56 billion) in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z14TCM"&gt;Samsung says its mobile business suffered from the industry-wide component shortage as well as “production disruptions” in its Vietnam factories, some of which were closed after a COVID outbreak. Combined with weak seasonality resulting in less demand, revenue declined from the previous quarter, though it was still up year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — all of which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release in the fall — and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix will mandate COVID-19 vaccinations on productions in the US</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xSP5Bs"&gt;Netflix will require the casts and some crew on its productions in the US to be vaccinated against COVID-19, a measure that comes as the Delta variant continues to spread across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2vFJD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/netflix-to-require-covid-vaccinations-for-all-actors-on-us-productions-1234801577/"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; that the streaming giant recently notified its production teams that it would require casts and crew working in “Zone A” on US productions to be vaccinated. &lt;em&gt;Deadline &lt;/em&gt;described this classification as including both cast members and those who are in close contact with them. According to the report, Netflix plans to make few exceptions to the new vaccination policy, with exclusions including age, medical, and religious reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk15Ts"&gt;Netflix confirmed the measure to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; but declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s older Kindles will start to lose their internet access in December</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o2BxS2"&gt;Amazon’s Kindle e-readers with built-in 3G &lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G7H6AASHTERXBKNV&amp;amp;ref_=pe_45724480_593852510"&gt;will begin to lose the ability to connect to the internet on their own&lt;/a&gt; in the US in December, according to an email sent to customers on Wednesday. The change is due to mobile carriers transitioning from older 2G and 3G networking technology to newer 4G and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;5G networks&lt;/a&gt;. For older Kindles without Wi-Fi, this change could mean not connecting to the internet at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Instagram can take its child safety work even further  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h17Z5m"&gt;In May, I wrote here that&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-child-safety-problem-on-platforms"&gt; the child safety problem on tech platforms is worse than we knew&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-child-safety-problem-on-platforms"&gt;disturbing study&lt;/a&gt; from the nonprofit organization Thorn found that the majority of American children were using apps years before they are supposed to be — and fully a quarter of them said they have had sexually explicit interactions with adults. That puts the onus on platforms to do a better job in both identifying child users of their services and to protect them from the abuse they might find there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4CoRG"&gt;Instagram has now made some &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/giving-young-people-a-safer-more-private-experience"&gt;promising moves in that direction&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595897/instagram-under-16-accounts-private-default-limited-advertising"&gt;said that it would&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="xDb7Tx"&gt;Facebook will require its US employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 when they return to the office, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3s9aCl"&gt;“As our offices reopen, we will be requiring anyone coming to work at any of our US campuses to be vaccinated,” Facebook’s vice president of people Lori Goler said in a statement. “How we implement this policy will depend on local conditions and regulations. We will have a process for those who cannot be vaccinated for medical or other reasons and will be evaluating our approach in other regions as the situation evolves. We continue to work with experts to ensure our return to office plans prioritize everyone’s health and safety.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workers at a repair facility used by Apple compare conditions to sweatshops</title>

  &lt;p id="eKwK9I"&gt;Workers at a Houston, Texas facility that processes repairs for Apple, Dell, and Lenovo reportedly say they are working in “sweatshop” conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-repair-workers-sweatshop-csat-solutions-2021-7"&gt;according to a story from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Workers’ toilets are reportedly unsanitary and insufficient, they say they lack air conditioning, and they claim their pay is low at CSAT Solutions, a company that acts as a repair partner for tech companies like Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlrWzk"&gt;In the report, which is &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-repair-workers-sweatshop-csat-solutions-2021-7"&gt;worth reading in its entirety&lt;/a&gt;, employees also reportedly say there aren’t enough bathrooms or parking spots for the number of workers, and that they’re not allowed to use their phones while working, even in the case of family or personal emergencies. One employee told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that she got off work to discover that her...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will require masks again in most of its US stores</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MejYUc"&gt;Apple will be requiring customers and staff at most of its more than 270 US retail stores to wear masks even if they are vaccinated, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-28/apple-to-restore-mask-mandate-at-most-stores-for-shoppers-staff?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;according to a new &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, bringing back a requirement that had been removed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement"&gt;starting in June&lt;/a&gt;. The change goes into effect Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvlBaF"&gt;“After carefully reviewing the latest CDC recommendations, and analyzing the health and safety data for your local area, we are updating our guidance on face masks for your store,” Apple informed workers in a memo obtained by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “Starting July 29, face masks will be required in store for customers and team members — even if they’re vaccinated.” Apple employees who work in its corporate offices have also been told they must wear masks inside of Apple office...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZEk1VN"&gt;You may be switching jobs, or maybe you’ve decided to stop using a specific email account, or maybe you just want a copy of all your email just in case. Whatever your reasons, it’s not a bad idea to back up and export your Gmail and other Google accounts using Google’s Takeout feature. In fact, you can set your accounts to back up regularly, which is a good practice in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHv2wD"&gt;One note: if you’re backing up a company account, you may find that your company has disabled Takeout. There are third-party apps that say they can back up your Gmail, but you should check your company’s policies before you try them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eqmXEa"&gt;How to back up your Gmail:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tSrRu9"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://myaccount.google.com"&gt;myaccount.google.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cUmMit"&gt;Under Privacy &amp;amp; personalization, click on “Manage your data &amp;amp;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
