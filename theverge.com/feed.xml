    <title>Ford will start rolling out major over-the-air software updates to its vehicles this year</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JVNRXx"&gt;Ford is finally ready to start rolling out over-the-air (OTA) software updates to its vehicles at scale. While Tesla and other automakers have offered OTA updates for years, Ford only delivered its first software updates to select Ford F-150 and Mustang Mach-E customers this year. But the automaker says it’s prepared to rapidly increase the number of vehicles capable of receiving software updates, with the goal of producing 33 million vehicles with the capability by 2028. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLVFyM"&gt;Ford, which is fond of nonsensically attaching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12846440/ford-tough-ford-trucks-ford-tough-ford-tough-truck-ford"&gt;the phrase “Built Ford Tough”&lt;/a&gt; to its products, is playing it cool with the branding this time, simply calling its software updates “Ford Power Ups.” Over the past two months, Ford says over 100,000 F-150 and Mach-E...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE’s S21 competitor arrives in June for $749</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra features a large 6.67-inch screen with 144Hz refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="anuhJR"&gt;ZTE announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22384596/zte-axon-30-ultra-5g-specs-launch-us"&gt;Axon 30 Ultra alongside two other devices&lt;/a&gt; last month, and today reveals that the Ultra will go on sale June 4th starting at $749 / €749. Preorders begin &lt;a href="https://ztedevices.com/"&gt;directly through ZTE’s website&lt;/a&gt; on May 27th and include a free pair of ZTE’s Livebuds TWS earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSwaoC"&gt;While ZTE has tried some more adventurous things in its other devices that have missed the mark — an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16667508/zte-axon-m-dual-screen-smartphone-review"&gt;early attempt at a dual-screen phone&lt;/a&gt; and the world’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;under-display selfie camera&lt;/a&gt; for starters — the company is playing it straight with the Axon 30 Ultra. The phone is outfitted with cameras aplenty and high-end features, including a top-shelf Snapdragon 888 processor and a large 144Hz fast refresh rate display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAKyR5"&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra’s sub-$800 price tag positions it to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram blames ‘enforcement error’ for removal of posts about Al-Aqsa Mosque</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7Jj3EY"&gt;Instagram removed and restricted posts related to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem after its moderators confused its name with a group designated as a terrorist organization. In an internal company message &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/instagram-facebook-censored-al-aqsa-mosque"&gt;first obtained by &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a lead on the company’s Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy team called the removals “enforcement errors.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87Ke6p"&gt;Facebook, which owns Instagram, provided a copy of the internal post to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. In it, the employee wrote: “While Al-Aqsa (الأقصى) refers to a location, it is also unfortunately included in the names of several restricted organizations - by itself, however, this term should not and does not violate our policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJuwv1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;News &lt;/em&gt;reports that there is an armed group known as the Al-Aqsa...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon and WNBA strike multi-year streaming deal</title>

  &lt;p id="WgqYlQ"&gt;Amazon and the Women’s National Basketball Association have &lt;a href="https://www.wnba.com/news/amazon-and-the-wnba-reach-multi-year-deal-to-stream-16-regular-season-games-and-the-commissioners-cup-championship-on-prime-video/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a multi-year deal that’ll see several games streamed live on Prime Video. It’s the first time Amazon has ever secured exclusive Prime Video rights to pro basketball, following earlier forays into streaming sports content like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339636/nfl-streaming-deals-amazon-peacock-paramount-tubi-espn-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/7/17437248/amazon-premier-league-football-streaming-rights"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon’s Twitch has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20757665/twitch-international-streaming-partner-usa-basketball-nba"&gt;partnered with USA Basketball&lt;/a&gt; to stream international games from events like the FIBA World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCsTdd"&gt;The WNBA deal includes exclusive international streaming rights for 16 regular season games, as well as the inaugural Commissioner’s Cup game taking place on August 12.

    <title>‘Misogynistic’ Apple hire is out hours after employees call for investigation </title>

  &lt;p id="xIq2dM"&gt;Antonio García Martínez is no longer working at Apple hours after employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;circulated a petition&lt;/a&gt; calling for an investigation into his hiring. Martínez, a former Facebook product manager on the ad targeting team, authored a controversial book about Silicon Valley where he expressed misogynistic views on women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpSEnr"&gt;“We are deeply concerned about the recent hiring of Antonio García Martínez,” employees wrote in the petition. “His misogynistic statements in his autobiography — such as ‘&lt;em&gt;Most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit’&lt;/em&gt; (further quoted below this letter) — directly oppose Apple’s commitment to Inclusion &amp;amp; Diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A security researcher found Wi-Fi vulnerabilities that have existed since the beginning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPtM0vZbDOp9YHsdxLKiSn9_uJI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69278259/acastro__171016_1777_0001_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrator by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v6vzxE"&gt;The security researcher who discovered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/16/16484824/krack-wifi-encryption-bug-vulnerability-install-patch"&gt;the Krack Wi-Fi vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; has discovered &lt;a href="https://www.fragattacks.com"&gt;a slew of other flaws&lt;/a&gt; with the wireless protocol most of us use to power our online lives (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/update-windows-and-lots-of-other-stuff-asap-fragatta-1846878065"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The vulnerabilities relate to how Wi-Fi handles large chunks of data, with some being related to the Wi-Fi standard itself, and some being related to how it’s implemented by device manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niXbxn"&gt;The researcher, Mathy Vanhoef, calls the collection of vulnerabilities “FragAttacks,” with the name being a mashup of “fragmentation” and “aggregation.” He also says the vulnerabilities could be exploited by hackers, allowing them to intercept sensitive data, or show users fake websites, even if they’re using Wi-Fi networks secured with WPA2 or even WPA3. They...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel is using machine learning to make GTA V look incredibly, unsettlingly realistic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emTW_3Rw8JYa2vxj1HeRA_9OVak=/80x0:871x527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69278039/Screen_Shot_2021_05_12_at_1.20.41_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M1MlZc"&gt;One of the more impressive aspects of &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V is&lt;/em&gt; how closely the game’s San Andreas approximates real-life Los Angeles and Southern California, but &lt;a href="https://intel-isl.github.io/PhotorealismEnhancement/"&gt;a new machine learning project&lt;/a&gt; from Intel Labs called “Enhancing Photorealism Enhancement” might take that realism in a unsettlingly photorealistic direction (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/grand-theft-auto-looks-frighteningly-photorealistic-wit-1846878938"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZUYTs"&gt;Putting the game through the processes researchers Stephan R. Richter, Hassan Abu Alhaija, and Vladlen Kolten created produces a surprising result: a visual look that has unmistakable similarities to the kinds of photos you might casually take through the smudged front window of your car. You have to see it in motion to really appreciate it, but the combination of slightly washed-out lighting, smoother pavement,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The child safety problem on platforms is worse than we knew</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="B0obHy"&gt;Millions of young children are using platforms years before they turn 13 — and their presence could put many of them in danger. An &lt;a href="https://www.thorn.org/thorn-research-minors-perspectives-on-disclosing-reporting-and-blocking/"&gt;alarming new study&lt;/a&gt; has found that minors in the US often receive abuse, harassment, or sexual solicitation from adults on tech platforms. For the most part, though, children say they are not informing parents or other trusted adults about these interactions — and are instead turning for support for tech platforms, whose limited blocking and reporting tools have failed to address the threats they face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AzAr2"&gt;The report from &lt;a href="https://www.thorn.org/"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit organization that builds technology to defend children from sexual abuse, identifies a disturbing gap in efforts by Snap, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and others to keep...&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that all the big numbers around the truly rare original cards have caused a lot of excitement around new cards as well. But Target...&lt;/p&gt;
