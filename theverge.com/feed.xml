    <title>Apple is reportedly going to make more of its own chips</title>

  &lt;p id="uziLaj"&gt;Apple is reportedly working to design more chip components in-house, with the company said to be establishing a new office with the aim of replacing components that Apple currently sources from Broadcom and Skyworks, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-16/apple-builds-team-in-new-office-to-bring-wireless-chips-in-house"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9yzwE"&gt;The new office is said to be in its early stages but will eventually focus on “wireless radios, radio-frequency integrated circuits and a wireless system-on-a-chip,” in addition to “semiconductors for connecting to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12mJgk"&gt;While the A-series and M-series SoCs that contain the CPU and GPU for Apple’s iPhones and Macs get most of the attention, there are tons of additional chips inside those devices, handling things like power management, USB connectivity, wireless...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After 21 years Google Toolbar is finally gone, so we installed it one last time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="This is the page that opens after installing Google Toolbar, giving a synopsis of some of its features." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJoVgmSe38z3gmS01nrUGLyy444=/0x0:876x584/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282160/gdesktop14.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Success! You just installed the last Google Toolbar.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L7I2iY"&gt;I was lost and in search of myself after hearing the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/happy-21st-birthday-to-google-toolbar-which-inexplicably-still-exists/"&gt;devastating news on &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Google Toolbar had been put down by the search giant after nearly 21 years — longer than most projects &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/killedbygoogle/status/1470410675554033666?s=20"&gt;the company lets live&lt;/a&gt;. (A recent &lt;a href="https://museletter.area120.google.com/"&gt;newsletter effort&lt;/a&gt; didn’t make it past three months).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvGf27"&gt;There was no ceremony, no announcement, no moment of silence, nor any closure — just a “no longer available.” That’s what Google has now on its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/toolbar/answer/81376?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=6317538"&gt;Install Google Toolbar help&lt;/a&gt; page; it tells you how to uninstall the Google Toolbar and install Chrome instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to “install” Google Toolbar — the result may surprise you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jwh8Zz"&gt;It feels unreal for Google to silently forsake a tool that was, in 2008, &lt;a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/googles-chrome-kills-the-lucrative-toolbar-business/"&gt;responsible&lt;/a&gt; for 12 percent of all Google searches — and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Log4j is patched, but the exploits are just getting started</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gaRBSd"&gt;Peter Membrey, chief architect of ExpressVPN, remembers vividly seeing the news of the Log4j vulnerability break online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ofbz1n"&gt;“As soon as I saw how you could exploit it, it was horrifying,” says Membrey. “Like one of those disaster movies where there’s a nuclear power plant, they find it’s going to melt down, but they can’t stop it. You know what’s coming, but there are very limited things you can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQQvQO"&gt;Since the vulnerability was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit"&gt;uncovered last week&lt;/a&gt;, the cybersecurity world has kicked into overdrive to identify vulnerable applications, detect potential attacks, and mitigate against exploits however possible. Nonetheless, serious hacks making use of the exploit are all but certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z64xJe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As soon as I saw how you could exploit it, it was horrifying”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Google Chrome’s last-minute holiday shopping tools track prices and abandoned carts</title>

  &lt;p id="srD6OS"&gt;With time ticking away before shipping deadlines put a stop to your online holiday shopping, Google is &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/5-tips-finish-your-holiday-shopping-chrome/"&gt;highlighting a few new Chrome features&lt;/a&gt; that might help you out. Still, it’s not lost on us that these features used to keep track of stuff to help you shop are also useful for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770569/alphabet-google-market-cap-hits-2-trillion"&gt;nearly $2 trillion company&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747193/google-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-profit"&gt;makes most of its money from serving up relevant advertisements and making sure shoppers hit the “buy” button&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Google says iOS Chrome browsers will get the feature “in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An Afghan refugee who drove for Uber was killed in San Francisco — his family is seeking answers</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The family of a slain Uber driver wants the company to help them | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SJLghf"&gt;Ahmad Fawad Yusufi, a refugee from Afghanistan and father of three, was shot and killed last month in San Francisco during what &lt;a href="https://sfist.com/2021/12/08/potrero-avenue-shooting-victim-identified-as-father-of-three-who-helped-u-s-army-in-afghanistan/"&gt;police said was a botched robbery attempt&lt;/a&gt;. His family says Yusufi, a former interpreter with the US Army who lived in Sacramento, was in San Francisco to drive for Uber, a job which was their sole source of income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VkI7B"&gt;The ride-hailing company has said &lt;a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/crime/family-seeks-answers-afghan-refugee-shot-in-car/103-09455a67-69bf-4788-861d-248743a8fc47"&gt;Yusufi appeared to be “offline”&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the shooting, meaning he was not on duty, but his brother Ilyas says Yusufi worked all night Sunday driving for Uber, which was his reason for being in San Francisco at the time of the shooting early on a Monday morning. He’s written a letter to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, chief legal officer Tony West, and senior VP for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ latest true wireless earbuds offer noise cancellation for $99</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uVNUnN"&gt;OnePlus’ latest pair of true wireless earbuds are the $99 OnePlus Buds Z2. They’re double the price of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515636/oneplus-buds-z-earbuds-announced-features-price"&gt;$49.99 OnePlus Buds Z&lt;/a&gt; from last year but now benefit from active noise cancellation, a shorter stem, and a more lightweight construction. They’re available now in the US and will release in the UK and EU on December 20th for £99 and €99, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdarED"&gt;Although the Buds Z2’s price sits halfway between the Buds Z and OnePlus’ more premium $150 Buds Pro, it actually has better battery life than both of them. Battery life from the earbuds themselves is around five hours with ANC turned on, rising to seven hours when you turn it off, and combined with the case you get up to 38 hours total (dropping to 27 hours with ANC on). In...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo says test vehicle was in manual mode when it struck a pedestrian in San Francisco</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Waymo vehicle apparently struck a pedestrian in Lower Haight in San Francisco | KWillets on &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/rhlcg8/our_neighbor_was_hit_by_a_selfdriving_car/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IJ7ZkG"&gt;A Waymo autonomous vehicle struck a pedestrian in San Francisco Wednesday night, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/rhlcg8/our_neighbor_was_hit_by_a_selfdriving_car/"&gt;according to a post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesperson for the Alphabet-owned company confirmed the incident on Twitter but clarified that the vehicle was in manual mode at the time of the collision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hl1Y4Z"&gt;The incident took place in the Lower Haight neighborhood of San Francisco, where Waymo has been testing its vehicles since last summer. The Reddit user KWillets, who claims to have witnessed the collision, posted a photo of a Waymo vehicle stopped in the middle of the road with the driver-side door open. A firetruck is parked to the side, while a number of firefighters and bystanders are gathered in front of the vehicle. According to KWillets:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The House is a creepy stop-motion anthology coming to Netflix in January</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="58dteY"&gt;Once the holidays are over, and the &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt; marathons are done, you might be looking for something a little gloomier to watch — and it looks like Netflix has just the thing. The company just revealed the first trailer for its upcoming stop-motion anthology &lt;em&gt;The House&lt;/em&gt;, which debuts next month. It’s described as an “eccentric dark comedy about a house and the three surreal tales of the individuals who made it their home” that also has talking cats and mice for some reason. Each episode of the anthology is helmed by a different director — that includes Emma de Swaef and Marc Roels, Niki Lindroth von Bahr, and Paloma Baeza — and it’s produced by Nexus Studios. It also looks like it has quite the cast, with voice talent including Helena...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="WsOlSF"&gt;Apple has indefinitely delayed the date on which corporate employees will have to return to the office, according to a letter that CEO Tim Cook sent to staff on Wednesday. The letter, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, said the company’s date for returning to work, was “yet to be determined,” and he encouraged all employees to get the coronavirus vaccine and booster. &lt;/p&gt;
