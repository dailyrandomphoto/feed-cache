    <title>Ten top weather apps for Android phones</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="revCAV"&gt;One of the more popular uses for phones (besides taking photos and watching TikTok videos) is to check out the weather. As a result, there are myriad weather apps out there, making it really hard to pick which one to use. So we’ve put together this guide to what we think are some of the better ones out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcUkev"&gt;With the exception of one that used to be very well-liked: Dark Sky. Back in March 2020, Dark Sky was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;acquired by Apple&lt;/a&gt; and almost immediately removed from the Google Play app store. Originally, the Dark Sky API was going to be pulled as well — leaving a lot of third-party apps desperately looking for a substitute — but that’s been put off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527878/dark-sky-apple-ios-app-website-api-shut-down-end-of-2022"&gt;until at least the end of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. (By the way, if you use the iOS version of Dark Sky, that’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify is acquiring an audiobook company </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gaq6WhZhqk-YiB1o-171qD_L7SU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70129483/acastro_180213_1777_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1EVy8u"&gt;Spotify has announced plans to acquire the audiobook services and distribution company Findaway for an undisclosed price. The company operates multiple businesses, including distributing audiobooks to various platforms and offering audiobook creation services under its business Findaway Voices. The company pairs authors with narrators, which could become a new and valuable source of revenue for Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M31AsA"&gt;It also makes Spotify both a commercial bookseller and a publisher of audiobooks, a title the company has been hesitant to accept for its podcasting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1js05"&gt;“With this acquisition, we’re going to be able to accelerate the addition of an audiobook catalog onto the platform so that users can effectively get all of the audio content that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using Apple Pay and Touch ID on an external Magic Keyboard can get complicated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mropuN"&gt;Publications like &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/11/apple-pay-doesnt-work-on-your-magic-keyboard/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have reported some odd behavior when trying to use Apple’s Magic Keyboard with Touch ID to authenticate for Apple Pay — specifically, that it won’t work if you’re trying to do it with a MacBook that has its display closed, as it would be while running it in “clamshell mode” hooked up to an external monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECgIvc"&gt;Obviously, when the MacBook’s lid is closed, you can’t use the built-in Touch ID sensor, so it’s easy to see how this limitation was put in place. But in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607386/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip"&gt;Apple sells an external keyboard with the sensor&lt;/a&gt; (starting at &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK293LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-us-english"&gt;an eye-watering $150&lt;/a&gt;), it’s an awkward limitation. That’s especially true given that the keyboard’s Touch ID functionality only works with Apple Silicon-powered Macs...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can watch Valve’s Steam Deck developer event at 1PM ET Friday, even if you’re not a dev</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TJLYVt"&gt;We’ve known for a little while that Valve is giving developers a huge five-hour tour of its upcoming Steam Deck gaming handheld on Friday, November 12th starting at 10AM PT /  1PM ET. Now, we’re learning &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/steamworksvirtualconference/steamdeck"&gt;you can come watch&lt;/a&gt; even if you’re not a developer — Valve is telling press that “anyone can watch the event.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMQ2gu"&gt;The five-hour virtual conference will include discussions of the hardware; games that will appear &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/"&gt;“on Deck”&lt;/a&gt;; how the Linux handheld can play Windows games via a Proton compatibility layer; a deep dive on the AMD APU that powers it by AMD itself; and of course tips for Steam developers on how to make those things work in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MadBBJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s free to watch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vix6QQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3104662546549776336"&gt;The initial announcement&lt;/a&gt; made it seem like you had to be a Steamworks...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I just bought a $329 Nvidia RTX 3060 for $329, and all I had to do was wait nine months in line</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mw6LBXY92_u2mo1PaqQuHBa1jz8=/0x102:2791x1963/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70129121/verge_sean_hollister_evga_rtx_3060_20211111_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ERjrAP"&gt;Nearly nine months ago, Nvidia said it would launch its most affordable RTX 3000 graphics card yet — the $329 RTX 3060. Good luck actually finding one at that price, right? That’s why I subtitled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;my review&lt;/a&gt; “$329 with an asterisk sign.” And sure enough, they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301391/nvidia-rtx-3060-launch-supply-demand-newegg-shuffle"&gt;nigh-impossible to find on launch day&lt;/a&gt; for Nvidia’s sticker price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAFqs2"&gt;But that same day, February 25th, I signed up for EVGA’s graphics card &lt;em&gt;waiting queue&lt;/em&gt; on a whim. And after waiting in that queue for so long that I completely forgot I ever signed up, I got a surprise. On Monday, I received an email from EVGA letting me know I could actually purchase that $329 card for $329.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql4mzI"&gt;So I did. Yesterday afternoon, a brand-new RTX 3060 arrived for $379.41 after tax and shipping. That’s a...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s Starlink reveals new smaller, rectangular user dish to connect to satellites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BeTGF2gd7l76POoCr7_FFDI-dBc=/107x0:2354x1498/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128513/Screen_Shot_2021_11_11_at_12.14.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fMj61A"&gt;SpaceX’s internet-from-space initiative Starlink has &lt;a href="https://www.starlink.com/"&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; a new rectangular dish that interested customers can buy to tap into the company’s growing satellite constellation in low Earth orbit. It’s a thinner and lighter weight option than the circular dish that Starlink beta users have been testing over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40rhkK"&gt;Starlink is SpaceX’s satellite internet project, which aims to launch nearly 12,000 satellites into low Earth orbit where they can provide broadband internet coverage to people on the ground — notably those in remote and rural areas where traditional internet infrastructure is lacking. With so many satellites in low orbit at once, the idea is to have at least one satellite in view over every patch of the Earth,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Panic’s Playdate handheld delayed to early 2022</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwRWqb"&gt;Panic has delayed the first shipments of its Playdate handheld, which is kind of like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;a Game Boy but with a crank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/popagenda/playdate-2022-delay"&gt;to early 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The company said that initial units shipped with batteries &lt;a href="https://lists.play.date/w/C1CCc0cxLPvgKc6tC8jVmg"&gt;that didn’t work as expected&lt;/a&gt;, forcing it to send the units back to Malaysia to get new batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIAPOp"&gt;Panic also said that it has been affected by the global chip shortage in a significant way. Additional supply of the Playdate’s current CPU won’t be available for &lt;em&gt;two years&lt;/em&gt;, according to Panic. To get around that, Playdate units coming later in 2022 will have a revised main board that uses a more readily available CPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdklB"&gt;If you preordered a Playdate, you should be receiving an email that says when your Playdate is now estimated to ship. Orders have now...&lt;/p&gt;
