    <title>Waymo is bringing its autonomous vehicles to New York City for (manually driven) mapping</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IvFEQoJFutQk3ZLCDJbCkeUqpO8=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085218/IMG_0072.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8dfA5r"&gt;The latest autonomous vehicle company to tackle the mean streets of New York City will be Waymo. The Google spinoff is bringing a handful of cars to the Big Apple, where they will start mapping the city streets using manually driven vehicles with two people riding inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Qul4g"&gt;Waymo cited New York’s vibrant street life, “unusual road geometries” (which is a nice way of saying utterly confusing), and the likelihood of heavy rain and snow as being among the reasons the company is eager to test there. Presumedly the company is also curious to see how its vehicles will react when down-on-their-luck street hustlers slap their hoods and shout &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z-tCU-sULA"&gt;“I’m walking here!”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ndLN0"&gt;Waymo won’t have more than five vehicles on the street at a time to start out, a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to print a document when you don’t own a printer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UcV48yWBrR4u1ubd6QQE_f3BL9Y=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085276/IMG_2913.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;div id="XMQ01a"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jc3f3k"&gt;It can be difficult to figure out what to do when you’re asked to provide a hard copy of a document but don’t have access to a printer at home. While it used to be a safe bet that everyone had a printer at home, that’s no longer the case — but if you don’t have one, odds are that at some point, you’ll come across someone who hasn’t gotten the memo and insists on a hard copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0HN35"&gt;If you’ve found yourself in this situation, you’ve got options. To help, I’ve researched the various methods you can use to get a document from your computer to whoever needs it and have come up with a few tips and considerations for printing without your own printer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0mqi9"&gt;Before I get to that, though, you’ll have to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4UiFG3"&gt;Prepare to print&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="h5BMec"&gt;Presumably, the file you want...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democrats’ infrastructure bills don’t go far enough on cleaning up the power grid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gnx254"&gt;On a call Tuesday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rallied Democrats to pass two ambitious bills at the heart of President Biden’s agenda, aiming for a final house vote later this week. But the climate provisions of the $1.75 trillion budget reconciliation bill that progressives want to pass alongside a bipartisan infrastructure bill are newly uncertain after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) pushed to further delay the vote during a surprise press conference on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jOOOq"&gt;It’s the latest twist in a long struggle for Congress to pass meaningful legislation in support of the ambitious climate goals President Biden set on entering office. The reconciliation framework released last week puts $555 billion into clean energy, the first major effort to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google News to relaunch in Spain after mandatory payments to newspapers scrapped</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b5UGeanF61rutptGazygIU68AKU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70084975/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zd85vS"&gt;Who should get paid when big tech platforms aggregate news stories? This was the question that prompted Google to &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/media/google-news-spain/"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; its Google News platform in Spain in 2014, after the country decided the US tech giant should cough up a monthly fee to Spanish papers. Today, though, Google announced that Google News &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/google-news-in-spain"&gt;will return to Spain&lt;/a&gt; “early next year” after the country overhauled its online copyright laws in line with EU regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVcwQg"&gt;The big difference from Google’s point of view is that it no longer has to pay a fee to Spain’s entire media industry and can instead negotiate fees with individual publishers. Some may want to charge Google for sharing stories in Google News, and Google can pay them or exclude them, depending on its preference....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clearview AI ordered to delete all facial recognition data belonging to Australians</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RBoJJZ"&gt;Controversial facial recognition firm Clearview AI has been ordered to &lt;a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/updates/news-and-media/clearview-ai-breached-australians-privacy"&gt;destroy all images and facial templates&lt;/a&gt; belonging to individuals living in Australia by the country’s national privacy regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cr2CQz"&gt;Clearview, which claims to have scraped 10 billion images of people from social media sites in order to identify them in other photos, sells its technology to law enforcement agencies. It was &lt;a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/afp-admits-to-trialling-controversial-facial-recognition-tool-clearview-ai-546729"&gt;trialled by the Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; (AFP) between October 2019 and March 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQAnQF"&gt;Now, following an investigation, Australia privacy regulator, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), has found that the company breached citizens’ privacy. “The covert collection of this kind of sensitive information is unreasonably intrusive...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zillow reportedly needs to sell 7,000 houses after it bought too many</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zillow&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ODl9et"&gt;Zillow is trying to offload around $2.8 billion worth of houses onto investors after it bought them with the intent of selling them to hopeful homeowners and landlords, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/zillow-selling-7-000-homes-for-2-8-billion-after-flipping-halt?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="oAMtou"&gt;On Tuesday, Zillow announced in its earnings report that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760080/zillow-offers-home-selling-ibuyer-wind-down-excess-inventory-losses-financial-results"&gt;winding down the practice entirely&lt;/a&gt;, and estimated that it’ll lose over half a billion dollars in value on the houses it owns. It also announced that it would be laying off about a quarter of its employees, and said that it had underestimated how...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HYaZ7v"&gt;Tis’ the season for AirPods discounts galore. Last week, Apple finally launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third generation of AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, introducing a new AirPods lineup and dropping the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level AirPods from $159 to $129. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are also just around the corner, meaning many retailers are also starting to discount the AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and even the aforementioned third-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hV5pag"&gt;Even this far ahead of the shopping holiday, there are sizable discounts to be had on the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on the entry-level AirPods,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now, technically, build your own USB-C iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rUhqOu"&gt;Robotics engineering student Ken Pillonel wowed the internet last month with a wild hack that managed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722123/first-iphone-usb-c-port-robotics-engineering-student-custom"&gt;put a working USB-C port&lt;/a&gt; inside an iPhone X for a fully functional USB-C iPhone. And now, Pillonel has published a far more detailed video showing just how he managed to pull off the hack, &lt;a href="https://github.com/kenp-io/not-for-iphone-usb-c/tree/master/ip-x"&gt;along with a Github repository&lt;/a&gt; with technical details, CNC instructions, and information on the custom PCB that he designed for anyone brave enough to try and put together a similar hack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiIyLz"&gt;The 13-minute-long video shows off the nitty-gritty of Pillonel’s mod, which is simple in theory: combining a Lightning to USB-C connection together in a daisy chain to mimic a proper USB-C port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="brDvJQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
