    <title>DOJ reportedly considers filing criminal charges against Tether and Bitfinex execs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A smartphone displays the Tether market value on the stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZgOLQCFeFgTOUuaHnF1grtbR4d0=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635795/1025441174.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="M6KbYq"&gt;More than three years after initial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16951928/us-cftc-subpoena-bitfinex-tether-fiat-stablecoin-fraud-suspicions"&gt;reports of a federal investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the cryptocurrency stablecoin Tether, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/tether-executives-said-to-face-criminal-probe-into-bank-fraud?srnd=economics-vp&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that it remains a “potential” criminal case. In response to the report, the price of Bitcoin surged, briefly rising over $40,000 for the first time since mid-June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jQDXP"&gt;Unlike Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, a stablecoin ties its value to another asset — which, in this case, is one US dollar — backed by actual money or other holdings. It’s useful for traders to instantly make moves without worrying about rapid swings in the market. However, as &lt;a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/"&gt;many have documented&lt;/a&gt;, going back to 2014 when Tether was introduced, there are parts of its history that don’t add up to the story it’s telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AC6HJj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is business as...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Intel will make Qualcomm chips in new foundry deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wJkssiUJx-bjY6M6RfVdemJmqo=/25x0:1447x948/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635723/Screen_Shot_2021_07_26_at_5.38.24_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgyDkH"&gt;Intel has announced its first major customer for its new Intel Foundry Services business: Qualcomm. Best known for designing the Snapdragon chips that power most major Android phones, Qualcomm will start to have its chips manufactured by Intel in the coming years using Intel’s upcoming 20A process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUw67K"&gt;No timeframe has been announced for when the first Intel-made Qualcomm chips will arrive or which of Qualcomm’s products Intel will produce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MQ9mNW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel has a new architecture roadmap and a plan to retake its chipmaking crown in 2025","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hqO8J0"&gt;Additionally, Amazon’s AWS will be working with Intel Foundry Services, relying on Intel’s packaging solutions (although Intel won’t be directly making chips for Amazon).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NEwDcD"&gt;Qualcomm will rely on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;Intel’s newly announced Intel 20A technology&lt;/a&gt; node, scheduled for release in 2024. Intel 20A will...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nearly a thousand Activision Blizzard employees slam its response to harassment suit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard Video game company logo seen displayed" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgL2Ij-3DiNbJh4RFbaKApFa3nk=/0x384:4608x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635660/1076534092.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fInCj1"&gt;Hundreds of Activision Blizzard employees have signed a letter (published by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/activision-blizzard-staff-sign-petition-supporting-labor-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22594765/activision-blizzard-open-letter-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/over-1-000-activision-blizzard-employees-sign-letter-co-1847364340"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;that rebukes the company’s response to California’s allegations that Activision Blizzard has a discriminatory work culture and issues with sexual harassment. The company’s response to the lawsuit, which paints &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;an extremely upsetting picture&lt;/a&gt; of its culture and how women are treated there, has largely been to deny the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSHnll"&gt;In their letter, which can be read below, the employees say that response “creates a company atmosphere that disbelieves victims,” and they call for “immediate corrections” from the company’s top leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxeSWh"&gt;The letter was written in response to both public and internal statements made by Activision Blizzard...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel has a new architecture roadmap and a plan to retake its chipmaking crown in 2025</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Leban5"&gt;Intel is rethinking how it releases — and brands — its semiconductor innovations, CEO Pat Gelsinger announced today at the company’s Intel Accelerated webcast. The announcement includes the broad strokes of the next half-decade of Intel’s processor roadmap, new chip and packaging technologies, and a promise of an “annual cadence of innovation,” with the ultimate goal of seeing Intel retake its leadership in the processor space by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUGAKD"&gt;Future Intel products (starting as early as its upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225514/intel-12th-gen-hybrid-alder-lake-chips-2h-ces-2021"&gt;12th Gen Alder Lake&lt;/a&gt; chips later this year) will no longer use the nanometer-based node nomenclature that both it and the rest of the chipmaking industry has used for years. Instead, Intel is debuting a new naming scheme that it says will provide “a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla finally made a profit without the help of emission credits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model Y" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVQMeCFb-PDTz9gywJL5Mswj60Q=/418x0:3582x2109/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635391/0x0_Model_Y_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R0sPCO"&gt;Tesla sold enough cars and energy products to turn a profit &lt;em&gt;even without&lt;/em&gt; counting the sale of emissions credits to other automakers — a milestone for the company. This was the eighth profitable quarter in a row for Tesla, but the first where it can truly say it’s a profitable automaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvJVKU"&gt;Tesla &lt;a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf"&gt;shared Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it logged a $1.1 billion profit in the second quarter of 2021, with $354 million of that coming from credit sales. The rest came from automotive sales, as well as a boost in energy storage sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSIeyX"&gt;Tesla pulled this off despite taking a loss of $23 million on its big Bitcoin bet (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay"&gt;something that had helped it to a profit last quarter&lt;/a&gt;), a delayed rollout of the revamped Model S sedan and Model X SUV, and the global semiconductor...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zUfn7z"&gt;Best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>How to responsibly get rid of the stuff you’ve decluttered</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w4Liij"&gt;If you’ve been at home for over a year, you may have taken the opportunity to go through all those tech devices, books, old clothes, and other detritus that has piled up over the years. Or perhaps you’ve upgraded a bunch of your possessions recently and have suddenly realized you don’t have room for the stuff you’ve replaced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvET57"&gt;Whatever the reason, if you’ve got bags of tech, clothing, books, and other stuff that you need to get rid of, you want to get rid of them responsibly. Where do you go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEhTDO"&gt;As you must know by now, just dumping it isn’t an option. Reusing and recycling old and unneeded stuff has become an important aspect of the push to preserve the world’s environment. Many states and urban areas are mandating the recycling...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="7wBufS"&gt;Even more week-long, “record-shattering” heatwaves are coming for us. From now until 2050, if greenhouse gas emissions stay high, the odds of such heatwaves happening are two to seven times greater than they were over the past few decades, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01092-9"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;. From 2051 to 2080, those prolonged, record-breaking events are expected to become three to 21 times more probable than they were in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bS7dp"&gt;The authors of the new study, published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Climate Change&lt;/em&gt;, used climate models to come to their conclusions. But there’s already plenty of evidence in the world around us that backs up this study and others that link climate change to more frequent and severe heatwaves. Yet another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547454/2021-heat-wave-temperature-high-heat-dome"&gt;heat dome&lt;/a&gt; is stifling much of...&lt;/p&gt;
