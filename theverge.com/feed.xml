    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ea9kk2"&gt;A new experimental application on Android aims to make communication easier for people with speech and motor impairments, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/look-to-speak"&gt;Google announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The Look to Speak app lets users choose preselected phrases on their phone screen with their eyes. It’s available to everyone and is compatible with Android 9.0 and above, including Android One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJZaLf"&gt;Richard Cave, a highly specialist speech and language therapist at Google, works with people who have speech and motor impairments, especially people who are nonverbal and need assistance communicating. “It’s more than a job for me, it’s a passion,” Cave said in a blog post announcing the app. “Every day, I strive to help people find easier and more accessible ways to express their everyday needs,...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cyQH7O"&gt;Today, esports and entertainment organization FaZe Clan announces their new talent development program, FaZe Academy. It places a bunch of potential FaZe recruits into a bootcamp to get a shot at being a full-fledged member of the organization. It’s a long way from how the organization used to recruit in the beginning — which was by Twitter DM, says Darren Yan, VP of Talent at FaZe. The point of the Academy is to create lifelong FaZe members, and its first class will be announced in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuet5k"&gt;It’s an interesting idea, not least because cultivating successive generations of talent ensures that organizations can stay relevant even after their original members have quit the scene. In that regard, the Academy is something of a legacy builder:...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe releases Arm version of Lightroom for Windows and macOS </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jfq2Uw1xX4tufNM_y3d5B5-asg0=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68477312/adobelightroom.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JvwjHG"&gt;Adobe is releasing an Arm version of Lightroom for both macOS and Windows today. The latest version of Lightroom is now native for both Apple M1 systems and Qualcomm-powered Windows 10 devices. It’s debuting as a full release, rather than a beta version and Adobe is making it part of the regular Creative Suite installer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyxEn8"&gt;While this native Arm version is the new version of Lightroom, if you’re a fan of the classic Lightroom then you’ll need to wait a little longer for Adobe to ship it. “We intend to ship Apple M1 native versions as soon as they are ready, so stay tuned,” &lt;a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/2020/12/08/december-photography-updates.html#gs.myqpo5"&gt;says Sharad Mangalick&lt;/a&gt;, a program manager on the photography team at Adobe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bx1XYM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Adobe has also released a beta version of Photoshop for Arm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PAXcCY"&gt;This latest update to Lightroom...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus will launch on December 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ztT7Cb"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus — the company’s new workout program service — is set to launch on December 14th, the company announced today, with the subscription service set to cost $9.99 per month (or $79.99 per year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PptfBG"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus was announced earlier this year as Apple’s latest attempt to continue to bolster its subscription offers, and will feature Peloton-style guided workouts that can be viewed on an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, while utilizing an Apple Watch for tracking workout metrics as you go. The service will launch with ten workout types: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), strength, yoga, dance, core, cycling, treadmill (for both running and walking), rowing, and “mindful cooldown.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces $549 AirPods Max noise-canceling headphones, coming December 15th</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j0oG5H"&gt;It turns out Apple has one more major hardware announcement before 2020 comes to a close: after many months of rumors, Apple today unveiled its own over-ear, noise-canceling headphones. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fairpods-max%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F21438042%2Fapple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;They’re called the AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; and come with the premium design you’d expect from flagship Apple headphones. They also come with an extremely premium $549 price and are set to go on sale December 15th. Preorders start today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbQL2p"&gt;The AirPods Max come in five colors: space gray, silver, sky blue, green, and pink. They feature what Apple calls a “custom acoustic design” with a 40mm driver system “that provides rich, deep bass, accurate mid-ranges, and crisp, clean high-frequency extension so every note can be heard.” Apple has brought over a number of features...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit’s top post of 2020 was a Rick Astley photo, posted by Rick Astley</title>

  &lt;p id="7TibP2"&gt;Reddit shared today that its most upvoted post of 2020 was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/haucpf/ive_found_a_few_funny_memories_during_lockdown/"&gt;a picture from 1989&lt;/a&gt; posted by &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ReallyRickAstley/"&gt;Rick Astley&lt;/a&gt;, the living meme himself. Reddit’s Year in Review blogs can be a good insight into broader internet culture, and the site’s listing of the most popular topics of conversations certainly included the largest issue of the year: “COVID-19” was mentioned over 50.2 million times. But they also include other forms of virality as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPt3jp"&gt;Rick Astley is known for the single “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"&gt;Never Gonna Give You Up&lt;/a&gt;” from 1987, which was already a number one worldwide hit even before the music video for the song was used &lt;a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/an-oral-history-of-rickrolling"&gt;to create the rickrolling meme&lt;/a&gt;. Rickrolls were all the rage during the early 2000s web, and based on the interactions this r/pics post has...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hinge is about to become The Bachelor</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dsSklZ"&gt;Hinge’s newest feature takes a cue from &lt;em&gt;The Bachelor.&lt;/em&gt; In a new tab called Standouts, daters can preview potential matches’ responses to the dating app’s prompts and give anyone they’re interested in a “rose.” Users only receive one free rose per week, which refreshes on Sundays, so they’ll have to buy more to give them out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWMCeA"&gt;One rose costs $3.99, six cost $19.99, and 12 go for $29.99. Tim MacGougan, the company’s chief product officer, says the higher price point is meant to encourage scarcity and deep intention behind receiving a rose. If someone is potentially paying $4 to send a rose, you might weigh their like more heavily when deciding whether to like them back. (Any likes sent with roses are automatically sent to the top of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Christopher Nolan isn’t happy with Warner Bros. over HBO Max releases</title>

  &lt;p id="54aCmL"&gt;Director Christopher Nolan has fiercely criticized Warner Bros.’ surprise decision to release its 2021 lineup of films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;simultaneously on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, which he called “the worst streaming service.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AO4CZZ"&gt;“Some of our industry’s biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service,” the director &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christopher-nolan-rips-hbo-max-as-worst-streaming-service-denounces-warner-bros-plan"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He added that the studio “had an incredible machine for getting a filmmaker’s work out everywhere” but claims it’s dismantling it in a move which “makes no economic sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="stbgbY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s such controversy around it, because they didn’t tell anyone”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>VW-backed QuantumScape says its solid-state batteries will enable EVs to travel farther and charge faster</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jxuh5L"&gt;After nearly a decade in operation, QuantumScape, a San Jose-based startup backed by Volkswagen and Bill Gates, is finally breaking its silence. In a virtual “battery day” event for investors, the recently public company announced that its “solid state” batteries for electric vehicles will charge faster, hold more power, and last longer than traditional EV batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XCpdZ"&gt;Solid-state batteries have eluded researchers for decades. Most EV companies use “wet” lithium-ion batteries, which use liquid electrolytes to move energy around. But these batteries can be slow to charge, can freeze up in subzero temperatures, and contain flammable material that can be hazardous in the event of a crash. &lt;/p&gt;
