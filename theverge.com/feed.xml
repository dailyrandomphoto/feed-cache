  &lt;p id="AaJQvC"&gt;Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III on Sunday activated stage 1 of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF), ordering six commercial airlines to provide passenger planes to help evacuate people from US military bases in the Middle East, the Department of Defense said in a &lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2741564/department/"&gt;news release. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6Rjmv"&gt;The planes won’t fly in or out of the Kabul airport in Afghanistan, but will help transport Afghans and US citizens who have arrived at bases in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The plan calls for 18 planes total; four from United Airlines, three each from American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Airlines, and Omni Air, and two from Hawaiian Airlines. The DoD said in the release it doesn’t expect the CRAF activation to have a major impact on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook releases shelved content transparency report after criticism it wasn’t being transparent</title>

  &lt;p id="GQfDZZ"&gt;Facebook released a &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ixy9meh6vari4lf/Q1-Content-Transparency-Report-V0-US-internal-copy%20%281%29.pdf?dl=0"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; (.pdf) late Saturday about its most-viewed posts in the first quarter of 2021 that it had initially shelved reportedly because it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634841/facebook-most-viewed-content-report-look-bad"&gt;made the company look bad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehuzFH"&gt;As first &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/facebook-popular-posts.html"&gt;reported by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; which obtained a copy of the Q1 report before Facebook released it, the most-viewed link on Facebook between January and March of this year was a since-updated news story that suggested a Florida doctor’s death may be linked to the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__w3jh76vv54l"&gt;Facebook policy communications manager Andy Stone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1429208057947561987?s=20"&gt;tweeted Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that the criticism Facebook received for not releasing the report “wasn’t unfair,” but tried to unpack the complexities of how it handled that most-viewed link: &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CEO of Saygus smartphone company that never released a phone charged with fraud</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;This is the Saygus V2, which authorities say was never released.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uz7zUV"&gt;A Utah man who touted a revolutionary new smartphone for several years but failed to produce one, has been charged by the US Attorney’s office in Utah with securities fraud. a new filing shows. Chad Leon Sayers solicited approximately 300 investors to invest $10 million in Saygus, promising “imminent billion-dollar success,” &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ut/united-states-vs-chad-leon-sayers"&gt;according to the Justice Department.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWj0id"&gt;Instead of using the funds he raised to create the promised smartphone, he paid personal expenses and debts, and paid older investors with funds he raised from newer ones, which the US Attorney’s office in Utah called “Ponzi-like.” Sayers allegedly spent $2.17 million of the money raised on office rent, about $800,000 of the funds to settle other lawsuits, $500,000 on legal fees,...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="yUujrc"&gt;Samsung devices that support Samsung Pay can now store digital versions of users’ COVID-19 vaccination cards, through a partnership with healthcare nonprofit The Commons Project, the smartphone company &lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/pressreleases/the-commons-project-foundation-introduces-smart-health-cards-within-samsung-pay"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YksKRt"&gt;Users have to first download the free CommonHealth app from the Google Play store, and follow the instructions to access their COVID-19 vaccine record, from participating pharmacies, health systems, and health providers (not all providers are connected to the system yet). Once the user has access to their COVID-19 credential within the CommonHealth app, they can add it to their Samsung Pay wallet. The Covid-19 Vaccine Pass will then be available on the Samsung Pay app home page. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story of why Aaliyah’s ‘One in a Million’ album took 20 years to come to streaming </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eWoKb7"&gt;The 1996 album “One in  a Million,” by Aaliyah finally came to streaming platforms on Friday, almost 20 years after the singer’s death in a 2001 plane crash. A huge star in the 1990s and early 2000s, much of Aaliyah’s music has been missing from streaming platforms for the past two decades. As &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9610793/aaliyah-music-return-streaming-services-blackground-empire/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; magazine reported&lt;/a&gt; in a lengthy feature earlier this month, Aaliyah’s uncle, music producer Barry Hankerson, and her estate, controlled by her mother Diane Haughton and brother Rashad Haughton, have been at odds for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scB1w1"&gt;According to&lt;em&gt; Billboard,&lt;/em&gt; Hankerson has made a distribution deal to release the entire catalog of Blackground Records— which includes Aaliyah’s music as well as recordings from other artists including Timbaland &amp;amp; Magoo,...&lt;/p&gt;

The new law comes as Chinese tech firms have come under renewed scrutiny in the country, and sets rules around how companies handle users’ information. The law takes effect on November 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGNemt"&gt;The law—formally called the Personal Information Protection Law— was passed by China’s legislature on Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-passes-new-personal-data-privacy-law-take-effect-nov-1-2021-08-20/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, and calls for companies to get users’ consent before collecting personal data, and has rules for how companies should ensure users’ data is protected when it’s transferred outside of China.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9fE9RP"&gt;Social audio app Clubhouse has joined other social platforms in taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of its users in Afghanistan. Earlier this week, the platform reset tens of thousands of its Afghan users’ bios and photos, and made their accounts more difficult to discover in search. A spokesperson for Clubhouse said the actions didn’t affect the users’ followers, and all of the changes can be reversed if a user prefers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wHI3A7"&gt;

    <title>Judge rules California Prop 22 gig workers law is unconstitutional</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="awPxLG"&gt;California’s gig workers law, which allows companies like Uber and Lyft to treat workers as independent contractors— not employees— has been ruled unconstitutional and unenforceable by a judge. Voters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;approved the law as ballot initiative Proposition 22&lt;/a&gt; in November, with companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash spending more than $200 million to campaign for the measure. Labor organizations, including the Service Employees International Union, opposed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4QeG9"&gt;California Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch ruled Friday that the law illegally “limits the power of a future legislature to define app-based drivers as workers subject to workers’ compensation law,” adding that “The entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable.” He also ruled that it was...&lt;/p&gt;

Walmart also has a few more colors available at the same price, and both offer the red at an additional $6 markdown.
