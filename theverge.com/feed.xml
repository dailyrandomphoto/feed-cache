    <title>Welcome to Twitter, Jon Stewart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jon Stewart anti social network" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9s9-6K0bIJs8vewnvuJ7SqBP6Wo=/0x19:400x286/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68737853/jon-stewart.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V8kEiG"&gt;Jon Stewart has just joined Twitter, and is now the proud owner of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jon_actual/"&gt;a verified account&lt;/a&gt;. And, of course, his first tweet was about the redditors on r/WallStreetBets and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254857/robinhood-gamestop-amc-shares-sold-surprised-users"&gt;their stonks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqdUdU"&gt;While it may be the first time he’s made an appearance on Twitter, Stewart is already fitting right in — with a profile picture that’s not actually of him, but a dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9WFixW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is bullshit. The Redditors aren't cheating, they're joining a party Wall Street insiders have been enjoying for years. Don't shut them down...maybe sue them for copyright infringement instead!!&lt;br&gt;We've learned nothing from 2008.&lt;br&gt;Love&lt;br&gt;StewBeef&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Stewart (@jon_actual) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jon_actual/status/1354901018564321287?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="2cPCyg"&gt;Fellow late-night commentator Stephen Colbert jumped in to welcome him to the platform, giving Stewart a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood denies claims that it sold GameStop shares out from under its traders</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HrSPad"&gt;No, Robinhood tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, it didn’t sell off full shares of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop, AMC, and other buzzy stocks&lt;/a&gt; without permission from its traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9qz0P"&gt;That contradicts the stories of twelve people who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;saying that the app unexpectedly sold off their holdings in some of these companies. Quite a number of Robinhood users expressed their surprise on social media today that the app was selling off their stakes, and we tracked down a dozen of them. These traders didn’t believe they had prompted the sales, and they said they weren’t aware of anything on their account that would have automatically triggered them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZTzgT"&gt;“I didn’t have any triggers to sell the stock whether it went up or down. I certainly wouldn’t have put it at $197 when...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>University will stop using controversial remote-testing software following student outcry</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UEgGHl"&gt;The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign &lt;a href="https://emails.illinois.edu/newsletter/1970177238.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will discontinue its use of remote-proctoring software Proctorio after its summer 2021 term. The decision follows almost a year of outcry over the service, both on UIUC’s campus and around the US, citing concerns with privacy, discrimination, and accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGBLzk"&gt;Proctorio is one of the most prominent software platforms that colleges and universities use to watch for cheating on remote tests. It uses what its website describes as “machine learning and advanced facial detection technologies” to record students through their webcams while they work on their exams and monitor the position of their heads. The software flags “suspicious signs” to professors, who can review its...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google salvaged Robinhood’s one-star rating by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SIPC Says It Has Serious Concerns About Robinhood’s New Product" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzgdUXSF7n4v7Fn6C3gfNJZwkN4=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68737535/1073282662.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ryz6V1"&gt;Google is actively removing negative reviews of the Robinhood app from the Google Play Store, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;After some disgruntled Robinhood users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7001b/do_your_part_tank_robinhoods_rating_in_the_app/"&gt;organized&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hamiolhs/status/1354789899510149125?s=21"&gt;campaigns&lt;/a&gt; to give the app a one-star review on Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store — and succeeded in review-bombing it all the way down to a one-star rating — the company has now deleted enough reviews to bring it back up to nearly four stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLWSRC"&gt;Robinhood came under intense scrutiny on Thursday, after the stock trading app announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;it would block purchases of GameStop, AMC, and other stocks&lt;/a&gt; made popular by the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, and some users have already replaced their deleted one-star reviews with new ones to make their anger heard.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gambling apps are coming to Google’s Play Store in the US and 14 other countries</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XwP73j"&gt;An upcoming change to Google’s Play Store policies will allow gambling and betting Android apps that use real money in 15 more countries, including the US, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/28/google-play-android-gambling-apps/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, gambling apps are only allowed in &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9877032"&gt;four countries&lt;/a&gt;: Brazil, France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gA1zel"&gt;The new rules will be applied starting on March 1st, and they’ll permit gambling apps in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and the United States. Of course, each country will have its own limitations on what kind of online gambling is legal, with some countries allowing online casinos, sports betting, lotteries, and daily fantasy sports, and some being more...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games Store users claimed 749 million free games last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u7SqDn6Cig3DDXNHsJGw7FqiYTw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736814/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qepgyE"&gt;Epic Games Store released a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2020-year-in-review"&gt;bevy of stats&lt;/a&gt; to show off how its game storefront grew in 2020 compared to 2019, its launch year. It announced that there are over 160 million accounts now on PC, up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064951/epic-game-store-users-number-cross-play-revenue-valve-steam"&gt;108 million users registered in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It almost doubled in monthly active users from 32 million in December 2019 to 56 million last month. Epic also saw its daily active user count go up to 31.3 million, which the company claims is a 192 percent boost. Its peak concurrent player count hit 13 million in 2020, almost doubling its 7 million peak in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVJUlj"&gt;Unsurprising to no one, giving away free games each week is a nice way to keep people coming back to your storefront. (It also helps when your store is the sole provider of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on PC.)...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood will allow ‘limited buys’ of stocks like GameStop starting Friday</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p7rRY3"&gt;Robinhood has announced that, beginning on Friday, January 29th, it will allow “limited buys” on restricted stocks, potentially signaling the end of a brutal day-long hold on GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Nokia, and other stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgzS4T"&gt;“Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities,” the company &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed.” The company’s statement does not elaborate on how limited purchases will be for GameStop and the other restricted stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eZSElg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To be clear, this was a risk-management decision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V1nB2W"&gt;On Thursday morning, Robinhood restricted purchases of GameStop and the other stocks, which had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;driven to unusually high prices&lt;/a&gt; by coordinated activity on the...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="y20Wg8"&gt;Financial services company E-Trade has restricted purchases of GameStop and AMC stock, the company has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge — &lt;/em&gt;and, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255031/robinhood-gamestop-stop-purchases-reddit-wsb-stock-market"&gt;like Robinhood,&lt;/a&gt; it plans to resume trading of both stocks on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
