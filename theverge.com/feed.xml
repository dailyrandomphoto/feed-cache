    <title>Chinese companies are suing Amazon after getting banned for paid reviews</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rW7Egv"&gt;Several Chinese companies have filed a class-action complaint against Amazon for banning them from the Amazon marketplace over their use of paid reviews, a new complaint filed on September 13th claims. In the last year, Amazon has cracked down on companies soliciting paid reviews on its platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680269/amazon-ban-chinese-brands-review-abuse-fraud-policy"&gt;claiming to have permanently banned 600 Chinese brands&lt;/a&gt; across 3,000 seller accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SR7iBT"&gt;The companies listed in the complaint, doing business as Sopownic, Slaouwo, Deyixun, Cstech, Recoo Direct, Angelbliss, and Tudi, are seeking “recovery of funds that are being illegally and improperly withheld by Amazon” and are filing the class action to “stop any further misappropriation and misuse of funds that are legally and rightfully due to thousands of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA clears Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo for flight after probe into July incident</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P7FAry"&gt;Virgin Galactic is cleared to resume flights of its SpaceShipTwo space plane, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Wednesday, after capping a safety investigation into issues that came up during the company’s July flight carrying its founder Richard Branson. During that mission, SpaceShipTwo strayed from its designated airspace on its descent from space, and Virgin Galactic didn’t tell the FAA about it when it was supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXcghp"&gt;With the investigation now closed, the FAA required Virgin Galactic to make changes “on how it communicates to the FAA during flight operations to keep the public safe,” it said in a statement. Virgin Galactic said that includes “updated calculations to expand the protected airspace for future flights”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Switch Pro was real</title>

  &lt;p id="K1AXUG"&gt;Don’t get me wrong; we’re excited about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview'"&gt;Nintendo’s new OLED Switch&lt;/a&gt; — the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257643/nintendo-switch-lite-how-to-buy-in-stock"&gt;preorders&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; newsroom confirms it. But what about the more powerful Switch that so many of us thought was around the corner? A new &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/nintendo-switch-4k-developers-make-games-for-nonexistent-console?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report suggests that the global chip shortage is why plans fell through for a “Switch Pro” with upgraded hardware from Nvidia and 4K resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ll0JLN"&gt;The outlet previously reported on the device and backs up those reports by saying it’s identified at least 11 developers, like Zynga, who have received 4K Nintendo Switch development kits. Specifically, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; claims employees heard from Nintendo that they should design games to target the higher resolution. In response, Nintendo told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; its reporting was...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok settles lawsuit with actress over its original text-to-speech voice</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AfRJ4J"&gt;TikTok has agreed to settle a lawsuit with Bev Standing, the voice actress who said she was behind the app’s original text-to-speech voice. Standing sued TikTok in May, saying that the app was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22435058/tiktok-voice-sues-unauthorized-usage-text-to-speech"&gt;using her voice without permission&lt;/a&gt;. A robotic version of what sounded like Standing’s voice had been in the app for months, speaking over what felt like every other video at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onzcGh"&gt;A lawyer for Standing said the settlement was still being finalized and details around payment could not be disclosed. “They’ve reached an amicable resolution,” Robert Sciglimpaglia, who represents Standing, said in a phone call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Sciglimpaglia said TikTok would license Standing’s voice as part of the agreement, but it’s up to TikTok whether or not to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cadillac axes Escalade’s hands-free driving feature due to chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MIsXUGo-B97pTWLVIzVqO1DLbIw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69928293/cadillac_2021_escalade_0433.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XrhZig"&gt;The 2022 Escalade is heading into production, but it’ll be missing a key feature when the first customers pick up their new ride: the hands-free driving mode known as Super Cruise. It’s the latest feature to get the axe as a result of the global semiconductor shortage, which has been an especially big drain on the auto industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImJ4Yc"&gt;The shortage is also forcing Cadillac to hold off on adding Super Cruise to the CT4 and CT5 sedans, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2022-cadillac-escalade-super-cruise-hands-free-chip-shortage/?UniqueID=A3F2E32E-2148-11EC-8A3C-BD1F16F31EAE&amp;amp;PostType=link&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-09-29T17%3A14%3A01&amp;amp;ServiceType=twitter&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Roadshow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; With the Bolt currently not on sale due to the massive battery recall, that means parent company General Motors’ most advanced technological feature is currently not available on any new car. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring’s Always Home Cam security drone is ready for takeoff.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ngbeZJ"&gt;First announced at last year’s Amazon hardware event, the Ring Always Home Cam is now ready for take-off. Starting today, September 28th, you can request an invitation to be a crash-test dummy for Ring’s newest innovation. The Always Home Cam is a Ring camera attached to a drone that can fly predetermined paths in your home when triggered via a Ring Alarm sensor or from the Ring app. The camera costs $249.99; if you live in the US, you can apply for &lt;a href="https://ring.com/always-home-cam-flying-camera"&gt;an invitation to buy it&lt;/a&gt; today, and the devices will ship later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BjxoL"&gt;Designed to solve the problem of wanting to be able to see inside your home when you’re not there but not wanting to have dozens of cameras watching you when you are, the Always Home Cam only records when it’s in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says a new wired Nest doorbell is coming next year</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gLODRV"&gt;Google is working on a successor to the excellent Nest Hello doorbell, which it recently rebranded the Nest Doorbell (wired). The new Nest Doorbell will support 24/7 recording, will work with the Google Home app (not the Nest app), and should launch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwOVcb"&gt;Rishi Chandra, GM of Google Nest, shared the news in a &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Message-from-our-GM-Updates-for-our-Nest-customers/ba-p/17122"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on the Google Nest Community forum today. “We commit to being more transparent with you on where we are taking the camera portfolio,” writes Chandra. “We know that those with wired doorbell connections prefer to have a doorbell that can also support 24/7 continuous video history (via the Nest Aware subscription). We are excited to share that we will be launching a 2nd generation of Nest Doorbell (wired) in 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LDeupH"&gt;Twitch is adding new tools in the fight against harassment on the platform. Twitch announced it will be adding phone verification chat controls that will allow streamers to require a viewer to have a verified phone number in order to chat. Additionally, Twitch is tweaking the existing email verification settings to give creators greater control over who gets to chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ekA9Lv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we're putting more power in the hands of the community, by enabling phone verified chat! Now creators and mods can require viewers to verify their account via phone number (or email) before they can chat. For more information review the blog: &lt;a href="https://t.co/TlqCS4OzQC"&gt;https://t.co/TlqCS4OzQC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1443276027686383622?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Sonos says Google is blocking it from offering more than one voice assistant at once</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HKpy5o"&gt;Sonos developed a system called “Concurrency” that could make multiple voice assistants interoperable on its smart speakers but had to put its plans on hold because of Google, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/29/smart-home-monopoly/"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62CEZo"&gt;Concurrency does more or less what its name suggests by allowing Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa to be used side by side. “Sonos today sells speakers that let you choose between Alexa and Google, but only one can operate at a time — you have to disable one before you can use the other. In the Concurrency demo, talking to both of them required nothing more than saying their names,” &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; shares about Sonos’ demo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5HsCok"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sonos wants voice assistants to work together&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id="QlIRA3"&gt;On Tuesday, Elon Musk accused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699254/musk-bezos-spacex-blue-origin-code-confernce-2021"&gt;Jeff Bezos and his companies&lt;/a&gt; of using the legal system to slow SpaceX’s progress during a talk at the 2021 Code Conference. Just a few hours later, Amazon — which is working on a competing satellite-based internet project — sent &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; an unsolicited 13-page list of lawsuits, government petitions, and other legal actions that SpaceX has taken over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cpt0vA"&gt;“Attached is a list of some of the times SpaceX has sued the U.S. government on procurement matters and protested various governmental decisions,” a spokesperson for Amazon’s satellite division, Project Kuiper, wrote in the email. “It is difficult to reconcile their own historical record with their recent position on others filing similar actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
