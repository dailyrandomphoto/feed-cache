    <title>Microsoft is giving away free Windows 11 ice cream in NYC today</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg is a limited edition ice cream at Mikey Likes It.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Mikey Likes It Ice Cream&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRp864"&gt;Microsoft has teamed up with Mikey Likes It Ice Cream in New York City to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeyLikesItNY/status/1445447586450587651"&gt;give away free frozen dessert&lt;/a&gt; today. The collaboration marks the release of Windows 11 and part of what would normally, before the pandemic, include a Windows launch party in New York City. The “Bloomberry” (not to be confused with Bloomberg) ice cream looks like a frozen mix of the default Bloom Windows 11 wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXrcqj"&gt;The blueberry flavored ice cream is free at &lt;a href="https://mikeylikesiticecream.com/pages/hours"&gt;Mikey Likes It locations&lt;/a&gt; in the East Village and Harlem until stocks freeze up. We’re not sure if there are any entry requirements to getting this Windows 11 ice cream, like having to enable TPM 2.0 at the door, so please get in touch if you have to turn Secure Boot on to get your free ice cream. Please also...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use snap layouts in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bdslg0JlE-_tthhLPCHZXUj-dAk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955619/Screenshot__73_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FWzwaI"&gt;Windows 11 may not be exactly revolutionary, but there are some features that are just plain useful, and snap layouts are one of them. Replacing the drag-and-drop snap assist feature of Windows 10, snap layouts let you arrange your apps quickly and neatly on your desktop, making it much simpler to see all and use all at once. (Certainly, it’s a lot better than the constant Alt-Tab switching between apps that many of us are used to.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfvLtP"&gt;Here’s how you set it up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qGVfCP"&gt;Hover your cursor over the maximize icon in the upper right corner of an app or press Win-Z. You’ll see four (or six if you have a large monitor) different grid layouts that you can choose from. Each layout will have several zones in a different configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8jgEPt"&gt;Choose a layout and...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Yubico announces security keys with fingerprint readers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JUwBfmdoPPrxLJQ-Nt0tcmDtAAc=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955613/bio_comp_use.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Yubico&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jF13ay"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fblog%2Fput-your-finger-on-the-pulse-of-whats-new-with-the-yubikey-bio-series%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710987%2Fyubikey-fido-biometric-fingerprint-reader-usb-c-a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Yubico has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new line of security keys that lets you unlock accounts with a fingerprint. With older YubiKeys, logging in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI7yWHim-2Y"&gt;requires putting in a PIN&lt;/a&gt; and then tapping the key, but the new version can authenticate with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqgl2yuzCNE"&gt;just the tap&lt;/a&gt; (though the option to put in a PIN is still available if you’re wearing gloves or your fingers are wet). The convenience does come at a premium — the USB-A version of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fproduct%2Fyubikey-bio%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710987%2Fyubikey-fido-biometric-fingerprint-reader-usb-c-a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the YubiKey Bio&lt;/a&gt; costs $80, and the USB-C version costs $85. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0GyMi"&gt;The YubiKey Bio series acts like a regular security key, so it can help you either log on to services &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fsolutions%2Fpasswordless%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710987%2Fyubikey-fido-biometric-fingerprint-reader-usb-c-a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;without having to deal with passwords&lt;/a&gt; or act as a second factor in addition to something like a password or authentication code from your phone. Either use style can help you...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is BGP, and what role did it play in Facebook’s massive outage</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="06o5Y9"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;Facebook was completely knocked offline&lt;/a&gt;, taking Instagram and WhatsApp (not to mention &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709123/facebook-outage-down-detector-cloudflare"&gt;a few other websites&lt;/a&gt;) down with it. Many have been quick to say that the incident had to do with BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1445147230244061184?s=21"&gt;citing sources from inside Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445065270272434176?s=20"&gt;traffic analysis&lt;/a&gt;, and the gut instinct that “it’s always DNS or BGP.” Facebook is back up and has since &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/"&gt;released an explanation&lt;/a&gt; detailing how BGP was just a part of its woes (and saying that it more or less worked as intended), but this all raises the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bSASsz"&gt;What is BGP?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qhAt0P"&gt;At a very basic level, BGP is one of the systems that the internet uses to &lt;a href="https://blog.cdemi.io/beginners-guide-to-understanding-bgp/"&gt;get your traffic to where it needs to go as quickly as possible&lt;/a&gt;. Because there are tons of different internet service providers,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook explains the backbone shutdown behind its global outage on Monday</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="wiux5N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;massive outage&lt;/a&gt; that took down Facebook, its associated services (Instagram, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709669/facebook-outage-whatsapp-signal-telegram-encrypted"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, Oculus, Messenger), its platform for businesses, and the company’s own internal network all started with routine maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8jQFA"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/"&gt;infrastructure vice president Santosh Janardhan&lt;/a&gt;, a command issued during maintenance inadvertently caused a shutdown of the backbone that connects all of Facebook’s data centers, everywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFpNTp"&gt;That by itself is bad enough, but as we’ve already explained, the reason you couldn’t use Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709260/what-is-bgp-border-gateway-protocol-explainer-internet-facebook-outage"&gt;is that the DNS and BGP routing information pointing to its servers suddenly disappeared&lt;/a&gt;. According to Janardhan, that problem was a secondary issue, as Facebook’s DNS servers noted the loss of connection to the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is back online after a massive outage that also took down Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Oculus</title>

  &lt;p id="yQnrks"&gt;Just as Facebook’s Antigone Davis was live on CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;defending the company over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;whistleblower’s accusations&lt;/a&gt; and its handling of research data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701445/facebook-instagram-mental-health-research-pdfs-documents"&gt;suggesting Instagram is harmful to teens&lt;/a&gt;, its entire network of services suddenly went offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpmd6V"&gt;The outage started just before noon ET and took nearly six hours &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709654/instagram-facebook-outage-whatsapp-oculus"&gt;before it was resolved&lt;/a&gt;. This is the worst outage for Facebook since a 2019 incident &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265185/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-outage-2019-return-back"&gt;took its site offline for more than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;, as the downtime &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265002/facebook-instagram-outage-ad-revenue-lost"&gt;hit hardest on the small businesses and creators who rely on these services&lt;/a&gt; for their income. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s healthcare division leaned on misleading data, report alleges</title>

  &lt;p id="bEcnjw"&gt;Apple employees raising concerns that misleading data was used to support new health products were dismissed or met with hostility, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-health-employees-backlash-misled-executives-2021-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, a lack of structure within the health group, along with other organizational problems, is slowing and frustrating the company’s ambitions to push into healthcare, current and former Apple employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDZBVX"&gt;Some concerns focused on clinics Apple set up to both provide healthcare to employees and develop ways to integrate data collected from Apple devices into care. One doctor involved with the project, Will Poe, said in a resignation letter to CEO Tim Cook that he was concerned that members of the team were giving misleading and too-rosy information to Chief Operating...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple shares memorial to Steve Jobs on 10th anniversary of his death</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ure96Cy3FMUwLBlRAbXTxZs4Eo=/0x32:3650x2465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955046/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_9.13.26_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUpJQu"&gt;Apple is commemorating its co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs’ death with &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/"&gt;a new short film and a personal statement&lt;/a&gt; from the visionary tech executive’s family. Jobs passed away 10 years ago &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/6/2473035/apple-steve-jobs-has-died"&gt;on October 5th, 2011&lt;/a&gt;, after a difficult battle with pancreatic cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9cigZ"&gt;The short film — which has currently taken over Apple’s landing page —  commemorates Jobs’ life in photos, videos, and some of his most iconic quotes, from “the computer is a bicycle for the mind” to the introductions of the iMac, the iPod, and the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ubqnxz"&gt;
