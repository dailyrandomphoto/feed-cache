    <title>Bacteria get a fresh gig as art restorers in Italy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zX0NuZ"&gt;Michelangelo’s marbles in the Medici Chapel were looking dingy, so a team of art restorers decided to smear some bacteria on the situation. The specialized microbes cleaned up centuries of grime, leaving the marble statues with a fresh new look, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/30/arts/bacteria-cleaning-michelangelo-medici-restoration.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDfxFh"&gt;The team selected specialized strains of bacteria to target different stains on the marble. Some types of bacteria can thrive in harsh environments and are adapted to eating things that can cause humans problems. These bacteria can break down things like pollutants into relatively harmless components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlL9P8"&gt;In this case, the team looked for bacterial strains that would eat away at the stains and other gunk, without harming the marble itself, and tested their top choices on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi says it can now fully charge a phone in eight minutes at 200W</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NTEREz7crVo5fh-ISkhh1It2pKM=/0x0:2100x1400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69365040/xiaomi.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vZKE5y"&gt;Xiaomi has shown off its latest fast charging tech demo, and consequently is claiming the new world records for both wired and wireless charging speeds. Using a modified Mi 11 Pro with a 4,000mAh battery, Xiaomi says it’s able to fully charge the phone in 8 minutes over a 200W wired “HyperCharge” system, or in 15 minutes with 120W wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeV6et"&gt;Charging speeds are a frequent battleground for Chinese smartphone companies, who often release demonstrations of breakthroughs that may or may not show up in final products. Two years ago, for example, Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/26/18282069/xiaomi-100w-super-charge-turbo-fast-charger"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a 100W system that could charge a 4,000mAh battery in 17 minutes, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; filled up in 23 minutes at 120W — though it did have a bigger 4,500mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s latest 11th Gen processor brings 5.0GHz speeds to thin and light laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7WOe68"&gt;Intel made a splash earlier in May with the launch of its first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;11th Gen Tiger Lake H-series&lt;/a&gt; processors for more powerful laptops, but at Computex 2021, the company is also announcing a pair of new U-series chips — one of which marks the first 5.0GHz clock speed for the company’s U-series lineup of lower voltage chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0df8VH"&gt;Specifically, Intel is announcing the Core i7-1195G7 — its new top of the line chip in the U-series range — and the Core i5-1155G7, which takes the crown of Intel’s most powerful Core i5-level chip, too.&lt;/p&gt;

Both new chips are four core / eight thread configurations, and feature Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics (the Core i7-1195G7...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram making changes to its algorithm after it was accused of censoring pro-Palestinian content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2UzTvW"&gt;Facebook-owned Instagram has made changes to its algorithm after a &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-employees-bias-arabs-muslims-palestine"&gt;group of its employees reportedly complained&lt;/a&gt; that pro-Palestinian content was not viewable for users during the conflict in Gaza. Instagram typically surfaces original content in its stories before reposted content, but will now begin to give equal weighting to both, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xevjqx"&gt;As reported by &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; and the&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f2b394e5-d0c5-45e5-ba96-130865b02ce7."&gt; &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Instagram employee group had made numerous appeals about content that had been censored by Instagram’s automated moderation, such as posts about the al-Asqa mosque being mistakenly removed. The employees didn’t believe the censorship was deliberate, according to &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, but one said that “moderating at scale is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vilnius, Lithuania built a ‘portal’ to another city to help keep people connected</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/opmAm5lBqIKYOW6_K-Ru0lw9Cd4=/0x0:1731x1154/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69363977/vilnius_portal.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Go Vilnius&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EZIdkp"&gt;Weary of pandemic travel restrictions and aching to get out and see new people? The city of Vilnius, Lithuania has interesting solution: A real-time “portal” to another city. They really went all-in on the idea and the design; it looks quite a bit like something out of the erstwhile sci-fi movie/show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16338798/stargate-command-sg1-atlantis-universe-dedicated-streaming-service-mgm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdAmIi"&gt;The city installed a circular “door” for the portal near its train station that connects to a portal in Lublin, Poland, about 600 kilometers (or roughly 375 miles) away. The portals both have large screens and cameras that broadcast live images between the two cities— a kind of digital bridge, according to its creators— meant to encourage people to “rethink the meaning of unity,” Go Vilnius said in a &lt;a href="https://www.leta.lv/eng/home/press_release/8F8551B3-B997-4722-B6C5-96EB498FD60F/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. Aw. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Tomorrow War, Eternals, Infinite, Werewolves Within, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5qm7ECqaTYQqCn56zjkpJBmoq00=/0x1:1171x782/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69363800/chris_pratt_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T7hvLh"&gt;So tonight is the finale for &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; and there are so many threads that need to be tied up that I legitimately don’t know how they’ll answer all the open questions. I have a theory of who the killer is, and I &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; think it’s the same person who fathered Erin’s baby. Will Mare ever find happiness? It seems unlikely, I’m afraid. But maybe she’ll find answers or closure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKbTMj"&gt;I realized that in this week’s trailer roundup that— in addition to a time-traveling theme— we have two movies that feature Sam Richardson, who played Richard Splett, arguably the best supporting character on the late great HBO show&lt;em&gt; Veep. &lt;/em&gt;Please cast him in all the things, Hollywood, he’s hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Teslas made in Texas will likely have to leave the state before Texans can buy them</title>

  &lt;p id="0yIfCq"&gt;Tesla is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334860/tesla-cybertruck-factory-austin-texas-location-model-y"&gt;building a factory in Texas&lt;/a&gt; to make some of its cars, but when it’s up and running, the cars made there may have to go on a roundabout journey to get to Texan buyers (&lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/40779/tesla-will-have-to-ship-its-texas-built-cars-out-of-state-to-sell-back-to-residents"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Because of state laws banning car companies from selling directly to consumers, Tesla could end up shipping the cars from its Austin factory to other states, before they’re sent back to their Texan buyers. The state’s lawmakers were debating legislation that would have prevented the situation, but they’ve now missed their chance to pass it before they have to go on break until 2023 — &lt;a href="https://communityimpact.com/austin/southwest-austin-dripping-springs/development/2021/01/18/story-to-watch-in-2021-teslas-gigafactory-set-for-completion-by-years-end/"&gt;the factory is expected to be completed&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="V23zVS"&gt;Unredacted documents in Arizona’s lawsuit against Google show that company executives and engineers were aware that the search giant had made it hard for smartphone users to keep location information private, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/unredacted-google-lawsuit-docs-detail-efforts-to-collect-user-location-2021-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1Ugl4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.azag.gov/media/interest/updated-redacted-google-complaint"&gt;The documents suggest&lt;/a&gt; that Google collected location data even after users had turned off location sharing, and made privacy settings difficult for users to find. &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the documents show Google pressured phone manufacturers into keeping privacy settings hidden, because the settings were popular with users. &lt;/p&gt;
