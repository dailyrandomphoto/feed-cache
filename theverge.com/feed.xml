    <title>Stranger Things 4 will have a summer 2022 release date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wsXjbNl8B7lcdFbb4eduOtXYTwA=/360x0:1628x845/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105313/eleven_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Eleven is back for Season 4 of Netflix’s Stranger Things series | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1ZQMpp4BdU&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangerThings" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X07yfR"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/netflix/status/1457045171367989251"&gt;tweeted Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;will premiere in the summer of 2022. While not a precise release date, it’s at least something for fans of Netflix’s flagship supernatural series, who have waited through months of delays and a seemingly endless parade of mysterious teasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlL6gs"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/6/22765252/stranger-things-4-teaser-trailer-2022-release-date-netflix"&gt;teaser dropped Saturday&lt;/a&gt; as well, showing Eleven in California, adjusting to her new life and school. She writes in a letter to Mike that everything is great (even though we see her classmates being mean to her), and says she can’t wait for spring break. But of course, our girl can’t have anything nice last for too long; after a fade to black, we get some eerie music under shots of a roller rink and Eleven looking afraid, along with helicopters,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 appears to fall short of expected 30W charging speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pNfsde9ODBND2xI1T3rhqcMqQww=/162x0:1935x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105137/Google_Pixel_6_Pro__Alt_Angle_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQ0Ucz"&gt;When Google released the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, it boasted about the devices’ fast-charging capabilities. Plugging a Pixel 6 series device into its &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_30w_charger"&gt;$25 30W Fast Charger&lt;/a&gt; — which isn’t even included in the box — is supposed to take full advantage of the phone’s fast charging speed, juicing it up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes. We all can agree that this is an impressive spec, but unfortunately, it may not be totally realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tz4HxR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-charging-test-3051231/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; put the Pixel 6’s fast charging speed to the test, and its findings suggest that &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570"&gt;Google’s spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; is misleading. After trying out the 30W charger with the Pixel 6, &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; found that the Pixel 6 doesn’t fully harness the power of the charger — instead, it only hits a maximum...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack in the Box suing crypto exchange FTX, says it ‘brazenly’ copied its Jack mascot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/azq-zc8UuSV_K7m9z7qUGLR79w0=/184x0:903x479/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105071/jack_mascots.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jack in the Box is suing a crypto exchange it says copied its longtime mascot. Left is Moon Man, right is Jack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUuzEN"&gt;Restaurant chain Jack in the Box says it is suing cryptocurrency exchange FTX because it “brazenly and illegally copied or derived its ‘Moon Man’ mascot” from its established Jack mascot, and is doing damage to the Jack in the Box brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viRPw6"&gt;In a lawsuit filed in federal court in the Northern District of California this week, Jack in the Box claims that FTX’s Moon Man character, aka Lou Nar, “has a spherical white head also affixed to a talking human actor, with blue-dotted eyes, a nose, and a smile,” which is “strikingly similar to Jack. Both change their facial expressions and clothing throughout ads and appearances,” the suit maintains. Moon Man, however, is a “far inferior version” of Jack, the restaurant chain argues, and is ...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot swapped a live show for a massive music video at Worlds 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KMRUcaWN5Nif_mRpQI_ohGKsOs=/0x2:8033x5357/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70104983/CYW_WorldsOC_Set_015.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w9008O"&gt;Every year, one of the highlights of the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;World Championship is the opening ceremonies. It’s been a regular chance for developer Riot to create a real-world spectacle ahead of the big game. In the past that’s meant everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;holographic musical performances&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21541871/league-of-legends-world-championship-worlds-2020-opening-ceremony-ar-kda"&gt;an appearance from an augmented reality K-pop group&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, though, things went in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV6afJ"&gt;Without an audience in attendance due to COVID-19 restrictions, Riot instead went with a pre-produced series of music videos that featured gigantic real-world sets spliced with moments from the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Arcane &lt;/em&gt;animated series. It may not have been a live performance, but it was still impressive. “This is really what feature films do, what Marvel does,”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s handy AirTag Loop is selling for a low price at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag in an Apple Leather Loop accessory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4RdZRLPH6sD6sTOhez3BP5gSK_o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70104691/vpavic_4547_20210421_0070.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now buy an AirTag Loop for $24 from Amazon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o0ereY"&gt;iPhone owners planning on traveling or making lots of plans this holiday season may find today’s AirTag Loop deal useful. Right now at Amazon, you can buy the handy loop made specifically to carry Apple’s ultrawideband-capable Bluetooth tracker at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932PL9BF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an all-time low price of around $24&lt;/a&gt; instead of $29. This deal is valid on the orange or deep navy colorways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgirnc"&gt;Other colors are also on sale, but are selling for a little more. You can pick up the white or yellow variants for $26, for example. Given that AirTags lack a lanyard hole of their own (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;a very Apple move&lt;/a&gt;), you’ll need a loop to securely attach them to backpacks, keys, and other items. So, while you might be buying one a little begrudgingly, but you’ll probably be happy you have it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things 4’s new teaser promises ‘the best spring break ever’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X07yfR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;has gotten yet another mysterious teaser trailer, the latest in a series of clips promoting the upcoming fourth series of Netflix’s flagship supernatural drama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fhkuw"&gt;We open with a voiceover of Eleven writing a letter to Mike, looking forward to spring break when she gets to see him again. She describes how much she likes school and has made lots of friends (even though we actually see other kids being mean to her). We then get a few quick cuts of a roller rink, Eleven watching skaters and looking upset with some creepy music playing, someone shooting through windows, Joyce looking at a creepy doll, government thugs restraining Eleven, helicopters, explosions, and a dial being turned up (but we cut away before we can see if...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple hires Tesla’s former Autopilot software director</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B7dFWx"&gt;Apple hasn’t been all that vocal about its electric car project, but according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-05/apple-hires-tesla-s-autopilot-software-director-for-car-effort?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone maker is hiring Tesla’s Autopilot software engineer to work on its EVs. Sources close to the matter told&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that Apple scooped up Christopher “CJ” Moore to work on its self-driving software. He’ll report to &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3649749-apple-said-to-picked-up-ex-tesla-exec-for-electric-car-push"&gt;Stuart Bowers, another Tesla ex-pat&lt;/a&gt; who previously served as the vice president of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrhHAb"&gt;During his time at Tesla, Moore stirred up controversy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration"&gt;for calling CEO Elon Musk’s “full self-driving” claims exaggerated&lt;/a&gt;. In January, Musk stated that he was “highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human this year.” The full self-driving software, currently in beta, does not make a...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Dreamverse gallery.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cRhQxE"&gt;New York City has been filled with NFTs this week. Since Monday, hundreds, if not thousands, of people have darted between talks, galleries, hangouts, parties, and other events assembled for and by the usually all-online &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22639353/cool-cats-bayc-generative-nft-profile-avatar"&gt;NFT community&lt;/a&gt; to talk about the future of art, hype the space, and discover new and potentially soon-to-be-explosive projects. The result has been an exceptional number of hours spent in Times Square, one surprise Strokes concert, and a lot of dudes wearing crypto merch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlB6l7"&gt;Capping it all off was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/11/22666642/dreamverse-beeple-nft-inaugural-display-at-metapurse-party"&gt;a two-part event&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday called Dreamverse, hosted at the expansive music venue Terminal 5.

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult, especially with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; just on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which are compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744497/macos-12-monterey-apple-mac-download-available-now"&gt;recently-released macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; — and we’ll highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty...&lt;/p&gt;
