    <title>Server glitch allowed Eufy owners to see through other homes’ cameras </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NHzHSV"&gt;Last night, a number of Eufy home security camera owners discovered they were able to access smart camera feeds and saved videos from users they had never met, due to an apparent security glitch. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/17/huge-eufy-privacy-breach/"&gt;First reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the issue came to light in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/neayuo/access_to_random_cameras_in_another_country/"&gt;an extended Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;, in which users from around the world detailed their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H76KJQ"&gt;“Basically I could see every camera, their front door and backdoor bells, master bedroom, living room, garage, kitchen, their motion recordings, everything,” one Eufy owner noted. “I was wondering what was going on as it still had my email and name as signed in and noticed that some unknown email, I’m guessing of the Hawaii owner, was in my shared guest account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zcpiqH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For a security product to become...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Google’s Phone app can now announce who’s calling when the phone rings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5 in “Sorta Sage” green" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bG99qIER1grtTGL-hNvbWMfIxf8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299471/akrales_201012_4137_0117.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7banju"&gt;Google is rolling out a new feature for the Google Phone app that announces who’s calling when the phone rings, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/17/google-phone-gains-caller-id-announcement-feature-to-help-you-manually-screen-calls/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If it’s rolled out to you, you can set whether you want the app to announce caller ID every time the phone rings, only when you’re wearing a headset, or never, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyJmwN"&gt;iOS has had a feature like this for some time, and it seems like Google’s version for the Phone app works similarly to Apple’s implementation. On my iPhone, I find caller ID announcements to be really useful — it’s very handy to know who’s calling before I even look at my phone. Caller ID announcements are also a great accessibility feature, allowing people with visual disabilities to more easily know who is calling them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4lDqf3"&gt;Sadly,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk impersonators have stolen more than $2 million in cryptocurrency since October</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JDychf"&gt;Consumers lost over $2 million in cryptocurrency to scammers impersonating Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk over the last six months, &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/05/spotting-cryptocurrency-investment-scams"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission reported Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BmjA9"&gt;“Promises of guaranteed huge returns or claims that your cryptocurrency will be multiplied are always scams,” the commission said in its Monday report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z6oJai"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Promises of guaranteed huge returns or claims that your cryptocurrency will be multiplied are always scams”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="561eGT"&gt;For years, scammers have posed as Musk in order to fraud social media users out of cryptocurrency. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17096128/twitter-vitalik-buterin-elon-musk-cryptocurrency-scams"&gt;They use deceptive tactics on sites like Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, often using the same avatar images as Musk’s own account and slightly misspelling his username. Pretending to be Musk, the scammers will ask victims to send...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Focusing on personal responsibility still isn’t a good way to manage public health</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wAnQyn"&gt;Public health experts and communities around the country are still struggling to make sense of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s new mask guidelines. Last week, the CDC said it no longer thinks people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 need to wear masks in most situations. But cases of COVID-19 are still high in many places, and &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;less than 40 percent of people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States are fully vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZTQaG"&gt;In efforts to clarify and explain the agency’s thinking, CDC director Rochelle Walensky focused on the risk COVID-19 poses to each individual person who decides to wear a mask or not wear a mask. People who are vaccinated can decide to skip a mask knowing that they’re safer, and people who aren’t vaccinated should...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canoo’s electric van will start at $34,750</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/24C17SWG3VhE7wY-Ww0VsE-VYtk=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299197/1_midlander_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LHUt3R"&gt;California EV startup Canoo has finally &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/56/promises-kept---canoo-pricing-for-lifestyle-vehicle-is"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; pricing for the electric van it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882538/canoo-evelozcity-ev-subsicrption-electric-vehicle"&gt;announced back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The “lifestyle” van, as Canoo calls it, will start at $34,750 and cost as much as $49,950 for the most capable model, before additional equipment or tax incentives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxnMkS"&gt;Canoo has also started accepting $100 deposits for the van as well as for the electric pickup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324096/canoo-goev-ev-pickup-truck-specs-photos-revealed"&gt;truck it revealed in March&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;delivery van it debuted late last year&lt;/a&gt;. Pricing was not given for the pickup, though Canoo has said the base price for the delivery van will be $33,000. Canoo’s lifestyle van is slated to go into production sometime in 2022, though it won’t start production on the other two vehicles until at least 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJ5diH"&gt;All three vehicles are built on the same...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games sues AR company Nreal for sounding too much like ‘Unreal’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nreal Light glasses on LG Uplus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jPH4x6ANRq9jqFEXQtanIQ6ESWU=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299044/Nreal_with_U_5G_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nreal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pgdadR"&gt;Epic Games has sued smart glasses maker Nreal for infringing on its Unreal Engine trademark. Epic, which &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nced.187547/gov.uscourts.nced.187547.1.0.pdf"&gt;filed the case late last week&lt;/a&gt;, claims it’s “no coincidence” that Nreal’s name “looks and sounds virtually identical” to Unreal’s branding. As Nreal plans a US launch later this year, Epic wants to recoup damages and scuttle its application for a trademark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q71JJv"&gt;Epic argues that on top of “Nreal” sounding a lot like “Unreal,” both companies are competing in the same space. The China-based Nreal makes an augmented reality headset known as the Nreal Light, which projects 3D objects into real space, and it’s developed &lt;a href="https://developer.nreal.ai/nreal-tower"&gt;a demo game&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Nreal Tower. &lt;/em&gt;Its glasses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362407/nreal-light-ar-glasses-lg-uplus-samsung-galaxy-note-retail-launch-availability-price"&gt;shipped in Korea&lt;/a&gt; last year, and Nreal has gradually expanded their availability,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to make an AirTag holder for your pet’s collar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GzttfcZZg-DE7iVzlfQ8d3zQmGM=/0x88:2040x1448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298626/verge_IMG_7566_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hank being a good boy with an AirTag sleeve fitted to his existing dog collar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocCNe3"&gt;One seemingly obvious use for Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airtag%2Fairtag&amp;amp;sharedid=vergeairtagholderpet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$29 AirTag tracker&lt;/a&gt; is for pets. As a new dog owner, I wanted to add an AirTag to my dog’s existing leather collar, but the options currently available are lousy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjrJAr"&gt;AirTags are small, but they’re not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; small. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall%2Fairtag&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22439970%2Fpet-airtag-holder-dog-cat-collar-how-to-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Most AirTag holders&lt;/a&gt; currently available from Apple and its partners assume I’m okay with dangling a 0.39-ounce (11-gram) pendant off my medium-sized beagle’s neck. I’m not, which is how I came up with the idea for a DIY neoprene sleeve that keeps the IP67 water- and dust-resistant AirTag snuggly attached to Hank’s existing collar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mE3gf7"&gt;I’m not going to suggest that AirTags are the best way to track your pets — they’re not. But they’re relatively cheap, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-gps-pet-trackers/"&gt;dedicated GPS / GSM pet trackers...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now explore a surreal Gucci garden inside Roblox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgpRta3TQ9-eomcvltUbDco4TXQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298531/Come_as_You_Are_RSVP_Gucci_Garden_on_Roblox.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NuOkjI"&gt;For the next two weeks, the virtual realm of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is getting a dose of high fashion. Currently, fashion house Gucci is hosting an artsy garden space, &lt;a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/05/gucci-garden-experience/"&gt;which will be available for &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; users to explore starting today through to May 31st&lt;/a&gt;. The space was conceived as a virtual counterpart to a real-world installation called the Gucci Garden Archetypes, which is taking place in Florence, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FOyMd"&gt;Both the virtual and IRL spaces are described as multimedia experiences, which are divided into a series of themed rooms with names like “urban romanticism” and “Tokyo tribe.” It all sounds pretty surreal. Here’s the official description of what you’ll be doing in the digital version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aI3qdw"&gt;As they enter the Gucci Garden experience, visitors will shed...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Redbox still exists, plans to go public</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="H3UqZd"&gt;If you live in a major metropolitan area with great high-speed internet, you will be forgiven for forgetting Redbox exists. But the company that rents new releases from big red kiosks at grocery stores is still alive and kicking, and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/redbox-goes-public-spac-1234974560/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt; it intends to go public after it was acquired by the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Seaport Global Acquisition Corp. The new company is reportedly valued at $693 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSrAkF"&gt;Redbox has had success operating completely counter to Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, and all the other behemoth streamers that rely on set-top boxes, new TVs, and solid internet to function. According to Redbox, around 70 percent of its customers would be classified as “late adopters.” They’re people who...&lt;/p&gt;
