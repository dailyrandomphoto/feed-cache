    <title>What is BGP, and what role did it play in Facebook’s massive outage</title>

  &lt;p id="06o5Y9"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;Facebook was completely knocked offline&lt;/a&gt;, taking Instagram and WhatsApp (not to mention &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709123/facebook-outage-down-detector-cloudflare"&gt;a few other websites&lt;/a&gt;) down with it. Many have been quick to say that the incident had to do with BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1445147230244061184?s=21"&gt;citing sources from inside Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445065270272434176?s=20"&gt;traffic analysis&lt;/a&gt;, and the gut instinct that “it’s always DNS or BGP.” Facebook is back up and has since &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/"&gt;released an explanation&lt;/a&gt; detailing how BGP was just a part of its woes (and saying that it more or less worked as intended), but this all raises the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bSASsz"&gt;What is BGP?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qhAt0P"&gt;At a very basic level, BGP is one of the systems that the internet uses to &lt;a href="https://blog.cdemi.io/beginners-guide-to-understanding-bgp/"&gt;get your traffic to where it needs to go as quickly as possible&lt;/a&gt;. Because there are tons of different internet service providers,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook explains the backbone shutdown behind its global outage on Monday</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="wiux5N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;massive outage&lt;/a&gt; that took down Facebook, its associated services (Instagram, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709669/facebook-outage-whatsapp-signal-telegram-encrypted"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, Oculus, Messenger), its platform for businesses, and the company’s own internal network all started with routine maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8jQFA"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/"&gt;infrastructure vice president Santosh Janardhan&lt;/a&gt;, a command issued during maintenance inadvertently caused a shutdown of the backbone that connects all of Facebook’s data centers, everywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFpNTp"&gt;That by itself is bad enough, but as we’ve already explained, the reason you couldn’t use Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709260/what-is-bgp-border-gateway-protocol-explainer-internet-facebook-outage"&gt;is that the DNS and BGP routing information pointing to its servers suddenly disappeared&lt;/a&gt;. According to Janardhan, that problem was a secondary issue, as Facebook’s DNS servers noted the loss of connection to the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is back online after a massive outage that also took down Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Oculus</title>

  &lt;p id="yQnrks"&gt;Just as Facebook’s Antigone Davis was live on CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;defending the company over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;whistleblower’s accusations&lt;/a&gt; and its handling of research data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701445/facebook-instagram-mental-health-research-pdfs-documents"&gt;suggesting Instagram is harmful to teens&lt;/a&gt;, its entire network of services suddenly went offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpmd6V"&gt;The outage started just before noon ET and took nearly six hours &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709654/instagram-facebook-outage-whatsapp-oculus"&gt;before it was resolved&lt;/a&gt;. This is the worst outage for Facebook since a 2019 incident &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265185/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-outage-2019-return-back"&gt;took its site offline for more than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;, as the downtime &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265002/facebook-instagram-outage-ad-revenue-lost"&gt;hit hardest on the small businesses and creators who rely on these services&lt;/a&gt; for their income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dY4v4"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709806/facebook-says-the-six-hour-outage"&gt;issued an explanation for the outage on Monday evening&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it was due to a configuration issue.

    <title>Apple’s healthcare division leaned on misleading data, report alleges</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bEcnjw"&gt;Apple employees raising concerns that misleading data was used to support new health products were dismissed or met with hostility, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-health-employees-backlash-misled-executives-2021-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, a lack of structure within the health group, along with other organizational problems, is slowing and frustrating the company’s ambitions to push into healthcare, current and former Apple employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDZBVX"&gt;Some concerns focused on clinics Apple set up to both provide healthcare to employees and develop ways to integrate data collected from Apple devices into care. One doctor involved with the project, Will Poe, said in a resignation letter to CEO Tim Cook that he was concerned that members of the team were giving misleading and too-rosy information to Chief Operating...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple shares memorial to Steve Jobs on 10th anniversary of his death</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUpJQu"&gt;Apple is commemorating its co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs’ death with &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/"&gt;a new short film and a personal statement&lt;/a&gt; from the visionary tech executive’s family. Jobs passed away 10 years ago &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/6/2473035/apple-steve-jobs-has-died"&gt;on October 5th, 2011&lt;/a&gt;, after a difficult battle with pancreatic cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9cigZ"&gt;The short film — which has currently taken over Apple’s landing page —  commemorates Jobs’ life in photos, videos, and some of his most iconic quotes, from “the computer is a bicycle for the mind” to the introductions of the iMac, the iPod, and the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ubqnxz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>Taylor Swift fans are getting caught up in the Virginia gubernatorial race</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7x2Ley"&gt;Weeks before Virginia’s gubernatorial election, the campaign for Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe is reaching out to an unexpected constituency: Taylor Swift fans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvCMJA"&gt;On Tuesday, the McAulliffe campaign launched a series of Facebook, Instagram, and Google search ads highlighting his opponent Glenn Youngkin’s role in the controversial purchase of Taylor Swift’s master recordings in 2019. The buyout of Swift’s masters has been a point of bitter contention for the singer and her fans and could be an unexpected liability in the upcoming race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwSsLY"&gt;Last year, Youngkin — the Republican nominee for Virginia governor — retired as co-CEO of the private equity firm The Carlyle Group before launching his 2021 gubernatorial bid. At Carlyle, Youngkin...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All Facebook Gaming creators can co-stream now</title>

  &lt;p id="1MPeHv"&gt;Facebook is adding co-streaming to Facebook Gaming, a useful feature the Twitch competitor has lacked &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/07/facebook-launches-fb-gg-gaming-video-hub-to-compete-with-twitch/"&gt;since it launched in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, while Twitch’s version of a co-streaming feature — &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-to-use-squad-stream?language=en_US"&gt;“Squad Stream”&lt;/a&gt; — requires you to be a Twitch Partner, Facebook is making co-streaming available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwoK8d"&gt;“With co-streaming, we aim to increase discoverability for creators, encourage collaboration between creators and elevate the overall viewing experience,” Facebook explains. In short, streaming the same game alongside someone else is mutually beneficial. Actually starting a stream involves tagging up to three other creators during stream setup or after you’re live. If the other creators tag you back, then your audience is launched into a...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ehZjvN"&gt;When I cook, I typically just Google a recipe or try one out on the fly. But in the future, it’s possible artificial intelligence might help me concoct a meal or assist a chef as they write their next cookbook or design a menu. In today’s&lt;em&gt; Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; AI episode, we explore the world of AI product design — how far could AI go in helping humans design smells and tastes? For that discussion, we chat with Frederik Duerinck, the founder of ScentTronix, which is part software, part hardware and attempts to make customizable perfumes based on individual people. We also talk to Michael Spranger, COO at Sony AI, about how Sony is helping chefs design recipes and maximize flavor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KIave"&gt;Finally, we take it a step further and ask whether it’s even possible...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qW1dRE"&gt;Google traditionally holds an October hardware event to reveal its new Pixel phones. This year, it already announced them — here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. But the company clearly hasn’t said &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; it wants to say publicly quite yet, because &lt;a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/"&gt;it just announced a virtual event for October 19th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBce9g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OWYrKO"&gt;On October 19, we’re officially introducing you to Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro—the completely reimagined Google phones. Powered by Tensor, Google’s first custom mobile chip, they’re fast, smart and secure. And they adapt to you. #Pixel6Launch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OmPZaA"&gt;And though Google got out ahead of some of the leaks this year with its early Pixel announcements, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the Pixel 6 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686534/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-display-screen-video"&gt;the Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;
