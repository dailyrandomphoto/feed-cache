    <title>Instagram is testing a Take a Break feature</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RAaowz"&gt;Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri said Wednesday that the platform is testing the long-awaited Take a Break feature to give users reminders when they’ve spent a long time on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnJUDv"&gt;“It does what you think it does,” Mosseri said in a video posted to Twitter. “If you opt in, it encourages you to take a break from Instagram after you spend a certain amount of time on the app; 10, 20, or 30 minutes,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dBSa93"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Testing “Take a Break”  ‍ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We started testing a new feature called “Take a Break” this week. This opt-in control enables you to receive break reminders in-app after a duration of your choosing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m excited to dig into the results &amp;amp; hopefully launch this sometime in December. ✌  &lt;a href="https://t.co/WdSTjL6ZdH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WdSTjL6ZdH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1458468539812044803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;N...&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>All I want from my smartwatch is to give me a break</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HD0wue"&gt;If there’s one thing wearable makers learned during the pandemic, it’s that people are stressed out — and with good reason. It’s led to companies like Fitbit and Apple expanding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22295768/fitbit-premium-mindful-method-deepak-chopra-wellness-series"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/fitness-plus-introduces-workouts-and-meditations-with-shareplay/"&gt;mindfulness features&lt;/a&gt; in their most recent products and services. But while it’s encouraging to see wearables makers acknowledge that mental health is part of overall health, there’s still one major oversight: modern wearables are fundamentally centered around building and maintaining streaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyNY0e"&gt;Whether it’s hitting your daily 10,000 steps, burning a certain number of calories, or reminders to move every hour, the aim for most wearables is to help you build better health habits. To do that, consistency is key. No one’s denying that. But any...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam Deck launch delayed by two months</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck, which has been delayed to February.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZGLGPc"&gt;Valve is delaying the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, its handheld gaming PC, by two months. The Steam Deck had been set to launch in December, but Valve now estimates that the first orders will start shipping in February 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRwTjy"&gt;“We’re sorry about this — we did our best to work around the global supply chain issues, but due to material shortages, components aren’t reaching our manufacturing facilities in time for us to meet our initial launch dates,” &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3084396982306430712"&gt;Valve said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wjuL3"&gt;One editor at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is now seeing a Q1 2022 estimated ship date for a Steam Deck reservation that was originally slated for the December launch window. Another is seeing a Q2 2022 estimated ship date for an order that was initially going to arrive in Q1. (Both placed...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber discriminates against people with disabilities, new DOJ lawsuit alleges</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fWObmA"&gt;Uber discriminates against people with disabilities by charging them a “wait time” fee while entering the vehicle, according to a new lawsuit filed by the US Justice Department against the ride-hailing company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xa9oqJ"&gt;These extra fees have “harmed many passengers and potential passengers with disabilities throughout the country,” some of whom may be entitled to monetary damages, the department said. The lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for Northern California, alleges that Uber is in violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits discrimination by private transportation companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZzFsgJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Passengers would incur the fee two minutes after their Uber car arrives at their pickup location&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is making it easier to share your screen in Microsoft Teams and other video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pyOMePO74E8d32_DTdfmVFNsfo=/0x0:1332x888/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123056/Share_any_window_zoomZoom2X.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams share buttons will appear in Windows 11 soon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3GFgBI"&gt;Microsoft is adding a useful new Microsoft Teams integration into Windows 11 soon. The software maker has started testing a feature in Windows 11 that will allow Teams users to hover over open windows on the taskbar and quickly share the window content on a Microsoft Teams call. It will make screen sharing a lot easier for Teams and other communication apps on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dtp59a"&gt;Microsoft is testing this initially with Microsoft Teams for work or school rather than the built-in consumer version of Teams in Windows 11. “This means not everyone will see this right away with their Teams calls,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/10/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22499/"&gt;says Amanda Langowski&lt;/a&gt;, head of Microsoft’s Windows Insider program. “We plan to bring this to Chat from Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Teams for home) later.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash will acquire European delivery company Wolt as it builds a global platform</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1neYDT"&gt;DoorDash has agreed to acquire the food delivery company Wolt for €7 billion (about $8.1 billion) with plans to expand its reach to Europe (via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/doordash-to-acquire-food-delivery-company-wolt/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://wolt.com/en/about"&gt;Founded in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, Wolt is a Finland-based company that contracts out couriers to deliver takeout, groceries, and other goods to customers in 23 countries mainly throughout Europe. &lt;/p&gt;

Currently, DoorDash is only available in cities across the US, Canada, Japan, and Australia. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian goes public in one of the biggest IPOs ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n8k55W2Y7ME6-g842TXKjZEed7c=/0x0:2880x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123010/2022_Rivian_R1T_17.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mFyrrP"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Rivian is now a publicly traded company after executing one of the biggest initial public offerings in history. Rivian shares started trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange Wednesday at around $78 per share. That gave Rivian an overall valuation of nearly $80 billion and helped it net $12 billion in fresh cash, despite the fact that it only just recently started to make and ship its first electric pickup trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEODrf"&gt;It’s the sixth-largest IPO ever on a US stock exchange, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-09/ev-maker-rivian-is-said-to-guide-ipo-price-above-top-of-range?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s hard to imagine the company picking a better time to debut. Tesla has generated an incredible amount of interest in electric vehicles &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;is now one of the most highly valued companies in the world. The public markets...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego is now letting you preorder unofficial sets, including an epic Lego store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-8VvRE_tQGyvDTYWxxnMsztQNQo=/0x50:1200x850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122964/lego_store_bricklink.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zuliKf"&gt;What do a Lego store, a beautiful abandoned windmill, a retro bowling alley, a miniature aquarium, and a pair of Venetian houses have in common? They’ve all just become incredibly limited edition Lego sets &lt;a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/designer-program/introducing.page"&gt;that you can preorder from the Lego company itself&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSeXpV"&gt;They started out as candidates for Lego’s Ideas program, got rejected, and now, they’ve been crowdfunded back to life by fans like you through a separate competition &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/blogs/a4ae09b6-0d4c-4307-9da8-3ee9f3d368d6/post/7e027d01-6ec9-473c-b6b0-db8f92bbe5af"&gt;called the BrickLink Designer Program&lt;/a&gt; that gives creators 10 percent of the proceeds for their work. That means you have a short window of opportunity to snap up these unofficial official sets for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0u2kXr"&gt;And if you’ll allow me to indulge myself, they are &lt;em&gt;glorious&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvaIKm"&gt;Atop this post, you’ll spot the &lt;a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/designer-program/designer-sets-for-adult-fans-of-lego/215728/Modular-LEGO-Store"&gt;$179.99 Modular Lego...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
