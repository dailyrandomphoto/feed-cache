    <title>NASA is set for its most daring attempt to land on Mars in a search for ancient life</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g9ex47"&gt;On February 18th, NASA will make a daring attempt to land a car-sized rover on Mars in its most complex mission yet to hunt for ancient extraterrestrial life. If it survives the plunge through the Red Planet’s atmosphere, the Perseverance rover will kick off the first leg of a grand relay race to capture humanity’s first cache of pristine Martian soil samples, among many other scientific objectives it hopes to score along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ghJ60n"&gt;What time will NASA’s Perseverance rover land on Mars?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BHILAe"&gt;Having traveled 293 million miles since its launch in July last year, the rover is now gearing up to execute the Solar System’s most grueling parking job ever. At around 3:48PM ET, Perseverance will begin its wicked seven-minute descent toward the Martian...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boost your Nintendo Switch’s storage with this $70 512GB microSD card</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FVht1m0p1c6smlbgPIcBJmdGVVQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68836173/akrales_171025_2091_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jX35Yz"&gt;It’s a good thing that Nintendo’s Switch supports microSD because prices for the expandable storage format just keep getting better. Today, for instance, you can buy PNY’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KD4XJLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB microSD card at Amazon for just $70&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a Deal of the Day, so this price will expire later tonight. Previously, it was rare to find this amount of storage for less than $100, and with each Switch game being between 5-15GB in size, this will serve you a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yQcIQx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10349001"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1F2Y7F"&gt;Also at Amazon, you’ll find the lowest price yet offered on Apple’s most recent Mac mini with the M1 processor. It’s the base model with 256GB of storage, which is admittedly not much, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but you’ll pay $600&lt;/a&gt; at checkout instead of $670. This price drop beats all other retailers, but the catch is that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scientists try to fix flat maps with new double-sided projections</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zFncByLgV0o8ppaew0Cg3-DyIr4=/0x0:960x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68836121/equidistant_azimuthal_projection.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A double-sided projection to show off our 3D planet in 2D.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gott, Goldberg, Vanderbei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D23gK2"&gt;A trio of scientists have devised a new way to try to represent our spherical planet as a flat picture with a new class of projection that involves printing the map as a double-sided circle, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2021-02-astrophysicists-re-imagine-world-distorted-radically.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phys.org &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The Double-Sided Gott projections involve splitting a globe in two and printing the separate hemispheres on separate sides. The &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2102/2102.08176.pdf"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; is the work of J. Richard Gott, Robert Vanderbei, and David Goldberg from Princeton and Drexel universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZVqiy"&gt;While 3D globes are the most accurate way of representing the layout of the Earth’s surface, it’s much more convenient to refer to a 2D representation. There are a variety of ways of converting this 3D shape into 2D, which are referred to as map projections, but none of them are perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xAelb3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Nvidia is nerfing its new RTX 3060 for Ethereum cryptocurrency mining</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-vnDtIQMeS5VG-PPAgIbQasXFE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68836115/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qxWy0N"&gt;Nvidia is purposefully making its new RTX 3060 graphics cards less efficient to mine Ethereum cryptocurrency. New drivers that will accompany the release of the GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280277/nvidia-rtx-3060-graphics-card-release-date-time"&gt;later this month&lt;/a&gt; will reduce the hash rate of Ethereum mining by around 50 percent, using software detection for cryptocurrency mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9P609"&gt;“We designed GeForce GPUs for gamers, and gamers are clamoring for more,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/02/18/geforce-cmp/"&gt;says Matt Wuebbling&lt;/a&gt;, head of global GeForce marketing at Nvidia. “Yet NVIDIA GPUs are programmable. And users are constantly discovering new applications for them, from weather simulation and gene sequencing to deep learning and robotics. Mining cryptocurrency is one of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9Iq6f"&gt;It’s clear Nvidia is making the changes to try to help with the availability of its GeForce...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Google caved to Australia, and Facebook didn’t</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="GyJ9sS"&gt;On February 16th, I wrote that &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/australias-bad-bargain-with-platforms"&gt;Australia’s News Media Bargaining Code threatened to splinter the internet&lt;/a&gt;. On February 17th, the splintering arrived: Google cut a deal with News Corp. that will ensure its services continue to be provided in Australia, and Facebook walked away from the bargaining table and began preventing people from sharing news links from Australian publishers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCTNGG"&gt;I think Facebook basically did the right thing, and Google basically did the wrong thing, even though Google had a much tougher call to make. Today, let’s talk about why the tech giants made the decisions that they did, why Australia’s shakedown is rotten, and what’s likely to happen next. (If you didn’t &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/australias-bad-bargain-with-platforms"&gt;read my piece on the subject&lt;/a&gt;, it offers a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is coming to Xbox Series X / S and Xbox One</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uDooaf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout&lt;/em&gt;, Mediatonic’s charming platformer battle royale title, is coming to Xbox Series X / S and Xbox One this summer, Microsoft announced in &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/02/18/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-xbox-this-summer/"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; today. The news comes just one day after Mediatonic announced that the game was going to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288187/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-nintendo-switch-mediatonic"&gt;ported to the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; sometime this summer as well. While no firm release date has been announced, both ports will likely launch within the same time frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcfjtX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; originally released in 2020 on PC via Steam and PS4, where it was a free title for users with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402473/fall-guys-sony-ps-plus-most-downloaded-game-all-time"&gt;active PlayStation Plus subscription&lt;/a&gt;. The game mixes battle royale with the platformer genre, where players compete in elimination-type challenges. The title draws inspiration from competitive game shows...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="fRNeGs"&gt;Getting my license at age 16 was a breath of fresh air. It was me, my used 2007 Mazda6, and the open road. As anyone who knew me at the time will say, though, I was a misfortune magnet as a teenager and this extended to my car. There was even a running joke among my peers that I was on a first-name basis with the local tow truck drivers because &lt;a href="https://ohio.aaa.com/membership.html"&gt;AAA&lt;/a&gt; had to dispatch them on a regular basis — a dead battery being one of the more common mishaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIYf4c"&gt;Whether the battery died so often because I left a light on, the weather was frighteningly cold, or I waited too long to replace the battery, doesn’t really matter. However, my mom eventually saw fit to save me both time and money by gifting me the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Portable-Laptop-Charger-Starter/dp/B079FSPRXM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Halo Bolt Portable Car Jump Starter&lt;/a&gt; so I would...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="M5SEST"&gt;Out on the high seas, more than 200 miles from shore, seafood companies can operate with almost no oversight. These are ungoverned, international waters where it’s easier for companies to get away with overfishing and abuses like modern-day slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcP1vY"&gt;Scientists using new hacks for old technology are slowly changing that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYjADs"&gt;Two decades ago, large vessels began carrying a little box that connects to what’s called the maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS). It sends out a radio signal with information about the ship, like an identifying number, and its size, course, and speed. That’s supposed to help ships avoid running into each other. It also helps authorities see where vessels are when they’re close to shore. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The team behind indie adventure Minit returns with a side-scrolling racing game</title>

  &lt;p id="Qj2xHF"&gt;The indie gem &lt;em&gt;Minit&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/7/17207310/minit-indie-game-review-die-every-60-seconds-love-letter-classic-gaming"&gt;released back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, felt like a breath of fresh air. The monochromatic adventure game took a seemingly absurd time constraint — killing the player every 60 seconds — and turned it into both a passionate love letter to top-down classics like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda &lt;/em&gt;and an ingenious and clever quest that threw constant surprises at the player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xteSAm"&gt;Now, the core team behind &lt;em&gt;Minit — Nuclear Throne &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Disc Room &lt;/em&gt;developer Jan Willem Nijman, designer Kitty Calis, composer Jukio Kallio, and artist Dominik Johann&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;are back with a new spinoff title, &lt;em&gt;Minit Fun Racer. &lt;/em&gt;The game takes the same core idea and applies it to a side-scrolling biking game reminiscent of arcade titles of decades past. All proceeds of the game, which is...&lt;/p&gt;
