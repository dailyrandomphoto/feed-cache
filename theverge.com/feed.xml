    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aYs7oy"&gt;Space tourism firm Virgin Galactic will fly its founder Richard Branson on its next test flight slated for July 11th, the company confirmed Thursday. Branson’s flight date will come before rival Jeff Bezos is expected to fly in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522313/jeff-bezos-space-launch-brother-blue-origin-july-20"&gt;his own space tourism rocket on July 20th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8U2Rgu"&gt;Branson, 70, wasn’t set to fly Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity spaceplane for another two tests — until Thursday, when the company announced he’d fly on July 11th “testing the private astronaut experience” alongside four mission specialists and two pilots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qkqs4F"&gt;“I’ve always been a dreamer. My mum taught me to never give up and to reach for the stars. On July 11, it’s time to turn that dream into a reality aboard the next @VirginGalatic spaceflight,” Branson tweeted. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Blue Screen of Death is changing to black in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/psATsoCzSgIoZvY08Yy16XEHg48=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531788/windows11bsod.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11’s new Black Screen of Death.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lvvm49"&gt;Microsoft is changing its famous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) to black in Windows 11. The software giant started testing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;new design changes in a Windows 11 preview&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, but the Black Screen of Death isn’t fully enabled yet. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; understands Microsoft will be switching to a Black Screen of Death for Windows 11, matching the new black logon and shutdown screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7z9if"&gt;It’s the first major change to the BSOD since Microsoft added a sad face to the screen in Windows 8 in 2012, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/12/11412906/microsoft-windows-10-blue-screen-of-death-qr-code"&gt;QR codes in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft first introduced the BSOD in Windows 3.0, offering a way for IT professionals and support personnel to diagnose hardware and memory faults. A BSOD is Windows’ own kernel error or bug check, and it usually includes a dump...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is reportedly trying a ‘retail flex’ work-from-home program for store employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mTS4UOxf8ngm7iYOViexxXAdujA=/0x154:3036x2178/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531620/IMG_20171003_180359.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="91L5C2"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a program called “Retail Flex,” which will give its store employees the chance to work from home some weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/apple-to-test-hybrid-work-from-store-and-home-for-retail-staff"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; Mark Gurman. According to the report, the employees would be remotely handling things like tech support and online sales part of the time, and working at the store as usual at other times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuXefm"&gt;Having employees who traditionally work in a store transitioning to a remote role, even if it’s only a partial change, is a big shift, likely brought on by the pandemic. It doesn’t seem like Apple is just jumping into it. The company is reportedly starting a pilot program that will last at least six months, with participating employees being paid the same salary, plus some extra for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the tvOS 15 beta on Apple TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIyMLvWhtpqhoZXAlkrSFk2uxUs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531553/DSCF3875_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bi79e4"&gt;The next big software update for Apple TV will arrive with tvOS 15. While it won’t become widely available until later this year, users who are part of Apple’s public beta program can now take it for a spin ahead of time. It’s possible and even likely that Apple will continue tinkering with tvOS 15 features ahead of its official launch, but particularly for those looking to test-drive Apple’s forthcoming SharePlay feature, the public beta has officially landed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lx63fz"&gt;The goodies arriving in tvOS 15 that Apple has disclosed so far are small — you’re not going to notice a massive redesign of the tvOS interface, for example — but they’re not insignificant, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgo0ei"&gt;Though, a warning: once you install tvOS 15 on a newer Apple TV 4K box, there’s no...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is ending Evangelion by bringing the final film to Prime Video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVY0eCjscsxzq5Q_3iDILBUCRhE=/0x820:1562x1861/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531324/EVANGELION_3.0_1.01_THRICE_UPON_A_TIME.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vjIibO"&gt;Amazon is bringing the conclusion to the Rebuild of Evangelion film series — adaptations of the beloved anime &lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion &lt;/em&gt;created by Hideaki Anno&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZfuWMDEJpw"&gt;Prime Video on August 13th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Evangelion: 3.0 + 1.01 Thrice Upon a Time&lt;/em&gt; came out in Japan in March but will be making its global premiere on Prime Video in over 240 countries and territories, Amazon says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf9epA"&gt;Alongside the final fourth film, Amazon will also stream the other films in the series, &lt;em&gt;Evangelion: 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Evangelion: 3.33 You Can (Not) Redo&lt;/em&gt;. The company hasn’t said when those films will be available on its service, but hopefully in time to catch up for &lt;em&gt;Thrice Upon a Time&lt;/em&gt;’s August release. You can watch a trailer...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter considers letting you limit tweets to ‘trusted friends’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmkzaQ77Q4XmuhSE85oVm5zqCKo=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531124/trustedfriends_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mockup of what the new trusted friends feature could look like.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZaIbf"&gt;Twitter has shared three early design concepts for new features it’s considering for its service. “Trusted Friends” would let users limit the audience for select tweets to a smaller circle of close friends, while “Facets” could let you categorize your tweets when you send them. Finally, the service is also considering letting users list certain phrases that they’d rather not see in their replies. These ideas are in their early stages, Twitter says, and none are currently in active development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5jjlj"&gt;Many Twitter users already have multiple accounts to separate their work and personal lives, often with one of them being private to prevent sharing personal news too publicly. But features like Trusted Friends and Facets could allow for the same...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s the deal with the Seinfeld soundtrack finally coming out?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="seinfeld" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9hHc6IJAscYgh79BroFvgt9OGcs=/0x40:960x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531118/seinfeld.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bi4K7q"&gt;The hottest album of 2021 is about to drop. The soundtrack of the hit ‘90s sitcom &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld &lt;/em&gt;will be released on Friday, July 2nd (via &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/music/news/seinfeld-soundtrack-to-be-released-1235009969/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) on “all digital platforms,” though specific platforms weren’t stated. I expect to hear the bouncy slap bass-driven theme song that never fails to make me laugh blaring out of cars, apartments, and cafes this Fourth of July weekend. Believe it or not, there will be 33 tracks on the album, and it’s apparently the first time that this music will be made available in an official fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgW96K"&gt;The composer, Jonathan Wolff, told &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;that the soundtrack contains some music that was created for the show but never actually appeared in it. Three jazz songs were made for scenes where Elaine (played by Julia...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 15’s new Live Text feature</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="xDK9Nx"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;now available in public beta&lt;/a&gt;, which means that today you can try out all the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;biggest features coming to the iPhone&lt;/a&gt; this fall. That includes Live Text, the most technically impressive feature in the update, which allows you to pull text, email addresses, phone numbers, and more from pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJ8tcg"&gt;Live Text works with both handwritten and typed text, and supports English, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Portuguese, French, Italian, German, and Spanish. It’s also important to remember that iOS 15 is still in beta, which means that Apple could tweak or change how Live Text works in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpYxEg"&gt;Live Text works in a few different ways on iOS, depending on what you’re trying to use it for and where in the OS you...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big tech companies will have to open Russian offices if they want to advertise in the country</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eEa6YN"&gt;A new Russian law will require large social media companies to open offices in Russia if they don’t want to face advertising bans or &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-lawmakers-vote-force-us-tech-giants-open-local-offices-2021-06-17/"&gt;other penalties&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/putin-signs-law-forcing-foreign-it-firms-open-offices-russia-2021-07-01/"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The law was reportedly signed by President Vladimir Putin on Thursday and will apply to foreign companies that are “carrying out activities on the internet in Russia.” According to a Russian official, the law affects companies that have over 500,000 Russian visitors a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tvmpjo"&gt;The Russian government has been looking to rein in Big Tech’s influence in the country. In 2019, it introduced a law that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20977459/russian-law-pre-installed-domestic-software-tvs-smartphones-laptops"&gt;required device makers to pre-install Russian-made apps&lt;/a&gt; on smartphones, TVs, and computers (with Apple being allowed to instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361762/iphone-russia-startup-local-apps-yandex-mail-ru-law"&gt;show the apps to users during the setup...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workhorse says Postal Service broke its own rules in new mail truck contest</title>
