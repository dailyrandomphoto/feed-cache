    <title>FTC says Facebook has been a monopoly ‘since at least 2011’ in amended antitrust complaint</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auMO0T"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has filed &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21045875-facebook-revised-ftc-complaint"&gt;an amended antitrust complaint against Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that the company violated federal antitrust laws with its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. The new complaint is a more detailed version of a charge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;dismissed by the court in June&lt;/a&gt; for insufficient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iF9MNw"&gt;“Facebook has today, and has maintained since 2011, a dominant share of the relevant market for US personal social networking services,” the complaint alleges, citing time spent and active-user metrics on the daily and monthly scale. “Individually and collectively, these metrics provide significant evidence of Facebook’s durable monopoly power in social networking services.”&lt;/p&gt;

The event, which will be held at Tesla’s headquarters in Palo Alto, CA, &lt;a href="https://livestream.tesla.com/"&gt;will be livestreamed for the public&lt;/a&gt; starting at 5PM PT / 8PM ET (though the event may not actually begin until closer to 5:30PM PT). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O23w6E"&gt;We don’t have a lot of details about what will be announced, but based on the invitation, we’ll get a keynote address by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, hardware and software demos from Tesla engineers, test rides in the Model S Plaid, and “more.” Musk has also tweeted that the “sole goal” of the event is to lure experts in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence to come work at Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Battery power capacity in the US grew big time in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electric Cooperative Connexus Energy Builds Minnesota’s First Large-Scale Energy Storage System" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVor0NaPIkGzDpZ47Cxa1cUOFLs=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747812/1031531618.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A worker installs solar panel at the Connexus Energy Athens Township solar-plus-storage project site in Athens Township, Minnesota, U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018.  | Ari Lindquist/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qibmO"&gt;2020 was a big year for big batteries in the US, which is crucial for getting grids to run on more renewable energy. Power capacity — a measure of how much power a battery can instantly discharge — for large-scale batteries grew at an unprecedented pace in the US last year, according to an annual &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/electricity/batterystorage/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released this week by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HmkjbJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2020 smashed the previous record set in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NcHGs2"&gt;2020 smashed the previous record set in 2018 for the biggest growth in power capacity in the US with 489MW of large-scale battery storage added. That’s more than twice what was added in 2018. By the end of last year, there was 1,523MW of large-scale battery power capacity in the US. For comparison, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.sunpower.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fcs-solar-star-projects-fact-sheet_0.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F19%2F22632172%2Flarge-battery-power-capacity-us-grew-2020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;largest solar farm in...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New test brings Reels to Facebook in the US</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FaJ78t"&gt;Facebook in the US is going to look slightly more like TikTok for some users. Today, the company announced that it’s testing Facebook Reels stateside, which will bring the short-form, TikTok-like videos to the platform. These will show up for some users in the News Feed and within Groups, where people can watch them together. (The company is already testing this in India, Mexico, and Canada, and the US limited rollout is just an extension of that test.) As part of this test, Instagram users will also be able to cross-post their reels to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQPzK6"&gt;People can watch and create reels from the Facebook app, and the feature is designed to give people a way to “express themselves, discover entertaining content, and to help creators broaden...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird’s new electric bike looks like a VanMoof, and you can buy it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOa7dvbK3ONJOkWD_U_R-7_CzgQ=/0x1:2468x1646/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747472/Bird_Bike_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pL41Q1"&gt;Shared electric scooter company Bird is branching out into new two-wheeled vehicles, namely electric bikes. A few months after it introduced its first shared e-bike, the company announced that it would also offer its own e-bike for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="te7Fvp"&gt;The bike, dubbed Bird Bike of course, has a 500W rear hub motor, a Gates carbon belt drive, pedal- and throttle-assisted power, and the relatively modest sticker price of $2,299. Design-wise, the bike looks very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof’s popular e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;, with a slightly elongated top tube and embedded front and rear lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7P65L1"&gt;Bird, which was the first company to introduce shared electric scooters in a US city, has always flirted with the idea of e-bikes. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20926658/bird-scoot-electric-moped-la-cruiser-specs-speed"&gt;first rolled out its Scoot-branded electric...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kd0Lp6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vale: Shadow of the Crown&lt;/em&gt;, an audio-based adventure game by indie studio Falling Squirrel, is available on Xbox and PC today for $19.99. The game was developed in collaboration with the Canadian National Institute for the Blind, and made for and tested by blind and low-vision players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhHICz"&gt;Players navigate a medieval setting as Alex, the blind second heir to a kingdom, who is on her way to the borderlands when her caravan is attacked by enemy soldiers. Left on her own, Alex has to travel the land, find weapons, learn spells, and fight enemies without sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsenFo"&gt;Besides menus, which are presented in text and through audio description, the only visuals in &lt;em&gt;The Vale &lt;/em&gt;are colored specks that float across a black screen. The behavior of the specks...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="AGg5Yp"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged three former Netflix engineers with being part of a “long-running” insider trading scheme, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-158"&gt;the agency announced&lt;/a&gt;. The engineers and two close associates allegedly traded on confidential information about Netflix’s subscriber growth, generating more than $3 million in total profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61hYk4"&gt;According to the SEC complaint, while employed at Netflix in 2016 and 2017, Sung Mo “Jay” Jun tipped information about the streaming giant’s subscribers to his brother Joon Mo Jun and friend Junwoo Chon, who used the info to trade ahead of Netflix earnings announcements. After Sung Mo Jun left Netflix in 2017, the SEC alleges, he continued to get confidential information about the company’s subscriber...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Smartwatch-induced health anxiety led one woman to run 916 ECGs in a year</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uno6Cg"&gt;One year after getting diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, a heart condition that causes an irregular heartbeat, a 70-year-old woman was back for another diagnosis: new-onset health anxiety triggered by her smartwatch. Despite not having concerning symptoms, the patient became more and more preoccupied with and worried about notifications from her watch. Over the one-year period, she took 916 ECG recordings through her device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmMqlq"&gt;That patient isn’t an outlier, says Lindsey Rosman, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, who wrote about the case in a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8357265/pdf/nihms-1705938.pdf"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;. She was just one example of a pattern seen in cardiology clinics. “Patients with underlying...&lt;/p&gt;
