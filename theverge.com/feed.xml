    <title>AT&amp;T, Dish, and T-Mobile spend billions on more 5G spectrum </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zn3KZ1"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, Dish, and T-Mobile dropped billions of dollars in a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction to acquire more 5G spectrum licenses in the midrange 3.45GHz to 3.55GHz band, according to a report by the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-dish-spend-billions-on-spectrum-for-5g-services-11642188054"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HA5pFV"&gt;While AT&amp;amp;T was the biggest spender at $9 billion, Dish spent $7.3 billion, and T-Mobile followed behind at $2.9 billion. Verizon was notably absent from the auction. A number of smaller players also made the list, like Three Forty-Five Spectrum, which you can view on &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/atandt-dish-win-big-in-andromeda-auction-verizon-gets-nothing/d/d-id/774625"&gt;Light Reading’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YDLbhD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the third-largest FCC auction yet, with total bids reaching about $22.5 billion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxTIvd"&gt;The auction officially ended in November, but the FCC hasn’t publicly disclosed the winning bidders until now (&lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-379256A1.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). Total bids...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will now require employees to submit proof of COVID-19 booster shot</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R0bPp0"&gt;Apple now requires store and corporate employees to get a COVID-19 booster shot, the company announced in an internal email seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8JQJu"&gt;Once an employee is eligible to get a booster shot, they will have four weeks to comply, otherwise, they will need to take frequent tests to enter a retail store, partner store, or Apple office starting on February 15th. Apple will require unvaccinated employees — or those who haven’t yet submitted proof of vaccination — to provide negative COVID-19 rapid antigen tests before entering the workplace beginning on January 24th, although it’s unclear whether this applies to both corporate and retail employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8RVbxv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple boosts safety protocols as the omicron variant spreads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple will let dating apps offer third-party payment options in the Netherlands</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oc0YNi"&gt;Apple will let dating app developers offer alternate payment options in the Netherlands in compliance with the Dutch regulator’s ruling, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-15/apple-will-add-additional-payment-options-for-dutch-dating-apps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This will allow dating apps — and only dating apps — distributed in the country to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;Apple’s 15 to 30 percent commission&lt;/a&gt; on in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSHZQL"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mbbs4zql"&gt;a message to developers on its site&lt;/a&gt;, Apple explains that it’s introducing &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/"&gt;two new optional “entitlements,”&lt;/a&gt; or specific app capabilities, that will let developers add third-party payment processors for dating apps in the Netherlands. Dating app developers can either direct customers to a website to complete their purchase or add a third-party payment service within the app. However, if developers choose to snub Apple’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yellowjackets has reawakened my inner Lost fan</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u1hUuy"&gt;For the last few weeks, my mind has been filled with questions that, out of context, make little sense. I’ve thought long and hard about why a high school girl would start eating dirt and which middle-aged man might be covered in glitter. I’ve pondered the significance of everything from psychedelic mushrooms to a high school soccer coach’s pep talk to a missing bullet in a police officer’s gun. I’ve even rewatched video to see if a state championship-winning goal was offside — and don’t get me started on how much I’ve thought about cannibalism. What I’m saying is: &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; has completely taken over my brain. I haven’t been this obsessed with theorizing about events in a television show since the cast of &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; discovered the hatch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How a design museum unearthed a treasure trove of classic Slovak games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/71EDrmOsnr8OPdaBm21y8vhwUVM=/0x32:774x548/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393767/S_atochin.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Šatochin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hAxVN9"&gt;Late last year, the Slovak Design Museum released a translated collection of ’80s text adventures from the region. The games, often programmed by teenagers, capture a moment in history when the first generation of Slovak developers were learning their craft to share among their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ifwunf"&gt;The museum didn’t always cover games. Maroš Brojo, the general manager of the Slovak Game Developers Association, pitched the multimedia collection that he now curates. “When you get the patronage of a museum… it gives you much more credibility,” he says. “Suddenly, people start to have a very different view of this actually being part of something important. Our culture and our heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s excellent Basilisk V3 mouse is selling for its best price ever</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sEIbpk"&gt;We’re starting the weekend with some exciting news for gamers: our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;pick for the best wired gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; is now available for its lowest price to date. For only the third time, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Customizable-Ergonomic-Gaming/dp/B09C13PZX7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling Razer’s Basilisk V3 for just $59.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $69.99. The comfortable mouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22650400/razer-basilisk-v3-chroma-rgb-scroll-wheel-price-features"&gt;delivers notable improvements&lt;/a&gt; over its predecessor, particularly in regards to its scroll wheel. Depending upon how hard your scroll, the mouse can switch between ridged scrolling and free-spin modes, which make it easier to scroll down the page more freely — a perk that comes in handy even if you’re not using the mouse for gaming. It also touts a 26K DPI sensor, RGB lighting, and 11 programmable buttons, so you can adjust the controls to your liking within Razer’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why you might want a secure file-sharing service now that you’re working from home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYPvkvxWjZliIvCdF13ieBjmUoA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393577/VRG_ILL_4947_How_to_securely_share_files.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1F6FaM"&gt;When we were all at the office, many of us were connected to the office network. We didn’t need to give sharing files much thought. But now that we’re scattered across the landscape, securely sharing important files can take careful planning. Here’s why you might want to use powerful file-sharing services to share sensitive files safely, so you can collaborate better no matter where you’re working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CI6AcM"&gt;Probably the easiest way to share a file is to just attach a document to an email, or to a Slack or other instant message. But either way invites trouble on several fronts. If you rely too much on your email or messaging system, your poorly archived files could become available to prying hackers with phishing lures. If you’re sharing...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best noise-canceling headphone deals</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless 3 headphones are just $241 instead of $399.99 at Adorama.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2yBGHO"&gt;With many people working from home than they used to, owning a good pair of noise-canceling headphones has become more appealing than ever. However, they can be expensive and difficult to shop for due to the range of available models, many of which cater to different lifestyles and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights, while others are ideal for multitasking and marathon listening sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4B19IV"&gt;That’s why we’ve curated this list of the best deals on noise-canceling headphones. Here, you’ll find sales on all kinds of on-ear and over-ear headphones, all of which are designed to eliminate outside noise but come with their own strengths and weaknesses. And if you want to do even more research before making a buying decision,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams’ Walkie Talkie feature is now widely available</title>

  &lt;p id="emp3I5"&gt;Microsoft is making its &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/walkie-talkie"&gt;Walkie Talkie feature&lt;/a&gt; of Microsoft Teams generally available to all users of its communications app today. Walkie Talkie lets Microsoft Teams users turn smartphones or tablets into a walkie-talkie that works over cellular data or Wi-FI. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058313/microsoft-teams-walkie-talkie-push-to-talk-feature-preview"&gt;originally announced two years ago&lt;/a&gt; and has been available mostly in preview ever since. The feature &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-september-2020/ba-p/1726562"&gt;launched widely on Android in September of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but now Microsoft says it’s available for Zebra mobile devices as well as iPhones and iPads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeAw8t"&gt;Microsoft has primarily pitched this at frontline workers, employees who are customer-facing and run day-to-day operations inside companies. The software maker’s collaboration with Zebra Technologies makes it work with a dedicated...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="cVBhzE"&gt;Google will require anyone going to one of its US offices or facilities to have received a negative molecular test for COVID-19, the company informed employees Thursday in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/14/google-tells-anyone-coming-into-the-office-to-take-weekly-covid-tests.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;memo obtained by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Workers going to the office regularly will have to get tested weekly, chief health officer Karen DeSalvo said in the memo, and employees have been asked to report their vaccination status&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and wear surgical-grade masks indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IxE4l"&gt;Google spokesperson Lora Lee Erickson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that a new temporary COVID-19 policy is now being implemented, one where “anyone accessing our sites in the US are expected to obtain a recent negative COVID-19 molecular test before coming onsite” and that it’s offering various kinds of tests at no cost. &lt;/p&gt;
