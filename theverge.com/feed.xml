    <title>Apple places female engineering program manager on administrative leave after tweeting about sexism in the office</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ONzepy"&gt;Apple has placed senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik on indefinite administrative leave after she tweeted about sexism in the office. The company is currently investigating claims Gjøvik made about a hostile work environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcaR7F"&gt;“For months, I have been raising concerns with Apple employee relations about years of experiences with sexism, a hostile work environment, sexual harassment, unsafe working conditions, and retaliation,” Gjøvik says in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I asked them to mitigate the hostile work environment while they investigate, and they initially offered me EAP therapy and medical leave. I told them that made no sense, and said they should talk to my leadership and set up oversight and boundaries. I added...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Playdate’s first season of games won’t hit every handheld at the same time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2B-kXc-6jJ_pGhWGuNVo3EU3fo=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679840/Playdate_model_shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Panic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7ktTm2"&gt;One of the most intriguing aspects of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;Panic’s Playdate&lt;/a&gt; — besides its lovely crank — is the unique game delivery method that will bring 24 free games to the device. Panic plans to release a season of games (Season One), two games at a time each week. &lt;a href="https://help.play.date/games/season/"&gt;In a new FAQ released on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Panic explains a bit more about how that’ll work and reveals that, due to limited manufacturing capacity, not everyone will be playing new games at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYcxYQ"&gt;All Playdates will download new games weekly on “New Game Day” as long they’re connected to Wi-Fi, starting with the first two games when you connect your device. The catch is that not everyone will connect their Playdate to the internet on day one due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587193/playdate-preorder-how-to-panic-teenage-engineering-handheld-console"&gt;limited preorders&lt;/a&gt;. That means rather than...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Flo Rida Roblox Amazon TikTok ad is fake but amazing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3q3Hl7JynqSdBbPkOcltMEnt-0s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679707/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f35lYL"&gt;On Wednesday, a surreal TikTok ad from an advertiser posing as Amazon confused users into thinking the e-commerce giant was taking a stab at including absurdist internet humor into its online marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9EsHu"&gt;The ad featured gaming footage from the lego-like title &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;interspersed with strange clips of a man dancing to Flo Rida and T-Pain’s 2008 hit “Low,” but only the part where T-Pain says “Apple Bottom jeans.” There are also robot voices bullying each other about grandmas and girlfriends overlaid on the ad. The bizarre video was highlighted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eddyburback/status/1422972566629543941?s=20"&gt;Eddy Burback&lt;/a&gt;, a popular YouTuber and streamer, on his Twitter feed Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TCsgIo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;this was an amazon ad I got on tik tok???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this is 100% real I just recorded it &lt;a href="https://t.co/cST0JoKb33"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cST0JoKb33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;—...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>NYT crossword puzzle no longer works in third-party apps, crosses puzzle solvers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lA0MmX"&gt;People will no longer be able to play the digital version of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; daily crossword puzzle in third-party apps, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/crosswords/nyt-games-no-longer-available-on-across-lite-as-of-aug-9.html"&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt; made by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; on Monday. Starting August 10th, the crossword will be available digitally only via the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; site or on its own crossword app. Downloadable PDFs, in addition to the physical newspaper, will still be available for people who want to print and play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpWDze"&gt;Until now, crosswords were available in the &lt;a href="http://www.word-buff.com/across-lite.html"&gt;Across Lite .puz file format&lt;/a&gt;, so anyone with a &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; games subscription could download a puzzle and open it in the desktop or mobile app of their choice. The change applies not just to future puzzles but to the archive of puzzles that are currently in the .puz format. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton is updating its treadmills to again be useful without a subscription</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NyU_LBGt0vL_aAlBBglCI2YXAAE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679388/akrales_190328_3240_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3wIGPL"&gt;Peloton owners will again be able to use their treadmills without a subscription to the Peloton All-Access Membership, according to the company. In June, Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545663/peloton-tread-plus-treadmill-subscription-plan-recall"&gt;released a software update&lt;/a&gt; that required its treadmills to be secured with a passcode, a feature the company said was only available to paying subscribers due to “technical limitations.” At the time, Peloton promised that another software update was coming that would enable the feature for everyone, and it provided three free months of the subscription that usually costs $40 per month. On Wednesday, the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “all Tread owners can now access Tread Lock” along with the “Just Run” feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vh9rhV"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060884531-Tread-Lock"&gt;Peloton’s support page&lt;/a&gt;, the Tread Lock feature locks the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is testing a Snapchat-style stories feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jQPcejj7efOkQi9qpOxk77NbpqU=/0x44:1230x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679298/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_3.30.01_PM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DOSnVJ"&gt;On a long enough timeline, every social media app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;trends to adding stories&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s apparently TikTok’s turn: the popular video app is experimenting with a new stories feature. The feature was highlighted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1422994358400389123"&gt;Matt Navarra on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and a TikTok spokesperson confirmed the test in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkEGVg"&gt;The new feature, simply called “TikTok Stories,” appears to work similarly to other stories functions on apps like Instagram or Snapchat. Stories live in a newly added slide-over sidebar, where you’ll be able to see stories posted by accounts that you follow on TikTok for 24 hours before they’re automatically deleted. Other users will be able to react and comment on your story, too. And just like on Instagram and other platforms,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new MMO delayed for the fourth time, but this time by just one month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nw38Cg5KdRRvtrRYbAU1qwDLcPk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679135/ss23.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5FWQt"&gt;Amazon Games has delayed &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, its upcoming MMO, from August 31st to September 28th, the studio announced on Wednesday. The delay — the game’s fourth —  comes shortly after the end of &lt;a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/new-world-closed-beta"&gt;a closed beta&lt;/a&gt;, which wrapped up on August 3rd at 2:59AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2d0l2"&gt;The team will be “making some improvements” based on what players found in the beta, taking time to “smash bugs, improve stability, and polish the game,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playnewworld/status/1422969580394319877"&gt;according to a post on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cZDRe"&gt;“This was not an easy decision to make,” the team said. “We know this isn’t the first time we’ve changed our launch date in pursuit of quality, and that it can be disappointing to wait a bit longer. But we want to be sure we deliver you the highest quality game possible at launch.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook can project your eyes onto a VR headset, and it’s exactly as uncanny as it sounds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook’s prototype for “reverse passthrough VR,” a system for creating the illusion of eye contact while wearing a VR headset." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16XI0TT2ThWtjkxYNUUxSN4J5W0=/96x0:1104x672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679043/Reverse_passthrough_VR_hero_image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook Reality Labs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CeYFOQ"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs wants to help people see your eyes while you’re in virtual reality — even if the results sit somewhere between mildly unsettling and nightmarish. Earlier this week, FRL released a paper &lt;a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/reverse-pass-through-vr/"&gt;on “reverse passthrough VR,”&lt;/a&gt; a recipe for making VR headsets less physically isolating. Researchers devised a method for translating your face onto the front of a headset, although they emphasize it’s still firmly experimental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBzfou"&gt;“Passthrough VR” refers to a feature that displays a live video feed from a headset’s cameras, letting users see the real world while they’re still wearing the device. Facebook’s Oculus Quest platform, for instance, shows users a passthrough feed when they step outside their VR space’s boundaries. It’s useful...&lt;/p&gt;
