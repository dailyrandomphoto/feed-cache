    <title>Skype is getting another redesign with new themes and features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/svQeSQx9UKxCH7GBWWILI6skmDo=/0x8:2000x1341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915977/macbook_pro_mockup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skype’s new design and colorful layouts.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rx189p"&gt;Skype’s had more redesigns in the past five years than I’ve had hot dinners, but Microsoft is still ready to try and tweak things once again. The software maker is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skype.com%2Fen%2Fblogs%2F2021-08-announcement-modern-skype%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22696716%2Fskype-new-design-themes-calling-features-updates" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;teasing plans&lt;/a&gt; for an “improved, faster, reliable, and super modern-looking Skype.” Microsoft says it has been listening to feedback and, over the next few months, will start rolling out changes to modernize Skype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cn9KCE"&gt;The most important part of Skype, what Microsoft calls the call stage, is getting the most attention. The grid that’s displayed during calls will soon include everyone on a call, regardless of whether they have enabled video or not. This puts all participants side by side, including your own video in the main interface.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress isn’t satisfied with Facebook’s pause on Instagram Kids</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Ax1zQ"&gt;Facebook announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;it would be “pausing” work&lt;/a&gt; on its Instagram for kids app on Monday after weeks of growing pressure from lawmakers and advocacy groups to scrap the app. But many lawmakers aren’t satisfied with the pause, calling on Facebook to stop development entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgF3ij"&gt;In a statement issued Monday, Democrats in the House and Senate called Facebook’s decision to halt development of the Instagram product targeted to kids under 13 as “insufficient.” Four lawmakers signed onto the statement, including Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Rep. Lori Trahan (D-MA),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3LcslX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook has completely forfeited the benefit of the doubt”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Discord will now let you set a unique avatar in each of the servers where you hang out</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWroiH"&gt;Messaging app Discord announced today that its premium Nitro tier will now allow subscribers to use a different avatar on each of their servers. The option to “change nickname” in the app has been changed to “edit server profile.” That’s where you’ll be able to change both your nickname and server avatar, so if you use multiple servers — as a lot of Discord users do — you can keep each identity separate and unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zepfMG"&gt;Discord also announced today that they’re starting the rollout of scheduled events, which allow users to plan ahead, giving time to spread awareness and join. The company says it’s seeing more communities use stage channels to connect with members, in AMAs, open mic events, or other large-scale discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2yLkm"&gt;With scheduled...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford recalls Mustang Mach-Es over risk of glass roof flying off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FVTrD3NuyU6FkAOB3knodaGPlZY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915483/sokane_210125_4386_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l80R44"&gt;Ford is recalling the Mustang Mach-E out of concern that the windshield and panoramic roof could leak or, worse, come flying off during a crash or while driving. Nearly 18,000 of the electric SUVs sold to date are at risk of the former, though Ford says only around 13,000 of them run the risk of the roof detaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjAEyo"&gt;The company will start providing owners with recall instructions in late October, and it says it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the defect. Ford initially started recalling Mustang Mach-E SUVs last week in Canada, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/21/ford-recalls-mustang-mach-e-risk-of-glass-roof-falling-off-mocking-tesla-same-issue/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Electrek &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5svfw"&gt;Ford told the &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/FORD/MUSTANG%252520MACH-E/SUV/AWD#recalls"&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month that it had become aware that the windshield and panoramic roof of the Mustang Mach-E may...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok says it has passed 1 billion users</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;TikTok has passed 1 billion users | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wUsfUE"&gt;TikTok said Monday it has passed 1 billion monthly users. It’s a remarkable number for a platform launched in August 2018 that has been scrutinized by governments — including the US — that are worried about the data collection practices of its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srkr7J"&gt;TikTok’s popularity soared during the pandemic, becoming the most-downloaded app in the world in the first quarter of 2020, with some &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/05/20/inside-the-hunt-for-tiktoks-new-ceo-and-whats-next-for-the-worlds-hottest-app"&gt;315 million downloads&lt;/a&gt; in that quarter alone according to app analytics company SensorTower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4IqY9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/17/chinas-bytedance-tiktok-owner-saw-revenue-surge-111percent-in-2020.html"&gt;ByteDance reportedly saw its 2020 revenue&lt;/a&gt; more than double from the year prior, to $34.3 billion. From its launch to date, SensorTower says TikTok installs have reached 3.2 billion, which includes information from Douyin, the Chinese...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox is negotiating with music publishers after settling a copyright lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4WHnD8"&gt;Virtual world-building platform Roblox has settled a lawsuit with the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) and is negotiating potential deals with individual music publishers. Roblox announced the news this morning, saying it was “committed to partnering with the music industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6B6tS"&gt;The NMPA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527713/roblox-nmpa-lawsuit-copyright-infringement-deadmau5-ariana-grande-imagine-dragons"&gt;sued Roblox in June&lt;/a&gt; for letting users upload copyrighted songs into its shared library of game-building assets. Roblox quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564922/roblox-sony-music-partnership-lil-nas-x-collaboration-licensing"&gt;signed individual deals with BMG and Sony&lt;/a&gt;, but the new agreement settles all claims involving NMPA members. According to a press release and the NMPA, Roblox and the organization have agreed to the terms of an industry-wide settlement that individual music publishers can decide whether to opt in to, and the agreement...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Death Stranding Director’s Cut makes the most of the PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qUguCENQb5zcHfnfTQ5PCU_EUo=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915169/51298386042_570941bddd_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0UuTgs"&gt;Okay, I’ll make the obvious joke: was there really anything cut from &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;? For better and worse, Hideo Kojima’s deeply indulgent post-apocalyptic delivery simulator did not feel like it had been subject to heavy editing. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/7/12/22573731/death-stranding-directors-cut-hideo-kojima-missions-name-debate"&gt;Kojima himself has said&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn’t like the name of this new PlayStation 5 version of the game, dubbed a “director’s cut,” arguing instead that it has simply had new content produced for it. So there you have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQBEUp"&gt;In any case, &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; is one of the more worthwhile PS5 upgrades out there. For $10 (if you own the PS4 release), this new edition comes with extra missions, improved visuals and performance, more tools and items, DualSense-powered haptic feedback, and 3D audio support....&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro is $150 off today</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MA1IXp"&gt;The MacBook Pro remains Apple’s top-end option for notebooks with speedy M1 processors. There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/9/22526584/apple-m1x-macbook-pro-wwdc-2021-youtube-tags"&gt;talks of new models with a rumored M1X update&lt;/a&gt;, but as of now, if you’re looking for the best the M1 has to offer in the shape of a laptop, it’s the late-2020 MacBook Pro. Today, the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro is $150 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1753149462504113622#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,150 with 256GB of storage or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,350 for 512GB&lt;/a&gt;. This is the second-best price of all time on the popular laptop from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xw6COf"&gt;We often offer praise for its MacBook Air counterpart, which goes on sale more often and is still &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to $850&lt;/a&gt;, but the MacBook Pro is a great upgrade for those seeking a bit more performance with a better, brighter screen. You also get the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Music’s new Wear OS app is coming to older smartwatches after all</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Wear OS app for YouTube Music.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jqxiAT"&gt;YouTube Music’s Wear OS app is rolling out to a handful of older Wear OS 2 smartwatches from the likes of Fossil, Michael Kors, and Mobvoi starting this week, after previously launching exclusively on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22642047/google-youtube-music-wear-os-3-app-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic"&gt;Samsung’s new Wear OS 3-powered Galaxy Watch 4 smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;. The app lets YouTube Music Premium subscribers download songs to compatible smartwatches and listen to music offline without needing a paired phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyZEED"&gt;The new app was first detailed when Google and Samsung announced they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;merging their Wear OS and Tizen smartwatch operating systems&lt;/a&gt; to create Wear OS 3, and initial reports suggested it &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/11/youtube-music-wear-os-maps-release/"&gt;wouldn’t be coming&lt;/a&gt; to devices running the older Wear OS 2 operating system.

  &lt;p id="xPF2ZE"&gt;Now that your brand-spanking-new iPhone 13 has arrived (or is on the way), it’s time to start thinking about protecting your baby. After all, it’s only a matter of time before your phone falls out of your pocket or makes contact with your keys, so it’s worth the extra investment now to prevent future damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CujTbM"&gt;Although MagSafe as an iPhone accessory standard is already a year old, Apple is off to a slow start building out its accessory ecosystem. Since its October 2020 launch event, Apple has only launched a dozen official MagSafe products: from the iconic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe Charger&lt;/a&gt; puck to the 2021 &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMM0Q3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-golden-brown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe Leather Wallet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, Apple is famously tight-fisted...&lt;/p&gt;
