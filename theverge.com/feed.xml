    <title>Google to use patient data to develop healthcare algorithms for hospital chain</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X6gjOu"&gt;Google has made a deal for access to patient records from HCA, which which &lt;a href="https://investor.hcahealthcare.com/news/news-details/2021/HCA-Healthcare-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;operates 181 hospitals&lt;/a&gt; and more than 2,000 healthcare sites in 21 states, so the tech company can develop healthcare algorithms, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-strikes-deal-with-hospital-chain-to-develop-healthcare-algorithms-11622030401"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGoAsz"&gt;Google will store anonymized data from patient health records and internet-connected medical devices. That data will be used to build programs that could inform medical decisions made by doctors. The deal is described as “multiyear” by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ, &lt;/em&gt;without specifying how many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAFLzj"&gt;As health records moved online over the past few years, hospitals and tech companies jumped at opportunities to take advantage of the glut of digitized medical information collected at each doctor’s visit. Microsoft and Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-give-tech-giants-access-to-detailed-medical-records-11579516200?mod=article_inline"&gt;a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford is making an electric Explorer, boosts EV investment by $8 billion</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPMEFK"&gt;Ford will spend $30 billion on electric vehicles by 2025, and says 40 percent of its global fleet will be all-electric by 2030. The company is working on an all-electric versions of its Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs. And it’s developing two new electric vehicle platforms: one that will power full-size pickup trucks, and one that can easily flex between all- and rear-wheel drive to fit multiple vehicle types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlW9we"&gt;The company had previously committed $22 billion to EVs and had announced a goal to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;all-electric in Europe by 2030&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2dAvl"&gt;Ford is also creating a standalone business for its commercial vehicle division called Ford Pro. The company hopes that by offering more dedicated services to these customers, it can build on what is already a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lockheed Martin and GM are working on an electric Moon buggy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpdfPC"&gt;Lockheed Martin and General Motors unveiled plans on Wednesday to build an autonomous buggy-like vehicle that future astronauts can use to zip around the surface of the Moon. The two companies collaborated to pitch a conceptual Lunar Terrain Vehicle to NASA’s Artemis program, a Moon exploration campaign that calls for various robots, vehicles, and scientific bases to be planted on the lunar surface within the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I09IIE"&gt;Ahead of a presentation Wednesday morning, Lockheed and GM said in a joint press release that the vehicle will use the automaker’s autonomous driving technology and is “being designed to traverse significantly farther distances” than Apollo-era buggies. Just like those Moon buggies from the ‘70s, the Lockheed-GM concept...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More Americans believe in climate change but still can’t quit fossil fuels</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0GLLqC"&gt;Nearly two-thirds of Americans now believe that climate change is an urgent problem to address, but they aren’t nearly as enthusiastic about giving up oil and gas, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/05/26/gen-z-millennials-stand-out-for-climate-change-activism-social-media-engagement-with-issue/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; by the Pew Research Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNCsqO"&gt;Only one-third of people surveyed supported completely phasing out fossil fuels. Less than half of respondents are okay with phasing out new gas-powered vehicles. Taking those steps might seem drastic, considering fossil fuels currently&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;make up about 80 percent of the &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/"&gt;US energy mix&lt;/a&gt;. But phasing out most, if not all, fossil fuels is pretty much in line with what’s needed to meet the scale of the climate crisis, according to climate experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5d6ue"&gt;Now that many Americans are taking the threats posed by climate change seriously,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sweet Tooth’s post-apocalyptic world is meant to be a ‘storybook dystopia’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sweet Tooth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ymQ4ISwGyqF38yelfVW7-yxxCtM=/0x1:3600x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345107/sto105_nf_pull_02a_20210412R.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tq3UIB"&gt;Jeff Lemire’s &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; is a comic book about a young boy surviving in a world ravaged by a pandemic. He also happens to be a “hybrid,” a new breed of half-human, half-animal creature that began to appear alongside the deadly sickness. It’s a dark story, one that had the potential to be incredibly bleak and uncomfortable when translated to television. That’s particularly true now, as the real world continues to deal with its own pandemic. For the team adapting the story for an upcoming series on Netflix, all of these factors combined to create a slightly different approach. “It made us lean more into the hope,” executive producer Amanda Burrell says of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95Mwbd"&gt;Netflix’s eight-episode &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; series will debut on June 4th. It’s a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb’s CEO thinks the platform can replace your landlord</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dJa8tz"&gt;Airbnb doesn’t want you to forget about Airbnb, especially when you’re planning post-pandemic vacations. So on Monday, the company &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2F2021&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;made multiple announcements&lt;/a&gt; all seemingly designed to get people renting, traveling, and, crucially, choosing Airbnb to do so. It announced flexible booking, which lets people search across days, weeks, or months to plan a trip, as well as more location flexibility when looking for a place to stay. It also launched a faster onboarding process for hosts, during a time when competitors &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vrbo-isnt-airbnbs-problem-11621510202"&gt;like Vrbo&lt;/a&gt; are trying to poach them, as well as a new service for Super Hosts that’ll allow them to reach out to the Airbnb team directly for support issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGOYoA"&gt;“We just think there’s this huge inflection point in travel brought on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waze names former Hotwire president Neha Parikh as CEO</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vkqXaJ"&gt;Waze has a new CEO: Neha Parikh, the former president of Hotwire and a board member of Carvana. Parikh replaces Noam Bardin, who &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/waze-ceo-noam-bardin-to-leave-company-in-early-2021/"&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt; as CEO of the Google-owned navigation service last November after leading the company for 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6epDlZ"&gt;Parikh will join Waze as CEO starting in June, the company says. She is a veteran of online hospitality brand Expedia, having served in a variety of positions at two of the corporation’s subsidiaries: Hotels.com, where she ended as senior vice president for global brands and retails, and flight and hotel booking service Hotwire, where she is currently president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqTWlU"&gt;As Hotwire’s youngest and first female president, Parikh “led a return to growth by revamping the business model, reshaping the product,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Open-world RPG Pokémon Legends: Arceus is launching January 28th, 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g64PMho72s9zQBWQ1R2ecbLzm-g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344706/Switch_PokemonLegendsArceus_Screenshot__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJVRpG"&gt;Possibly the most ambitious &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game to date will be available early next year. Today &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1397539085921800194"&gt;Nintendo announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt; will be launching on the Nintendo Switch on January 28th, 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302841/pokemon-legends-arceus-open-world-rpg-nintendo-switch"&gt;The game was first announced in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECigw4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; looks to be a big change for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, a franchise that’s become known for its slowly evolving roleplaying games. It’s an open-world RPG that takes place in a much older version of the Sinnoh region, before the time of pokémon trainers and organized competitions. In addition to the new setting, the experience also looks to be much more seamless compared to the main games, as Nintendo says players will be able to go out into the wild to “study the pokémon’s behaviors, sneak up to them, then...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now hide like counts on Instagram and Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwbQvj1_XrGbBaO54-q2kLj4b3I=/40x0:1660x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344538/IG_Hiding_Likes__Consumer_View_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8k7TKT"&gt;You can now hide like counts on Instagram and Facebook. After years of testing on both platforms, Facebook and Instagram have settled on an opt-in experience for hiding like counts to allow people to disable seeing them across all posts and an option to hide their own public like counts from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYfAa7"&gt;Instagram is enabling this feature after years of tests and pressure from experts to make changes to its platform.
