&lt;p id="6mPJK6"&gt;“With more options for getting started, and staying active and healthy during pregnancy as well as at any age or fitness level, we hope even more people will be inspired to keep moving with our amazing team of passionate trainers,” said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s senior director of fitness technologies, in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Peloton Bike Plus’ GymKit support no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="ZiuLwt"&gt;Peloton debuted its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22238974/peloton-bike-plus-review-price-features"&gt;Bike Plus&lt;/a&gt; with a much-desired feature: GymKit support. But now, the company’s pulling back some of that functionality. A Peloton spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today that GymKit no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes and instead will “only be available in cycling classes for now.” The spokesperson also said: “Peloton is committed to bringing the GymKit integration to all workouts and disciplines within Apple’s terms of service,” seemingly suggesting bootcamp workouts didn’t fall under those terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYdBuC"&gt;This change is a disruptive one for users who might have purchased the Bike Plus specifically for its GymKit support. It’s the first piece of hardware from the connected fitness company to support GymKit, and the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Chromebook Spin 513 with a Snapdragon 7c processor starts at $480</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dsskNS"&gt;We already knew Acer was working on the first two Chrome OS devices powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c chips. And today, the company has released two product listings for its Chromebook Spin 513, but you can’t buy this laptop just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wv9jHs"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/acer-chromebook-spin-513-starts-at-479-with-snapdragon-7c/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;AboutChromebooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Chromebook Spin 513 with the Snapdragon 7c processor has two configuration listings that have appeared on Acer’s website, with a starting price of $479.99. Acer announced in October that the Chromebook Spin would start at $399.99. Additionally, both laptops also do not show 4G LTE for connectivity, which is something that was noted to be a configuration option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtiAuV"&gt;The key difference between the two is the RAM configuration, which is only a $20 price difference. Although...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Core wants to be the YouTube of game development, and now anyone can try it</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZtfUjM"&gt;Core, the platform that hopes to help creators build games and players experience them, is launching for free in early access today. It’s available exclusively on the Epic Games Store and already includes over 20,000 free playable games across a wide variety of genres including team-based multiplayer shooters, RPGs, and side-scrollers. Core’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;developer, Manticore Games, says that over a million players and creators have used the platform while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21158189/core-free-game-creation-tool-pc-youtube-twitch"&gt;it’s been in alpha over the past year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOZEA6"&gt;The aim with Core is to make it easier for creators to develop and monetize games, similar to what YouTube did for online video, while gamers get “an endless arcade of high-quality, user-built games and worlds.” The platform’s development tools are built on...&lt;/p&gt;

The order also &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126"&gt;places significant new restrictions&lt;/a&gt; on Russia’s sovereign debt, which will make it more difficult for the country’s government to raise money and support its currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJ2GPW"&gt;“Treasury will target Russian leaders, officials, intelligence services, and their proxies that attempt to interfere in the U.S. electoral process or subvert U.S. democracy,” said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “This is the start of a new U.S. campaign against Russian malign behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hT31wo"&gt;Uncovered in December, the hack saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;more than 250 federal agencies and...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grab a 5G-ready OnePlus 8 for 50 percent off today at B&amp;H Photo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s7FSUBnLHe3LqmDXgCBkPhsS9lI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130542/vpavic_042008_3967_0089.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AYyAtE"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is once again offering the lowest price yet on the Verizon variant of the OnePlus 8. Originally priced at $800, you can &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615543-REG%2Foneplus_5011101036_8_5g_uw_smartphone.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get this model for $400&lt;/a&gt;. This phone typically costs more than the original OnePlus 8 model because it is compatible with Verizon’s mmWave network. However, because B&amp;amp;H is selling it as unlocked, it will work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile networks if either is your preferred phone carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVbKLe"&gt;The OnePlus 8 includes a 6.5-inch OLED screen, a 90Hz refresh rate, and 128GB of storage. Despite its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;, debuting a few weeks ago, at $400, this is still a great deal for people looking to upgrade to a 5G-ready smartphone and not spend a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon added another 50 million Prime subscribers during the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTRldkql6Y73wnoKf7UOnKMJNho=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130468/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UBErQR"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders"&gt;final annual letter&lt;/a&gt; to Amazon’s shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;who will step down in Q3 2021 to make way for Andy Jassy&lt;/a&gt; — shared that the number of Prime subscribers has reached 200 million. Its Q4 2019 earnings included the milestone of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21115823/amazon-q4-19-earnings-prime-membership-fresh-one-day-shipping"&gt;surpassing 150 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; to its Prime service that offers fast shipping, original TV content, and more. Essentially, Amazon convinced 50 million people to join Prime during the pandemic, accounting for an approximate 33 percent growth of the base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Fwurx"&gt;If you haven’t paid attention to the company’s earnings in the past year, Prime subscribers certainly aren’t the only numbers Amazon has been able to grow. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22260133/amazon-q4-2020-quarterly-earnings-jeff-bezos-ceo-transition-andy-jassy"&gt;2020 was the company’s most profitable year yet&lt;/a&gt;, growing bigger during a time when many...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A federal ‘revenge porn’ ban could transform online harassment laws</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="agaUJJ"&gt;The US could be on the verge of passing the first federal law against nonconsensual pornography or “revenge porn.” If it does, it could reignite a debate over the balance between punishing serious harms and limiting free expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQ2rPI"&gt;Lawmakers in 46 states (as well as Guam and the District of Columbia) have already passed bans on nonconsensual pornography: nude or sexually explicit images distributed without their subjects’ consent. But activists have long called for a federal law to replace the patchwork of state laws — and now, they’re on the cusp of getting it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Tb2ut"&gt;&lt;a href="https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/SPEIER_034_xml210311224936258.pdf"&gt;A new measure&lt;/a&gt; that would ban knowingly or recklessly distributing “intimate visual depictions” of non-consenting subjects has been added as an amendment to the Violence Against...&lt;/p&gt;
