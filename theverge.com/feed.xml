    <title>Future Apple Watches could feature blood glucose and body temperature sensors</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h8ahct"&gt;This year’s Apple Watch could feature an improved screen and updated ultra-wideband support, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, but more substantial improvements like temperature and blood glucose monitoring will not appear until later models. The company is also reportedly planning a successor to last year’s more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a new extreme sports-focused model, due for release in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBxl32"&gt;The improvements coming to this year’s model, which will almost certainly be called the Series 7, appear to be small. Its display bezels are said to be thinner, and a new lamination  technique could reduce the distance between the display and the front cover. The watch’s ultra-wideband support could also be improved after getting its Apple...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s premium G1 OLED now comes with a 5-year warranty in the US and UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pU-sbNp7Kjiwl0jQpwSNgkvLaK4=/4x0:1597x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448531/large01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG is now offering a 5-year warranty for its G1 OLED.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bu8FhG"&gt;LG is offering an extended 5-year warranty on its 4K G1 OLED in the US, covering any problems that develop with its panel after the standard one-year warranty. In the UK &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fuk%2Foled-tvs%2F2021%2Foled-warranty&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F14%2F22532894%2Flg-5-year-warranty-g1-oled-z1-4k-8k-usa-panel-failure-burn-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; the extended warranty also applies to its Z1 8K OLED. It’s unclear in how many other countries LG is offering the extended warranty, and the company did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6jAqo"&gt;The extended warranty appears to be an attempt to upsell customers from LG’s popular lower-end sets like the C1 to its more premium G1 model. But it should also allay any fears that the new brighter Evo OLED panel LG is using in the G1 won’t last as long as its previous OLED panels. Or, as LG said in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/lg-oled-tvs-now-come-with-a-five-year-warranty-but-not-all-of-them"&gt;given to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “The warranty is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Workspace and Google Chat are officially available to everybody</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Spaces" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rtFVBU9LrXneTbHJCVe24eCBXmU=/120x0:3720x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448465/Spaces_static_image___Fam_Reunion.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n1st3n"&gt;Google is announcing some changes to its Workspace suite of apps and services today, including availability for anybody who has a Google account. Google says that there are over three billion users of its Workspace apps — though it’s probably a safe bet that Gmail accounts for a healthy chunk of that userbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oeUWT"&gt;A lot of people will soon have the option to switch over to Google’s more modern system for Gmail, Docs, and Chat. All of them can be integrated in a single tab more easily, for example with chats sliding over to the left to reveal a shared spreadsheet. It’s also related to the company’s new “smart canvas” push, which is also designed to interlink its various apps via “smart chips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYHrm5"&gt;To get started, Google is now officially offering...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s game streaming service Luna is opening access to all Prime members June 21 and 22</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jqBmj6HQn-51xq9r_A8BWaQDca8=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448422/_DSC6805_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpEjfk"&gt;Amazon is opening up access to its game streaming service Luna &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=23494951011"&gt;to all Amazon Prime members on June 21 and 22&lt;/a&gt; (Amazon Prime Day). Previously, to test out Luna you had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21451371/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-service-twitch-alexa-controller"&gt;request access or sign up&lt;/a&gt; from supported Fire TV devices. But for this limited-time only, any Prime subscribers in the mainland US will be able to start a 7-day trial of Luna right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWQTsE"&gt;Luna is available on Windows PC, Mac, Fire TV, and via the web on iPhone, iPad, and “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177222/amazon-luna-android-cloud-gaming-google-pixel-samsung-oneplus"&gt;select Android phones&lt;/a&gt;.” Regular pricing is $5.99 a month for access to games including &lt;em&gt;Control, GRID&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;. Or, once you’ve got a Luna account, you can pay $14.99 a month for the Ubisoft Plus beta channel. This gets you access to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=21494096011"&gt;big range of Ubisoft games&lt;/a&gt;, including the latest titles from...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google to work with UK regulators on its big ad-tracking shakeup</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jzx9Qx"&gt;The UK’s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), will collaborate with Google as it attempts to rework online ad targeting, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-have-key-oversight-role-over-google-s-planned-removal-of-third-party-cookies"&gt;the regulator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/our-commitments-privacy-sandbox/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have announced. It comes as Google is attempting to phase out the use of third-party cookies for tracking and targeting users with ads and instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;use a new set of technologies&lt;/a&gt; it’s calling Privacy Sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ch5sIJ"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/our-commitments-privacy-sandbox/"&gt;its announcement&lt;/a&gt;, Google said this is the first time regulators and technology companies have worked together on new technologies like this. As well as the CMA, the UK’s data protection regulator (the Information Commissioner’s Office, or ICO) will also be involved. “The CMA is taking a leading role in setting out how we can work with the most powerful tech...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung says it hasn’t decided whether to halt Galaxy S21 FE production</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKx6rJfWPBvv-CF_SNEt38S-44U=/0x0:970x647/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448284/s21fe.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An alleged render of the Galaxy S21 FE. | OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NIbrGO"&gt;Samsung has downplayed a report that claimed the company has suspended production of an upcoming phone called the Galaxy S21 FE. Korean publication &lt;em&gt;ETNews&lt;/em&gt; alleged over the weekend that production of the unannounced phone had stopped because of a shortage of semiconductors, and that Qualcomm processors had been reallocated to foldable devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyY0S7"&gt;The report has since been deleted, and Samsung now says it hasn’t made a decision on whether to halt production. In a statement texted &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/samsung-halts-production-of-new-phone-on-chip-shortage-et-says"&gt;to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, the company says “While we cannot discuss details of the unreleased product, nothing has been determined regarding the alleged production suspension.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IrGspR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE review: the right price for the right stuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d5ZIZ1"&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE — the FE stands for Fan Edition — was expected to be a cut-down, more affordable...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="VC1JN5"&gt;E3 2021 is finally here. After being canceled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, E3 is back for 2021 in an all-digital format, and it kicked off on June 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZLqrf"&gt;There’s been a lot of great announcements so far, including a trailer and release date for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22307059/elden-ring-george-rr-martin-fromsoftware-e3-2021-trailer-gameplay"&gt;highly-anticipated &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22531110/ubisoft-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-game-trailer-e3-2021"&gt;a trailer for Ubisoft’s gorgeous &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;a release date for Microsoft and Bethesda’s &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532295/final-fantasy-origins-square-enix-team-ninja-trailer-e3-2021"&gt;the reveal of a chaos-filled and action-heavy &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; spinoff&lt;/a&gt;. But there are still two days of E3 left, with Capcom’s presentation on Monday and Tuesday’s Nintendo Direct to look forward to, among other shows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The six coolest games from the PC Gaming Show at E3 2021</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They Always Run.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6MbfUL"&gt;The second day of E3 2021 has been busy with Xbox and Bethesda’s joint conference followed by Square Enix’s showcase, but plenty more game announcements came from the PC Gaming Show. If you don’t have time to catch up on the whole 90 minutes, we’ve rounded up a few of our highlights of intriguing and upcoming games that you’ll want to wishlist on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J5m6Yb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rawmen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p id="pI3Znq"&gt;Basically &lt;em&gt;Splatoon &lt;/em&gt;but with food, &lt;em&gt;Rawmen&lt;/em&gt; is a third-person arena shooter where instead of guns, you fight with food against up to two to eight players. Sling soup at your opponents, become a human meatball by jumping into meat juice and rolling your way back home, or launch yourself in the air with doughnut bombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VwJ7gL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;They Always Run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="bgj020"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="YNFJUw"&gt;A new cinematic trailer introduces the King of Wakanda himself — although his face is not shown clearly until he puts on his Black Panther mask. He will be defending Wakanda from Klaw, who has infiltrated Wakanda in order to steal Vibranium for his own plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cftuE5"&gt;The trailer page indicates that &lt;em&gt;War For Wakanda&lt;/em&gt; will release this August.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7rCDcy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Babylon’s Fall&lt;/em&gt; finally has a substantial gameplay trailer, which was revealed at Square Enix’s E3 2021 Showcase. The new trailer is the first time it’s been seen since the game was first announced in 2018. Players will team up tackling challenging dungeons in an attempt to scale the titular tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQKNPk"&gt;The co-op title is developed by PlatinumGames and can be played solo or with up to four players. Besides the studio’s trademark hi-octane melee action, the new footage from the fantasy title shows that players can wield ranged weapons like magic staffs and bows. Their powers and customization is also based on a special equipment called the Gideon Coffin worn on their backs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S06HyT"&gt;The developers confirmed that &lt;em&gt;Babylon’s Fall &lt;/em&gt;is a live-service title...&lt;/p&gt;
