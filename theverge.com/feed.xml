    <title>The US has set a date to reopen its borders to vaccinated foreign visitors</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="stjlW6"&gt;The White House announced Friday that the US is reopening its land and air borders to vaccinated foreign nationals on November 8th. State Department spokesman Ned Price said at a press briefing that details will be available ahead of November 8th for airline passengers and people arriving at US land borders for what they’ll need to show full proof of vaccination against COVID-19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlKs6h"&gt;As part of pandemic restrictions, non-essential travelers from more than 30 countries had been barred from entering the US since March 2020. This latest news comes as the White House announced Tuesday that the US was ending restrictions at the borders and ferry crossings with Mexico and Canada for foreign nationals vaccinated against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA launches its Lucy spacecraft to study the Jupiter Trojan asteroids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with the Lucy spacecraft aboard is seen in this 2 minute and 30 second exposure photograph as it launches from Space Launch Complex 41, Saturday, Oct. 16, 2021, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ufm9TM_jJuhZIMM6nt9CKUEVtsg=/0x301:2689x2094/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70003424/lucy_in_the_sky2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aVPTFI"&gt;NASA’s Lucy space probe launched successfully from Cape Canaveral in Florida early Saturday, the beginning of a 12-year mission to study Jupiter’s Trojan asteroids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGji5y"&gt;The uncrewed spacecraft lifted off at 5:34AM ET aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. Lucy sent its first signal to Earth from its own antenna to NASA’s Deep Space Network at 6:40AM ET.  Scientists believe the Trojan asteroids, which orbit the Sun along the same path as Jupiter, may hold clues about the formation of our solar system. It’s NASA’s first-ever single-spacecraft mission to explore so many different asteroids, the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-ula-launch-lucy-mission-to-fossils-of-planet-formation"&gt;agency said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqWn4M"&gt;Lucy is named for the fossilized human skeleton &lt;a href="https://iho.asu.edu/about/lucys-story"&gt;discovered in Ethiopia in 1974&lt;/a&gt;, which provided key insights into human evolution....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snag a Samsung soundbar for a low price from Newegg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7SNrW9JK95Gjy7Dq2eV3hQky3YQ=/0x54:1280x907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70003340/86_508_325_S08.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T8xwj2"&gt;This slim soundbar from Samsung is currently available for its lowest price ever at Newegg, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsamsung-hw-q60t-za-soundbar%2Fp%2FN82E16886508325%3FItem%3DN82E16886508325%26cm_sp%3DDailydeal_SS-_-86-508-325-_-10152021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to just $298&lt;/a&gt;. This 38-inch soundbar comes packed with 9 forward-firing speakers and a wireless subwoofer for a soundbar that punches well above its weight. There are a couple of things to keep in mind, however. This soundbar only comes equipped with a single HDMI input and output port, so you’ll need to rely on a switcher, or utilize the built-in Bluetooth connectivity if you’re using this soundbar for multiple devices. Another small drawback is the lack of additional rear-channel speakers, which shouldn’t be an issue for smaller rooms, but if you have a particularly large living room, you may want to invest in a pair of tertiary speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dbrand pulls its PS5 Darkplates from sale after Sony threatens legal action</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3znqwwjp1lcp4rpyqtuzvNGrpg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70002640/DSCF7516.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P8Au9K"&gt;Earlier this year, Dbrand started selling matte black PS5 side plates that it called Darkplates, and when it did, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279685/matte-black-ps5-faceplates-on-sale-dbrand-sue-us-sony"&gt;baited Sony&lt;/a&gt; right on the product’s info page to “Go ahead, sue us.” We got our hands on some, and they look &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306874/dbrand-ps5-darkplates-matte-black-hands-on-review"&gt;exactly like you expect&lt;/a&gt;, making the sides of your PS5 black instead of white. They even have their own tongue-in-cheek take on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;PlayStation icon microtexture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zovZ0O"&gt;As of Saturday, though, you can’t buy Darkplates anymore, as Dbrand has removed them from sale after (perhaps unsurprisingly) receiving a cease and desist letter from Sony. (If you visit the Darkplates site right now, it just shows &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/ps5"&gt;a list of news articles&lt;/a&gt;, including ones from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGvP4o"&gt;Dbrand shared the letter with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which we’ve included at the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After seeing new leaked photos of the Pixel 6, I think I finally get the phone’s unusual design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQPglv-t6irHT0jFmscKCsBsPpQ=/8x0:4096x2725/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70002129/FBxXgMvWUAUanqP.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6’s distinctive look is easy to spot at a distance.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129719782326274" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yqjx77"&gt;We’re just a few days away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;Google’s October 19th launch event&lt;/a&gt; for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, but if you want an early look at what to expect, you might want to check out this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129643542519811"&gt;big thread of leaked images&lt;/a&gt; from prolific leaker Evan Blass. The thread includes what appear to be official renders of both phones, images of cases, and some photos of people using the phones — and it’s that last category of images that were the most interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KptRwm"&gt;Ever since early rumored renders of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446078/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-specs-camera-screen"&gt;Pixel 6 lineup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447011/google-pixel-6-leaks-renders-pics-specs"&gt;hit the web&lt;/a&gt;, I wondered exactly why Google decided to make the massive camera bar across the back of both phones. It never really appealed to me, and since the bar isn’t flush with the back of the phones, I’ve been worried it’s going to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A year later, Apple’s MagSafe continues to underwhelm </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The watch charger flips up so you can use the Apple Watch in nightstand mode." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P6OOA5yf8u1He-TS4NYA6S22rRU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70002069/dbohn_201109_4283_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QxPh0J"&gt;One year ago yesterday, I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21515490/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-accessories-ecosystem"&gt;how MagSafe could be the biggest reason to buy an iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;. I believed it, too. It looked like Apple had cracked the code to effortlessly accessorize the iPhone and even add modular new capabilities. The company showed its pricey new MagSafe cases and wallets seemingly snapping into place, plus faster wireless charging. The future looked bright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzRPOV"&gt;But if you became an early adopter like me, you might have wound up disappointed. As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1449111887388549126"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, two of Apple’s first overpriced MagSafe accessories are already out of date. First, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/15/magsafe-duo-apple-watch-series-7-no-fast-charge/"&gt;we just learned Friday&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s $129 MagSafe Duo Charger can’t fast-charge an Apple Watch Series 7. Second, Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674261/apple-iphone-leather-wallet-magsafe-find-my-tracking"&gt;already replaced the $59 MagSafe...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Treasury says ransomware payouts in 2021 could top entire past decade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VY5KvL-tDj5ek3mNZdkCAASbQ60=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70002018/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7nJRIU"&gt;The ransomware business is booming this year and could be bringing in billions for some of its top players, according to &lt;a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/ransomware-trends-bank-secrecy-act-data-between-january-2021-and-june-2021"&gt;a report released&lt;/a&gt; by the US Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN (&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/treasury-said-it-tied-5-2-billion-in-btc-transactions-to-ransomware-payments/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The report analyzed the massive growth in ransomware payments in the first half of 2021 by looking at suspicious activity reports from financial institutions and was even able to estimate how much some hacking groups were making by analyzing blockchain transactions linked to their wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BI3REj"&gt;The report found that reports of suspicious ransomware-related transactions totaled around $590 million from January 2021 to June 2021. One of the most shocking numbers in the report is that the top 10 hacking groups have...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve bans blockchain games and NFTs on Steam, Epic will try to make it work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQwrFGXtUrMP0sAp8zX80GVAeBc=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000611/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IVcxLA"&gt;Games that use blockchain technology or let users exchange NFTs or cryptocurrencies won’t be allowed on Steam, according to a rule added to &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding"&gt;Valve’s “What you shouldn’t publish on Steam” list&lt;/a&gt;. The change &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713803680473089"&gt;was pointed out by SpacePirate&lt;/a&gt;, a developer working on an NFT-based game, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713807312801796?s=20"&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt; that the change was because the company doesn’t allow game items that could have real-world value. But Steam could also be avoiding controversy with the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2VLSl"&gt;Steam is one of the most well-known PC game stores, but it’s not the only one. While Epic’s CEO Tim Sweeney has said that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696978/epic-tim-sweeney-nft-scam-concerns-web-3"&gt;isn’t interested in touching NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, that policy doesn’t seem to apply to games in its store: &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22493091"&gt;Epic told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “open” to the idea of games that use NFTs or...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="i37MNz"&gt;Epic tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s “open to games that support cryptocurrency or blockchain-based assets” on its game store, unlike its competitor Valve which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust"&gt;has banned games that feature blockchain technology or NFTs from Steam&lt;/a&gt;. When we asked about allowing games that featured NFTs, Epic told us there’d be some limitations, but that it’s willing to work with “early developers” in the “new field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wydB5N"&gt;Epic says that the games would have to comply with financial laws, make it clear how the blockchain is used, and have appropriate age ratings. It also says that developers won’t be able to use Epic’s payment service to accept crypto; they would have to use their own payment systems instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZUyCOD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic will clarify its rules in the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id="mG8wnh"&gt;McDonald’s new plant-based burger, aptly named the McPlant, is coming to eight restaurants across the US (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/mcdonalds-to-test-mcplant-which-includes-its-own-meat-free-burger-next-year-beyond-meat-shares-fall.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The fast-food chain teamed up with Beyond Meat to make the meatless option. This comes about a year after McDonald’s ended its P.L.T. pilot, another Beyond Meat branded burger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9VN7a"&gt;It’s still unclear what the differences are between the McPlant and the P.L.T., other than the name. A &lt;a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/ourstories.mcplant-usrestaurant.html"&gt;post on McDonald’s website&lt;/a&gt; says that the McPlant patty will contain peas, rice, and potatoes and will also be topped with tomatoes, lettuce, onions, pickles, mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and American cheese. That sounds a lot like the P.L.T., but we won’t really know until the start of its test on November 3rd. It’s also important to note that the...&lt;/p&gt;
