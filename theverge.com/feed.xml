  &lt;p id="dvAANe"&gt;Ironically, if you’re looking for Apple discounts this Black Friday season, you won’t find them at Apple, even if the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/shopping-event"&gt;bundling Apple gift cards with almost all of its latest products&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t fear, however, as there are plenty of reliable third-party retailers like Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Best Buy that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwzsMr"&gt;Many of these retailers started discounting some of the most popular Apple products ahead of Black Friday, dropping prices on everything from the latest MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch Series 7.  Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals we’ve found by category, and we’ll continue to update this piece as more deals are published.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="n6ej8I"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/collection/offers?hl=en-US"&gt;launched its Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s a lot to like if you’re in the market for a Pixel, Chromecast, or Nest device. The search giant kicked off the deals in the Google Store early, and now many of the big-name retailers are offering equivalent deals on the same items. Google even advertises these deals as running until December 1st, a few days after Cyber Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShDHRU"&gt;By now there are many great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; to consider, and in addition to our retailer-specific roundups for sales at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22783434/target-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday-tech-games"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784145/amazon-black-friday-2021-best-deals-tech-cyber-monday"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re starved for ideas on what to shop for, we also have a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"&gt;gift guides&lt;/a&gt; for you to check out.&lt;/p&gt;
