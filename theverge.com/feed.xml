    <title>Google shares its commitment to Matter, promises future interoperability between smart home platforms  </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="In8SuQ"&gt;Google gave a glimpse into how the new smart home standard Matter might actually work in our smart homes today, and it’s looking pretty exciting. At its &lt;a href="https://eventsonair.withgoogle.com/events/smarthomesummit2021?utm_campaign=Q3_2021_SHS"&gt;Google Smart Home Developer Summit&lt;/a&gt; today, the company announced new tools to help developers build devices that work with both Google Home, the new connectivity standard Matter, and across any other Matter-complaint ecosystems. This means that, yes — one day, very soon — the (new) Nest Thermostat could work in the Apple Home app without the need for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678088/home-assistant-amber-smart-home-hub-specs-release-date-price"&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt; or other workarounds. And if those two can work together, well, anyone can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xu0fn3"&gt;Due to arrive next year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; is an open smart home application protocol that promises to make smart home devices talk to each other no &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; who...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google details extensive phishing campaign targeting YouTubers</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b_ybhS7hjiPTg9VkpneHNsDoli4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026711/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="POLvc0"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/phishing-campaign-targets-youtube-creators-cookie-theft-malware/"&gt;put out a report&lt;/a&gt; detailing a phishing campaign directed at YouTubers, which involved around 15,000 fake accounts and over a million messages to targets. The phishing attempts were carried out by multiple hackers, and the company says it’s recovered around 4,000 accounts since late 2019. The attackers weren’t just trying to get the creators to put their password into a fake website, though — they were trying to infect their computer with malware that would steal their login cookies, which is a much more intensive attack than sending a link and waiting for someone to get sloppy with their passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haAyEl"&gt;YouTube doesn’t publicly say who was recruiting the hackers, only that they were using Russian-language forums to advertise. The...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and Xbox Game Pass on December 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oP_p487HW5Tm7nzfYP9UXAW_d0I=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026536/Among_Us_Hero_JPG.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TsivCO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is arriving on Xbox and PlayStation on December 14th. The popular social deduction game will &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/21/among-us-launching-with-xbox-game-pass-on-december-14/"&gt;also launch on Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; on the same day and be available on Xbox One, Xbox Series S / X, PS4, and PS5 consoles. The announcement comes months after Sony confirmed &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410775/among-us-playstation-4-5-ps4-ps5-ratchet-clank"&gt;coming to its PlayStation consoles&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWaCuk"&gt;Just like on other platforms, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; will support crossplay and online multiplayer across mobile, PC, and now consoles. The only difference between the two console versions is PlayStation players will get access to exclusive &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank-&lt;/em&gt;themed cosmetics. There’s a skin and hat to make your character look like Ratchet, and a pet that looks like Clank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKlpAs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; was a huge hit during the early stages of the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Regulators demand more info about tech payment systems</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;CFBP Director Rohit Chopra&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mx18fp"&gt;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued a series of information-gathering orders on the business practices of major digital payments systems. Orders were issued to Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, PayPal, and Square, the bureau said in an announcement on Thursday morning. Chinese pay systems operated by WeChat and AliPay will also be studied but are not subject to any CFBP orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofUkWp"&gt;Issued as part of the CFPB’s investigative authority, the orders are not an indication of specific wrongdoing, but they suggest the CFBP will be taking a more active role in regulating tech companies’ consumer products in the future. In particular, they are meant to root out any data collection or anti-competitive conduct that may have not yet come...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google lowers Play Store fees for subscriptions and music streaming apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2eHIgJEzxbCPY3isq0hfR3ZY7Ag=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026351/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sGWkFg"&gt;As regulatory pressure on the Play Store for Android increases, Google is once again making changes to its business structure. It has announced that more categories of apps will be eligible to pay significantly less than the usual 30 percent fee. The company is announcing that all subscription-based apps will now pay a fee of 15 percent. It’s also says that “ebooks and on-demand music streaming services” will be “eligible” for a fee “as low as 10%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6rhMj"&gt;Google’s stated reason for the cheaper prices on ebooks and music streaming apps is that “content costs account for the majority of sales” and that the rates “recognize industry economics of media content verticals.” It’s unstated but also surely true that regulatory pressure and public...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will make it easier to separate your work and personal life on Android </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vWQON"&gt;Google’s Work Profile tool for Android, which lets you hide your work apps and data with the flip of a switch and keeps your personal phone use safe from your company, will be coming to more users next year. According to a blog post from the company, currently, the feature is limited to phones that your organization manages, but Google says it’ll start to become available to people using Google Workspace in 2022. After that, it’ll branch out with the ultimate goal of letting anyone using Android for work flip a switch to make their business apps disappear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJfnme"&gt;The ability to turn off work, especially when many of us are working remotely, is sorely needed. My colleague Monica Chin recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671697/personal-laptop-work-security-privacy"&gt;wrote a great argument&lt;/a&gt; for why you should have a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter bought a messaging app to help make DMs and Communities better</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Ssgqa"&gt;In an effort to strengthen its Communities, Twitter has acquired Sphere, a group chat app founded in 2016 that aims to make conversations more interactive and organized. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but &lt;a href="https://www.sphere.me/"&gt;Sphere’s website&lt;/a&gt; describes the app as a place that “transforms groups into vibrant communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XsP8Y"&gt;Sphere was co-founded in 2016 by &lt;a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/nick-daloisio"&gt;Nick D’Aloisio, a British computer programmer turned serial entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, it was an app for real-time questions and answers but later evolved into a hub for group chats (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/twitter-buys-nick-daloisios-free-chat-app-sphere-.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;). During Sphere’s standalone existence, it aimed to bring organization to group conversations on mobile. As shown on Sphere’s website, some of its features included self-clearing feeds, auto-archiving, and call-outs...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Critics and supporters come out in force to discuss SpaceX’s plans to launch from South Texas</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLINNc"&gt;This week, a vibrant mixture of supporters and critics voiced their opinions about SpaceX’s launch operations in Boca Chica, Texas during virtual town halls — input that will be considered as the government decides the company’s future in the state. More than one hundred people took the time to give their thoughts during the meetings on Monday and Wednesday, with opinions ranging from effusive praise of the company to concerns over SpaceX’s impact on the region’s communities and environment. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcxSBL"&gt;The lengthy town halls were &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/"&gt;hosted by the Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently evaluating whether to give SpaceX a license to launch the company’s massive new Starship rocket out of Boca Chica.

  &lt;p id="rejspL"&gt;Best Buy’s deal of the day for today &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPOcS1owyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;features a range of Razer products&lt;/a&gt; worth considering for any of your gaming or streaming needs, and Amazon is matching or beating some of these prices. If retailers are competing, you’re probably winning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a49Jgq"&gt;There are multiple options of keyboards and mice, as well as the top-range webcam from Razer and its compact microphone. For your mechanical keyboard fix, you can go big or small. If you prefer compact, you can pick between black or white versions of Razer’s Huntsman Mini 60-percent boards with clicky optical switches for just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPOazpadJ7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$95 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08BFF4C7J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$94 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. A small-format keyboard might be intimidating at first, with its omission of a number pad and F-keys, but it allows you to keep your hands...&lt;/p&gt;
