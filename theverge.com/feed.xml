    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K5Dv2a"&gt;Toyota said Thursday that it would &lt;a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/35741389.html"&gt;reduce production&lt;/a&gt; in Japan and North America due to a shortage of semiconductor chips, a sign that even the best-run supply chains are being affected by the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKGkL0"&gt;In Japan, the automaker will reduce production by 40 percent later this month and into September, which will affect most of its production lines, the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toyota-succumbs-to-chip-shortage-and-shuts-factories-11629372702"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;; planned reductions in North America will be between 40 and 60 percent in August. The reductions mean Toyota will produce between 60,000 and 90,000 fewer vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1epYY8"&gt;“Due to COVID-19 and unexpected events with our supply chain, Toyota is experiencing additional shortages that will affect production at most of our North American plants,” the company said in a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google secretly had a giant gaming vision that includes bringing games to Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8e0lvTg4_7XY1PRHup94yeOgtro=/0x0:1211x807/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748239/google_gameplan_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zaoG72"&gt;Apple’s Mac has long been an afterthought for the video game industry, and few think of Google as a games company — despite running Android, one of the biggest game platforms in the world. But Google had a plan to change those things in October 2020, according to an explicitly confidential 70-page vision document dubbed “Games Futures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RrPgnN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Iraou7"&gt;The “need-to-know” document, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"&gt;caught up in the discovery process&lt;/a&gt; when Epic Games hauled Apple into court, reveals a tentative five-year plan to create what Google dubbed “the world’s largest games platform.” Google imagined presenting game developers with a single place they can target gamers across multiple screens including Windows and Mac, as well as smart displays — all tied together by...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new Foundation trailer has some serious ‘Game of Thrones but in space’ energy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htOt2NDjRXJQdtwzpsiCqOGmHiw=/0x32:1828x1251/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748186/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_8.52.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="miQG7D"&gt;Apple has released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4QYV5GTz7c"&gt;a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, its upcoming epic sci-fi show for Apple TV Plus based on Isaac Asimov’s series of novels, and I’m getting some serious “&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;but in space”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;energy from it. There are vast (space) vistas, a sweeping soundtrack, numerous shots of people making very serious faces, and dramatic proclamations that wouldn’t be out of place in an early episode of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B82vBj"&gt;“Wars will be endless.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OZiHUh"&gt;“Martyrs tend to have a long half-life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DRso2D"&gt;“Change is frightening. Especially to those in power.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DDrqms"&gt;And you know what? That’s fine with me. For me, nothing has replicated the excellence of the first few seasons of &lt;em&gt;Game of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Thrones. &lt;/em&gt;Their gripping action, shocking twists, and captivating power struggles made...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC says Facebook has been a monopoly ‘since at least 2011’ in amended antitrust complaint</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auMO0T"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has filed &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21045875-facebook-revised-ftc-complaint"&gt;an amended antitrust complaint against Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that the company violated federal antitrust laws with its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. The new complaint is a more detailed version of a charge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;dismissed by the court in June&lt;/a&gt; for insufficient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iF9MNw"&gt;“Facebook has today, and has maintained since 2011, a dominant share of the relevant market for US personal social networking services,” the complaint alleges, citing time spent and active-user metrics on the daily and monthly scale. “Individually and collectively, these metrics provide significant evidence of Facebook’s durable monopoly power in social networking services.”&lt;/p&gt;

The event, which will be held at Tesla’s headquarters in Palo Alto, CA, &lt;a href="https://livestream.tesla.com/"&gt;will be livestreamed for the public&lt;/a&gt; starting at 5PM PT / 8PM ET (though the event may not actually begin until closer to 5:30PM PT). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O23w6E"&gt;We don’t have a lot of details about what will be announced, but based on the invitation, we’ll get a keynote address by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, hardware and software demos from Tesla engineers, test rides in the Model S Plaid, and “more.” Musk has also tweeted that the “sole goal” of the event is to lure experts in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence to come work at Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Battery power capacity in the US grew big time in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electric Cooperative Connexus Energy Builds Minnesota’s First Large-Scale Energy Storage System" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVor0NaPIkGzDpZ47Cxa1cUOFLs=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747812/1031531618.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qibmO"&gt;2020 was a big year for big batteries in the US, which is crucial for getting grids to run on more renewable energy. Power capacity — a measure of how much power a battery can instantly discharge — for large-scale batteries grew at an unprecedented pace in the US last year, according to an annual &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/electricity/batterystorage/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released this week by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HmkjbJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2020 smashed the previous record set in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NcHGs2"&gt;2020 smashed the previous record set in 2018 for the biggest growth in power capacity in the US with 489MW of large-scale battery storage added. That’s more than twice what was added in 2018. By the end of last year, there was 1,523MW of large-scale battery power capacity in the US. For comparison, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.sunpower.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fcs-solar-star-projects-fact-sheet_0.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F19%2F22632172%2Flarge-battery-power-capacity-us-grew-2020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;largest solar farm in...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New test brings Reels to Facebook in the US</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FaJ78t"&gt;Facebook in the US is going to look slightly more like TikTok for some users. Today, the company announced that it’s testing Facebook Reels stateside, which will bring the short-form, TikTok-like videos to the platform. These will show up for some users in the News Feed and within Groups, where people can watch them together. (The company is already testing this in India, Mexico, and Canada, and the US limited rollout is just an extension of that test.) As part of this test, Instagram users will also be able to cross-post their reels to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQPzK6"&gt;People can watch and create reels from the Facebook app, and the feature is designed to give people a way to “express themselves, discover entertaining content, and to help creators broaden...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird’s new electric bike looks like a VanMoof, and you can buy it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOa7dvbK3ONJOkWD_U_R-7_CzgQ=/0x1:2468x1646/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747472/Bird_Bike_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pL41Q1"&gt;Shared electric scooter company Bird is branching out into new two-wheeled vehicles, namely electric bikes. A few months after it introduced its first shared e-bike, the company announced that it would also offer its own e-bike for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="te7Fvp"&gt;The bike, dubbed Bird Bike of course, has a 500W rear hub motor, a Gates carbon belt drive, pedal- and throttle-assisted power, and the relatively modest sticker price of $2,299. Design-wise, the bike looks very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof’s popular e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;, with a slightly elongated top tube and embedded front and rear lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7P65L1"&gt;Bird, which was the first company to introduce shared electric scooters in a US city, has always flirted with the idea of e-bikes. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20926658/bird-scoot-electric-moped-la-cruiser-specs-speed"&gt;first rolled out its Scoot-branded electric...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
