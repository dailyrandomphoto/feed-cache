    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rzQIrV"&gt;Amazon is hosting a wide variety of tech deals for Cyber Monday. The company started its deal festivities early by knocking down prices for many of its own devices, including some of its newer products that hadn’t yet seen any discounts. The fourth-generation Echo smart speaker, the latest Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi routers, and more are all discounted right now, in addition to several other Amazon devices, such as the company’s entire range of Fire TV streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7OYsE"&gt;We’ll be including the best deals we find below. The latest deals to hit the wire will be at the top, while the others will be organized by category. If your search for gifts spans wider than what Amazon has in stock, check out our other coverage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;the best Cyber Monday deals...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXFrPb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583104/early-cyber-monday-deals-sales-tech-laptops-tvs-earbuds"&gt;Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; is a good time of the year to consider upgrading your phone. Whether you’re looking for a deal through a carrier or you’d rather get an unlocked phone, you can save during the holiday season. The best deals on phones are on Android devices, including newer models from Google, Samsung, OnePlus, and more. Predictably, these big price cuts don’t apply to iPhones. Nothing new there, but there is a gift card promo happening if you are interested in picking one up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMRuMl"&gt;Below, you’ll find the best deals we’ve found so far. If you buy an unlocked phone, there won’t be any strings attached to the purchase. If we include a carrier promotion, we’ll be sure to thoroughly list out each requirement necessary to get the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Cyber Monday deals on noise-canceling headphones</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WmMrK3"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones are an important piece of tech if you enjoy having zero distractions or outside noise while you jam to funky tunes or listen to podcasts. And, as you might have expected, Cyber Monday is a good time to invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC95lA"&gt;While not as convenient as popping earbuds into your ears, noise-canceling headphones do a better job of erasing sound distractions when stacked up against popular wireless earbuds like Apple’s AirPods Pro or Jabra’s 75t. But if you prefer earbuds over headphones, we have rounded up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611428/black-friday-earbuds-deals-wireless-cyber-monday"&gt;the best wireless earbud deals this Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVgfg2"&gt;We are picking out all of the best deals going on right now on several brands that offer noise-canceling headphones. If you want more deals for other tech categories, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;check...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhitJa"&gt;During Cyber Monday this year, you can expect to find many of the best wireless earbuds on sale for their lowest prices yet. Apple’s AirPods Pro, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus, and other popular models from Jabra, Sony, 1More, and more companies have never been more affordable. If you haven’t yet treated yourself to a set of truly wireless earbuds that connect via Bluetooth, prepare to never look back to using wired earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAI1eM"&gt;We have collected deals across multiple retailers below, and they’re all significantly lower than their usual asking price. As new deals become available or go out of stock, we’ll update this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tdoco8"&gt;If you’re looking for even more Cyber Monday deals, be sure to check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21579415/black-friday-best-deals-sales-tech-headphones-gaming-tvs-laptops"&gt;continuously updated roundup&lt;/a&gt; with all of the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple fined €10M by Italian watchdog over iPhone waterproofing claims</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xnOK2n"&gt;The Italian Competition Authority, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato or AGCM, has fined Apple €10 million (around $12 million) for making misleading claims about the waterproofing of its iPhones, &lt;a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-italy-apple-antitrust/italys-antitrust-fines-apple-10-million-euros-for-misleading-commercial-practices-idUKKBN28A0OH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Affected iPhone models go back to 2017’s iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otrdLk"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2020/11/PS11578"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the AGCM criticized Apple for not being clear enough about its water resistance claims. It said that claims about iPhones being water resistant for up to 30 minutes at depths of up to four meters only apply in certain circumstances like controlled lab tests with pure water. The regulator also criticized Apple’s disclaimer that said water damage is not covered as part of the iPhone’s warranty, despite marketing the phones’ water...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PvCD0L"&gt;Best Buy was one of the first retailers to launch Black Friday deals — all the way back in mid-October to go up against Amazon Prime Day. Now that Cyber Monday is essentially here, Best Buy is back with a bunch of great sales that you can take advantage of. And, you can do all of your shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7NDsp"&gt;Below, you’ll find the best deals currently happening at Best Buy.

As new deals come out, we’ll add those to the top so you can see them easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66OMsk"&gt;Latest deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="hjBsWu"&gt;You don’t often see iPads on sale, even on Cyber Monday, but Best Buy has &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725227826478218776" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the latest model of the iPad mini&lt;/a&gt; with WiFi and 64GB for $300, which is $100 off its usual...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7QychB"&gt;Cyber Monday is here. It’s the last big shopping opportunity of 2020, and if you didn’t already take advantage of some deals that debuted over the weekend, now’s your chance. Every retailer has debuted at least a few new deals earlier than ever, and we’re focused on adding them here — in addition to the great Black Friday deals you can still get. As you’re expecting, there are some great deals on gaming laptops, wireless noise-canceling headphones, earbuds, tablets, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHCSuC"&gt;We’ll be doing our best to keep this post updated during Cyber Monday, and stay tuned throughout Cyber Week as we give you as many chances as possible to get everything on your holiday wish list. We’ve put the latest deals right at the top for easy viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5VU3Q"&gt;It’s rare that Apple slashes the prices on its own products. Fortunately, other retailers are putting a lot of Apple products on sale for Cyber Monday. A bunch of retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Walmart, and Woot are slashing the prices on everything from wearables to its wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIuihu"&gt;Additionally, the online Apple store will have a special promotion on Friday, November 27th, and running until Monday, November 30th. The promotion will allow &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you to get up to $150 in an Apple gift card&lt;/a&gt; if you purchase an eligible product during the four-day event as listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VKYPYw"&gt;Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy an &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-3#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wOJmIA"&gt;Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy AirPods (&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMRXJ2%2Fairpods-with-wireless-charging-case#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wireless&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMV7N2%2Fairpods-with-charging-case#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wired case&lt;/a&gt;) or a pair of &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMWP22AM%2FA%2Fairpods-pro#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;....&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Oculus has discounted VR games and experiences for Cyber Monday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h57TNlXGCIXIEMaQU7YvF9DV-TQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67988648/akrales_200904_4160_0390.0.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AUmEQY"&gt;Oculus is hosting a big sale on virtual reality games and experiences for Cyber Monday. There are plenty of standalone deals if you just want one or two titles, but Oculus has also curated several bundles, each one on a different theme. Those will help you save the most money, and Oculus will dock the cost if you already own one of the titles. What’s more, you can gift titles to other people from the Oculus store, too. You’ll just need their email address when checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZcS8g"&gt;According to Oculus, all of the games in the bundles below will work with Quest standalone headsets. Be aware, though, that only some of them support cross-buy, meaning one purchase will work both as a standalone app on Quest and when wired to your PC via Oculus Link....&lt;/p&gt;
