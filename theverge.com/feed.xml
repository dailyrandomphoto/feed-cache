    <title>Facebook reportedly plans newsletter tools after explosion in popularity</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bXjWLC"&gt;Facebook is planning to offer newsletter tools for independent journalists and writers, &lt;a href="https://nyti.ms/36hBCTB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. These are thought to include features for helping writers build a following using the social network, curate their email lists, and manage their paid subscriptions. Although work on the project is in its early stages, executives reportedly hope the features could launch as soon as this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QhuRK"&gt;The news comes as interest in newsletters is booming. Newsletter service Substack boasted over 250,000 paying subscribers across its service &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/pandemic-spurs-journalists-to-go-it-alone-via-email-613ca2d5-e8d5-4235-9582-48cc028e9d8b.html"&gt;as of September last year&lt;/a&gt;, and just this week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;Twitter acquired newsletter rival Revue&lt;/a&gt;. A number of high-profile journalists have left traditional publications to start up independent newsletters,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal adds mainstream chat features to lure wider audience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Signal logo seen in the background of a silhouette hand holding a mobile phone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jcEQ4AyHaakar8q2gQvAHxBEqrU=/0x1:5000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68738816/1230608869.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DouYvU"&gt;The latest version of Signal for both iOS (5.3.1) and Android (5.3.7) brings a number of new additions to the increasingly popular encrypted messaging app. These include mainstream features like chat wallpapers, animated stickers, and an “About” section in your profile. The iOS app now handles data more efficiently, too, bringing it closer to feature parity with the Android app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTogdR"&gt;Messaging apps like Signal and Telegram have seen a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;surge in growth&lt;/a&gt; in recent weeks. Signal was helped by a recommendation from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, while both benefited from the backlash to Facebook’s confusing new privacy policy for WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYCe93"&gt;The new features were first announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1348785240819466242"&gt;on January 11th&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; reported on them rolling out in the beta...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi says its ‘Air Charge’ technology works over several meters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-sAPh7Ly0LkMErzbgevFocGK60=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68738358/Lark20210129_110714.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RArVhf"&gt;Xiaomi has &lt;a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/01/29/forget-about-cables-and-charging-stands-with-revolutionary-mi-air-charge-technology/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; “Mi Air Charge Technology,” a wireless charging system that the company claims is able to charge devices “within a radius of several meters.” Multiple devices can be charged at 5W at the same time, according to Xiaomi, and physical obstacles apparently don’t reduce charging efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX2fpH"&gt;Xiaomi says the technology will also work with smartwatches and fitness bracelets. Another goal is to make “living rooms truly wireless,” with speakers, lamps, and smart home devices all being powered by the same remote system. A Xiaomi representative confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, however, that no commercial products will include the technology this year, and declined to provide a timeframe for release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzrwjL"&gt;Here’s how Mi Air Charge Technology...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome to Twitter, Jon Stewart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jon Stewart anti social network" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9s9-6K0bIJs8vewnvuJ7SqBP6Wo=/0x19:400x286/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68737853/jon-stewart.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V8kEiG"&gt;Jon Stewart has just joined Twitter, and is now the proud owner of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jon_actual/"&gt;a verified account&lt;/a&gt;. And, of course, his first tweet was about the redditors on r/WallStreetBets and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254857/robinhood-gamestop-amc-shares-sold-surprised-users"&gt;their stonks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqdUdU"&gt;While it may be the first time he’s made an appearance on Twitter, Stewart is already fitting right in — with a profile picture that’s not actually of him, but a dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9WFixW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is bullshit. The Redditors aren't cheating, they're joining a party Wall Street insiders have been enjoying for years. Don't shut them down...maybe sue them for copyright infringement instead!!&lt;br&gt;We've learned nothing from 2008.&lt;br&gt;Love&lt;br&gt;StewBeef&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Stewart (@jon_actual) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jon_actual/status/1354901018564321287?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Robinhood denies claims that it sold GameStop shares out from under its traders</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HrSPad"&gt;No, Robinhood tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, it didn’t sell off full shares of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop, AMC, and other buzzy stocks&lt;/a&gt; without permission from its traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9qz0P"&gt;That contradicts the stories of twelve people who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;saying that the app unexpectedly sold off their holdings in some of these companies. Quite a number of Robinhood users expressed their surprise on social media today that the app was selling off their stakes, and we tracked down a dozen of them. These traders didn’t believe they had prompted the sales, and they said they weren’t aware of anything on their account that would have automatically triggered them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZTzgT"&gt;“I didn’t have any triggers to sell the stock whether it went up or down. I certainly wouldn’t have put it at $197 when...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>University will stop using controversial remote-testing software following student outcry</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UEgGHl"&gt;The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign &lt;a href="https://emails.illinois.edu/newsletter/1970177238.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will discontinue its use of remote-proctoring software Proctorio after its summer 2021 term. The decision follows almost a year of outcry over the service, both on UIUC’s campus and around the US, citing concerns with privacy, discrimination, and accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGBLzk"&gt;Proctorio is one of the most prominent software platforms that colleges and universities use to watch for cheating on remote tests. It uses what its website describes as “machine learning and advanced facial detection technologies” to record students through their webcams while they work on their exams and monitor the position of their heads. The software flags “suspicious signs” to professors, who can review its...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google salvaged Robinhood’s one-star rating by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SIPC Says It Has Serious Concerns About Robinhood’s New Product" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzgdUXSF7n4v7Fn6C3gfNJZwkN4=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68737535/1073282662.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ryz6V1"&gt;Google is actively removing negative reviews of the Robinhood app from the Google Play Store, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;After some disgruntled Robinhood users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7001b/do_your_part_tank_robinhoods_rating_in_the_app/"&gt;organized&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hamiolhs/status/1354789899510149125?s=21"&gt;campaigns&lt;/a&gt; to give the app a one-star review on Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store — and succeeded in review-bombing it all the way down to a one-star rating — the company has now deleted enough reviews to bring it back up to nearly four stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLWSRC"&gt;Robinhood came under intense scrutiny on Thursday, after the stock trading app announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;it would block purchases of GameStop, AMC, and other stocks&lt;/a&gt; made popular by the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, and some users have already replaced their deleted one-star reviews with new ones to make their anger heard.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="XwP73j"&gt;An upcoming change to Google’s Play Store policies will allow gambling and betting Android apps that use real money in 15 more countries, including the US, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/28/google-play-android-gambling-apps/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, gambling apps are only allowed in &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9877032"&gt;four countries&lt;/a&gt;: Brazil, France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gA1zel"&gt;The new rules will be applied starting on March 1st, and they’ll permit gambling apps in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and the United States. Of course, each country will have its own limitations on what kind of online gambling is legal, with some countries allowing online casinos, sports betting, lotteries, and daily fantasy sports, and some being more...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qepgyE"&gt;Epic Games Store released a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2020-year-in-review"&gt;bevy of stats&lt;/a&gt; to show off how its game storefront grew in 2020 compared to 2019, its launch year. It announced that there are over 160 million accounts now on PC, up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064951/epic-game-store-users-number-cross-play-revenue-valve-steam"&gt;108 million users registered in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It almost doubled in monthly active users from 32 million in December 2019 to 56 million last month. Epic also saw its daily active user count go up to 31.3 million, which the company claims is a 192 percent boost. Its peak concurrent player count hit 13 million in 2020, almost doubling its 7 million peak in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVJUlj"&gt;Unsurprising to no one, giving away free games each week is a nice way to keep people coming back to your storefront. (It also helps when your store is the sole provider of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on PC.)...&lt;/p&gt;
