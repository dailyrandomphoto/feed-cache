    <title>Amazon moves Lord of the Rings production from New Zealand to UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_e5wH4q-rAacHmZ4H3hoQEDZiyQ=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69719401/1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FkkSYF"&gt;Amazon has decided to produce its upcoming &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; TV series in the UK from the second season on. Although the first season was filmed in New Zealand, as with Peter Jackson’s movies, Amazon now says pre-production on season two will begin early next year in the UK while season one post-production continues in New Zealand through June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMyMf0"&gt;It’s not clear exactly where the series will be shot. Amazon is shipping the complex sets it built for the first season over to the UK and is currently booking stages for them, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/the-lord-of-the-rings-season-2-move-production-uk-new-zealand-1234813857/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company films several Prime Video series in the UK already, including Neil Gaiman adaptations &lt;em&gt;Good Omens &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Anansi Boys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2CW97"&gt;The move to the UK won’t be without controversy. Author J.R.R. Tolkien...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Immunocompromised people can get third COVID-19 vaccine shot, FDA says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZnPpd"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration will allow people with compromised immune systems to get a third dose of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-vaccine-dose-certain-immunocompromised"&gt;amended the emergency use authorizations&lt;/a&gt; for each vaccine to allow this specific group of people to get an extra shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7LCSf"&gt;Usually, the standard two doses are enough for a person to generate plenty of antibodies to fight off the coronavirus. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619963/third-dose-covid-vaccine-transplant-nih-study"&gt;research done&lt;/a&gt; over the past few months shows that many immunocompromised people make too few antibodies or none at all. A third dose might give some of those patients the boost they need to produce antibodies. French officials have been recommending those patients get a third shot since April. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jake Paul will not face federal charges after FBI raid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jake Paul v Tyron Woodley - Press Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DIp1tl09KynejmlKRIlpGcg_yes=/0x0:3433x2289/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69718589/1328568943.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Katelyn Mulcahy/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6nhD7h"&gt;The US Attorney won’t be filing any charges against Jake Paul, according &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/08/12/jake-paul-no-federal-charges-arizona-mall-incident-george-floyd-protest-scottsdale-looting/"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;TMZ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by Paul’s lawyers. Paul &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366407/jake-paul-fbi-raid-comment-arizona-looting-absurd-rumors"&gt;was being investigated by the FBI&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356047/jake-paul-fbi-federal-search-warrant-house-raided-guns"&gt;raided his house&lt;/a&gt;, for his involvement in an incident that took place at an Arizona mall in May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tuxpr"&gt;These particular legal troubles began when Paul was filmed in and around a mall in Scottsdale, AZ, which was being looted in the wake of police brutality protests sparked by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529934/darnella-frazier-filmed-george-floyd-murder-phone-pulitzer-prize-citation"&gt;the murder of George Floyd&lt;/a&gt;. Paul denied participating in the looting (and wasn’t seen doing so in the videos that circulated on social media), but was still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280476/jake-paul-arizona-protests-riots-youtube-filming-scottsdale"&gt;charged with criminal trespassing and unlawful assembly&lt;/a&gt; by the Scottsdale Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amid Black Widow lawsuit, Disney boss defends its pandemic release strategy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvwgHB"&gt;Following a high-stakes lawsuit over Disney’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;day-and-date release&lt;/a&gt; of Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; on its Premier Access streaming platform and the company’s compensation of the film’s star Scarlett Johansson, the head of Disney today defended both the company’s payouts to talent as well as its decisions around various pandemic movie releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFRDSq"&gt;During the company’s third-quarter earnings call, Disney boss Bob Chapek explained the company’s multi-pronged approach to releasing its films throughout the pandemic, which included theatrical exclusives, straight-to-digital releases on Disney Plus, and a hybrid of both that saw films debut on Disney’s paid Premier Access platform the same day they premiered in theaters. Premier Access was chosen as the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s $1.5 billion Air Hub opens in Kentucky to speed up deliveries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YNFI2Y"&gt;Your Amazon packages may be getting an express ticket — &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/welcome-to-the-amazon-air-hub"&gt;Amazon has finished building&lt;/a&gt; its $1.5 billion air hub, located at the Cincinnati / Northern Kentucky International Airport, and has started operations there. Amazon started building the 800,000-square-foot facility in 2019, and it now boasts robots, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-air-hub-kentucky-photos-2021-8#amazon-air-hub-is-situated-on-600-acres-at-the-cincinnatinorthern-kentucky-international-airport-1"&gt;miles of conveyor belts&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZPRh7"&gt;A big benefit of having a centrally located place to process packages and get them on planes is speed — that’s why UPS has a hub in Louisville, Kentucky; FedEx ships many packages through Memphis, Tenessee; and DHL has a hub in the same airport as Amazon. Amazon’s press release says that the cargo hub will help with the “rapid transport of customer packages throughout the U.S.” Jeff Bezos also made that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook shouldn't be allowed to buy Giphy, says UK regulator</title>

  &lt;p id="3bzKu1"&gt;15 months ago, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21259965/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-buy-instagram-integration-cost"&gt;said it was buying&lt;/a&gt; the popular GIF search engine Giphy for about $400 million. Now the acquisition may be a bust, thanks to an antitrust probe by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xT3GUM"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/facebook-s-takeover-of-giphy-raises-competition-concerns"&gt;preliminary findings report&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday, the CMA said the deal should be unwound because it will “negatively impact competition between social media platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qRjSJ"&gt;The CMA’s reasoning for wanting to block the Giphy deal is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VedAea"&gt;“Millions of posts every day on social media sites now include a GIF. Any reduction in the choice or quality of these GIFs could significantly affect how people use these sites and whether or not they switch to a different platform, such as Facebook. As most major social media sites that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple updates Eddy Cue’s title to better reflect its turn to services</title>

    <title>Facebook office return delayed until 2022 in the US</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VZyTmX"&gt;Specifically citing concerns about a rise in cases of the delta variant of COVID-19, Facebook confirmed a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-12/facebook-delays-return-to-offices-until-2022-for-u-s-employees?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report that it has pushed back plans for US workers to return to the office until next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kKTbOX"&gt;Data, not dates, is what drives our approach for returning to the office. Given the recent health data showing rising Covid cases based on the Delta variant, our teams in the US will not be required to go back to the office until January 2022. We expect this to be the case for some countries outside of the US, as well. We continue to monitor the situation and work with experts to ensure our return to office plans prioritize everyone’s safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Bill Gates wants in on Congress’ big climate infrastructure push</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At The One Planet Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kiyzinFBqqIhjkbDFG7FX7RDTvE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69716975/1041349006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Bill Gates, billionaire and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, speaks during the One Planet Summit in New York, U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 26, 2018.  | Mark Kauzlarich/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ELGvZM"&gt;The bipartisan infrastructure deal could unlock a new stream of private funding for climate tech&lt;strong&gt; — &lt;/strong&gt;and Bill Gates wants in on the action. Gates’ climate investment fund says that if the infrastructure bill moves forward, it will match&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;$1.5 billion in government funds and put that money toward projects that are developing green technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
