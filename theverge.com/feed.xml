    <title>Facebook’s next hardware launch will be its Ray-Ban ‘smart glasses’</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What exactly the glasses will look like or how they will function is unclear. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yooLrx"&gt;Facebook’s next hardware launch will be its long-awaited Ray-Ban ‘smart glasses,’ CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed on an &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4442353-facebook-inc-fb-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;earnings call&lt;/a&gt; this week. When exactly the glasses will arrive is unclear. We least heard they were launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;some time in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but the pandemic has changed a lot of companies’ plans, and Zuckerberg did not comment on a time frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9JFX9"&gt;“Looking ahead here, the next product release will be the launch of our first smart glasses from Ray-Ban in partnership with EssilorLuxottica,” said the Facebook CEO. “The glasses have their iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCqRGJ"&gt;We don’t know what those “neat things” are, though Facebook has previously confirmed that the glasses will not have an integrated display...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s first PS5 software beta arrives with M.2 SSD support</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EF8n3w"&gt;Sony’s PS5 system software beta program is starting to roll out today, and it include access to the long-awaited M.2 SSD slot. The first PS5 beta is available for select users in the US, Canada, Japan, UK, Germany, and France. The beta includes some new UX enhancements and customizations, but the biggest addition is M.2 SSD expansion support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NomTWN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/#min"&gt;Sony notes&lt;/a&gt; you’ll need an M.2 SSD that’s PCIe Gen4 and has read speeds of 5,500MB/s or faster. That’s largely what we were expecting, and it means a variety of Gen4 drives will be supported — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price"&gt;Samsung’s 980 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507807/western-digital-wd-first-pcie-4-0-nvme-ssds-sn850"&gt;Western Digital’s SN850s&lt;/a&gt;, and many other modern M.2 SSDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wTApH"&gt;You may need to consider the cooling requirements for using an M.2 SSD in a PS5, though. “Using an M.2 SSD with your PS5...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is kicking ‘sugar dating’ apps out of the Play Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QPDtQrjI9-xa6c9riX4KGHJ_Uho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649143/acastro_180507_1777_android_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LxqE0s"&gt;“Sugar dating” apps will not be allowed on the Android Play Store from September 1st, Google has announced as part of a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9934569?hl=en-GB"&gt;series of policy changes&lt;/a&gt; for the platform. The change, which was &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/28/google-bans-sugar-daddy-apps-from-play-store/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, specifically prohibits apps relating to “compensated sexual relationships.” Other changes coming to the platform include a new crackdown on inactive developer accounts, &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/announcing-policy-updates-to-bolster.html"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRY4sM"&gt;Traditionally, sugar dating relationships involve older, wealthier individuals dating and showering younger partners with gifts. As &lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;notes, there’s no shortage of apps on the Play Store designed around setting up “sugar daddy” relationships. None of them explicitly say that older men are expected to compensate younger women for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bang &amp; Olufsen launches its first pair of noise-canceling true wireless earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beoplay EQ are available in gold (pictured) and black.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bang and Olufsen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ZRuuD"&gt;Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen’s Beoplay EQ are the Danish audio brand’s first pair of noise-canceling true wireless headphones. Two microphones on each earbud handle noise cancellation duties alongside an extra mic for making calls, for a total of six across the two earbuds. They’re releasing globally on August 19th in black and gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rmzn6Q"&gt;At $399 (£359 / €399), the Beoplay EQ are around $50 more expensive than B&amp;amp;O’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/15/21067061/bo-beoplay-e8-true-wireless-earbuds-price-features-sound-bluetooth-aptx"&gt;non-noise-canceling Beoplay E8 earbuds&lt;/a&gt; were at launch. They don’t feature the third-generation E8’s formidable battery life, which tops out at 35 hours of total charge from the earbuds and case combined. Instead, the Beoplay EQ can run for around 20 hours when used with the charging case. Battery life from the earbuds themselves is about the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robot arranges 100,000 dominoes into a Super Mario Bros. mural in one day</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DPuHD"&gt;Engineer and YouTuber Mark Rober has created a robot that can make domino murals at lightning speed, and has shown it off &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HEfIJlcFbs"&gt;with a video of it arranging 100,000 dominoes&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;-themed mural in just over 24 hours. Rober says it would take a team of seven humans a week to do the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOwW73"&gt;The robot, named the “Dominator,” achieves this by putting down 300 dominoes at a time — which are, of course, loaded into it by another robot. Rober says in the video that the current version of the Dominator is the culmination of years of work from him and his team, and he goes into how the device actually works, as well as showing some of the failed designs that led to the final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUL6pl"&gt;If the name Mark Rober rings a bell, it may be...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung boosts profits and pledges to ‘mainstream’ foldables</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OdLFlF"&gt;Samsung Electronics has released its second-quarter earnings, reporting 20 percent higher revenue and 54 percent higher operating profit year-on-year despite its mobile division taking a hit due to component shortages. The company made an operating profit of 12.57 trillion won (~$10.97 billion) off 63.67 trillion won (~$55.56 billion) in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z14TCM"&gt;Samsung says its mobile business suffered from the industry-wide component shortage as well as “production disruptions” in its Vietnam factories, some of which were closed after a COVID outbreak. Combined with weak seasonality resulting in less demand, revenue declined from the previous quarter, though it was still up year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — all of which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release in the fall — and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="xSP5Bs"&gt;Netflix will require the casts and some crew on its productions in the US to be vaccinated against COVID-19, a measure that comes as the Delta variant continues to spread across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2vFJD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/netflix-to-require-covid-vaccinations-for-all-actors-on-us-productions-1234801577/"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; that the streaming giant recently notified its production teams that it would require casts and crew working in “Zone A” on US productions to be vaccinated. &lt;em&gt;Deadline &lt;/em&gt;described this classification as including both cast members and those who are in close contact with them. According to the report, Netflix plans to make few exceptions to the new vaccination policy, with exclusions including age, medical, and religious reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk15Ts"&gt;Netflix confirmed the measure to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; but declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;
