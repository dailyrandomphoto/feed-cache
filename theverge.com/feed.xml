    <title>Netflix is reopening a movie theater in SoCal this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iAeTqRM664350AJr4OVT6ruSm00=/58x0:1618x1040/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012789/PV_BayTheater_ComingSoon_1676x1040_46__5_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lmhAm4"&gt;Netflix will reopen the Bay Theatre at Palisades Village in Southern California beginning October 22nd, becoming the third physical theater with which the streamer has announced a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dj3OQ"&gt;The theater will reopen this weekend with Jeymes Samuel’s &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81077494"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a Western starring Zazie Beetz, Regina King, and Idris Elba, among other notable stars — beginning with multiple showings starting Friday. Adult tickets are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.atomtickets.com%2Fcheckout%2F403661718%23%2Ftickets&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F18%2F22733232%2Fnetflix-movie-theater-bay-palisades-village" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently listed&lt;/a&gt; for $12 each, while discounted and children’s tickets cost $10. Free first-come, first-served tickets to Netflix animated titles &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81199052"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vivo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Mitchells vs. The Machines&lt;/em&gt; will also be available at the box office today through Thursday, October 21st from 3PM to 6PM PT.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where to get the new 14 and 16 inch MacBook Pros</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c1wqsi01nQVfcCWF0ZB0R48QIwo=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012700/1Rm4aV2YiD.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J8SCzS"&gt;As expected, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22488347"&gt;Apple’s “Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; brought a number of new additions to Apple’s lineup, including a pair of new laptops in the form of new versions of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22488779"&gt;14-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-generation of AirPods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Azd3ng"&gt;Both versions of the 2021 MacBook Pro are configurable with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;newly announced M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs&lt;/a&gt;, which build greatly on the improvements made by the M1 CPU that debuted last year. Besides the beefier processor, the new versions of the MacBook Pro have enhanced GPU performance, battery life, and a host of new connectivity options, including a trio of Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI output, and an SD card reader in addition to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733119/apple-new-macbook-pro-magsafe-back"&gt;Magsafe 3 connector&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Listen to the sick Mac sound effect song that Apple opened its keynote with </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uY6Pp8hTo7Xm_ldpHYleUyJF9-g=/284x0:2114x1220/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012561/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_5.41.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zIA9kE"&gt;Apple kicked off its MacBook Pro keynote a little differently today: with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxJpZtp2ItE"&gt;sweet remix of classic Apple sound effects&lt;/a&gt; from the past 45 years of the company’s history, created by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0dvX0R4NEh6cmxKUFFXdDlXT3pxblpjSUVWZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttQmtJOGJHZ1NiTmVBazdlTG80dkV0MnBuQUU0OFhKR3J0RVlpNUZWM0xiNHkySjA2RWRkTnU5SVI0c1psN2tkYnlsY3dxal9JVEtkR2lfdTl6N21UcUlFSGJWbWZKOEc2WWVXSWNsX0FRbU5WTi1USQ&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.co%2FAGCook"&gt;artist A. G. Cook&lt;/a&gt; — using Apple’s Pro Display XDR, MacBook Pro, and Logic Pro, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49Hal6"&gt;The song itself is called “Start Up” and is a surprisingly chill listening experience. The video’s fun, too, featuring a wide array of Apple hardware from throughout the years, including old iBooks and the sadly defunct iPod Hi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bPBWkV"&gt;The full list of sound effects trend toward Apple’s more recent hardware, of course, but there are a few classic Easter eggs, too. The full list of sound effects, provided by Apple, is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="keslCD"&gt;iMac G3 startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WsFibI"&gt;MacBook Pro startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8gUMox"&gt;A...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>How to preorder Apple’s third-gen AirPods</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2hB74cmpCY1wERDLyyuzjgpGmI=/150x0:1749x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012528/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_10.23.57_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s third generation of AirPods will be available on October 26th for $179.&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vQRTjj"&gt;The tech world may be abuzz regarding the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22488779"&gt;14-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22491254"&gt;16-inch MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22435385"&gt;new AirPods&lt;/a&gt; — announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22488347"&gt;Apple’s “Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; today — have also conjured up a storm. Apple has finally announced a new pair of true wireless earbuds set to launch on October 26th for $179, while lowering the price of the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1019575/7613?subId1=Verge3rdGenAirpods101821&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMV7N2AM%2FA%2Fairpods-with-charging-case" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;entry-level AirPods 2 to $129&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZDatb"&gt;As expected, the third-generation AirPods mirror their sleeker sibling, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, mostly in its new design and in some functionality, barring the active noise cancellation. For the first time since 2016, the AirPods include a wider, Pro-like charging case and shorter steams. They also boast Pro features like Adaptive EQ, which customizes your audio experience, and an intuitive force sensor for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly added a MagSafe charging case to its AirPods Pro, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gEqvGhOvHFVtieZ5tn9_1SCciYE=/0x42:2124x1458/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012470/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_2.19.16_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N6gGM1"&gt;Apple just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;announced its third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; with a new charging case that works with its MagSafe magnetic charging system, but the company &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/introducing-the-next-generation-of-airpods/"&gt;also quietly announced&lt;/a&gt; that, starting today, it’ll also be including the new case with its pricier &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLWK3AM/A/airpods-pro"&gt;$250 AirPods Pro model&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Jbgpnx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple announces third-generation AirPods for $179","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jdpqCs"&gt;The new case doesn’t claim to charge Apple’s AirPod products any faster; it just has the magnets needed to attach to Apple’s MagSafe charging puck for easier alignment when charging. AirPods already worked with MagSafe, thanks to the broader Qi charging spec, so it’s more of a slight convenience than anything else, but it's good to see Apple expanding MagSafe to more products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcnnGc"&gt;Unfortunately, Apple also isn’t taking the opportunity here to add a reverse wireless...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new 14-inch MacBook Pro with a notch</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pzYFl7"&gt;Apple has announced a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-14-and-16/"&gt;redesigned MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which now includes a 14-inch screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;Apple’s new M1 Pro and Max chips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;a notch&lt;/a&gt;, squared-off design, and a wider selection of ports in addition to the standard Thunderbolt ones — it brings back the HDMI port and SD card reader and adds a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733119/apple-new-macbook-pro-magsafe-back"&gt;MagSafe 3 connector&lt;/a&gt; for charging (though you can also charge it with the Thunderbolt ports if your house is littered with USB-C power bricks). It starts at $1,999 and &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/2r5oMg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can be ordered “today.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDMM04"&gt;It has a 14.2-inch 120Hz ProMotion Mini LED display, which Apple is branding as “Liquid Retina Pro XDR.” It has slimmer bezels than the previous generation but also includes a notch, which houses a 1080p webcam but not Apple’s Face ID system. Resolution-wise, the 14-inch...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s second-gen AirPods got a permanent $30 price cut</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oYxNKn"&gt;Apple announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; during today’s big hardware event: a $179 set of earbuds that are much closer to the AirPods Pro in terms of features and design. Though, it’s not all bad news if you don’t want to spend that much on AirPods. As a result of this new set, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-2nd-generation/"&gt;Apple has permanently slashed the price of its second-gen AirPods that include a wired charging case from $159 to $129&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Igazhh"&gt;The model that includes a wireless charging case is no longer available for purchase (through Apple, at least). It does, however, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MR8U2AM/A/wireless-charging-case-for-airpods"&gt;still sell the wireless charging case separately for $79&lt;/a&gt;, but I really wouldn’t encourage buying that versus just getting the new, third-generation AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsbtCu"&gt;Apple currently has a lineup of AirPods that starts at...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="TYddrX"&gt;The trans employee resource group at Netflix has released a list of demands for the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723592/netflix-trans-employees-walkout-statements-ceo"&gt;ahead of Wednesday’s walkout&lt;/a&gt;. “We want the company to adopt measures in the areas of content investment, employee relations and safety, and harm reduction, all of which are necessary to avoid future instances of platforming transphobia and hate speech,” employees wrote in a press release, which has not yet been made public but was supplied to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QL7YQ1"&gt;The news comes after weeks of controversy due to Netflix executives continuing to support Dave Chappelle and his comedy special &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which many LGBTQ people and allies have criticized as transphobic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dll4A6"&gt;Last week, Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle"&gt;fired a leader of the trans ERG&lt;/a&gt; who was helping to organize the walkout....&lt;/p&gt;

The Touch Bar is gone, replaced with a full-size function row.

  &lt;p id="LjQqvB"&gt;Following several beta releases, Apple announced that the next version of its macOS software, macOS Monterey, is about to release. It’ll be rolling out as an update starting on Monday, October 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Dr8m8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;My colleague Monica Chin previewed the public beta software&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, highlighting Monterey’s improvements to Facetime. The software will bring other exciting features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;SharePlay and Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, which will enable Mac and iPad users to move files seamlessly between devices, but perhaps not at launch. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-unveils-game-changing-macbook-pro/"&gt;In its press release for the new, redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, Apple says that those features are coming “later this fall.” Additionally, Apple made significant tweaks to Safari, its own web browser, for Monterey, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686070/apple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back"&gt;it has since...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
