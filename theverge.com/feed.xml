    <title>How to get more space in your Google storage</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="995CJ1"&gt;For many of us, Google storage is the modern-day hard drive. It’s the place where our most important thoughts, documents, and memories reside. But just like with a traditional hard drive, the space isn’t infinite, and running out of room can be a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4NMAK"&gt;By default, Google gives you 15GB of space to use for everything associated with your account. (If you have a paid G Suite account, your limit’s likely higher.) That includes content connected to Gmail, Google Drive, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;all&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Google Photos saved after June 1st&lt;/a&gt;. Needless to say, data adds up fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxF6Db"&gt;You can check your current storage status by visiting &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/settings/storage"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, and if push comes to shove, you can purchase more space there, too, for as little as &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/about"&gt;$2 a month&lt;/a&gt; for an extra 100GB. But...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford says it will go all-electric in Europe by 2030</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3GvSPyN99Jw4nuwQQXnQJeUtaZQ=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830428/All_New_Ford_E_Transit_09.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9vTleR"&gt;Ford will only sell electric vehicles in Europe by 2030, it said Wednesday. The automaker said it will spend $1 billion to convert its factory in Cologne, Germany, into its first EV production line on the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EIGoE"&gt;Ford says it will transition to EV-production gradually over the next decade. By 2024, the company’s entire commercial vehicle lineup will be “zero-emissions capable, all-electric or plug-in hybrid.” By mid-2026, Ford says “100 percent” of its passenger vehicle lineup will be the same. And by 2030, Ford expects two-thirds of its commercial vehicle sales to be all-electric or plug-in hybrid, while all of its passenger vehicles sold will be pure battery-electric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WK1ujE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford said it will increase its investment in electric and...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazon changed traffic light timing during union drive, county officials say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BfVvGhkLeHr4JLh34ynR2gDzBFE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830297/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WmH8Xl"&gt;As part of its ongoing fight over an Alabama warehouse’s efforts to unionize, Amazon reportedly changed the timing of a traffic light outside the warehouse, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1361819139866828803"&gt;according to reporting by &lt;em&gt;More Perfect Union&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Union organizers at the site had previously accused the company of altering the timing so that pro-union workers would not be able to canvass workers while stopped at the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWIu8Y"&gt;Until recently, the altered timing on the traffic light outside the factory had been dismissed as a rumor. But &lt;em&gt;More Perfect Union&lt;/em&gt; confirmed with Jefferson County officials that last year, Amazon notified the county of traffic delays during shift changes and asked for the light to be changed. On December 15th, the county increased the green light duration in an...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maps show ZIP codes hit hardest by COVID-19 have low vaccination rates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chicago’s Roseland Community Hospital Handles Spike In Covid Patients" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TyWGlNZYb_DHIll4UYZwzSI2dxs=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830290/1291860627.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oDmNp7"&gt;From the start of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, experts &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/addressing-racial-equity-vaccine-distribution/"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that it would take careful attention to make sure it was distributed equitably. Making sure non-white and poorer communities had access to life-saving vaccines would be an issue of justice and a public health necessity. Throughout 2020, these groups had &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22252693/covid-19-deaths-us-who-died"&gt;higher rates of death&lt;/a&gt; and disease from the virus than &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/health-equity/data-10-cities-show-covid-19-impact-based-poverty-race"&gt;white and wealthy&lt;/a&gt; people, so protecting them would be key to the overall goal of using vaccines to save the most lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TAIBy"&gt;Despite those warnings, the COVID-10 vaccination campaign got off to a rough and unequal start. By the middle of January, when 17 states were reporting race and ethnicity data, analyses showed that Black and Hispanic people were vaccinated at &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/early-state-vaccination-data-raise-warning-flags-racial-equity/"&gt;lower rates...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All Your Base Are Belong To Us has turned 20 </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5HPFC5"&gt;As of yesterday, it’s been 20 years since “All Your Base Are Belong To Us” was uploaded to Newgrounds. Let that sink in. And while you’re doing that, &lt;a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/11940"&gt;feel free to watch the video in its entirety there&lt;/a&gt;, too. It’s been kept safe in a Flash-emulating container, so even now, it’s safe from the inconvenient fact that Flash has been discontinued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oF1XyS"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/get-ready-to-feel-old-the-all-your-base-music-video-turns-20-today/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, the history of the “All Your Base” video is longer than just a single upload. Much of it is taken from a tiny GIF of the Mega Drive game &lt;em&gt;Zero Wing&lt;/em&gt;, which had been circulating widely online because of its disastrous English translation (and the GIF itself existed because of early emulation culture). “Early Internet communities poked fun at the sequence by creating and sharing...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York State is suing Amazon for alleged worker safety failures during COVID-19</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JiIBG7"&gt;New York Attorney General Letitia James &lt;a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=muvelgaOEvSt6Yc1gGqzAg=="&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Amazon in the state’s supreme court on Tuesday, claiming the company failed to protect its workers early on in the COVID-19 pandemic and also retaliated against employees who voiced concerns over what they felt were inadequate safety measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5kD9o"&gt;The news, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/technology/amazon-new-york-lawsuit-covid.html"&gt;reported yesterday by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, follows Amazon’s decision earlier this month to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279819/amazon-new-york-ag-state-lawsuit-covid-19-warehouse-conditions-pandemic"&gt;preemptively sue the New York AG’s office&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to prevent James from bringing charges, doing so by trying to have jurisdiction over its workplace safety measures in New York be deemed a federal issue not within the purview of the state AG. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First trailer for Disney’s live-action Cruella movie feels more Joker than 101 Dalmatians</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lM5qY275OBC-aIHh_O1SOWK0NiM=/97x0:1207x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830012/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_8.59.58_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o7tWpw"&gt;There’s a moment in the first trailer for Disney’s live-action &lt;em&gt;Cruella &lt;/em&gt;movie when Emma Stone utters in a terrible faux British accent, “I am woman, hear me roar.” It feels less like something Disney fans will remember from the iconic &lt;em&gt;101 Dalmatians &lt;/em&gt;villain, Cruella de Vil, and more like Jared Leto’s Joker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22278944/zack-snyder-justice-league-official-premiere-trailer-hbo-max"&gt;telling Batman, “We live in a society.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0MSzZ"&gt;All of which is to say that Disney may have found its own Joker-type character in Stone’s Cruella de Vil... but not necessarily in a good way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNrujM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella &lt;/em&gt;is set in 1970s London. Stone plays the soon-to-be-villain in an origin story of sorts. She’s an aspiring punk designer — and a grifter — who is trying to get society’s wealthiest people to take notice of her and her designs. Throughout the...&lt;/p&gt;

Outside of &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.
