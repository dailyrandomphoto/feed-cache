    <title>Tesla whistleblower Martin Tripp ordered to pay $400,000 to settle hacking case</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tGDtXv"&gt;Martin Tripp, the former Tesla worker who has been embroiled in a bitter legal battle with CEO Elon Musk for over two years, was ordered to pay his former employer $400,000 after admitting to leaking confidential information to a reporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvjoR9"&gt;The settlement is intended to bring an end to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263757/tesla-elon-musk-employee-hack-spying-whistleblower-gigafactory-martin-tripp-drugs"&gt;one of the more sordid stories at Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, in which Tripp, a former process technician, locked horns with the billionaire CEO over allegations that Tesla was wasting a “jaw-dropping” amount of raw material as it ramped up production of the Model 3 sedan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XeTnH4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The settlement is intended to bring an end to one &lt;s&gt;﻿&lt;/s&gt;of the more sordid stories at Tesla&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Go watch this video about an AI system that can predict how proteins fold</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eUYngK"&gt;Within any living organism, there are thousands of different proteins, each with its own unique shape. For decades, the exact formation of those shapes has been a pain for scientists to figure out. How exactly does a protein, which starts as a string of amino acids, fold itself into the funky 3D shapes you might recognize from diagrams? AlphaFold, an &lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphafold"&gt;AI from DeepMind&lt;/a&gt;, may have an answer. It can predict, with heretofore unseen accuracy, the shape a protein will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBzmn7"&gt;AlphaFold was put to the test in a global competition called Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction, or CASP, which DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis calls the “Olympics of protein folding” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg7WjuFs8F4"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt;. During the competition, systems like AlphaFold are given the amino...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose adds swipe volume controls to QuietComfort Earbuds and Sport Earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s-SrCqBMZVQwKFnEAD-c7xpLUno=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68050638/IMG_0723-1.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A5NCa7"&gt;One of the few complaints I had in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;review of Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt; was that they lacked onboard volume controls. Well, a few weeks after they went on sale, the company has now resolved that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojhIj6"&gt;In the latest update of the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bose-music/id1364986984"&gt;Bose Music app out today on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a new volume control option in settings. (Presumably this will be coming to the Android app imminently, as well.) Once you toggle it on, you’ll be able to swipe up and down on the right earbud to adjust how loud the audio is. This feature is available for both the QuietComfort Earbuds and less expensive Sport Earbuds. It’s something that was spotted in early user manuals for the earbuds but was removed before they shipped. I’m glad Bose has quickly moved to add this...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Windows Feature Experience Packs are smaller updates to Windows 10</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Windows 10 stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmwbTtUAXoY-N4tK23JhTiNrFvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68045021/mswindows1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5LAMcR"&gt;Microsoft has started testing smaller feature updates for Windows 10 in the form of a Windows Feature Experience Pack. The branding appeared inside Windows 10 earlier this year, but Microsoft has only confirmed what the packs will be used for this week. The Windows Feature Experience Pack will be used to “improve certain features and experiences that are now developed independently of the OS,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/11/30/releasing-windows-feature-experience-pack-120-2212-1070-0-to-the-beta-channel/"&gt;according to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NHHGJ"&gt;The first feature pack has been released to Windows 10 beta testers this week, and it includes the ability to use the built-in screen snipping app to paste screenshots directly into folders within the File Explorer. The pack also includes a split keyboard mode for 2-in-1 touch devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IQvz4h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Feature packs are for the smaller parts...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offer noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. There are currently three models to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4vnkg"&gt;The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop at least another $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. The three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E67sPx"&gt;Regardless of which model you choose, all three models support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p id="UkJwbt"&gt;China’s Chang’e 5 mission, tasked with bringing a sample of lunar dirt back to Earth, successfully landed on the Moon on Tuesday, marking the third time that China has placed a robotic spacecraft on the lunar surface. The lander will soon begin digging up samples of lunar soil, which will be returned to our planet later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a complex mission consisting of four main spacecraft that will all work together to bring between 2 to 4 kilograms of lunar dirt back to Earth. The quartet traveled to the Moon attached together and got into lunar orbit on November 28th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Libra cryptocurrency project changes name to Diem to distance itself from Facebook</title>

  &lt;p id="6SCDX9"&gt;The Libra cryptocurrency is &lt;a href="https://www.diem.com/en-us/updates/diem-association/"&gt;getting a new name today&lt;/a&gt;, Diem, in an effort to show that the project has “organizational independence” as it attempts to get regulatory approvals for launch. The project initially received widespread pushback in part because it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18682290/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-visa-mastercard-digital-currency-calibra-wallet-announce"&gt;emerged out of Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and in part because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18716326/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-blockchain-irs-starbucks"&gt;its ambitious aims&lt;/a&gt; seemed to threaten traditional government-run financial systems. The independent organization that runs the project, the Libra Association, will now be known as the Diem Association, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-01/facebook-backed-crypto-group-libra-changes-name-to-diem-network"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that its currency will be called the Diem Dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCgb8c"&gt;Diem, as it is now known, has shrunk significantly in scope since it was first announced. Major launch partners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20910330/mastercard-stripe-ebay-facebook-libra-association-withdrawal-cryptocurrency"&gt;pulled support&lt;/a&gt; in quick succession last year because of its...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="xvJXiF"&gt;Facial recognition algorithms are getting better at recognizing faces in masks, according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8331"&gt;data published on Tuesday by the National Institute for Standards and Technology&lt;/a&gt; (NIST). Drawing on independent testing of more than 150 separate facial recognition algorithms, the new report suggests masks may not be as big a problem for facial recognition systems as initially thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Aqbi5"&gt;Vendors voluntarily submit their facial recognition algorithms to NIST for testing as part of the Facial Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT). The institute publishes results of those tests on a rolling basis as each algorithm is submitted. When NIST &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344751/facial-recognition-face-masks-accuracy-nist-study"&gt;first examined masks’ effect on facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; in July, it found that algorithms weren’t great at identifying faces...&lt;/p&gt;
