    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xAHVOz"&gt;Richard Branson’s July flight to the edge of space is under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration for veering out of its designated airspace mid-flight, the FAA said on Wednesday after a &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The mission’s two pilots were alerted to yellow and red light warnings mid-flight that, according to sources in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, should’ve prompted them to abort the mission. The flight continued and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;ultimately landed safely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCfgga"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane air-launched from its carrier aircraft on July 11th carrying founder Branson and three company employees over the firm’s New Mexico spaceport, Spaceport America. The rocket plane soared 53.5 miles high, skimming the edge of space for a few minutes of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The time a human-driven car ran over an autonomous robot</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5cUJcr"&gt;Crossing city streets filled with SUV drivers in a hurry is tricky for any pedestrian, but what about a robot that’s less than two feet tall? &lt;a href="https://www.starship.xyz/"&gt;Starship Technologies&lt;/a&gt; is flooding college towns with autonomous electric delivery bots that trundle goods to your location in their locked storage compartment. While the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973971/uber-self-driving-car-crash-investigation-human-error-results"&gt; safety of human pedestrians around large vehicles with autonomous capabilities&lt;/a&gt; is still being debated, this time, the roles were reversed. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rach.ipsa/video/7002765870946651398"&gt;As shown in a video posted to TikTok by rach,ipsa&lt;/a&gt;, even a couple of lights plus cameras, radar, ultrasonic sensors, and neural networks weren’t enough for this robot to avoid getting clipped by a Ford Escape.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s aptX Lossless promises CD-quality audio for wireless headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dk29DEtxQYdRiLuQXBli0-Hdbo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805804/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gbMPQK"&gt;2021 has been a big year for lossless music now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;Apple has gone in on the higher-quality streaming&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;no longer charging an added premium&lt;/a&gt; for it. But one of the main challenges confronting lossless audio is how to play it wirelessly (at full fidelity) on wireless headphones and earbuds. Qualcomm thinks it has found a solution with the new aptX Lossless, which is part of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313214/qualcomm-snapdragon-sound-announced-high-res-audio"&gt;Snapdragon Sound program&lt;/a&gt; announced earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pBU86"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/09/01/qualcomm-adds-bluetooth-lossless-audio-technology-snapdragon-sound"&gt;With aptX Lossless&lt;/a&gt; (which is technically an extension of aptX Adaptive), Qualcomm says it’ll be able to stream CD-quality, 16-bit / 44.1kHz lossless audio over Bluetooth. The first devices to feature the new technology are expected to be available in early 2022. Snapdragon Sound leans on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Broadcasters secure a win in their fight against scrappy TV streamer Locast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3k_FyTp-QAQYE0N0y9z8TCojkw4=/0x10:2164x1453/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805756/locast.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6rHoaV"&gt;ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox have secured a victory in their legal fight against Locast, a nonprofit that re-streams their local broadcast stations at little to no cost, much to the consternation of those networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoqByd"&gt;Locast is a service that makes local broadcasts free — kind of, we’ll get to that — to those who may be unwilling to pony up for cable or live TV streaming services, or just don’t want to hook up an antenna in their living room. Those four networks are already broadcast over-the-air for free; Locast then uses a &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/111"&gt;legal exemption&lt;/a&gt; in copyright law to re-transmit their broadcasts and put them online for people to more easily access. Locast doesn’t &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; charge for its service, but it does &lt;a href="https://www.locast.org/donate"&gt;ask for donations&lt;/a&gt; that start around $5 per...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s new fantasy sports-like prediction games let you blast your boldest picks to everyone you know</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RLV8EKR4x_WUeGIyxna-B04TNu0=/0x0:890x593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805644/NRP_Fantasy_Games_on_Facebook_Inline_3__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshots of Facebook’s fantasy sports.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BIxGuH"&gt;Facebook is adding fantasy sports-like prediction games that will let users guess what’s going to happen in sports, TV shows, and pop culture. The new games, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/introducing-facebook-fantasy-games/"&gt;called Facebook Fantasy Games&lt;/a&gt;, are rolling out first on the iOS and Android apps for users in the US and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikji9v"&gt;The first game available is Pick &amp;amp; Play Sports, a daily sports prediction game it made in partnership with Whistle Sports. (It was already available in the iOS app for me, so it might be for you, too.) In the “upcoming months,” Facebook plans to release additional games for TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The Bachelorette&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Survivor&lt;/em&gt;, sports leagues like Major League Baseball, and one made with &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed. &lt;/em&gt;Games will have public leaderboards, but you can also make your own public or private...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tech companies face pressure over January 6th subpoenas</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="A Gadsden Flag flag left by Pro-Trump protesters who entered the U.S. Capitol building is seen after mass demonstrations in the nations capital during a joint session Congress to ratify President-elect Joe Biden on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gJ-bqcDJ0b3uq-WwmxH85v8jVLU=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805415/1230490671.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JCQLwx"&gt;As Congress pushes for more details of the January 6th attack on the Capitol, tech companies have found themselves caught between a new request from the select committee investigating the attack and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/jan-6-riot-mccarthy-trump-telecom-companies/2021/09/01/cad1753c-0b1d-11ec-9781-07796ffb56fe_story.html"&gt;ominous threats from Republicans&lt;/a&gt; hoping to stall the committee’s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxOkqc"&gt;Pushing for new details about communications between Republican members of Congress and President Trump during the attack, the House select committee sent data requests on Monday ordering the preservation of phone records and other communications related to the January 6th attack. Requests went out &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/january-6-committee-telecoms/2021/08/30/a2592168-0997-11ec-a6dd-296ba7fb2dce_story.html"&gt;to 35 companies&lt;/a&gt;, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Microsoft. Wireless providers like AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless also received the request.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="yDlPkK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/"&gt;Reddit has banned&lt;/a&gt; anti-vaccine and anti-mask subreddit r/NoNewNormal and has quarantined 54 other subreddits associated with COVID denial. A week ago, the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/"&gt;company’s CEO said in a post&lt;/a&gt; that Reddit was meant to be a place of “open and authentic discussion and debate,” even for ideas that “question or disagree with popular consensus.” In today’s post, the company has clarified its rules with regard to health misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BnndB"&gt;The subreddit NoNewNormal has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651653/amazon-ivermectin-misinformation-autocomplete"&gt;cited by many&lt;/a&gt; in the Reddit community as a source of vaccine misinformation, and it was known for “brigading” other subreddit’s discussions by butting in on conversations about COVID or related policies in other communities. NoNewNormal was the source of 80 such brigades in the past...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon isn’t denying its CEO saved an exec from being fired for discrimination</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;
