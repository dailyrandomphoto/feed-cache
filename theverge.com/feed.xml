    <title>Twitter considers letting you limit tweets to ‘trusted friends’</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mockup of what the new trusted friends feature could look like.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZaIbf"&gt;Twitter has shared three early design concepts for new features it’s considering for its service. “Trusted Friends” would let users limit the audience for select tweets to a smaller circle of close friends, while “Facets” could let you categorize your tweets when you send them. Finally, the service is also considering letting users list certain phrases that they’d rather not see in their replies. These ideas are in their early stages, Twitter says, and none are currently in active development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5jjlj"&gt;Many Twitter users already have multiple accounts to separate their work and personal lives, often with one of them being private to prevent sharing personal news too publicly. But features like Trusted Friends and Facets could allow for the same...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s the deal with the Seinfeld soundtrack finally coming out?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="seinfeld" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9hHc6IJAscYgh79BroFvgt9OGcs=/0x40:960x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531118/seinfeld.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bi4K7q"&gt;The hottest album of 2021 is about to drop. The soundtrack of the hit ‘90s sitcom &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld &lt;/em&gt;will be released on Friday, July 2nd (via &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/music/news/seinfeld-soundtrack-to-be-released-1235009969/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) on “all digital platforms,” though specific platforms weren’t stated. I expect to hear the bouncy slap bass-driven theme song that never fails to make me laugh blaring out of cars, apartments, and cafes this Fourth of July weekend. Believe it or not, there will be 33 tracks on the album, and it’s apparently the first time that this music will be made available in an official fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgW96K"&gt;The composer, Jonathan Wolff, told &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;that the soundtrack contains some music that was created for the show but never actually appeared in it. Three jazz songs were made for scenes where Elaine (played by Julia...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 15’s new Live Text feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Grz1iv2Q-EqgdejaZyXhstVLLIM=/311x0:2249x1292/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531103/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_3.24.37_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xDK9Nx"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;now available in public beta&lt;/a&gt;, which means that today you can try out all the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;biggest features coming to the iPhone&lt;/a&gt; this fall. That includes Live Text, the most technically impressive feature in the update, which allows you to pull text, email addresses, phone numbers, and more from pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJ8tcg"&gt;Live Text works with both handwritten and typed text, and supports English, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Portuguese, French, Italian, German, and Spanish. It’s also important to remember that iOS 15 is still in beta, which means that Apple could tweak or change how Live Text works in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpYxEg"&gt;Live Text works in a few different ways on iOS, depending on what you’re trying to use it for and where in the OS you...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big tech companies will have to open Russian offices if they want to advertise in the country</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Plenary meeting of Russian State Duma" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kXjeA1brgwC9USGx0IBJuCFNEaM=/0x0:4397x2931/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530985/1233463725.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eEa6YN"&gt;A new Russian law will require large social media companies to open offices in Russia if they don’t want to face advertising bans or &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-lawmakers-vote-force-us-tech-giants-open-local-offices-2021-06-17/"&gt;other penalties&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/putin-signs-law-forcing-foreign-it-firms-open-offices-russia-2021-07-01/"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The law was reportedly signed by President Vladimir Putin on Thursday and will apply to foreign companies that are “carrying out activities on the internet in Russia.” According to a Russian official, the law affects companies that have over 500,000 Russian visitors a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tvmpjo"&gt;The Russian government has been looking to rein in Big Tech’s influence in the country. In 2019, it introduced a law that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20977459/russian-law-pre-installed-domestic-software-tvs-smartphones-laptops"&gt;required device makers to pre-install Russian-made apps&lt;/a&gt; on smartphones, TVs, and computers (with Apple being allowed to instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361762/iphone-russia-startup-local-apps-yandex-mail-ru-law"&gt;show the apps to users during the setup...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workhorse says Postal Service broke its own rules in new mail truck contest</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R5XNGX"&gt;EV startup Workhorse has accused the United States Postal Service of bias in choosing defense contractor Oshkosh to build the next-generation mail truck, and claims the agency committed “countless errors” during the selection process. Workhorse also alleges that the new mail truck that Oshkosh and the USPS debuted in February is entirely different from the one the defense contractor tested during the yearslong competition, and that it doesn’t have a working prototype, something the startup says is blatant evidence of unfair treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwT77I"&gt;These new allegations are at the &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694043/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.28.0__1_.pdf"&gt;heart of the complaint&lt;/a&gt; that Workhorse filed in the US Court of Federal Claims &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536793/workhorse-federal-bid-protest-usps-contract-oshkosh-ngdv"&gt;on June 16th&lt;/a&gt;, which was unsealed this week.

    <title>How to restore your Mac from the macOS Monterey beta to Big Sur</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QsFRv8tXEAOtBo2Aq053anr3AdU=/102x0:1790x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530607/lcimg_71a6f738_86b9_4aed_a194_067e8224a6d4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZoFr15"&gt;If you downloaded and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22323032"&gt;installed the macOS Monterey public beta&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a chance that you may want to return to Big Sur, which is currently the stable macOS version. There are a couple of different ways to restore your Mac’s original software; which one you should follow depends on how you installed the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y2Oq8"&gt;The path to restoring is easiest if you made a Time Machine backup before updating the operating system, or if you installed the beta on a separate partition via Disk Utility. If you installed the beta on your main partition without a backup, you can still restore your system to the older OS, but you’ll need to start fresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GY1Bse"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple launches public beta of macOS Monterey, bringing updates to FaceTime and Safari","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JshbJD"&gt;Whichever path you chose, we’ll walk you through how to find your way back to a more reliable OS.

    <title>Go read this feature on an engineer who turned ‘free’ Xbox gift cards into millions in Bitcoin</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAmh9M"&gt;When you can be in the right place at the right time, you can really make some things happen for yourself. Take, for instance, Volodymyr Kvashuk, who moved from Ukraine to the US for a career in computer science and wound up working as an engineer for Microsoft. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2021-microsoft-xbox-gift-card-fraud/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_content=businessweek&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-businessweek&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a new must-read feature from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; that was exactly the right time to turn a loophole in Microsoft’s payment testing apparatus into a multimillion-dollar Bitcoin scheme — and a sick lake house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKeWmu"&gt;Kvashuk’s job was to look for flaws in how Microsoft processed payments by buying things like physical hardware using a company card and a fake login. Microsoft knew enough to not send him a Dell PC every time he ordered one, but Xbox gift cards bought online and sent to...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Go4M5"&gt;Sony’s next flagship phone, the Xperia 1 III, will ship on August 19th in the US — for a whopping $1,299.99. It’s available to preorder today, the company announced. The new photography-focused phone is designed as a complement to Sony’s Alpha camera range, and it introduces a variable periscope-style telephoto lens. It’s also equipped with just about everything you’d expect from a flagship Android phone in 2021, including a Snapdragon 888 processor, 5G, and a 6.5-inch display with 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
