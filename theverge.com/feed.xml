    <title>India sets stricter rules for social media giants</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4PK6KR"&gt;India has announced new regulations for social networks and other web services in the country, particularly “significant social media” companies with large user bases, like Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UowV5d"&gt;India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) &lt;a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1700749"&gt;announced the rules&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. &lt;a href="https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/specificdocs/documents/2021/feb/doc202122521.pdf"&gt;They require social media companies&lt;/a&gt; to establish a “grievance redressal mechanism” for users, including official “grievance officers” who acknowledge complaints within 24 hours and resolve them within 15 days. Services must also remove nudity and sexually explicit content within 24 hours of a user flagging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sr9Ojb"&gt;“Significant social media intermediaries” face additional responsibilities. These companies must appoint India-based officials that work...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Music is now available on Google TV and Android TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEm_Rx2NX7y3F1DiST03L85LKY8=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873307/amazon_music_android_tv.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pei3Ud"&gt;Amazon Music is finally coming to Google’s set-top box operating systems, with a new app rolling out for Google TV (currently just available on the latest Chromecast) and Android TV starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOyfjS"&gt;The app will function similarly to Amazon Music on other devices. Subscribers to Amazon Music Unlimited (which costs $7.99 per month for Prime members or $9.99 per month) will be able to access the full music library, similar to Spotify or Apple Music. Regular Prime Members will get access to a curated list of songs and playlists, while users without any subscriptions will get access to Amazon Music’s ad-supported options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wF0zw4"&gt;It’s by no means the first music app on Google’s hardware — in addition to Google’s own offerings, services like Spotify...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Framework Laptop is an upgradable, customizable 13-inch notebook coming this spring</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fTYY5u"&gt;A San Francisco-based startup called &lt;a href="https://frame.work/"&gt;Framework&lt;/a&gt; has just launched an ambitious project: a thin, lightweight productivity laptop that it claims can be “upgraded, customized, and repaired in ways that no other notebook can.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5g2L1"&gt;Framework founder Nirav Patel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company aims to address his long-standing frustrations with consumer technology companies. Patel was one of the original Oculus employees and has worked for Apple as well. During that time, he says he “saw an industry that felt incredibly broken across the board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyx41p"&gt;“As a consumer electronics company, your business model effectively depends on churning out constant tons of hardware and pushing it into channels, and into market, and into consumers’ hands, and then sort...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zack Snyder’s Army of the Dead is a big Vegas heist movie coming to Netflix — with zombies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iz0nKUDsP0gPnmg8bswY-QaHqv4=/0x20:3000x2020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873204/AOTD_081519_20780R5_20__20CC_20__20V2_f.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CLAY ENOS/NETFLIX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8HIzxL"&gt;Netflix’s next big-budget action movie is almost here: &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; from director Zack Snyder sees a squad of mercenaries battling their way into Las Vegas to pull off a massive heist. The catch is it’s set after a zombie apocalypse has ravaged the city, so instead of the usual Vegas barriers of casino security and mob bosses, the crew will have to fight through hordes of the ravenous undead to try to get the score of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ENAji"&gt;The first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t show off much, but we do know that Dave Bautista (&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;) will be leading the the show. Snyder, of course, is no stranger to big action films and zombie movies, in particular, having directed the 2004 remake of &lt;em&gt;Dawn of the Dead &lt;/em&gt;(as well as his...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Listen to Post Malone cover Hootie &amp; the Blowfish for Pokémon’s 25th anniversary</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVQY8CH5_FkpyldUdIlTkSaTYS4=/0x51:960x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873199/Post_Malone_x_Pokemon_Publicity_Photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1eL7JI"&gt;On Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278179/post-malone-pokemon-concert-25th-anniversary"&gt;Post Malone will hold a virtual concert&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297819/pokemon-25th-anniversary-nintendo-game-boy-pikachu"&gt;the 25th anniversary of the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; franchise&lt;/a&gt;. If that combination wasn’t strange enough, today, he revealed one of the songs he’ll be performing: a cover of Hootie &amp;amp; the Blowfish’s mid-’90s hit “Only Wanna Be With You.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zi8rVr"&gt;I’m not entirely sure how much crossover there is between Post, Hootie, and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; fans, but the song is definitely a real thing. You can listen to the cover in the video above, and The Pokémon Company says “the song will be included as part of Post’s headlining appearance” at the virtual concert, which will be airing on February 27th at 7PM ET. You can watch the live stream on both Twitch and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOXpBQ"&gt;Elsewhere, it also looks like we may be getting some...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First trailer for Pixar’s Luca follows two sea monster best friends trying to enjoy a summer in Italy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ji2T9KcRVTfoixTbJlARos-XUlA=/215x0:1298x722/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873070/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_9.29.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qwYTTx"&gt;Trying to find friends can be stressful on its own, but when you’re a sea monster trying to blend in with the residents of an Italian town who just so happen to hate sea monsters, it’s even more anxiety-inducing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weimXu"&gt;This is the basic premise of &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;Pixar’s new animated film&lt;/a&gt; coming later this year. The movie follows Luca Paguro, a 13-year-old sea monster who wants to see what life is like above the sea, and his friend Alberto Scorfano, who loves the human world. Together, they take on human-looking forms and explore around an Italian town, trying to live a carefree life and enjoy the simple things that humans may take for granted, like bicycles and gelato. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbleHh"&gt;If that sounds a little like &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt;, one of Disney’s most popular...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple TV’s touchpad swipes and misses at being a good remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SabX-zpnBqRdZwClYeBz2FzeBXs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873060/akrales_210224_4406_0066.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vLMbFe"&gt;It’s rare to find a button that is almost universally hated, but the infamous touchpad on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9630952/new-apple-tv-4-review"&gt;Apple TV’s Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; might be the exception. Even over half a decade after its introduction, it stands as one of the most reviled pieces of hardware around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwJD7m"&gt;The failings of the Apple TV remote don’t just stem from a bad touchpad (and don’t get me wrong: it is bad) but from a larger misunderstanding on Apple’s part of what makes a good remote and the fundamental purpose of those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvoWpW"&gt;The typical TV remote is big and ugly, but it’s also extremely easy to find and navigate thanks to differing patterns of buttons that make it clear what you’re touching even without checking. Generally speaking, no one has ever been too confused about how to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where to buy Nvidia’s RTX 3060 graphics card </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kfxa6U"&gt;Nvidia’s new RTX 3060 will be available to purchase starting on Thursday, February 25th at 9AM PT / 12PM ET. Unlike other GPUs in the RTX 30 series, Nvidia is not making a Founder’s Edition of the RTX 3060, but other manufacturers like EVGA and Gigabyte are making their own iterations of the RTX 3060. The price is said to be $329, but as has been the case for the past year, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to find it available for that. Retailers that have posted listings are already marking up 3060 cards to $390 or more, which is much closer in price to the step-up 3060 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbzG6g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22064700"&gt;reviewed EVGA’s iteration of the RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; and noted in his review that although the GPU’s price makes it more competitive to buy, you’re...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="cZr5d0"&gt;Esther Cohen is 91, vaccinated against COVID-19, and wants to play mahjong with her friends — who are also vaccinated. She &lt;a href="https://www.aaas.org/news/looking-back-and-forward-covid-19-anthony-fauci"&gt;asked Anthony Fauci&lt;/a&gt; if they could get back to their games after he spoke at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ue9yOU"&gt;Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said she should wait a bit longer and urged her to be patient. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/08/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html"&gt;was working&lt;/a&gt; on guidelines for people who’d been vaccinated because lots of people were asking the same question, he said — why get vaccinated if you can’t get back to normal? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2r1v0qpkmDCofvfzLEcU6WDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809161/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
