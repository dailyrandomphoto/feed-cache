    <title>The PlayStation 5 is available at Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5ikMud"&gt;Sony’s elusive PlayStation 5 console is in stock at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re one of the many people who has struggled to get one for yourself, today is looking good for you, and it’ll look better if more retailers jump in with stock later today. As usual, Walmart might not immediately appear to be selling consoles today, but you might be able to get one added to your cart if you refresh frequently. (&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: make sure your payment method and shipping address are entered ahead of time on each site before you try to buy a console. The faster you can checkout, the more likely your chance of success. Also, Walmart tends to release more consoles in 10-minute waves, so try again if 3:00PM ET doesn’t work, try again at 3:10PM ET.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack had some problems on Thursday for more than an hour</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pueWRGSomJe0poqIhJ3iBDk2g2c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318276/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3VQ0J5"&gt;Slack experienced frustrating issues for many on Thursday, including for some of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. For me, some messages just wouldn’t send. But a little more than an hour after Slack first reported the outage, the company said that the issues were resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSRGX4"&gt;“We’ve released a fix for this issue, and Slack is up and running once again,” &lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-05/33aed870657e30a0"&gt;Slack said in a post on its status site&lt;/a&gt; at 2:36PM ET. “If you are still experiencing any trouble, please fully quit your Slack app or browser using Command + Q (Mac) or Ctrl + Q (Windows/Linux), and then reopen it.” Slack first posted about the outage at 1:17PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtTWIW"&gt;The next time there’s a Slack outage, I highly recommend you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=slack%20down&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live"&gt;cruise Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to see the ridiculous &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NyloAndry/status/1395436475815243782"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Swainsch/status/1395436446337703939"&gt;GIFs&lt;/a&gt; that people post. You...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Ford’s F-150 Lightning stacks up against the Tesla Cybertruck and Hummer EV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z71ovA"&gt;Ford has revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;its first all-electric F-150&lt;/a&gt;, the Lightning, and on paper it looks like a really compelling truck. It’s priced aggressively for an electric vehicle, has plenty of power, and looks to be more capable at towing and hauling than the cheapest gas-powered F-150s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9YmLm"&gt;But Ford’s not alone in developing an electric pickup truck — far from it, in fact. There is a slew of electric pickups set to hit the market in the next year and a half or so. Tesla’s polarizing Cybertruck should start rolling off the line at the company’s new Texas factory at the end of 2021 or in early 2022. Rivian — a startup that has raised billions of dollars and is backed by Amazon and Ford — has an electric pickup called the R1T due out this June. And...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap’s new Spectacles let you see the world in augmented reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of a woman wearing the fourth-gen Spectacles, which are black with angular frames." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-TRdQFrgKF_-Q6eS-tXq0cVd9L0=/120x0:1740x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318328/Spectacles_KatVHarris_Portrait.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bdAtUx"&gt;Snap’s new Spectacles glasses are its most ambitious yet. But there’s a big catch: you can’t buy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KyxKs"&gt;On Thursday, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel unveiled the company’s first true augmented reality glasses, technology that he and rivals like Facebook think will one day be as ubiquitous as mobile phones. A demo showed virtual butterflies fluttering over colorful plants and landing in Spiegel’s extended hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ye9Tqb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The next generation of Spectacles can help unlock a new way to use AR hands-free”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a6OcHH"&gt;The new Spectacles have dual waveguide displays capable of superimposing AR effects made with Snapchat’s software tools. The frame features four built-in microphones, two stereo speakers, and a built-in touchpad. Front-facing cameras help the glasses detect...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat gets augmented reality Legos you can build with a friend</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zQhWLk"&gt;Snapchat is introducing a new type of augmented reality lens, called “Connected Lenses,” which allows Snapchat users to connect and enjoy an AR experience or game together — even if they’re not in the same physical space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehdjnl"&gt;The company is partnering with Lego for its first Connected Lens, which allows users to build a Lego model in augmented reality together, whether that’s in the same room or through the internet from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WMo2N9"&gt;In the demo video that Snap showed off, both users see the same floating Lego model on a table in their respective homes and can add parts, effects, and animations to the model, which are reflected for both users in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ST47nH"&gt;The move marks Snap’s latest expansion of augmented reality...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap will launch a standalone iOS video editing app called Story Studio later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ECWt6q7FFJPf0d1Z0j43WzVMX5c=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318136/Story_Studio_GIF.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap’s forthcoming iOS app Story Studio will allow people to handle more complicated videos edits from their mobile device. | Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CENQ6T"&gt;Snap wants to be the company people think of when they go to edit videos on mobile, so during its annual partnership summit today, the company announced a new iOS app that’ll help it achieve that goal: Story Studio. It’ll give people editing tools specifically designed for mobile, or vertical, videos. The app will pull data from Snapchat and its new Spotlight feature, more familiarly recognized as its TikTok competitor, to help people figure out how and what to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Afq8Kr"&gt;They can look through Snapchat insights, like what’s trending on the app across sounds, hashtags, and lenses. Lenses will be built directly into Story Studio, as well as Snapchat Sounds and stickers, so editors can add those. Of course, like most other video editing apps,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC reduces out-of-state prison phone rates</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;phone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eC5vuf"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously Thursday to lower some of the rates incarcerated people and their families pay to speak over the phone. For jurisdictional reasons, the measure only applies to interstate or international calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKH5vc"&gt;The Commission approved a measure that prohibits companies like Global Tel Link and Pay Tel Communications from charging families and incarcerated people more than 12 cents a minute in large prisons and 14 cents a minute in large jails for out-of-state calls. Previously, rates were capped at 21 cents a minute and single conversations could total several dollars. The action also caps international calling services for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People are bidding millions for the first ride on Blue Origin’s suborbital crew capsule</title>

  &lt;p id="mWAE8b"&gt;Rich people are jockeying for a seat on Blue Origin’s first crewed New Shepard mission, bidding as high as $2.8 million for a ten-minute experience at the edge of space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YuOvvy"&gt;A single seat aboard the New Shepard crew capsule, dubbed the RSS First Step Crew Capsule, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420709/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-shepard-tickets-astronaut"&gt;went up for auction&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, starting with a sealed bidding round that drew “more than 5,200 bidders from 136 countries,” the company said in a statement yesterday. By Wednesday morning, when the auction’s open-bidding phase began, the highest bid was revealed: $1.4 million. It rose to $2.8 million by the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwZhXP"&gt;RSS First Step, a gumdrop-shaped pod with seats for six, is getting set to fly its inaugural crew sometime in the next six months, with one seat reserved...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get ready for a busy Atlantic hurricane season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nicaragua Prepares To Receive Hurricane Iota" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j6yupZOumAwIVbrsYEMhf6Cr3pY=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69317799/1286039153.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;nbsp;PUERTO CABEZAS, NICARAGUA - NOVEMBER 16: Palm trees blow by wind as Nicaragua prepares to receive hurricane Iota on November 16, 2020 in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. Less than two weeks after being hardly affected by Hurricane Eta, villagers of Puerto Cabezas take precautions before landfall of Iota.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Maynor Valenzuela/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9aJmiq"&gt;The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season is shaping up to be busier than average. There’s a 60 percent chance of an above-normal season this year. Up to 20 named storms and as many as 10 hurricanes are expected, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/noaa-predicts-another-active-atlantic-hurricane-season"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; published today by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They also forecast up to 5 major hurricanes, which have&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;winds reaching 111 mph or higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srh3is"&gt;Hurricane season officially starts on June 1st.
