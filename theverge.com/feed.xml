    <title>EV charging network ChargePoint now supports Android Auto  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Q4crVHGD5kpCNXPN0D7ZvbmWmU=/162x0:1356x796/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203865/Android_Auto_Screens_Nearby_Stations.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The integration lets you view charging stations directly from your car’s infotainment screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: ChargePoint&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qdPP52"&gt;ChargePoint, operator of one of the largest EV charging networks across Europe and North America, is adding support for Android Auto to its app. The functionality means Android phone users will be able to find, navigate to, and start charging from a ChargePoint charging station from their car’s infotainment screen, without having to pick up their phone. Support for Android Auto follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571093/chargepoint-carplay-app-find-stations-start-charging-electric-cars-ev"&gt;addition of CarPlay support&lt;/a&gt; in November last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmRTb5"&gt;According to ChargePoint, the Android Auto experience lets you view a map with nearby charging stations, check status, filter by metrics like availability and cost, and then start a charging session once you arrive. The in-vehicle app can also be set to notify the driver once a busy charging station...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung loses over $270M from Texas plant shutdown as quarterly profits boom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rjroCK"&gt;Shutting down its semiconductor plant in Austin, Texas lost Samsung over 300 billion won (around $270 million), &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210429007100320"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yonhap News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking during a conference call, a senior vice president at Samsung’s foundry business Han Seung-hoon said that the shutdown affected around 71,000 wafers, corresponding to “around 300 to 400 billion won in damage.” The statement coincided with Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-first-quarter-2021-results?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=direct"&gt;latest earnings release&lt;/a&gt;, in which it reported strong sales of its smartphones and other consumer electronics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUpzfR"&gt;The South Korean electronics giant was forced to shut down its Austin plant — which produces microprocessors like radio frequency integrated circuits and solid state drive controllers — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287054/samsung-chip-production-halted-austin-winter-storm-uri-power-blackouts"&gt;back in February&lt;/a&gt; after a storm left some 200,000 Austin...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon lawsuit alleging Trump bias in $10 billion military contract clears another hurdle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aqnP71Iezoxz1ysOg1aOo6r6_8Q=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203696/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0LeMrI"&gt;An ongoing lawsuit pursued by Amazon against the US government and Microsoft will continue after a federal judge rejected a motion to dismiss the case. The suit concerns Microsoft’s success in securing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20700698/microsoft-pentagon-contract-jedi-cloud-amazon-details"&gt;$10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract&lt;/a&gt; with the Defense Department — a decision that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21002725/amazon-trump-jedi-contract-rules-court-documents-microsoft-pentagon"&gt;Amazon says&lt;/a&gt; was influenced by President Donald Trump’s dislike of the company and its CEO Jeff Bezos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gtKOz"&gt;The decision, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/28/pentagon-cloud-contract-depositions/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-28/judge-declines-to-toss-amazon-suit-claiming-trump-cost-jedi-bid"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;means Amazon can now argue in front of a court that Trump himself and former defense secretary Jim Mattis should testify. A motion to dismiss the case was rejected by Judge Patricia Campbell-Smith on Wednesday April 28, though her full opinion was filed under seal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JiZYRN"&gt;Amazon and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PS5 preorders begin in China, almost six months after US launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KNi2lA"&gt;The PS5 will be available to buy in China on May 15th, a little over six months after its original release in the US last year, &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/2833736934/Kd7K32XBZ?from=page_1006062833736934_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;type=comment#_rnd1619682582948"&gt;Sony announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The disc version of the console will retail for 3,899 yuan (around $600), while the cheaper disc-free model will cost 3,099 yuan (around $479). Preorders open today. The launch means Sony’s next-gen console will beat Microsoft’s to release in the country, although &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/sony-playstation-5-launch-china-ahead-of-microsofts-xbox.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CBNC&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft received safety approvals to release the Xbox Series X and Series S there at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kjo3zc"&gt;Relative to its size and population, China isn’t considered a huge market for console gaming. Game consoles were technically illegal in the country &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/07/china-lifts-13-year-ban-video-games-consoles"&gt;until 2014&lt;/a&gt;, which meant PC and mobile gaming has become...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vivaldi is updating its browsers to block annoying cookie pop-ups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i60nfBJtsFfk2phO_qZj3fvHdpc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203592/vivaldi_browser_cookie_blocker_setting.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5WTD3D"&gt;Vivaldi announced today that it’s updating the &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/press/embargoed/vivaldi-browser-blocks-cookie-dialogs-improves-privacy-design/"&gt;desktop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/press/embargoed/new-vivaldi-on-android-language-switcher-cookie-crumbler/"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; versions of its Vivaldi browser with the ability to block annoying cookie preference pop-ups. Thanks to the passage of the European Union’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt; (GDPR), you’ve probably had to click through at least one dialog box asking if you’d like to manage how a site tracks you. Vivaldi’s new update lets you avoid those notifications — with some major caveats — while theoretically still keeping you safe from tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EJa8q"&gt;Vivaldi’s logic for the new feature, affectionately called “Cookie Crumbler,” is that while giving users control over how they’re tracked is good, doing so through a pop-up “leads to clicking ‘allow’ or ‘accept’ without realizing that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Would you pay $30 a month for a faster web browser that eats less battery?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LENmsQirMZcz7iocpzQn4960BIg=/0x0:1376x917/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203413/mighty_browser.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ao3iRA"&gt;No matter how much web browsers improve, it feels like they can’t keep pace with everything we want to do. Open one too many tabs on a few-year-old laptop, and your fan starts spinning, your battery life dips, your system starts to slow. A faster or cleaner PC might fix it, but &lt;a href="https://www.mightyapp.com/"&gt;a startup called Mighty has a different idea&lt;/a&gt;: a $30-a-month web browser that lives in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ievKTm"&gt;Instead of your own physical computer interacting with each website, you stream a&lt;em&gt; remote &lt;/em&gt;web browser instead, one that lives on a powerful computer many miles away with its own 1,000Mbps connection to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAtGyB"&gt;Suddenly, your decent internet connection would feel like one of the fastest internet connections in the world, with websites loading nigh-instantly and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook claims it mistakenly hid posts calling for India’s prime minister to resign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLTZoh"&gt;When Facebook users tried to view a hashtag calling for the resignation of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/srinivasaiims/status/1387472195316711426"&gt;instead saw a message&lt;/a&gt; saying that Facebook was temporarily hiding the posts in order to keep the community safe. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-blocking-posts-hashtag-resign-modi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the posts were hidden for about three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3qohU"&gt;Facebook has now restored the posts. The company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the hashtag was blocked “by mistake” and claims it wasn’t because the Indian government asked Facebook to remove it. It also says the block was the result of some of the content that used the hashtag, but did not specify what kind of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeLMIH"&gt;The temporary suspension of the hashtag is likely to fuel concerns about the influence that Modi’s BJP party wields...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s pay raise for over 500,000 workers comes at an interesting time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTm_XxvVt3EXSYcqwX81Bd4F8hY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69202415/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFHMtK"&gt;Amazon has announced that over 500,000 of its workers will get a permanent increase in their hourly wages starting in mid-May, from as low as an additional 50 cents an hour to as much as three extra dollars per hour (via &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-boost-pay-500k-operations-workers-much-3-hour-1b-investment/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That’s a substantial chunk of its 1.3 million person workforce getting at least a small pay bump, and the company shared that it’s investing over $1 billion in these pay increases. Amazon said that it’s also on a hiring spree for “tens of thousands of jobs across our operations in the US.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xGE3T"&gt;Amazon previously recognized its warehouse and delivery workers with a $2 pay bump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21182411/amazon-hires-employees-warehouse-delivery-pay-raise-coronavirus"&gt;last March&lt;/a&gt; as the company worked to meet increased demand during the pandemic, but that was a temporary raise that disappeared &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/amazon-to-end-wage-increases-and-overtime-pay-in-june.html"&gt;in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is giving its top prepaid hotspot plan a big price cut and more data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F6nYNSjSefgz4FUmbf23KKjuw7g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69202232/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customers already enrolled in the prepaid plan will get a data boost and a lower price when their plan renews.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCXn6a"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says it will now offer a prepaid 5G data-only plan with up to 100GB of data for $55 per month — a big upgrade from its previous offering of 40GB for $75. The new pricing extends to Cricket Wireless customers as well as AT&amp;amp;T’s direct prepaid subscribers, though those on Cricket won’t be able to access the 5G network. These plans allow customers to buy data for their tablet or mobile hotspot separate from their voice plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEnrf2"&gt;That 100GB is a lot of data at a lower price than the other major carriers are offering; currently, T-Mobile has a prepaid data-only plan of 50GB for $50 and Verizon has a 30GB plan for $65 per month.
