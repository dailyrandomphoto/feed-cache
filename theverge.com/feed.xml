  &lt;p id="9J9GPS"&gt;Microsoft is launching its Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan. The software giant has been testing streaming Xbox Game Pass Ultimate games in these markets over the past few months, and is now ready to greatly expand the reach of its xCloud technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oZa31"&gt;XCloud will be available to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers in Brazil and Mexico later today, meaning it technically launches in Australia and Japan in the early hours of October 1st. Xbox Cloud Gaming will be available through the dedicated Android and Xbox Windows apps, or via the web for iOS and other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6SGPn"&gt;Microsoft is now offering Xbox Cloud Gaming in 26 countries, thanks to this big expansion. “Since cloud gaming is powered by custom...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox chief warns console supply constraints will last into 2022</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I7yVyk"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox chief, Phil Spencer, says console supply issues will continue into 2022. In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/gaming-leaders-strauss-zelnick-of-take-two-xboxs-phil-spencer-join-thegrill-2021/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wrap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-console-supply-issues-will-continue-into-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Spencer admits the Xbox supply issues will last for the rest of the year and into 2022 due to supply chain complications beyond just a chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VkjAt"&gt;“I think it’s probably too isolated to talk about it as just a chip problem,” says Spencer. “When I think about, what does it mean to get the parts necessary to build a console today, and then get it to the markets where the demand is, there are multiple kind of pinch points in that process. And I think regretfully it’s going to be with us for months and months, definitely through the end of this calendar year and into the next calendar...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honda is doubling down on rockets, robots, and flying cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RdLZS3Tb7c5gGhR-GQB7Kpirhks=/0x108:2581x1829/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930004/187513_Honda_e_and_Frankfurt_International_Motor_Show_2019.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NnKpGu"&gt;Honda is increasing its research and development spending in three futuristic areas: rockets, robots, and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOL), otherwise known as flying cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyHFk7"&gt;The automaker will spend $45 billion (5 trillion yen) on R&amp;amp;D over the next six years. But Honda won’t say what fraction of that amount will be spent on developing rockets, robots, and flying cars, nor even if it plans on pursuing those projects as commercial businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0r3WP"&gt;In fact, Honda sees robots, rockets, and eVTOL aircraft as an extension of its main business of manufacturing automobiles. If the company can get a better electric vehicle platform out of it, for example, then it will be worth the investment. Basically, it wants to see if it can...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i98rut"&gt;Amazon has settled a dispute with two workers that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367672/amazon-employees-climate-justice-nlrb-case-wrongful-termination"&gt;National Labor Relations Board said were fired for their activism&lt;/a&gt;. In April 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220353/amazon-covid-19-criticism-protest-fired-employees-cunningham-costa-climate-change"&gt;fired Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa&lt;/a&gt; after they had organized a protest against Amazon’s work with oil and gas companies, as well as raising concerns with the company’s coronavirus measures at its warehouses. &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15kVQrpyqH_sbtOXvQ38DeXZx7lwLAn3GVsZUDb6i0e8/edit"&gt;In a joint statement&lt;/a&gt;, Costa and Cunningham said that the company would have to pay them lost wages as well as inform employees that they couldn’t be fired for organizing. They haven’t mentioned whether they would be getting their jobs as UX designers back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czFgdX"&gt;At the time of the NLRB’s ruling, Amazon said that it disagreed with the findings, and that Costa and Cunningham had been fired...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is Facebook’s internal research on the mental health effects of Instagram</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hbaYAV"&gt;Facebook has shared the internal research about the impact of Instagram on teenage mental wellbeing reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported that the files showed Instagram knew the social media network has a negative affect on teens’ mental health. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;has pushed back&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’s&lt;/em&gt; characterizations of its research, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; “it is simply not accurate that this research demonstrates Instagram is ‘toxic’ for teen girls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSTY2F"&gt;The research slide decks are available on &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;Facebook’s newsroom here&lt;/a&gt;, split into two PDFs. We’ve also embedded the PDFs at the bottom of this story. Notably, the two PDFs have been annotated by Facebook in an effort to provide context.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo categorically denies that a 4K Switch Pro is in development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzndv147yiO9wZfKx_61I1fa9VI=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69929036/nintendo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f4M4eY"&gt;It is rare for a big company to come out and categorically deny an entire report, but that’s what Nintendo just did today — the Japanese corporate entity has issued a press release insisting that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/nintendo-switch-4k-developers-make-games-for-nonexistent-console?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s seeming revelation&lt;/a&gt; that Nintendo was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled"&gt;pushing developers to build 4K-resolution games&lt;/a&gt; for an upcoming but potentially canceled “Switch Pro” handheld was entirely incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNMMYO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1443366440183074819"&gt;Nintendo writes&lt;/a&gt; the report “falsely claims that Nintendo is supplying tools to drive game development for a Nintendo Switch with 4K support” and insists that it’s “not true.” Separately, it says that it has no plans for any new Nintendo Switch other than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview"&gt;the slightly refined OLED model&lt;/a&gt; that’ll be out next week.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rW7Egv"&gt;Several Chinese companies have filed a class-action complaint against Amazon for banning them from the Amazon marketplace over their use of paid reviews, a new complaint filed on September 13th claims. In the last year, Amazon has cracked down on companies soliciting paid reviews on its platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680269/amazon-ban-chinese-brands-review-abuse-fraud-policy"&gt;claiming to have permanently banned 600 Chinese brands&lt;/a&gt; across 3,000 seller accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SR7iBT"&gt;The companies listed in the complaint, doing business as Sopownic, Slaouwo, Deyixun, Cstech, Recoo Direct, Angelbliss, and Tudi, are seeking “recovery of funds that are being illegally and improperly withheld by Amazon” and are filing the class action to “stop any further misappropriation and misuse of funds that are legally and rightfully due to thousands of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA clears Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo for flight after probe into July incident</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P7FAry"&gt;Virgin Galactic is cleared to resume flights of its SpaceShipTwo space plane, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Wednesday, after capping a safety investigation into issues that came up during the company’s July flight carrying its founder Richard Branson. During that mission, SpaceShipTwo strayed from its designated airspace on its descent from space, and Virgin Galactic didn’t tell the FAA about it when it was supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXcghp"&gt;With the investigation now closed, the FAA required Virgin Galactic to make changes “on how it communicates to the FAA during flight operations to keep the public safe,” it said in a statement. Virgin Galactic said that includes “updated calculations to expand the protected airspace for future flights”...&lt;/p&gt;
