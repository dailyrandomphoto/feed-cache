    <title>Pixel 6’s rumored 23W wireless charging stand and more details leak early</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rvgrvH"&gt;Leaked images of Google’s upcoming Pixel 6 have given us our best look yet at new features coming to the search giant’s next flagship smartphone. The images, which were leaked by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446002191110639616"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;, reveal shots of a second generation Pixel Stand wireless charger, user interface details, and camera specs, and include a mention of face unlock biometric security. They’ve arrived a little under two weeks before the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are due to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;officially announced on October 19th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuaWIg"&gt;There’s not much in these pictures that hasn’t already leaked, but what they offer is a better look at the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s rumored features. The beefy new Pixel Stand, for example, is believed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22651097/google-pixel-6-pro-stand-23w-wireless-charging"&gt;support 23W fast charging&lt;/a&gt; according to an August leak,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Kinect is back, thanks to Sky’s new all-in-one TVs</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TGUqX6"&gt;Sky is resurrecting the original dream of Microsoft’s Kinect accessory next year. The British satellite broadcaster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714076/sky-glass-tv-streaming-service-uk-pricing-release-date"&gt;announced its new Sky Glass TVs&lt;/a&gt; this morning, and the company has built a separate 4K camera that includes motion controls and gestures support. It even works across games, and has a social TV sharing feature built in partnership with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ya2N3k"&gt;“Working with Microsoft we’re also building a fantastic feature that lets us watch TV together even if we’re miles apart,” explains Fraser Stirling, Sky’s chief product officer. “It syncs your TV with other households, with integrated video and chat on-screen, and you can choose content from the biggest channels — including Premier League matches, movies, and all your favorite...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s new Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro earbuds support high-quality LDAC audio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EJY-96XnjA31RFr171h-JJMWEfQ=/0x27:1399x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962872/F85E02CD_CC42_4CC2_86EB_2FF0ADB218EC.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bl6ETq"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore brand is today refreshing its flagship true wireless earbuds with the new $169.99 Liberty 3 Pros. Both the earbuds and their slider-style charging case look very similar to the Liberty 2 Pros, though the buds are 30 percent smaller and have an “air pressure relief structure” in their wingtips for added comfort. Anker has made more significant improvements to the features they offer: the new earbuds have active noise cancellation — you’d hope for as much at this price — and the “HearID ANC” system is optimized for efficiency and comfort. Anker says it monitors outside ambient noise while also taking in-ear pressure into account, so the level of ANC automatically adapts to the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGatIW"&gt;The dual-driver acoustic...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap is taking action to address fentanyl dealing on Snapchat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WuGqcuw-1OGdDzXHxYwHrIcFuGE=/0x0:911x607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962866/Heads_Up_Triptych___cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users will be directed to an educational portal if they search for certain keywords.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjFI6O"&gt;Snapchat has announced a series of measures it’s taking to counter drug dealing on its platform, and to educate users about the dangers of fentanyl and other drugs. When users search for drug-related keywords like “fentanyl,” Snap says it will direct them to a new educational portal called Heads Up. It’s also ramping up actions against drug dealers on its platform, including improved in-app reporting tools and proactive detection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cfb0Vq"&gt;The announcements follow a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/pills-bought-on-snapchat-deadly/index.html"&gt;investigation by &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into a spate of deaths involving teens and young adults who were suspected of having bought fentanyl-laced drugs through the social network. The report alleged that drug dealers are able to use Snapchat to find buyers, and that the platform isn’t...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sky’s new Glass TVs ditch satellite dishes for Wi-Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Su3sncNLg53FCTLJzGios1cm-ps=/469x0:5532x3375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962840/Sky_Glass___Racing_green___Home_page.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Glass TVs stream channels over Wi-Fi instead of satellite dishes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e5tGLM"&gt;British Satellite broadcaster Sky is moving away from the satellite dishes that have defined its TV service for decades. Sky Glass is launching today, an ambitious effort to sell television sets that stream Sky TV content over Wi-Fi directly to consumers. There’s no external box, no satellite dish, and no need for a soundbar. Sky calls the all-in-one TV “no fuss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0yBdX"&gt;Although announced for the UK today, Sky has global aspirations for Glass TV “built on technology borne of the collaboration as part of the Comcast Corporation.” As such, we might be looking at the platform underpinning Comcast’s rumored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685538/comcast-xclass-tv-sky-q-smart-tv-hisense-x1-operating-system"&gt;XClass TVs&lt;/a&gt; for the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Cloud Gaming is now fully powered by faster Xbox Series X hardware</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1m9G7M"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service (xCloud) is now fully powered by custom Xbox Series X hardware. Microsoft tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it recently completed the upgrade, which improves both framerates and game load times for players streaming Xbox games over the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHNjNb"&gt;While Microsoft has moved Xbox Cloud Gaming to 1080p and 60fps streams in recent months, the company has yet to unlock the full potential of custom Xbox Series X hardware to deliver 4K streams. It’s not clear when this will be available, but Microsoft has been moving towards delivering Xbox Cloud Gaming beyond just mobile devices and browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1WkLc"&gt;Microsoft is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527420/microsoft-xbox-tv-app-streaming-stick-xcloud"&gt;working on a dedicated Xbox app for TVs&lt;/a&gt; that will allow Xbox players to stream games without a console. Standalone...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="n692sJ"&gt;Syniverse, a telecom company that helps carriers like Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&amp;amp;T route messages between each other and other carriers abroad, disclosed last week that it was the subject of a possible five year long hack. If the name Syniverse sounds familiar, the company was also responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953422/text-messages-delayed-received-overnight-valentines-day-delay"&gt;the disappearance of a swath of Valentine’s Day text messages&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGv9U2"&gt;The hack in question was brought to light &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1839175/000119312521284329/d234831dprem14a.htm#toc234831_9"&gt;in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Syniverse published last week&lt;/a&gt;. In it, Syniverse shares that in May 2021 it “became aware of unauthorized access to its operational and information technology systems by an unknown individual or organization.” The company did its due diligence notifying law enforcement and conducting an...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix will edit phone numbers out of Squid Game following prank calls </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fh69lb"&gt;Netflix’s immensely popular &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; is getting an edit after phone numbers shown in the series dialed real numbers, leading to what the company described as “unfortunate” prank dials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjTnsa"&gt;The Korean drama about a sadistic “game,” in which players find themselves with no option but to participate in a series of twisted challenges, contains visible phone numbers in multiple scenes (a phone number is also clearly visible in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704313/sk-broadband-netflix-suing-for-payment-squid-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; trailer). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQklFG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-edit-squid-game-phone-number-after-woman-inundated-with-calls-2021-10-06/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; the news, cited Netflix and production company Siren Pictures as saying they purposefully did not include a complete number and weren’t aware the number shown would reach a real line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkKXoY"&gt;Netflix confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the numbers that appear in &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; will be...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i8C52N"&gt;Sony is making it a little bit harder to buy games digitally on the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Vita. Beginning October 27th, you won’t be able to use a credit card, debit card, or PayPal to purchase games or add money to your wallet on those systems, &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/important-notice/"&gt;according to a support document&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, you’ll have to use a PlayStation Store gift card or load up the wallet tied to your account on the PlayStation Store on the web, your phone, or on a PS4 or PS5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQzvwY"&gt;This disappointing change is the latest in something of an ongoing story of Sony’s support for its older consoles. In March, Sony announced it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356791/sony-playstation-store-close-ps3-vita-psp-game-downloads"&gt;closing the PlayStation Store for the PS3 and Vita&lt;/a&gt;, but it reversed that plan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22392126/sony-ps3-ps-vita-stores-open-backtrack-psp-july-2nd-mistake"&gt;a few weeks later&lt;/a&gt;, saying it “made the wrong decision.”...&lt;/p&gt;
