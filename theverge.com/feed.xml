    <title>HTC’s Vive Focus 3 update could free arcades from VR backpacks</title>

  &lt;p id="D5v4m7"&gt;HTC is adding &lt;a href="https://blog.vive.com/us/2021/11/11/introducing-new-features-vive-focus-3/"&gt;a few big updates&lt;/a&gt; to its Vive Focus 3 virtual reality headset, aiming to make it better for big, free-roaming multiplayer VR games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZdUSw"&gt;The Vive Focus 3 — a $1,300 non-consumer-focused wireless headset — is adding a new feature called Location Based Entertainment, or LBE Mode. LBE Mode greatly expands the headset’s tracking distance to 33 by 30 meters. Meanwhile, an additional feature called Map Sharing lets multiple headsets share the same virtual world in the same location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2D7Kn"&gt;Together, these features mean the Focus 3 can more easily support the group VR sessions you’d find at an immersive free-roam arcade space like Zero Latency or The Void. HTC has also added a few other options. There’s a mode that immediately calibrates the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors delays Endurance EV pickup after announcing Foxconn deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dw7xasOy3DvbaYZsP7Iquqb7XKE=/110x0:3050x1960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130173/Screen_Shot_2021_11_11_at_4.39.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gEHaB"&gt;Cash-strapped EV startup Lordstown Motors is delaying the launch of its electric pickup truck, the Endurance, one day after announcing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775168/foxconn-lordstown-motors-electric-vehicle-factory-trump-ohio"&gt;sale of its Ohio factory to iPhone assembler Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJigzW"&gt;Lordstown Motors said Thursday that it now plans to ship the Endurance in the third quarter of 2022, not the second as previously targeted, because of supply chain shortages. It &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;announced a third-quarter loss&lt;/a&gt; of $96 million and said it will finish the year with just $150 million to $180 million in cash — including a $100 million payment from Foxconn toward the purchase of the factory. Lordstown Motors is also still building pre-production versions of the truck at the Ohio factory despite saying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620787/lordstown-motors-q2-2021-earnings-gm-factory-production-manufacturing"&gt;as recently as August&lt;/a&gt; that it would be making...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The global chip shortage is a nightmare before Christmas</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fHMlPj"&gt;The global chip shortage has had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;massive effect&lt;/a&gt; on the entire technology industry for more than a year, but a wave of gaming hardware news over the past week and change has shown that things aren’t going to get better anytime soon. Gaming companies big and small are going to be feeling the sting well into next year, and it’s not just Sony and Microsoft’s next-gen consoles that could be hard to get a hold of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zl9b8"&gt;Nintendo was arguably the first to kick off the waterfall of news, revising its &lt;strong&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/strong&gt; sales forecast for the fiscal year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762933/nintendo-earnings-q2-2021-switch-sales-forecast"&gt;down by 1.5 million&lt;/a&gt; on November 4th “due to the effects of the global semiconductor shortage,” &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/211104_4e.pdf"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa elaborated further &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/211105_2e.pdf"&gt;in a Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt;, saying that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s unexciting 2021 Mac and iPhone software prove it should take a break from annual OS updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1qRq7SHCJLRJiiCNR0ulhJp0cwg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130116/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZnL4b"&gt;Apple’s fall software updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, are officially out in the world for everyone. But Apple’s latest software has arrived with more of a whimper than a bang; the two updates aren’t so much bad as they are &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;. Which has me wondering: why is Apple still clinging to its annual release schedule at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lXVnu"&gt;There are two problems that Apple’s annual cadence causes. The first, as is the case this year, is that iOS and macOS are increasingly mature operating systems with fewer issues to fix or missing features to add. Which, in turn, means that there are fewer opportunities for sweeping upgrades like there were in the early days when the iPhone getting copy and paste support was headline news. Short of Apple changing its...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is emailing out 50,000 Microsoft Store gift cards for the holiday season</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="znkudT"&gt;Double-check your inbox and your spam folder because Microsoft might have left something in there for you. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775341/microsoft-store-gift-card-email-promotion"&gt;a few people noticed gift cards for the Microsoft Store suddenly appearing via email&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has confirmed it sent out 50,000 of the codes to US customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2qx6t"&gt;Per a Microsoft spokesperson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dEPNd9"&gt;To help spread holiday cheer, Microsoft Store has surprised a total of 50,000 U.S. customers with virtual gift cards via email. 25,000 customers will receive a $100 Microsoft Gift Card while 25,000 others will receive a $10 Microsoft Gift Card ahead of this holiday season. These randomly selected recipients can redeem their gift card on Microsoft Store through December 31, 2021 and spend it within 90 days of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Ten top weather apps for Android phones</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="revCAV"&gt;One of the more popular uses for phones (besides taking photos and watching TikTok videos) is to check out the weather. As a result, there are myriad weather apps out there, making it really hard to pick which one to use. So we’ve put together this guide to what we think are some of the better ones out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcUkev"&gt;With the exception of one that used to be very well-liked: Dark Sky. Back in March 2020, Dark Sky was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;acquired by Apple&lt;/a&gt; and almost immediately removed from the Google Play app store. Originally, the Dark Sky API was going to be pulled as well — leaving a lot of third-party apps desperately looking for a substitute — but that’s been put off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527878/dark-sky-apple-ios-app-website-api-shut-down-end-of-2022"&gt;until at least the end of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. (By the way, if you use the iOS version of Dark Sky, that’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify is acquiring an audiobook company </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1EVy8u"&gt;Spotify has announced plans to acquire the audiobook services and distribution company Findaway for an undisclosed price. The company operates multiple businesses, including distributing audiobooks to various platforms and offering audiobook creation services under its business Findaway Voices. The company pairs authors with narrators, which could become a new and valuable source of revenue for Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M31AsA"&gt;It also makes Spotify both a commercial bookseller and a publisher of audiobooks, a title the company has been hesitant to accept for its podcasting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1js05"&gt;“With this acquisition, we’re going to be able to accelerate the addition of an audiobook catalog onto the platform so that users can effectively get all of the audio content that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using Apple Pay and Touch ID on an external Magic Keyboard can get complicated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mropuN"&gt;Publications like &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/11/apple-pay-doesnt-work-on-your-magic-keyboard/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have reported some odd behavior when trying to use Apple’s Magic Keyboard with Touch ID to authenticate for Apple Pay — specifically, that it won’t work if you’re trying to do it with a MacBook that has its display closed, as it would be while running it in “clamshell mode” hooked up to an external monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECgIvc"&gt;Obviously, when the MacBook’s lid is closed, you can’t use the built-in Touch ID sensor, so it’s easy to see how this limitation was put in place. But in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607386/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip"&gt;Apple sells an external keyboard with the sensor&lt;/a&gt; (starting at &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK293LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-us-english"&gt;an eye-watering $150&lt;/a&gt;), it’s an awkward limitation. That’s especially true given that the keyboard’s Touch ID functionality only works with Apple Silicon-powered Macs...&lt;/p&gt;
