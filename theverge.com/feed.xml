    <title>Fossil doesn’t plan to upgrade its existing watches to the new Wear OS </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fossil&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvt3Ci"&gt;Fossil executives Greg McKelvey and Steve Prokup &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fossil-is-planning-a-premium-google-watch-for-fall/"&gt;said in an interview with CNET&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s existing Wear OS watches won’t get upgraded to the new combined Wear software platform from Samsung and Google. Instead, Fossil is planning a premium watch that Prokup said would have “pretty major hardware upgrades,” and existing watches will probably be discounted as budget options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgL86r"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;CNET,&lt;/em&gt; Fossil’s Gen 6 watch should have features similar to upcoming watches from Google and Samsung, with faster performance, longer battery life, new chips, and LTE cellular options. “All of the software benefits that Google’s talking about and launching with the unified platform is something we’ll be building into that as well,” McKelvey said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter blocked in Nigeria after deleting a tweet by its president </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wq5AdK"&gt;Twitter is suspended “indefinitely” in Nigeria, “for the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence,” according to a statement (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FMICNigeria/status/1400843062641717249?s=20"&gt;threaded on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) from the country’s minister of information and culture. The move comes days after the platform &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/04/1003506918/nigeria-suspends-twitter-after-it-deleted-a-tweet-by-the-president"&gt;removed a threatening tweet&lt;/a&gt; by president Muhammadu Buhari which Twitter said violated its “abusive behavior” policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNfuo1"&gt;On Saturday, the office of Nigeria’s attorney general and ministry of justice said it would arrest and prosecute anyone who tried to get around the block, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/05/africa/nigeria-prosecute-twitter-users-intl/index.html"&gt;CNN reported&lt;/a&gt;, and directed government agencies to cooperate with prosecutors “to ensure the speedy prosecution of offenders without any further delay.” Several news...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Justice Department has charged a Latvian woman it says helped develop Trickbot malware</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3oO9u"&gt;The US Department of Justice has charged a Latvian woman for her role in allegedly developing the Trickbot malware, which was responsible for infecting millions of computers, targeting schools, hospitals, public utilities, and governments, the agency said &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization"&gt;in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3106W"&gt;The DOJ alleges that Alla Witte was part of a criminal organization known as the Trickbot Group that operated in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Suriname. She allegedly helped develop the malware which was used to enable ransomware demands and payments. Victims would receive a notice that their computers were encrypted, the DOJ said, and were directed to buy special software through a bitcoin address linked to the Trickbot Group to have their files decrypted. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square will invest $5 million to build solar-powered bitcoin mining facility</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MRGG5X"&gt;Financial services firm Square Inc. will partner with blockchain technology provider Blockstream Mining to build an open-source, solar-powered bitcoin mining facility, Blockstream &lt;a href="https://blockstream.com/2021/06/05/en-blockstream-and-square-inc-join-forces-for-solar-powered-bitcoin-mining/"&gt;announced in a press release&lt;/a&gt; Saturday. Square confirmed the news in a tweet, saying it was “committed to driving further adoption and efficiency of renewables within the bitcoin ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cboLyV"&gt;According to the release, Square will invest $5 million in the facility, which will be a “proof-of-concept for a 100% renewable energy Bitcoin mine at scale,” and will be built at one of Blockstream’s sites in the US. “We hope to show that a renewable mining facility in the real world is not only possible but also prove empirically that Bitcoin accelerates the world toward a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India reportedly warns Twitter of ‘unintended consequences’ if it fails to follow new rules</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K2BIW6"&gt;India’s government has told Twitter it could face “unintended consequences” if it fails to comply with the country’s new social media rules, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-twitter-comply-with-it-rules-or-face-unintended-consequences-2021-06-05/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; India’s technology minister wrote in a June 5th letter to Twitter that the company’s responses to previous government letters about the new rules did not confirm whether Twitter was in full compliance, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f38IJN"&gt;Under India’s Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/26/whatsapp-reportedly-sues-india-govt-says-new-media-rules-end-privacy.html"&gt;took effect in May&lt;/a&gt;, social media companies could be subject to legal action if they fail to follow the code’s provisions, which are aimed at regulating the platforms’ content.

    <title>Hackers reportedly used a compromised password in Colonial Pipeline cyberattack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Colonial Pipeline Storage Tanks" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06nE8mij9ZQwphFkgNfqJ3trOes=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69410925/1232834767.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dckft0"&gt;An analysis of the cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline found that the hackers were able to access the company’s network using a compromised VPN password, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The hack led to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443933/colonial-pipeline-ransom-4-million-hack-gas-shortage"&gt;ransomware payout of $4.4 million&lt;/a&gt;, and resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-gas-prices-hit-3-a-gallon-as-shortage-sets-in-amid-colonial-pipeline-shutdown-11620832180"&gt;gas prices around $3 per gallon&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in several years at US gas stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTOhAS"&gt;According to cybersecurity firm Mandiant, the VPN account didn’t use multi-factor authentication, which allowed the hackers to access Colonial’s network with a compromised username and password. It’s not clear whether the hackers discovered the username or were able to figure it out independently. The password was discovered among a batch of passwords leaked on the dark web, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7TtaW"&gt;The breach occurred...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cruise gets permit from California to provide passenger test rides in driverless vehicles</title>

  &lt;p id="NwdI3B"&gt;The California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) &lt;a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M387/K064/387064893.PDF"&gt;said Friday&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) it has authorized General Motors-owned self-driving vehicle company Cruise to provide driverless passenger service to the public in its robotaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNdgvL"&gt;The CPUC said Cruise is the first entrant in its driverless pilot program, which lets companies give test rides in vehicles without drivers. Under the terms of the program, Cruise may not charge passengers for the rides, and the company must submit quarterly reports to the CPUC about the vehicles’ operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xk04DI"&gt;Cruise has been testing its driverless vehicles in San Francisco, and last month &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-waymo-cruise-seek-permits-charge-self-driving-car-rides-san-francisco-2021-05-11/"&gt;applied for a permit&lt;/a&gt; that will allow the company to charge for autonomous rides and deliveries in the area. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;unveiled its Cruise...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvLENO"&gt;The FBI is trying to get a list of IP addresses, phone numbers, and other information on people who read a &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; article about the deaths of two of its agents (&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/03/usa-today-subpeona-florida-shooting-491847"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951.1.1.pdf"&gt;The subpoena&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) says it relates to a criminal investigation, and is seeking the information of readers who accessed the article in a specific 35-minute timespan, but it’s unclear who or what the Bureau is trying to track down. &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; is fighting back against handing over the information, calling the request unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PAM853"&gt;How can we possibly memorialize the brutal toll of COVID-19? It’s something I’ve been thinking about this week. The US observed Memorial Day on May 31, honoring people who died in military service. Artists, politicians, and activists are now starting to think about how to memorialize the more than 3.7 million people around the world who have died of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whaazx"&gt;Temporary memorials have already sprung up over the past 18 months, &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/11/coronavirus-deaths-covid-memorials-remembering-victims.html"&gt;with flags, painted hearts, and pictures honoring the dead&lt;/a&gt;. But plans for new, more permanent memorials are starting to take shape. Some are massive structures, others are quiet gardens, and still others will be incorporated into spaces already dedicated to memorializing people who have died. In the UK, plans are...&lt;/p&gt;
