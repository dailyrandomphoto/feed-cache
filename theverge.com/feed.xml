    <title>Signal is testing a payments feature that lets you send cryptocurrency to friends</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bYv2gU"&gt;Signal &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; it’s now testing a new peer-to-peer payments system in the beta version of its apps. Appropriately called Signal Payments, the new feature right now supports only one protocol: the MobileCoin wallet and its companion cryptocurrency MOB. MobileCoin has a close relationship with Signal co-founder and CEO Moxie Marlinspike, who advised the company prior to its &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/mobilecoin-a-cryptocurrency-involving-signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-just-raised-venture-funding/"&gt;most recent round of funding announced last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uc7YcI"&gt;“The first payments protocol we’ve added support for is a privacy focused payments network called MobileCoin, which has its own currency, MOB,” wrote Jun Harada, Signal’s head of growth and communication, in a &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “As always, our goal is to keep your data in your hands rather than ours; MobileCoin’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it’s no longer replenishing Oculus Rift S supplies</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fjAZn4"&gt;Facebook says Oculus Rift S headsets “generally” won’t be replenished as they disappear from store shelves, marking the end of the virtual reality system’s life span. &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/rift-s-dead"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, Facebook has confirmed that “generally speaking, as channels sell out of stock, they won’t be replenished moving forward.” The PC-tethered headset is unavailable through Oculus’ store, and it’s out of stock on retail platforms like Amazon and Walmart in the US, except from third-party sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyNG5W"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21422717/facebook-oculus-rift-s-discontinued-quest-2-vr-connect"&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt; that it would discontinue the Oculus Rift S in 2021. While the headset was a successor to the landmark Oculus Rift, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523941/oculus-rift-s-review-vr-headset-price-specs-features"&gt;compromised on features&lt;/a&gt; like screen resolution and refresh rate, particularly compared to high-end...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jimmy Fallon will play Among Us with streamers and the cast of Stranger Things in Twitch debut</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZpQzLf"&gt;Jimmy Fallon is making his Twitch debut on Tuesday evening in what promises to be some hilarious rounds of &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; with a star-studded group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5IYuv"&gt;Fallon will be joined by The Roots’ Questlove, Tariq Trotter, and Kirk Douglas; &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things &lt;/em&gt;stars Noah Schnapp (who plays Will Byers) and Gaten Matarazzo (who plays Dustin Henderson); streamers Sykkuno and Rachel “Valkyrae” Hofstetter; YouTuber Corpse Husband; and &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; developer InnerSloth’s community director, Victoria Tran. With so many big names participating, Fallon’s stream has the potential to be huge, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) two streams of &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526164/aoc-among-us-twitch-debut-top-concurrent-viewers"&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/aoc-returns-twitch-playing-among-us-jagmeet-singh-xqc-disguisedtoast/"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLap02"&gt;The group will be playing Tuesday starting at 6:45PM ET, and you can watch it &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jimmyfallon"&gt;on Fallon’s Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned Nvidia’s RTX Voice works on older GTX graphics cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nvidia geforce gtx 1080" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VUqOLwarugZW9PxNuJhow9X60Sg=/164x0:3676x2341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69083253/WwBCPl4.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6DceaT"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX Voice feature that eliminates background noises that would otherwise come through your microphone debuted exclusively on costly RTX graphics cards. My colleague Taylor Lyles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444508/nvidia-broadcast-download-rtx-voice-noise-app"&gt;wrote back in September 2020&lt;/a&gt; that the company patched RTX Voice software to run on older GeForce GTX, Quadro, or Titan-branded GPUs all the way back in September 2020, but I was just reminded of it today from &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/rtx-voice-works-on-pascal-maxwell-kepler"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4O5WU"&gt;Given that Nvidia’s newest RTX 30-series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;graphics cards are pricey and tough to find&lt;/a&gt; (as are just about any kind of somewhat capable GPU), this is a good way to extend the utility of older hardware if you don’t want to upgrade yet. If your graphics card is running Nvidia’s 410.18 driver, models down to the GTX 600-series released in...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="fEfH0Y"&gt;“Who do you blame for Yahoo Answers getting shut down?” reads &lt;a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20210405155122AA3yax3"&gt;one of the final queries&lt;/a&gt; ever submitted to the venerable advice service. As of press time, it has garnered more than 250 responses, all from those who’ve regularly doled out their imperfect observations to countless eighth-graders, chronic hypochondriacs, political firebrands, and curious stoners throughout the 15-year life span of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIs6ii"&gt;The premise of Yahoo Answers was simple: ask any question you want and receive solutions from anyone in the world. “[It] likely doesn’t turn a profit … instead of spending the money necessary to moderate they just decided to close the whole thing down,” theorizies a user named Bill, who has penned 11,182 of these answers during his career...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM is building an electric Chevy Silverado with 400 miles of range</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chevrolet 2019 Silverado Reveal Event Ahead Of The 2018 North American International Auto Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-xxH31jpEgUBjQihF3YmpsGaO4=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084057/904641536.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0m6wKY"&gt;General Motors just &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/apr/0406-factory0.html"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it’s making an all-electric version of the Chevy Silverado pickup truck, the company’s bestselling vehicle. The new truck will be powered by GM’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;new EV battery&lt;/a&gt; and will offer around 400 miles on a full charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izXau9"&gt;The company did not immediately say when the electric Silverado will go on sale, but GM president Mark Reuss said at an event on Tuesday that the company will also make commercial fleet-focused versions of the truck. GM has been &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34732462/gm-chevy-electric-truck-teased/"&gt;teasing an electric Silverado&lt;/a&gt; for months now. It previously said &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a31227446/chevy-electric-pickup-confirmed-2025/"&gt;it may not release a pickup EV until mid-decade&lt;/a&gt; and hadn’t officially announced the truck was coming until Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBPerP"&gt;The electric Silverado will be made at “Factory Zero,” the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;recently rebranded Detroit-Hamtramck...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wisk Aero accuses rival flying taxi firm Archer Aviation of ‘brazen theft’ in a new lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V2mVoR"&gt;Wisk Aero, a joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk, is suing rival air taxi firm Archer Aviation for allegedly stealing its trade secrets and infringing on its patents. Wisk is seeking unspecified monetary damages and an injunction against Archer to prevent it from using the allegedly stolen technology. In response, Archer says it has “no reason to believe” that it possesses any of Wisk’s intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this powerful story about how the internet never lets you forget</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="SRjWKo"&gt;The technology and social media we use every day constantly bombard us with things we’ve shared in the past or advertise to us based on who they think we are. Those past posts can be fun to relive, and every once in a while, those targeted ads do actually work. But &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; senior writer (and former &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer) Lauren Goode published &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/weddings-social-media-apps-photos-memories-miscarriage-problem/"&gt;a powerful and personal story&lt;/a&gt; about how these technologies can also haunt us with memories of times we may want to forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="takeBZ"&gt;In the essay, Goode describes how she called off her wedding in May 2019, and ever since, she has grappled with technology reminding her of her former relationship and the wedding that didn’t happen. Here is just one devastating passage: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QKXn3A"&gt;Social media and photo apps were by now full-on...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>YouTube claims it’s getting better at enforcing its own moderation rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DkGOSv04BaRdDsjLWYfvxFtdr8Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69083827/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dlrimL"&gt;YouTube wants the world to know that it’s doing a better job than ever of enforcing its own moderation rules. The company says that a shrinking number of people see problematic videos on its site — such as videos that contain graphic violence, scams, or hate speech — before they’re taken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHGKrz"&gt;In the final months of 2020, up to 18 out of every 10,000 views on YouTube were on videos that violate the company’s policies and should have been removed before anyone watched them. That’s down from 72 out of every 10,000 views in the fourth quarter of 2017, when YouTube started tracking the figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dnsPo7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The figure measures enforcement of YouTube’s own rules&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FfuGsm"&gt;But the numbers come with an important caveat: while they measure how well YouTube is doing at...&lt;/p&gt;
