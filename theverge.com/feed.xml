    <title>Apple Music for Android reveals lossless audio could be imminent</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vG0d0x"&gt;Apple might have bigger plans for next week than initially thought. The new iMac, iPad Pro, and Apple TV 4K are all set to start shipping to early preorder customers on or around May 21st, but now it seems there could be two surprise announcements: a hi-fi streaming tier of Apple Music, and maybe even AirPods 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3VVVA"&gt;The Apple Music part seems extremely likely when you factor in &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/14/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-streaming/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Digging into the latest Apple Music for Android beta app, they discovered direct references to high-resolution audio that didn’t exist previously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCJlbD"&gt;These are the prompts found in the app’s code, though they’re not user-facing quite yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KV8zLy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lossless audio files preserve every detail of the original file. Turning this on will consume significantly...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>A driverless Waymo got stuck in traffic and then tried to run away from its support crew</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GZ30lS"&gt;One of Waymo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;fully autonomous minivans&lt;/a&gt; got stuck at an intersection in Chandler, Arizona, prompting the company to send a roadside assistance team to come extract it. But when the crew arrived, the vehicle started to drive away before pulling over and completely blocking a three-lane road. It was a rare moment captured on video of one of Waymo’s driverless vehicles performing erratically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KifZs"&gt;The incident was recorded from inside the vehicle by Joel Johnson, who publishes videos on YouTube under the handle &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JJRicksStudios/featured"&gt;JJRicks Studios&lt;/a&gt; about his experiences using Waymo’s Level 4 autonomous vehicles, which operate without a safety driver behind the wheel. Johnson’s video is a rare unedited look at what happens when one of the world’s most proficient...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about how TikTok and apps are making Starbucks orders obnoxious</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeQUs3rUIAypzbYEBPxsK0f5cZk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69288888/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lV3rCC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;has &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/appuccino-tiktok-starbucks"&gt;published a great story&lt;/a&gt; that looks at the cultural phenomenon that was on display when &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/starbucks-viral-order-edward-b1845504.html"&gt;that picture of a mile-long Starbucks order&lt;/a&gt; (which included over 18 pumps of flavor) went viral earlier this month. It explores both the phenomenon of people ordering more customizations when using apps (something I know I’ve fallen prey to myself, though nowhere close to the extent displayed in the photo), as well as the world of TikTok Starbucks influencers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEuJMv"&gt;Wait, what? Starbucks influencers? If you, like me, had never heard of this corner of the internet, be prepared to read about TikTok teens and even some Starbucks employees on the platform coming up with drink recipes that can become so popular that some employees estimate they...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked renders reveal an even more affordable 5G Samsung phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ZAfjACwY8f9NyWLvRz0TSI92Eg=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69288778/a22_5g_render_91mobiles.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Images show what could become Samsung’s least expensive 5G phone, nabbing the A32 5G’s title.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: 91mobiles&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0akzLd"&gt;A new batch of leaked images shows what could become Samsung’s least expensive 5G phone yet: the Galaxy A22 5G. The Galaxy A32 5G currently holds that title at an already low $279. The images come from &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-a22-5g-4g-renders-specs-exclusive/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and match up with previous leaks hinting that the phone might be on its way with a 200,000 KRW price (~$180), though it may be only destined for India and parts of Asia in the immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNeDqF"&gt;The leaked images show two variants — 5G and 4G versions — with two slightly varied sets of specs. The 5G model will allegedly have a 6.4-inch LCD and a rear triple-camera array (probably a 48-megapixel main / macro / depth sensor combo). A MediaTek Dimensity 700 chipset looks likely, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/samsung-galaxy-a22-5g-spotted-on-geekbench/"&gt;previous &lt;em&gt;Geekbench&lt;/em&gt; leak&lt;/a&gt;, plus a substantial...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Late last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the fourth-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Itch.io is waiving all sales fees today for ‘Creator Day’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbhGdJ"&gt;Indie game storefront &lt;a href="http://Itch.io"&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt; is waiving sales fees on everything today, May 14th, as part of the company’s first &lt;a href="https://itch.io/blog/252069/announcing-the-first-itchio-creator-day"&gt;Creator Day&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone selling things on the diverse storefront (which includes everything from indie games to music to entire magazines) will be able to keep “100 percent of sales after taxes and payment processor fees.” It’s similar to Bandcamp’s monthly creator program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188143/bandcamp-waives-sales-fees-artists-affected-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;Bandcamp Fridays&lt;/a&gt; (although Itch.io hasn’t said on what schedule it’ll run the promotion in the future).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwNe5R"&gt;Itch.io is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/29/18118217/itchio-steam-leaf-corcoran-pc-games-indie"&gt;beloved by creators&lt;/a&gt; for being relatively easy to use and generally more transparent than other bigger game storefronts like Steam. It also takes a smaller cut than most other online game platforms: Itch.io traditionally only asks for 10 percent of...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NXmO8B"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKDtL1"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay and Dieter talk with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior reporter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/adi-robertson"&gt;Adi Robertson&lt;/a&gt; about the second week of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; trial, which involved a lot of arguing over the definition of a game and whether a banana should wear clothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hulilM"&gt;Both Nilay and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; writer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/monica-chin"&gt;Monica Chin&lt;/a&gt; have tried to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt;, Elon Musk’s space-based ISP. The results have been middling — and infuriating if you think too much about why everybody is so excited for Starlink in the first place.

    <title>Walmart confirms it is indeed still selling Pokémon cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Walmart DTD 555" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kJ4O4rdunWA3AnLF7uQkXSod2w4=/2x0:554x368/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69287642/walmart555.1419973090.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Walmart DTD 555&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1PfR9J"&gt;Contrary to published reports, Walmart confirmed in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Friday that it has not suspended the sale of any trading cards, including the Pokémon cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433236/target-halts-sale-pokemon-mlb-nba-nfl-trading-cards-may-14"&gt;that Target recently took off its shelves&lt;/a&gt;. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-13-pokemon-cards-pulled-from-target-and-walmart-due-to-safety-concerns"&gt;reports on social media&lt;/a&gt; of people seeing signs at Walmart stores indicating that the retailer would also no longer be selling the cards in stores, but it appears that’s not official policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DLyxi"&gt;There’s been a bit of a mania around Pokémon cards, and trading cards in general lately, with card rating companies being buried in “an avalanche of cardboard” as collectors try to up the value of their cards with an official grade. Apparently, the collectors’ market has people excited about buying new cards: the Pokémon...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Whale hugs, ‘active sea serpents,’ and the wild world of whale sex </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Northern Right whale" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/luI0npye8sJPGQLpGzs1tnKaf68=/9x0:5091x3388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69287370/639203570.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ebccv0"&gt;Adorable drone footage came out last week showing two right whales touching bellies and wrapping their flippers around each other — appearing to “hug.” It was a moment rarely caught on camera. Scientists still aren’t exactly sure what that behavior really means, but the moment is a window into the dramatic world of whale sex and conservation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="OhVKPN"&gt;The video that’s been released to the public was just one snippet of a series of footage from two drones that was captured on February 28th in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts.

    <title>Famicom Detective Club brings more great crime drama to the Switch</title>

  &lt;p id="p76AUx"&gt;There’s something about the Nintendo Switch that makes it a great fit for murder mystery stories. Just like a good novel, these are games best enjoyed while curled up in a comfy chair with a warm drink, ideally when it’s dark and rainy outside.
