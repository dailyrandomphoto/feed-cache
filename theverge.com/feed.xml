    <title>Kevin Hart signs deal with Netflix for four exclusive movies</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1vrj6"&gt;Netflix has signed &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/kevin-hart-along-with-hartbeat-productions-ink-exclusive-partnership-with"&gt;a multiyear deal with Kevin Hart&lt;/a&gt; and his production company HartBeat Productions for four exclusive films starring Hart and first dibs on films the comedy star develops with his company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YT7Rh"&gt;Hart partnered with Netflix most recently for his comedy special &lt;em&gt;Zero F**ks Given,&lt;/em&gt; which Netflix says was the “#1 Netflix comedy special in 2020,” but this new deal would bring the lucrative comedy star even deeper into the fold. Hart’s films have grossed a combined $4 billion in the global box office, according to Netflix, so taking advantage of that star power to draw users to the streaming service and keep them around makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UboHUV"&gt;Relying on recognizable comedy stars has been a successful formula for Netflix. Adam Sandler’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dickinson’s second season trades death for fame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wiM1UN0z03sOspJS7L9gwFDnlBU=/126x0:1314x792/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651910/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_3.21.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UK0uk6"&gt;Writing is often the domain of obsessives, and Emily Dickinson — at least, the witty, chaotic version of her portrayed by Hailee Steinfeld on Apple TV Plus’ &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt; — gives herself over to her obsessions fully. In the first season of the show, which is an irreverent, &lt;em&gt;Riverdale&lt;/em&gt;-style take on the life of the famed young poet, her obsession was Death, played by Wiz Khalifa. (Like I said: irreverent.) In the latest season, Steinfeld’s Emily is obsessed with fame. Lovers of dramatic irony have a lot to dig into here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brnbxJ"&gt;The new season of &lt;em&gt;Dickinson &lt;/em&gt;is a lot like the first: equal parts over-the-top comedy and earnest teen soap. But this time around, the show has a touch more restraint. It keeps the outrageous excess — &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt;’s second season...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Western Digital doubles the storage in its portable SSDs to 4TB</title>

&lt;p id="YtAgGE"&gt;The 4TB storage configuration will be available under Western Digital’s My Passport and WD_Black black brands, along with its subsidiary SanDisk’s Extreme series. All of the products will also include a five-year warranty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcCw24"&gt;Starting at $680, Western Digital’s My Passport SSD, which received a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/20/21376091/western-digital-my-passport-ssd-portable-storage-backup-second-gen-faster"&gt;model refresh last August&lt;/a&gt;, promises up to 1050MB/s read speeds and 1000MB/s write speeds. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite streamer TheGrefg broke Twitch records with more than 2 million concurrent viewers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ggXcy5"&gt;Spanish streamer and EU Heretics team owner &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegrefg"&gt;David “TheGrefg” Martínez&lt;/a&gt; smashed the concurrent record on Twitch today, with more than 2 million live viewers tuning in to watch him reveal his Icon series &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skin. His excitement was palpable, and viewers watched live as Martínez googled Twitch’s previous records on his own record-breaking stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12UEPM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s Icon Series skins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068938/fortnite-ninja-skin-icon-series-metaverse-tyler-blevins-ultimate-virtual-world-star-wars"&gt;are reserved for the game’s top creators&lt;/a&gt;, which include people like Kathleen “Loserfruit” Belsten and Tyler “Ninja” Blevins. As of this writing, &lt;a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Icon_Series_Outfits"&gt;there are only seven outfits in the series&lt;/a&gt;; Martínez’s would be the 8th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Samsung’s Galaxy S21 event</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pddNHN"&gt;Samsung’s next Unpacked event will kick off on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;January 14th at 10AM ET&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to copious leaks, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect from the big day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbAnaA"&gt;Samsung is widely expected to announce its next lineup of flagship phones, which will likely be called the S21, S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra. The S21 Ultra is rumored to have top-of-the-line specs, cameras, and, in a first for an S-model Galaxy phone, support for Samsung’s S Pen stylus. The S21 and S21 Plus are expected to have similar specs but differentiate in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jF9FUl"&gt;A new set of true wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds Pro, and a Tile-like item tracker, the Galaxy SmartTag, also seem like a lock. Rumors about both products have hit the web recently, and they each showed up in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s second-gen ultrasonic fingerprint reader is bigger and faster than the original</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2MjdJq"&gt;Qualcomm has just announced the 3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2, the latest version of its ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor that looks to improve on the original model in nearly every way. The new version offers a larger surface area for the sensor and faster processing to unlock phones even quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2Zuro"&gt;The company is making a big jump here: the new Gen 2 model measures 8mm x 8mm, compared to the 4mm x 9mm surface area of the first-generation model, for 77 percent more surface area. In turn, that means it’ll be easier to accurately place your finger on the sensor, and it allows for the sensor to collect more data with each scan. By combining the larger sensor with faster processing, Qualcomm promises that scanning a fingerprint to unlock a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC settles with photo storage app that pivoted to facial recognition</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9xZT0O"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has reached a settlement with photo storage app Ever that it says used customers’ photos to develop facial recognition technology without telling them, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/california-company-settles-ftc-allegations-it-deceived-consumers"&gt;the agency announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Wgdcd"&gt;Under the &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/everalbum_order.pdf"&gt;terms of the agreement&lt;/a&gt;, Everalbum Inc. is required to delete photos and videos of its users who deactivated their accounts, as well as any facial recognition algorithms developed with users’ photos or videos. The company also must delete all “face embeddings,” which it describes as “data reflecting facial features that can be used for facial recognition purposes” that were derived from users’ photos who didn’t give consent for their use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEB8AY"&gt;Everalbum, which &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/ever-once-accused-of-building-facial-recognition-tech-using-customer-data-shuts-down-consumer-app/"&gt;shut down Ever in August and rebranded itself as Paravision AI&lt;/a&gt;, is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ad-supported Hulu is only $2 for college students </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Hulu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rTvRkm"&gt;Keeping up with every single streaming service is an expensive affair, but Hulu is offering US college students a special discounted &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fstudent&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22225329%2Fhulu-college-student-discount-ads-watch-party-offline-download#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;plan at $2 a month&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, Hulu’s ad-supported plan costs $5.99 a month. The new student plan, which is an evergreen offer and will run for the same price as long as students can verify their continued enrollment, offers more than a 65 percent discount. Students can sign up for the offer now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBrUEO"&gt;Hulu has made offers like this in the past for general subscribers (not just college students), but those were limited time deals. Hulu’s &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2020/11/26/black-friday-2020-hulu-black-friday-deal-too-good-miss/6431679002/"&gt;Black Friday sale&lt;/a&gt;, for example, saw the cost go down to $2 a month for an entire year. These are all for ad-supported plans, though. Hulu’s ad-free plan remains much more...&lt;/p&gt;

Market research firm &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-global-pc-market-Q4-2020?ctid=1906-7fad0e51797053191ee1cfe45c29812b"&gt;Canalys reports&lt;/a&gt; that PC shipments reached 297 million units in 2020, up an impressive 11 percent from 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47274421"&gt;IDC puts the year&lt;/a&gt; at 302 million shipments, up 13.1 percent year over year. &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-01-11-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-grew-10-point-7-percent-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-2020-and-4-point-8-percent-for-the-year"&gt;Gartner also agrees&lt;/a&gt; that 2020 was a big year for PCs and the biggest growth we’ve seen since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aeyohg"&gt;PC shipments are up thanks to demand related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The networking company has announced what it’s calling an “industry-first” Wi-Fi 6 adapter built into a USB stick. Plug it into your laptop or desktop computer, and you may be able to get better performance than from your older Wi-Fi chip. The adapter advertises speeds up to 1,200Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
