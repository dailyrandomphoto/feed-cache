    <title>The FBI is trying to get IP addresses and phone numbers of people who read a USA Today article</title>

  &lt;p id="HvLENO"&gt;The FBI is trying to get a list of IP addresses, phone numbers, and other information on people who read a &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; article about the deaths of two of its agents (&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/03/usa-today-subpeona-florida-shooting-491847"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951.1.1.pdf"&gt;The subpoena&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) says it relates to a criminal investigation, and is seeking the information of readers who accessed the article in a specific 35-minute timespan, but it’s unclear who or what the Bureau is trying to track down. &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; is fighting back against handing over the information, calling the request unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wE4VfF"&gt;“We were surprised to receive this subpoena particularly in light of President Biden’s recent statements in support of press freedom.  The subpoena is also contrary to the Justice Department’s own guidelines concerning the narrow...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Memorials to honor COVID-19 dead begin to take shape</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PAM853"&gt;How can we possibly memorialize the brutal toll of COVID-19? It’s something I’ve been thinking about this week. The US observed Memorial Day on May 31, honoring people who died in military service. Artists, politicians, and activists are now starting to think about how to memorialize the more than 3.7 million people around the world who have died of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whaazx"&gt;Temporary memorials have already sprung up over the past 18 months, &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/11/coronavirus-deaths-covid-memorials-remembering-victims.html"&gt;with flags, painted hearts, and pictures honoring the dead&lt;/a&gt;. But plans for new, more permanent memorials are starting to take shape. Some are massive structures, others are quiet gardens, and still others will be incorporated into spaces already dedicated to memorializing people who have died. In the UK, plans are...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter blocked in Nigeria after deleting a tweet by its president </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wq5AdK"&gt;Twitter is suspended “indefinitely” in Nigeria, “for the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence,” according to a statement (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FMICNigeria/status/1400843062641717249?s=20"&gt;threaded on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) from the country’s minister of information and culture. The move comes days after the platform &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/04/1003506918/nigeria-suspends-twitter-after-it-deleted-a-tweet-by-the-president"&gt;removed a threatening tweet&lt;/a&gt; by president Muhammadu Buhari which Twitter said violated its “abusive behavior” policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67sf2I"&gt;The statement from Minister Lai Mohammed did not mention the deleted tweet, or what form the suspension would take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mYudQd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>The Supreme Court pared down a controversial anti-hacking law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Supreme Court Releases Opinions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6JRemP_2WR-Evf0-bousC1LiQu4=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69410461/1319807308.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="76uI31"&gt;The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), a controversial anti-hacking law which bans “exceeding authorized access” on a computer system, was narrowed by the Supreme Court on Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-783_k53l.pdf"&gt;in a 6-3 ruling&lt;/a&gt;. The court said the law shouldn’t cover people misusing systems they’re allowed to access — and that claiming otherwise would criminalize a “breathtaking amount” of everyday computer use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08PEaS"&gt;The court case, &lt;em&gt;Van Buren v. United States&lt;/em&gt;, concerns a former Georgia police officer named Nathan Van Buren. Van Buren accepted $5,000 in exchange for looking up a woman’s license plate in a police database. (The deal was actually an FBI sting operation, and the plate number was fictitious.) Because the exchange violated department rules, prosecutors said...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says Bing’s ‘Tank Man’ censorship was a human error</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5bDTkb"&gt;On Microsoft’s search engine Bing, searching for “Tank Man,” the iconic figure from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, turned up no image results in the United States for part of Friday. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8v9m/bing-censors-tank-man"&gt;Vice was able to produce the same results&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and heard from multiple users from other countries who ran into the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLTXln"&gt;Stranger still, searching “Tank Man” or “Tiananmen Square Tank Man” turned up normal search results in Bing, it’s just images that were mysteriously missing. When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted Microsoft for an explanation, it said “&lt;em&gt;This is due to an accidental human error and we are actively working to resolve this.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rit5s"&gt;Apple employees are pushing back against a new policy that would require them to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Staff members say they want a flexible approach where those who want to work remote can do so, according to an internal letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FS3kub"&gt;“We would like to take the opportunity to communicate a growing concern among our colleagues,” the letter says. “That Apple’s remote/location-flexible work policy, and the communication around it, have already forced some of our colleagues to quit. Without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; being a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok says the repeat removal of the intersex hashtag was a mistake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yp5JK2SsRPG3dGrnOGaImYPkUEo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69408728/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvqKBf"&gt;Pidgeon Pagonis, an intersex activist, noticed last week that the #intersex hashtag wasn’t working on TikTok. They couldn’t click the tag on one of their own posts and trying to search for intersex pulled up a “null” page. This was the second time Pagonis noticed the tag disappearing, and they worried that TikTok had banned it just as they were about to start a series of celebratory videos called Intersex Joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDvsUT"&gt;Pagonis usually feels safe on TikTok because people on the platform are generally receptive to intersex topics. After growing up with secrecy, lies, and shame around being intersex, Pagonis sees TikTok and other platforms as spaces where intersex people “can connect with each other and also advocate for ourselves and each other,...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="xIcCCe"&gt;Linux gamers using Valve’s Proton compatibility tool to run Windows games will be getting a performance upgrade in the future: Nvidia has announced that it’s working with Valve to bring FPS boosts using its DLSS technology featured on its RTX cards. It’s almost enough to make me want to revisit Linux gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMlmCl"&gt;DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, is a technology that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;lets gamers get more performance&lt;/a&gt; without having to give up too much image quality. It does this by running the game at lower-than-native resolution (say, rendering the game at 1080p when your monitor is 4K), but then upscaling the image to native resolution using some mightily impressive algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lF3KWd"&gt;The tech will, of course, be exciting for people with Linux gaming...&lt;/p&gt;
