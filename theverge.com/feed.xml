    <title>Six Days in Fallujah publisher now says the game is ‘inseparable from politics’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MfOP9x"&gt;Nearly a month after distancing itself from political statements, the publisher of the controversial military shooter &lt;em&gt;Six Days in Fallujah &lt;/em&gt;has backtracked and now says the events in the game are “inseparable from politics.” The game, which takes place during the Iraq War’s Second Battle of Fallujah, has come under scrutiny for seemingly portraying a US-centric focus on a campaign in which an estimated 800 Iraqi civilians were killed, &lt;a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1967340_1967350_1967530,00.html"&gt;according to the Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vR0Cw"&gt;“We understand the events recreated in &lt;em&gt;Six Days in Fallujah&lt;/em&gt; are inseparable from politics,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VicturaGG/status/1368924485676527623"&gt;publisher Victura said in a statement on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “We believe the stories of this generation’s sacrifices deserve to be told by the Marines, Soldiers, and civilians who were there,”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Zuckerberg says realistic avatars are Facebook’s next big VR bet</title>

  &lt;p id="ylVt8p"&gt;Facebook’s future virtual reality headsets should capture users’ facial expressions for more realistic digital avatars, says CEO Mark Zuckerberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pptj0H"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-on-mind-reading-apple-and-the-race-to-mainstream-vr?utm_source=ti_app"&gt;In a podcast interview for &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Zuckerberg expounded on the next decade in virtual and augmented reality, including future Oculus VR devices. “One of the things that I’m really excited about for future versions is getting eye tracking and face tracking in, because if you’re really excited about social presence, you want to make sure that the device has all the sensors to really kind of animate realistic avatars so you can communicate well like that,” Zuckerberg says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WWE Network on Peacock: your questions answered</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3e5QbY6TJgd478gk57EQigugNE=/0x13:2040x1373/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68930505/wwepeacock.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Peacock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmBCSE"&gt;Peacock is sharing more details today about how it will integrate WWE’s enormous selection of content later this month when WWE Network becomes part of the NBCUniversal streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyXLOg"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248330/wwe-network-peacock-move-announced-date-price"&gt;announced in January&lt;/a&gt;, WWE’s new portal will launch on Peacock starting on March 18th. The standalone WWE Network app will shut down in the United States a few weeks later on April 4th. That means current subscribers will be able to use the old app for WWE’s upcoming &lt;em&gt;Fastlane&lt;/em&gt; pay-per-view this month if they want. But come &lt;em&gt;WrestleMania 37&lt;/em&gt;, which is happening on April 10th and 11th, Peacock will be the only choice. There’s no way to transfer a WWE Network subscription over to Peacock, but the company is offering wrestling fans &lt;a href="https://imp.i305175.net/c/482924/896950/11640?sharedid=VergeWWENetworkonPeacock03082021&amp;amp;utm_campaign=20200101evergreen&amp;amp;cid=20200101evergreenpdaffil001&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2FWWE"&gt;an exclusive deal&lt;/a&gt; to help...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hummer’s electric SUV will be revealed on April 3rd</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: GM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C1ADPX"&gt;General Motors will reveal an SUV version of its all-electric Hummer EV on April 3rd, the company announced. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;The automaker unveiled the pickup truck version&lt;/a&gt;, with 350 miles of range and a host of high-tech features, last October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub8cTc"&gt;GM, which is producing the electric Hummers under its GMC brand, wouldn’t say when the SUV is expected to go into production. The electric pickup truck will start assembly at the end of this year, with the highest spec trim level available to customers first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JdLgL4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company is highlighting the EV’s off-roading capabilities as a way to align with the all-important truck market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j53aMb"&gt;GMC also &lt;a href="https://media.gmc.com/media/us/en/gmc/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/mar/0308-hummer.html"&gt;showed off its pre-production Hummer EV&lt;/a&gt; handling some snowy conditions in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The company is highlighting...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish will acquire Republic Wireless to boost adoption of its 5G network</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XzUfOf"&gt;Satellite television provider Dish Network has announced its plan to acquire cell carrier Republic Wireless, &lt;a href="https://about.dish.com/2021-03-08-DISH-to-acquire-Republic-Wireless"&gt;Dish said on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The acquisition, when it closes, will give Dish roughly 200,000 wireless customers to help boost its 5G network, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;Dish plans to launch later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Dish says Republic Wireless customers won’t see any immediate changes to their plans and won’t have to take any action on their accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADtNcx"&gt;Dish became a major player in the telecom business last year when it finalized its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;purchase of Sprint’s Boost Mobile business&lt;/a&gt; for $1.4 billion, as part of a sale Sprint was required to make to merge with T-Mobile. Dish has since signaled its intentions to launch a 5G...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People who are vaccinated can socialize together without masks, CDC says</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="apNvd1"&gt;People who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can gather indoors with other vaccinated people without masks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said today. The recommendation is part of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html"&gt;long-awaited guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for how people who have received the shots can adjust their behavior. People who are vaccinated should still wear masks when they’re in public and while interacting with people who have not been vaccinated. They should also avoid large gatherings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TiOw9F"&gt;“A growing body of evidence now tells us that there are some activities that fully vaccinated people can resume at low risk to themselves,” CDC director Rochelle Walensky said during a press briefing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="KOmFla"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id="UIhQTX"&gt;When you can’t find exactly what you want — whether that’s the perfect e-bike, the right size knitting pattern, or a much-needed support network — the DIY movement has an answer: create it yourself. This collection of stories looks at where the DIY ethos is popping up in 2021, from players looking to make video games more accessible for themselves to a family mounting their own campaign to help find a missing person.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="esBC7P"&gt;HeheStreams offers customers live broadcasts of every NBA game on television, so long as they follow these three easy steps. First things first; buy a $100 Amazon gift card. Next, where you’re supposed to fill out the email address and name of whoever it’s for, put in your own information. “Make no mention of HeheStreams, please,” asks the site’s owner. “We are not able to accept gift cards sent to us directly.” After completing the transaction, copy and paste the Amazon code that has arrived in your email account into an entry field on the HeheStreams website. The owner will also process Paypal and credit card transactions, but this, by far, is the preferred method. Once approved, the floodgates open up. Voila, basketball heaven,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vp4Bt"&gt;In view of all this, we’ve tried to gather as much helpful information as we can about ways to research and snag vaccination appointments for yourself and others. We’ll update this as more information presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYv8ZW"&gt;Research the vaccination qualifications in your state&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Sony’s WH-CH710N noise-canceling headphones are half off</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IMpHNX"&gt;Not all of Sony’s noise-canceling over-ear headphones are costly. You can get a good deal today on the WH-CH710N in either gray or black at Best Buy. At Amazon, you can find those colors, with an additional blue-colored option. Each store is selling this model for $98 instead of $200, which is $10 shy of the best-ever price during Black Friday 2020.
