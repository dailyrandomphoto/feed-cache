    <title>Virgin Galactic spaceplane VSS Unity completes successful flight</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbGNaU"&gt;Virgin Galactic completed its first successful space flight in more than two years on Saturday, with its crewed VSS Unity spacecraft carried to an altitude of more than 44,000 feet before gliding safely back to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJfZWr"&gt;Virgin’s VMS Eve carrier aircraft took off from Spaceport America in New Mexico at about 10:35AM ET with Unity aboard. About 10 minutes before its release, Unity switched to its own battery power, and conducted flight control and electrical checks. Once released by Eve, Unity’s pilots C.J. Sturckow and Dave Mackay ignited the rocket motor, then shut it down a few minutes later, with the spacecraft’s momentum keeping it traveling toward its apogee, or highest point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyKm2o"&gt;Unity reached apogee at about 11:30AM ET, did a slow...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says HomePod and HomePod Mini will support lossless audio after future update</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sD5nPS"&gt;In a new support document on its website, Apple &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212183"&gt;dives a little deeper into the details&lt;/a&gt; around the upcoming launch of lossless audio on Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxkEOt"&gt;Apple now says that both the HomePod and HomePod Mini will support lossless audio after a future software update. That’ll be good news to people who’ve invested in one or a pair of Apple’s smart speakers. Two HomePods grouped in stereo playing a lossless source? Yeah, that’s going to sound wonderful. Apple isn’t yet giving any timetable for when this software update will be released, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIusvP"&gt;The document also clarifies that the Apple TV 4K will only support standard lossless audio when the ALAC files become available in June. Apple has said that in most cases, the “Hi-Res Lossless” tier...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook’s Fortnite trial testimony was unexpectedly revealing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlLa-l7Gi7acAzhS7HlzqN7CSsE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328196/1233030839.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkoY2d"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial was bookended by Tims. Epic Games called its CEO Tim Sweeney as the first witness nearly three weeks ago. Yesterday, Apple called Tim Cook as the last to take the stand, before both sides make their final case to a judge on Monday. Cook was supposed to bring home Apple’s defense of its ecosystem. He did it by laying out Apple’s most high-minded principles — but also its hard financial calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGpgYJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; covers two separate issues: whether the market for in-app purchases within the App Store is unfairly monopolistic, and whether iOS &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is a monopoly that should be opened up to third-party stores and side-loaded apps. Cook addressed both with an appeal to user safety and privacy. “Privacy from our point...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RjUFa0"&gt;The 2021 &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship will be held in Shenzhen, China, &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/article/2021-league-of-legends-worlds-final-date-venue-set/bltb734e254ca2378e3"&gt;Riot Games announced&lt;/a&gt; late Friday. The Worlds Final will be at the Universiade Sports Centre, a 60,000 capacity stadium that’s home to the Shenzhen FC football (soccer) club, on November 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMCgUS"&gt;“We’re extremely excited to push the boundaries of entertainment and sport this year with Worlds 2021 and define the next 10 years of LoL Esports,” John Needham, Global Head of Esports for Riot Games said in a statement. “Shenzhen is China’s most competitive and innovative city with thousands of high-tech startups and entrepreneurial pursuits, so we felt that it was the perfect landscape to host our Finals.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Home Sick Pilots is a haunted house story with a punk rock edge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6t0OaZk0kPPMXHQ0WsSC8WqUBU=/0x387:585x777/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328089/home_sick_pilots_vol_1_teenage_haunts_tp_74bfafdd45.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKeCle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This biweekly &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nATKX"&gt;Haunted house stories are usually pretty dreary. It helps with the horror: a bleak old house covered in shadows so that you can’t see what’s around the corner. But &lt;em&gt;Home Sick Pilots&lt;/em&gt; goes in a different direction. It’s still dark and spooky, but it’s also incredibly vibrant — thanks in large part to its punk rock edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="500PJR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Home Sick Pilots&lt;/em&gt; is an ongoing series from Image Comics — the run is currently five issues deep — about a girl named Amida, her band, and a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Time, money, and the new vaccination push </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Florida Vaccination Effort Aims To Vaccinate Migrant Workers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MfPXBp4QmIjP02MhTam0AC5rKk=/0x42:3000x2042/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69327914/1319098831.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ydFcBe"&gt;In the US, COVID-19 vaccines are free, but it turns out that money is still a big barrier to vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cQ39l"&gt;See, even though the vaccines don’t cost a thing, it still takes time to go and get a shot and potentially recover from any side effects. For working adults, that may mean taking time off work — and that isn’t something that everyone can afford to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="hbr6vl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmWA18"&gt;Black and Hispanic people are particularly concerned about the tradeoff between missing work and getting the vaccine, according to new &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/how-employer-actions-could-facilitate-equity-in-covid-19-vaccinations/"&gt;results from&lt;/a&gt; research published by the Kaiser Family Foundation this week. People in both demographics are more likely than their white counterparts to work lower-paying jobs, which may not offer as much paid leave for things like illness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ggjBw"&gt;Those...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Transgender’ will be among more than 350 new tags Twitch is adding next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozLTd4"&gt;Starting next week, streaming platform Twitch will add more than 350 new community tags to its platform related to gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ability, and mental health, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/05/21/celebrate-yourself-and-your-community-with-350-new-tags/"&gt;new blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The list of tags will include transgender, Black, disabled, veteran, and Vtuber, Twitch said, and it will remove the “ally “ references from its LGBTQIA tag, in favor of a new standalone ally tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nniZUu"&gt;The platform thanked its trans community for pushing for a transgender tag, and admitted “the simple truth is we should have done this sooner.” &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/25/21176485/twitch-trans-streamers-discoverability-tags"&gt;Twitch reportedly had resisted adding a transgender tag&lt;/a&gt; over concerns about targeted harassment. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mvxu3u"&gt;China became the second country to successfully deploy a vehicle on Mars on Saturday, and the first to do so on its inaugural visit to the Red Planet. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/china-says-martian-rover-takes-first-drive-surface-red-planet-2021-05-22/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the solar-powered Zhurong rover drove down the ramp of its landing capsule on to the surface of Mars at about 10:40 AM Beijing time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lohqey"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436072/china-tianwen-1-mars-landing-zhurong-rover"&gt;Zhurong first landed on Mars&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month and started its journey on Mars’ surface on Utopia Planitia, a smooth plain where NASA’s Viking 2 lander touched down in 1976. That’s more than 1,200 miles from the Jezero Crater where the US rover &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Perseverance touched down in February&lt;/a&gt;. A third rover, NASA’s Curiosity, which landed on Mars in 2012, was spotted by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/mars-rover-curiosity-on-mont-mercou-orbit-photo"&gt;climbing up Mars’ Mont Mercou&lt;/a&gt; last month, &lt;em&gt;S...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
