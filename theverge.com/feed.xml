  &lt;p id="NZW5kE"&gt;Today, let’s talk about one of Apple’s many announcements this week at its Worldwide Developer Conference, which some see as a possible threat to the rise of journalism distributed by email. If that sounds self-indulgent, given that it’s coming from a journalist who distributes his work via email, I apologize. But it touches on so many of the subjects of interest to us here — a tech giant’s ability to reshape markets to its liking; how journalism will navigate the platform era; what we mean when we talk about privacy — that I hope I can pique your interest at least a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xb0lpy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wnk4BD"&gt;Start with the announcement. On Monday at WWDC, Apple announced&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DIn%2520the%2520Mail%2520app%252C%2520Mail%2Cused%2520to%2520determine%2520their%2520location.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22525195%2Fapple-mail-protection-privacy-pixel-tracking-newsletters-substack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Mail Privacy Protection&lt;/a&gt;, which will limit the amount of data that people who send you emails can...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate approves billions for US semiconductor manufacturing</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="spHDan"&gt;After months of political jockeying and procedural hurdles, the Senate approved a massive science and technology bill Tuesday to boost US competitiveness with China. The bill invests billions into emerging technology industries like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and quantum computing in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrtDCD"&gt;The bill — titled the US Innovation and Competition Act or USICA — builds off a previous proposal from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called the &lt;a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/majority-leader-schumer-senator-young-and-representatives-khanna-and-gallagher-introduce-endless-frontier-act-with-12-bipartisan-senators-and-5-representatives-to-dramatically-increase-us-investment-and-leadership-in-science-and-tech-innovation-strengthen-economic-and-national-security-and-keep-the-us-strategically-competitive-with-china-and-other-countries"&gt;Endless Frontier Act&lt;/a&gt;. Endless Frontier was lauded as one of the first big bipartisan bills to come from the Biden administration. But over the last few months, the bill, which was seen as a must-pass piece of legislation for both parties, was bloated with political mush and much...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple brought back the beloved magnifying glass for selecting text in iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJNnS9HAWzSLl1uJNOW2sgwHw_s=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424709/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="elQ9Cv"&gt;Apple’s text selection &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-brings-back-the-magnifying-glass-for-accurate-text-selection/"&gt;magnifying glass has reappeared&lt;/a&gt; in the iOS 15 beta, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22524824%2Fapple-ios-15-iphone-text-selection-magnifying-glass-reversal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s own site&lt;/a&gt; confirms its return by listing it as a feature. Bringing the feature back is a reversal from when Apple made the decision to dump it in iOS 13, which is a bit of a rare occurrence: Apple doesn’t usually go back after it’s done away with something (bringing back scissor switches in its keyboards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;after years of butterfly switches&lt;/a&gt; is a notable exception). The return of the little pop-up is welcome, though: I can only speak for myself, but since iOS 13’s release, I’ve constantly been struggling without the helpful little magnifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YC5WA3"&gt;The new version of the text magnifier seems to be a bit smaller than the old one (in case you’ve forgotten what it...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The IRS wants more authority to collect data on cryptocurrencies</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7BKDMN"&gt;The Internal Revenue Service asked Congress for more authority to request reporting on the transactions of cryptocurrency exchanges and brokers on Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/irs-chief-asks-congress-for-authority-to-get-cryptocurrency-data?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The IRS hopes to use the data it collects to develop regulations for the fast-growing crypto industry — if it’s able to get the space’s biggest players to comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRkMp4"&gt;The organization made the request during the Senate Finance Committee’s hearing on the &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/the-irss-fiscal-year-2022-budget"&gt;IRS’s proposed Fiscal Year 2022 budget&lt;/a&gt;. IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said that the group is challenged frequently in its requests for reporting and “to have a clear dictate from Congress on the authority of [it] to collect that information is critical.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US wants to fix its broken lithium battery supply chain  </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;This photo taken on March 12, 2021 shows workers at a factory for Xinwangda Electric Vehicle Battery Co. Ltd, which makes lithium batteries for electric cars and other uses, in Nanjing in China’s eastern Jiangsu province.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by STR/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldMZxw"&gt;The US announced plans to build out a domestic supply chain for lithium batteries, which are critical for electric vehicles and renewable energy. Its new goal is to be able to do nearly everything — from mining to manufacturing and recycling batteries — within its borders by the end of the decade. If it fails, the US could struggle to meet its own&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;climate goals and compete in the growing electric vehicle&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8N5wxn"&gt;The Department of Energy (DOE) released a “&lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/national-blueprint-lithium-batteries"&gt;national blueprint&lt;/a&gt;” today outlining how it plans to boost America’s ability to make lithium batteries. Demand for these&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;batteries has already skyrocketed for electronics and electric vehicles. Spruced-up electricity grids will also need large&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;batteries to accommodate increasing amounts...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google TV just got a much cheaper streaming option for its live TV guide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VLqEeX"&gt;Google TV, which offers one of the cleanest streaming experiences to cord-cutters, just vastly improved its live TV options — which is to say, users actually have options now. While the “Live” tab was previously limited to Google’s own pricey live TV streaming service, YouTube TV, the company has introduced a cheaper alternative with a Sling TV integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huFQBb"&gt;The companies confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the added support for Sling TV marks the first non-Google live TV integration for the platform, and that’s significant. While quite good, YouTube TV costs $65 per month before any additional add-ons or entertainment subscriptions like Starz or HBO Max offered through the service. Sling TV, meanwhile, starts at $35 per month for either of its...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s password-protected photos feature is arriving on newer Pixels</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jhmjoj"&gt;Google’s Locked Folder feature, which allows you to password-protect specific images or videos to keep them from showing up in your main photo library, is available in the latest Pixel update, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/07/june-pixel-feature-drop-2021/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/10694388"&gt;Google’s page explaining Locked Folder&lt;/a&gt; says the feature is only currently available on Pixel devices, starting with the 3. When it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442416/google-photos-locked-folder-private-hidden-pictures"&gt;announced the feature at its I/O conference&lt;/a&gt;, Google said that it would be coming to other Android phones “throughout the year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eA6snZ"&gt;If you’ve got an updated Pixel, you can set up the Locked Folder by going to Photos, then to Library &amp;gt; Utilities &amp;gt; Locked Folder. Once it is set up, this is where you’ll be able to see your secret stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The six-year-old iPhone 6S will get iOS 15, and that rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bBUoFOzgTMz04ihhp5021RnhETM=/196x0:2305x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424126/iphone_6s_plus_clean_2_7.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus arrived in September 2015 running iOS 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1ydGZS"&gt;The iPhone 6S will turn six years old this September, an eternity in phone years. If you’ve managed to hold onto one this long, then Apple has some good news for you — your phone will be eligible for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15 upgrade&lt;/a&gt; when it arrives for the public this fall. The iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, and first-generation iPhone SE, which all shipped with iOS 9, will be among the oldest devices to receive the OS update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUWzSX"&gt;Six years is an awfully long life span for a mobile device, and certainly puts the 6S in the running for the longest supported phone to date. The iPhone 5S was five years old when it got its last OS update with iOS 12 but wasn’t eligible for iOS 13. On the Android side, Samsung has made recent moves to improve its device longevity by...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Screen Time to keep your iPhone use within healthy limits</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71fUVO"&gt;We all spend a lot of time on our phones, and it’s possible — just possible — that some of us spend too much time. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17870126/ios-12-screen-time-app-limits-downtime-features-how-to-use"&gt;we ran an article&lt;/a&gt; explaining how to use what was then Apple’s brand-new Screen Time feature, which was built in order to help people keep their on-screen time in some sort of sane proportion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4g5Gbf"&gt;At the time (which was when iOS 12 came out), you could use Screen Time to check how much time you spent on your phone, use an App Limits feature to limit your (or your kids’) daily time spent on various apps or types of apps, or use its Downtime feature to cut off access to all (except a few) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
