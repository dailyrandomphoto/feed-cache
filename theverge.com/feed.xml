    <title>Dropbox adds new file conversion tools and faster camera backups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_mg2UFkYmi-MBtDJ8h1bZSvEkgo=/0x0:4800x3200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69605470/Camera_uploads.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Camera uploads should now be faster and more reliable.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dropbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GtBlqQ"&gt;Dropbox is getting a slew of interface tweaks alongside new tools and features. One of the more useful inclusions is a new file conversion feature, which lets Dropbox users convert images between different formats like JPEG and PNG, and files into PDFs. Support for video conversion is coming soon. Dropbox is also adding new features to its password manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asMISF"&gt;Automatic camera backups from mobile, which will now be available to users on Dropbox’s free tier, are also seeing some improvements. Dropbox says uploads should now be faster and more reliable, and on iOS there’s now an option to specify exactly which folders should be automatically backed up (the feature is coming to Android later this year). There’s also the option to have photos...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe releases Apple M1 support for Premiere Pro</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0WNEnL"&gt;Adobe’s Premiere Pro is now ready for everyone using an M1 Mac. Support for Apple’s new chips is rolling out today, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22192979/adobe-arm-m1-mac-apple-silicon-premiere-pro-beta"&gt;launching in beta&lt;/a&gt; in December. Adobe says there are speed increases throughout the app, from a 50 percent faster launch to 77 percent faster “editing,” whatever that giant term encompasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbQa8X"&gt;Apple released its first computers with M1 chips in November. Though they’re able to run apps that were built for machines with Intel processors, programs had to be updated to take full advantage of the M1’s speed improvements. Getting Adobe on board was always going to be a necessity — its apps are critical creative tools for many industries — and fortunately, Adobe has been fairly quick to get updates out the door for its biggest...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Max are cheaper than ever at Best Buy and Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tt27Ij"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; over-ear headphones are more affordable than ever today at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746747840673268260#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Normally around $500 in recent weeks, each color option costs $455 (Best Buy has each color for this price, while Amazon’s selection is a little more spotty). It’s pricier than many competing noise-canceling headphones from the likes of Sony and Bose, but these have unrivaled build quality and materials, as well as solid performance in just about every regard. This price drop makes its minor flaws a little more excusable, like that it requires a $35 cable if you want to listen to music with a wire, and that its carrying case isn’t so great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TaO3vp"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/"&gt;The company’s new Email Protection feature&lt;/a&gt; gives users a free “@duck.com” email address, which will forward emails to your regular inbox after analyzing their contents for trackers and stripping any away. DuckDuckGo is also extending this feature with unique, disposable forwarding addresses, which can be generated easily in DuckDuckGo’s mobile browser or through desktop browser extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvQqdT"&gt;The personal DuckDuckGo email is meant to be given out to friends and contacts you know, while the disposable addresses are better served when signing up for free trials, newsletters, or anywhere you suspect might sell your email address. If the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new RadRover is Rad Power Bikes’ first e-bike with an integrated battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQkdyHc5MZUTRuyTGpGoh5W5eWI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69605187/RoverFarmer_754.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L7KBb3"&gt;The RadRover, Rad Power Bikes’ flagship electric bike, is getting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21049638/rad-power-bikes-radrover-step-thru-new-design-price-range"&gt;another major upgrade&lt;/a&gt;. The bike will be the first from the Seattle-based company to feature a semi-integrated battery. And when it’s released later this year, it will be the most expensive model in Rad Power Bikes’ lineup to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFR9nw"&gt;The RadRover 6 Plus (it’s a mouthful of an official name) comes with a bevy of new parts, including hydraulic disc brakes, a custom geared-hub motor, a new ergonomic frame, and an improved LED display that’s easier to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nDfBdp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the most eye-catching new detail is certainly the semi-integrated battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ik8byN"&gt;But the most eye-catching new detail is certainly the semi-integrated battery, a first for the company. Rad Power Bikes’ batteries tend to be larger...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google TV update adds option to manually clear out ‘Continue watching’ row</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oUOl7v"&gt;Google TV, the new smart TV interface that debuted on Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;most recent Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, appears to be getting a small but important tweak for its “Continue watching” row. Over &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/onmmeg/hide_from_continue_watching_on_google_tv_had_been/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/19/google-tv-continue-watching-hide/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) user u/Alfatango97 has spotted a new option to manually hide entries from the row, which is designed to let viewers quickly jump back into unfinished TV shows or films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCvbeg"&gt;When it works, the Continue watching row is a convenient way pick up from where viewing was interrupted. But occasionally it can get cluttered with content you started watching and have no intention of finishing, or content that’s finished but whose credits are so long that it still shows up as in-progress. Being able to manually clear out the row should make it easier to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple pushes back return to offices due to rising COVID cases: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Aerial Views Of Silicon Valley Housing And Tech Campuses" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3z7EP1rVRfy_lkvq4hpAfgGIR10=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69604565/1178079031.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3fqDyv"&gt;Apple is delaying its plan to return to mandatory in-person work because of the increase of COVID cases driven by the Delta variant, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-20/apple-will-postpone-return-to-office-after-covid-19-persists"&gt;according to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. The company had laid out a roadmap for returning to its offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;in early September&lt;/a&gt;, with employees expected to come in at least three days a week, but now that deadline has reportedly been extended “by at least a month to October at the earliest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ilw7M8"&gt;Apple’s return to offices was controversial among some of its employees. A group of workers in an internal Slack channel for thousands of “remote work advocates” collaborated on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to CEO Tim Cook and the rest of Apple’s leadership, making the case that the company should embrace a more flexible work-from-home policy.

    <title>Walmart, Ikea, and Amazon have a dirty shipping problem</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;SAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 01: A container ship enters the Port of Los Angeles on February 1, 2021 in San Pedro, California. As of January 28, a record 38 container ships were on standby to offload cargo to the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles amid a wave of online consumer goods purchases in the U.S. amid the pandemic. | Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AnJwKi"&gt;Giant retailers, including Amazon and Ikea, have pledged to go green, but their shipping is still pretty dirty. Now shoppers can now see how much pollution some of the biggest retail companies in the US each generate while bringing goods into the country, thanks to a new report. In 2019, the 15 companies in the report generated almost as much climate pollution as 1.5 million American homes do in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaAXft"&gt;The report looks at greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution caused by shipping piles of cargo around the world and ranks the top 15 biggest polluters by company. Walmart tops&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the list, generating more greenhouse gas emissions than a coal-fired power plant would in a year. Ashley Furniture, Target, Dole, and Home Depot round out the top...&lt;/p&gt;
