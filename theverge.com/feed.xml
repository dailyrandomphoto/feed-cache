    <title>Netflix just announced a huge slate of anime series and films</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/naVyKbul4UyioOnDRztoEt3Vy8E=/0x26:1280x879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434657/GSP_Gdesign_yamamori_1007.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ifyvio"&gt;Netflix’s expansion into anime continues. Today, the streaming service announced details for a number of exciting shows, ranging from a horror series with characters designed by &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;’s Yoshitaka Amano to the next chapter in the &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; franchise to another Godzilla show. Here’s everything that was announced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Jg4ctj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam Hathaway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="ODePBY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b0MdKr"&gt;The headliner was the return of classic mech franchise &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt;, with a series called &lt;em&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam Hathaway&lt;/em&gt;. “After Char’s rebellion, Hathaway Noa leads an insurgency against Earth Federation, but meeting an enemy officer and a mysterious woman alters his fate,” the description reads. It’s listed as coming soon and will eventually be joined by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380140/netflix-live-action-gundam-movie-jordan-vogt-roberts-legendary-sunrise"&gt;a live-action &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; film&lt;/a&gt; from director Jordan...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dark Sky’s iOS app and website will shut down at the end of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Sky on the web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nBnzIy"&gt;Following Apple’s acquisition of popular weather app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;Dark Sky in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Dark Sky’s iOS app and website will be available until the end of 2022, co-founder Adam Grossman said in a Monday update to &lt;a href="https://blog.darksky.net/"&gt;Dark Sky’s blog&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/10/dark-sky-apple-acquisition-shutdown-date/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAX1EV"&gt;The update about the 2022 shutdown hit the same day that Apple announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22527878%2Fdark-sky-apple-ios-app-website-api-shut-down-end-of-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new weather features coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; as part of its WWDC keynote presentation. The stock Weather app is getting a new design, full-screen weather maps, next-hour precipitation notifications, and even new animated backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWhDEQ"&gt;Dark Sky shut down the Android and Wear OS versions of its apps on August 1st, 2020. But the iOS app is still available &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id517329357"&gt;for $3.99 on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re interested in buying it ahead of next year’s shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first trailer for Netflix’s Masters of the Universe: Revelation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Masters of the Universe: Revelation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aitIrIR3g810MQspms8HBajgSL8=/282x0:3318x2024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434334/MastersoftheUniverse_Revelation_Part1_Episode1_00_16_53_13.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yxcxsx"&gt;Our first look at Kevin Smith’s revival of He-Man is here: today, Netflix debuted the first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&lt;/em&gt;, which will hit the streaming service on July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78wlPi"&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&lt;/em&gt;, which also streamed on Netflix, the new He-Man series isn’t a reboot of the classic cartoon. Instead, it’s a continuation, which picks up right after the original show ended in 1985, with the excellent addition of Mark Hamill as Skeletor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVmMrT"&gt;Here’s how Smith, who is serving as showrunner, describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rGBP7A"&gt;Narratively our show is set up as the next episode in the legacy ‘80s animated series that aired from 1983-1985. This is a continuation of that story. We’re playing with the original mythology and characters,...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>How to watch the debut of Tesla Model S Plaid, the ‘quickest production car ever made’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W2_KM0ClvWDR4bb5AHy3cVWYwww=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434160/0x0_ModelS_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5X8n8t"&gt;Tesla will hold a delivery event for its new, high-performance “Plaid” version of the Model S on Thursday. It’s an effort by Elon Musk’s company to reignite interest in its nearly decade-old electric sedan, which is also facing stiff competition from Porsche and Mercedes-Benz. When its released, Musk claims the Plaid Model S will be the “quickest production car ever made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVL4lI"&gt;The event, which will be held at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, CA, will be livestreamed for the public starting at 7PM PT / 10PM ET (though the event may not actually begin until closer to 8:30PM PT). It was originally scheduled for June 3rd, but Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/29/22459617/musk-tweets-model-s-tesla-plaid-delivery-delayed-again-june-10th"&gt;pushed it to the 10th&lt;/a&gt; after tweeting that the vehicle needed “one more week of tweak.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new health features bring new focus to elder care technology  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ksqI6"&gt;Apple’s new health features will be available for anyone with an iPhone. But two of the tools announced at WWDC 2021, walking steadiness and the ability to share health data with family members, could be particularly useful for older adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOBiA0"&gt;People who work with older adults are excited that a company like Apple is interested in tech that could be used for this group. Experts have spent years frustrated that companies don’t design products to meet the needs of that demographic. There have been a few attempts to introduce new tools, but none got much traction, says Richard Schulz, a social psychologist studying aging at the University of Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHXROR"&gt;“I think the reason is that the big boys — companies like Apple — never got into it,”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Record labels sue Roblox for letting users upload pirated songs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lil Nas X performing ‘Holiday’ inside Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yAuhRRK-KRwMIHArBZjXs4lsm7Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434047/LNX_Concert_HOLIDAY.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8tIIML"&gt;The National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) has sued &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; for letting users upload music from Ariana Grande, Imagine Dragons, deadmau5, and other artists without paying a licensing fee. &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.822912/gov.uscourts.cacd.822912.1.0.pdf"&gt;The lawsuit seeks&lt;/a&gt; $200 million in damages and a court order that will make &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; crack down on piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FHKre"&gt;The NMPA filed suit yesterday on behalf of several major music publishers. It accuses &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;massively popular, kid-focused platform&lt;/a&gt; for games and social experiences — of hosting a shared library of copyrighted but unlicensed songs. The complaint alleges that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; “actively preys on its impressionable user base and their desire for popular music, teaching children that pirating music is perfectly acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KeRkpr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“‘Roblox’ allows a prodigious...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Control is free on the Epic Games Store for one week</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UNoH1s"&gt;Remedy’s excellent supernatural thriller &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; is available for free on the Epic Games Store from now until June 17th at 11AM ET. All you need is an Epic Games account — just log in to the store while the deal is live, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/control"&gt;claim your copy of the game for PC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdjoPp"&gt;If you haven’t played &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; before, I highly recommend picking it up. I really liked exploring the game’s spooky paranormal world, and using protagonist Jesse Faden’s psychic abilities to fling objects from the environment at enemies is a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIMqD0"&gt;Epic is offering &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale"&gt;Mega Sale&lt;/a&gt;, which also runs through June 17th. Like last year, Epic is offering its $10 Epic Coupons that are applied automatically at checkout on eligible games that cost $14.99 or more...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Hoover Dam reservoir is at an all-time low </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tourists Visit The Hoover Dam" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ChAsHArl0uxSV2BwTQkG0S7c74c=/0x0:4974x3316/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433928/1253437187.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A general view of Lake Mead, a human-made lake that lies on the Colorado River, about 24 miles southeast of the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, in the states of Nevada and Arizona, on December 21st, 2019, in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Nevada. Formed by the Hoover Dam, Lake Mead is the largest reservoir in the United States and serves water to the states of Arizona, California, and Nevada, as well as some of Mexico, providing sustenance to nearly 20 million people and large areas of farmland.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Paul Rovere / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FKF81y"&gt;Lake Mead, the reservoir created by the Hoover Dam, that feeds water to 25 million people across Western states, is historically low. On June 9th, the water level dipped to &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/hourly/levels.html"&gt;1,071.57&lt;/a&gt; feet above sea level, narrowly beating a &lt;a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2016/05/19/lake-mead-declines-new-record-low/84597120/"&gt;record low&lt;/a&gt; last set in &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/lakemead_line.pdf"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaQJpU"&gt;The lake surface has dropped 140 feet since 2000, leaving the reservoir just 37 percent full. With such a dramatic drop, officials expect to declare an official &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona-environment/2021/05/27/hoover-dam-drought-water-levels-lake-mead/5134031001/"&gt;water shortage&lt;/a&gt; for the first time ever. That could affect water and energy that Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam deliver to Arizona, California, and Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPeCDY"&gt;Water levels at Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US, are &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/24mo/2021/MAY21.pdf"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to keep dropping throughout the year. The drought tugging at the lake’s water levels is affecting other...&lt;/p&gt;

Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with true wireless earbuds. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Luckily, many of the most popular models routinely undergo a price cut, even outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;. There are often sizable discounts on the base model as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best AirPods deals available, including those on the...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="egSlyU"&gt;What this focus on the fundamentals means in practice is that the Nord CE is slightly stripped down compared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;last year’s Nord&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s slightly higher-specced than its predecessor, too. So you’re getting a higher-resolution 64-megapixel main camera (up from 48 megapixels), but there are only three rear sensors in total. (There’s also an 8-megapixel ultrawide with a...&lt;/p&gt;
