    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n6D1iZ"&gt;Lee Jae-yong — known as Jay Y. Lee in the West — the de facto leader and heir to the Samsung Group conglomerate, has been ordered back to prison for two years and six months on bribery charges, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-18/samsung-s-billionaire-heir-ordered-back-to-prison-for-bribery"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zKWGN"&gt;The billionaire son of controversial Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21532544/samsung-chairman-lee-kun-hee-dies-78"&gt;died in October&lt;/a&gt;, was first jailed in 2017 in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/9/14867124/samsung-bribery-corruption-trial-chairman-lee-jae-yong"&gt;succession scandal&lt;/a&gt; that saw the removal of president Park Geun-hye. Lee served just one year of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/25/16201360/samsung-lee-jae-yong-guilty"&gt;five-year sentence&lt;/a&gt; before a retrial was ordered in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz1wrF"&gt;Lee had been accused of offering horses and other bribes to a friend of the former president to win government support for his succession at Samsung. Park is serving a 20-year sentence on a variety of charges including bribery related to Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin’s rocket reaches orbit for the first time, deploys satellites</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9HVGW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 17th 5:34PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virgin Orbit’s rocket &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_Orbit/status/1350933162398986240"&gt;&lt;em&gt;reached orbit and the satellites were released&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, meaning Sunday’s mission was a success. The headline has been updated to reflect this. The original story is below. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNSIl2"&gt;Virgin Orbit — the sister company of billionaire Richard Branson’s space tourism outfit Virgin Galactic — will try a second test of its small satellite-launching rocket later today, months after it failed to reach orbit during a first attempt. It will also be the first time that the company tries to launch working satellites into space on behalf of NASA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2r69S"&gt;Sometime after 1PM ET, Virgin Orbit’s customized Boeing 747 will take off from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21035125/virgin-galactic-spaceport-america-truth-or-consequences-new-mexico"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s spaceport in the Mojave desert&lt;/a&gt; and ascend to 35,000 feet with the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler resurfaces on Sunday with an update message, but nothing else</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Parler logo seen displayed on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CUhsNL-ZXo_deKW4rxxasFnqnh4=/0x0:3234x2156/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68682223/1230527974.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="message—notice"&gt;Social media platform Parler was all but wiped off the internet last week, but on Sunday, showed some signs of life. A message from Parler CEO John Matze, first noted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donie/status/1350799549959458817"&gt;CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;- is now appearing at the &lt;a href="https://parler.com/"&gt;site’s URL&lt;/a&gt;, with an image showing a “technical difficulties” banner, and a message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zbp2x"&gt;“Now seems like the right time to remind you all — both lovers and haters — why we started this platform. We believe privacy is paramount and free speech essential, especially on social media,” the message reads, pledging to “welcome all of you back soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jomKZX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon dropped Parler from its hosting platform&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, saying in a letter it “cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Cherry, Clarice, The United States vs. Billie Holiday, and more</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="axNlSi"&gt;I’m getting to the point where there’s so much to stream that I don’t know what to watch first, old shows I want to catch up on, or new shows/movies so I can keep up with all the references on Twitter. But! I am filled with hope for the coming weeks, as there are a slew of interesting-looking trailers for movies I have been waiting to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f6E0eq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rMs8tY"&gt;The United States vs. Billie Holiday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mXMImx"&gt;I sort of wish this movie had been named “Strange Fruit” after Holiday’s 1939 song that drew the ire of the FBI, but guessing a lot of people don’t know about this part of Holiday’s life. The great jazz singer who struggled with drug addiction saw the government wreck her career using an undercover sting operation, all over a controversial song. Really looking...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub admits ‘significant mistakes were made’ in firing of Jewish employee </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Acquires GitHub : Illustration" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UlBOC3TiNxqXaBT1eFs3TomIv6s=/38x0:4798x3173/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68681542/967199944.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MhNOgs"&gt;GitHub is admitting that a Jewish employee was fired in error and is offering him his job back. The news comes after the company hired an independent law firm to investigate the termination, and found that “significant mistakes were made.” The company’s head of HR, Carrie Olesen, is also resigning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HU6E7Q"&gt;“Yesterday evening, the investigation reached the conclusion that significant mistakes were made that are not consistent with our internal practices or the judgement we expect from our leaders,” wrote GitHub CEO Nat Friedman in an internal message to employees on January 16th. He said the company would be issuing &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2021-01-17-update-on-an-employee-matter/"&gt;a public apology on its blog this weekend&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whnwDj"&gt;In the post, GitHub COO Erica Brescia said: “To the employee we wish to say publicly:...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New lawsuit accuses Amazon of e-book price fixing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRHmBiLdB1w69YJz1w2nldtLGAo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68681089/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HtU0h9"&gt;Amazon is facing a new lawsuit alleging that a deal between the company and five book publishers has created higher prices on e-books, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-a-longtime-e-book-discounter-is-accused-of-driving-up-the-price-of-e-books-11610748615?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4CMeo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/sites/default/files/case-downloads/amazon-ebooks-price-fixing/01.14.21-complaint.pdf"&gt;The lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed by law firm Hagens Berman in a federal district court in New York, alleges that the publishers pay high commissions and other costs to Amazon, which in turn increases the retail price of e-books sold on the platform. Due to the deal between Amazon and the publishers— HarperCollins Publishers, Hachette Book Group, Penguin Random House, Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, and Macmillan &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; the Amazon price is the price the publishers charge other retailers as well, preventing other sellers from offering the e-books at lower prices, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XvWIs"&gt;The lawsuit...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal is back after an outage that lasted more than 24 hours</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u6LQB5"&gt;After experiencing technical difficulties Friday, the Signal messaging app appears to be back up and running. The company tweeted Saturday night that it was “back,” although added that some users may still see error messages in their chats. The company didn’t explain what caused the outage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6DV26M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Signal is back! Like an underdog going through a training montage, we’ve learned a lot since yesterday — and we did it together. Thanks to the millions of new Signal users around the world for your patience.

    <title>Critical NASA rocket test ends early with a shutdown</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXyk5Y"&gt;A critical NASA rocket test ended with a shutdown on Saturday, a little over a minute into what was planned to be an eight-minute test. This trial run was a vital checkpoint for NASA’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173176/nasa-space-launch-system-inspector-general-audit-over-budget-schedule"&gt;much-delayed Space Launch System&lt;/a&gt;. The SLS is set to play a key role in the agency’s Artemis program which aims to return astronauts to the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lz89gK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22232498/sls-nasa-space-launch-system-green-run-hot-fire"&gt;During today’s Green Run test&lt;/a&gt;, the four rocket engines in the SLS core fired for a little over a minute while anchored in NASA’s rocket test stand. The team had planned to have the engines fire for approximately eight minutes, or about the same amount of time it will take to launch future missions to the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pbFMpQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Watch all four &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASA_SLS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASA_SLS&lt;/a&gt; core stage engines roar to life and shake the ground in Mississippi. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teams...&lt;/p&gt;
