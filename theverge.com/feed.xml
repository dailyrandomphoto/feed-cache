    <title>Clubhouse is funding 50 pilot audio shows from creators</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FYlVtX"&gt;Clubhouse is funding the creation of &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog/meet-the-creator-first-finalists"&gt;50 audio shows&lt;/a&gt; made by creators on its platform. The concepts include everything from an interview series with Taryn Southern to a pair of shows discussing the culture of hairstyles to a game show called “Serial Killer Speed Dating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQyShb"&gt;Participants will each get a $5,000-per-month stipend for three months, plus gear and creative support, to help them create the series. The goal is to develop and pilot each show over the next three months. If shows take off, there’s a possibility Clubhouse will sign some of them to a longer-term deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YnyIjy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clubhouse’s goal is to “support new voices” on its platform&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Loki’s show is coming out two days earlier, in the spirit of the trickster god</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AjPkKNnxmhanu6d_OnLw4KpW29Q=/533x0:2336x1202/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241096/Screen_Shot_2021_02_24_at_12.21.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EenqOj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, the upcoming Disney Plus show about the trickster god and brother of Thor, will be coming out slightly earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299343/loki-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-tom-hiddleston-wandavision-black-widow"&gt;than originally planned&lt;/a&gt;: the premiere date has moved to June 9th, from the 11th. The show will also air on a new day of the week, with new episodes airing on Wednesdays instead of Fridays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3L2MP"&gt;The announcement was made in a video uploaded to Marvel’s YouTube channel. The video starts with a typical Marvel montage, but then is interrupted by Tom Hiddleston talking about how Loki is always left out of superhero montages. (It’s understandable that he’d feel left out — even in articles about a show dedicated to the character, he’s typically described in relation to his brother.) “Wednesdays are the new Fridays,” he says, before...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump objects to continued Facebook ban in email screed calling for ‘political price’ to be paid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="American Conservative Union Holds Annual Conference In Florida" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ft-rtzlNV9jtjhyXn5q4tMbACgw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241090/1304610267.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zgfNiw"&gt;Former President Donald Trump’s Facebook ban is sticking around for now, following the decision from Facebook’s Oversight Board to uphold its original ban from earlier this year. And Trump is not pleased, according to his first official statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLpams"&gt;“Free speech has been taken away from the President of the United States,” an emailed statement from Trump &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1389962790467620866"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reads&lt;/a&gt;, calling for a “political price” to be paid not just by Facebook, but by Google and Twitter as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TEn1qw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook’s Trump ban can stay in place, says Oversight Board","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5FMU3n"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249427/facebook-oversight-board-nobel-peace-prize-instagram-snowden"&gt;panel of independent experts&lt;/a&gt; established to oversee high-stakes moderation and policy disputes on the social media platform.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In its decision, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;the Oversight Board explained&lt;/a&gt; that while Facebook’s initial decision to suspend...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new 11-inch iPad Pro is already $50 off at Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XhdJUoJIvAT4grCWyb1qUU4JkoU=/0x38:980x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241072/ipad_pro_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="601EPa"&gt;The new 11-inch iPad Pro with the M1 processor costs $799 to preorder at most retailers, but not at Walmart. You can reserve an &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1039828/9383?sharedid=VergeApple11InchPro050521&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Silver%2F307298322&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11-inch model with 128GB of storage for $749&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll arrive at your door on or before June 1st. The step-up configuration with 256GB of storage is $50 off, too, costing $849 to preorder. We’ve seen similar preorder deals on the new iPad Pro from &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fipad%2Fproducts%2Fipad-pro-11-inch-1%3Fvariant%3D39316139212834#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a site called Expercom&lt;/a&gt;, but it currently offers a vague “3-6 week” estimate for shipping your purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjcFdP"&gt;Granted, it’ll still be another handful of weeks before a purchase from Walmart ships, but at least there’s some reassurance there that it’ll arrive by early June at the latest. At the time of publishing, Walmart says that orders will ship on Monday, May 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin targeting July for first crewed flight, opens auction for a seat</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NqS9k4"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin is aiming to launch its first crew of humans to the edge of space on July 20th aboard its suborbital space tourism rocket, New Shepard, the company announced on Wednesday. One seat aboard that flight will be auctioned off to support its Club for the Future foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdfOZq"&gt;“On July 20th, New Shepard will fly its first astronaut crew to space,” the company said in a press release. “We are offering one seat on this first flight to the winning bidder of Blue Origin’s online auction.” The auction starts today, the statement added, inviting the public to place a bid on its website. The statement didn’t include any information on how much each seat will cost going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Entertainment Space for Android tablets puts videos, games, and books in one place</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dUsgdfGxfW_z4j4mrcuaINoPsuQ=/0x83:1987x1408/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69240715/entspace1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pdFckA"&gt;Google is today announcing a new feature on Android tablets that plays to one of their greatest strengths: media consumption. The simply named “Entertainment Space” will be a new section to the left of the home screen on tablets from Walmart starting this month, and it’ll expand globally to devices from Lenovo, Sharp, and others later in the year. It’s an all-encompassing hub that brings together video (TV shows, movies, and YouTube), games, and books. Entertainment Space is something Google has been building for a couple years, and it’s one of the more significant changes to the Android tablet experience in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JXixY"&gt;“You’ll save time and avoid having to hop between apps to try to figure out what to do, whether it’s to watch, play or...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>College student sues Proctorio after source code copyright claim</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QEg3w5"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has filed a &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/document/johnson-v-proctorio-complaint"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the remote testing company Proctorio on behalf of Miami University student Erik Johnson. The lawsuit is intended to “quash a campaign of harassment designed to undermine important concerns” about the company’s remote test-proctoring software, according to the EFF. It’s the latest legal battle for the software company, which has publicly sparred with online critics throughout the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzQ9k6"&gt;The lawsuit intends to address the company’s behavior toward Johnson in September of last year. After Johnson found out that he’d need to use the software for two of his classes, Johnson dug into the source code of Proctorio’s Chrome extension and made a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ejohnson99/status/1303121786637373443"&gt;lengthy Twitter thread...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s Labor Department reverses Trump-era gig worker rule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Transportation Union And Rideshare Drivers United Members Hold Rolling Vehicle Protest Calling On State To Enforce AB5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1pSc4ZRa3L3NLokeI6vNkCJVGs4=/0x4:5317x3549/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69240336/1219237615.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mario Tama / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XabTnL"&gt;The US Department of Labor withdrew a Trump-era rule that would have made it easier for “gig economy” companies like Uber and Lyft to classify their workers as independent contractors. The reversal doesn’t change any gig workers’ current employment status, but it does signal that the Biden administration is taking a less friendly stance toward this sector of the economy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uvUGx"&gt;The rule was finalized in early January, before Biden took office, and would have made it more difficult for gig workers to be reclassified as employees under federal law. Over the years, some gig workers have fought to be classified as employees so they could qualify for benefits like paid sick leave, health insurance, and minimum wage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qfEk8z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Stop the erosion of worker...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
