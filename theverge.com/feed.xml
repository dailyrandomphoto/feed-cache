    <title>That’s no moon: veteran Apple designer unveils $1,799 Cell Alpha speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lFPfmf"&gt;Christopher Stringer, an ex-Apple designer who worked on everything from the HomePod to the original iPhone during his 22 year-stint at the company, has unveiled his new startup’s debut speaker. It’s called the &lt;a href="https://syngspace.com/"&gt;Cell Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, a futuristic Death Star-shaped connected speaker with an emphasis on spatial audio. It costs $1,799, or $1,969 if you want the model with a floorstanding base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6qdbJ"&gt;The Cell Alpha has woofers on its top and bottom arranged into a “force-balanced” configuration. These are paired with three mid-range drivers that are distributed around its equator, where they’re presumably joined by a small thermal exhaust port — the Cell Alpha’s only known weakness. Jokes aside, Stringer’s company Syng claims this three-driver configuration...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple teases major Music announcement as lossless streaming rumors mount</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/114Qih1BN4Gm7ubZptERHIF8OQU=/1x0:1111x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297485/msedge_ebejRVkHMS.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the teaser in Apple Music’s web app.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://music.apple.com" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MjXNwG"&gt;Apple is teasing a major Apple Music announcement. “Get ready,” a post in the service’s Browse tab reads, “music is about to change forever.” Tapping the image reveals an animated video, though it just consists of the music streaming service’s logo spinning in place. The teaser, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/16/apple-music-about-to-change-forever/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;first reported by MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is believed to refer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;Apple Music’s rumored lossless and hi-res music streaming&lt;/a&gt; features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpuSpB"&gt;A launch of the new higher quality streaming is believed to be imminent after code referencing “Lossless” and “Hi Res Lossless” streaming tiers appeared in the service’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/16/lossless-audio-references-found-in-apple-music-web-app-as-company-teases-special-announcement/"&gt;web apps&lt;/a&gt;. According to code in the Android app, the lossless tier will support music streaming at 24-bit/48Hz (a small step up from regular CD-quality...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sharp’s new flagship phone has a giant 1-inch camera sensor and Leica branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tr6IWS0pnW4PQD5469hI0pVApoo=/0x0:2090x1393/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297483/sharp.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dP3AC6"&gt;It appears that Leica has found a new mobile camera partner, following Huawei’s sanctions-induced retreat from the international smartphone market. Sharp just announced the &lt;a href="https://jp.sharp/k-tai/aquos-r6/"&gt;Aquos R6&lt;/a&gt; in Japan, and its Leica-branded lens sits in front of what is now the largest camera sensor on any phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxTt8t"&gt;The 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor is similar in specs to what you’d find in Sony’s high-end RX100 compact cameras. It’s only the second 1-inch sensor ever to make its way into a smartphone, and the first to make its way into a phone from an traditional phone manufacturer — Panasonic released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6151671/panasonic-leica-cm1-android-cameraphone"&gt;Android-powered CM1 back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t exactly a mainstream device. The closest any current phone gets to a 1-inch sensor is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Xiaomi’s new Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, which...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy director’s Paralympics RPG is launching next month</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U9sddg"&gt;The first project from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/em&gt; director Hajime Tabata’s new studio JP Games will finally be released next month, the company has announced. &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; is a mobile RPG themed around the Paralympic Games, the first game ever to carry the official Paralympics license. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18307399/pegasus-dream-tour-paralympics-game-hajime-tabata-2020"&gt;initially announced&lt;/a&gt; more than two years ago, but the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics were postponed a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and there’d been radio silence on the project ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOELvx"&gt;JP Games describes &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; as an “avatar RPG” set in Pegasus City. You can create a character based on a selfie from your phone, and train them in various para-sports. The game features illustrated versions of nine real-world para-athletes who...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft board members thought Gates should step down after affair with employee: WSJ</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bill Gates during 8th International Conference on Agriculture Statistics in New Delhi" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5EEKWD5O-9QuOUrplRVrJ_NLLcw=/0x0:5440x3627/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297079/1183210456.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s614Xu"&gt;Some of Microsoft’s board members concluded that Bill Gates should step down last year as an investigation was being conducted into an affair with an employee, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-directors-decided-bill-gates-needed-to-leave-board-due-to-prior-relationship-with-staffer-11621205803"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gates ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;resigned from the board in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; says was before the investigation had been completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epJGgK"&gt;The board reportedly hired a law firm in 2019 to investigate the matter following a Microsoft employee alleging in a letter that she had had a sexual relationship with Gates over many years. The employee, who was an engineer at the company, is said to have asked that Melinda French Gates, who was married to Bill at the time, read her letter, though it’s unclear whether that actually happened. Gates and French...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Green Knight, Wish Dragon, Venom 2, and more</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D4g5So"&gt;So since &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; isn’t dark enough (honestly give us &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, show writers), I also started watching &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; (HBO Max) and over the weekend watched &lt;em&gt;The Woman in the Window&lt;/em&gt; (fine, gritty anti-heroines are my thing, I guess). &lt;em&gt;Mare&lt;/em&gt; is so far reminding me a lot of &lt;em&gt;Broadchurch&lt;/em&gt;, another not-very-uplifting but great show, and Kate Winslet is going all-in on the accent and the look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SRYGK"&gt;But wow what a disappointment&lt;em&gt; The Woman in the Window &lt;/em&gt;was. It has an all-star cast (Amy Adams, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Brian Tyree Henry, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Anthony Mackie) and a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts, based on AJ Finn’s 2018 novel (which BY THE WAY, &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions"&gt;read the bonkers backstory&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; guy).

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xzuGg0"&gt;Officials in Puerto Rico are reportedly investigating an incident involving YouTube star Jake Paul, after he was seen in a now-deleted video riding in a vehicle on a beach that’s a nesting area for turtles this time of year, the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/15/puerto-rico-investigating-jake-paul-after-viral-video-sparks-turtle-outrage/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjg9S9"&gt;“I have ordered an investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the use of two motor vehicles on beaches that are presented to be in Puerto Rico,” secretary of natural and environmental resources Rafael Marchargo said &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/05/15/jake-paul-puerto-rico-investigation-turtles-beach/"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; (h/t TMZ). “Some media have published today a video of the influencer Jake Paul in a motor vehicle on the beach, an activity that is prohibited, apart from law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="vlDm8s"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery are in talks that would combine AT&amp;amp;T’s media business with Discovery’s reality-TV dynasty to create a massive new entertainment entity, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/at-t-is-said-in-talks-to-combine-content-assets-with-discovery-kor6r2uj?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources. &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-05-16/why-att-is-spinning-off-hbo-cnn-warner-media-discovery"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; corroborated the story&lt;/a&gt;, noting that “many Warner Media executives were stunned by the news.” Neither company confirmed the deal, but if it came to pass, the combined company would be a potentially significant competitor for streaming brands like Netflix and Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gm5ih"&gt;But as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, AT&amp;amp;T only recently added some major entertainment brands to its portfolio when it &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-m-a-at-t/att-closes-85-billion-deal-for-time-warner-idUSKBN1JA36U"&gt;acquired Time Warner for $85 billion&lt;/a&gt;, a deal that was finalized in 2018.

  &lt;p id="H06VAa"&gt;Amazon has launched an ad-supported, free video streaming service called MiniTV within the Amazon India app, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a different offering than its separate Amazon Prime Video service, as MiniTV is contained within Amazon’s traditional shopping app, rather than its own standalone app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0VhbT"&gt;Only available to users in India, MiniTV’s catalog includes mostly older content which its content partners made originally for YouTube and other platforms. The lineup includes beauty and fashion content, tech news, and cooking shows, and Amazon’s partners for the channel include Indian web content studios Pocket Aces and TVF, and  list of well-known Indian comedians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wyz1dN"&gt;The company says it’s planning “new and exclusive videos” in the coming...&lt;/p&gt;
