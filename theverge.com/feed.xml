    <title>Fitbit Charge 5 leaked images show color display and new rounded look</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eoKE9z-k-d0p9pKU_Nud9uvZtS8=/42x0:2613x1714/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69730371/fitbit_charge_5_leaks.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oHhnpn"&gt;Fitbit is apparently preparing an update to its line of Charge fitness trackers, and newly-leaked images offer our best look yet at what will likely be the refreshed design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdRs7P"&gt;The renders, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/fitbit-charge-5-renders-2735036/"&gt;from leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;, purportedly show the upcoming Charge 5 model. It looks like it shares design notes with Fitbit’s recent Luxe tracker, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22386394/fitbit-luxe-fitness-wellness-tracker-price-release-date-features"&gt;released in April&lt;/a&gt;. There’s an organic feel to the tracker, with a curved screen that blends into a more rounded body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRWu3o"&gt;Two slim panels on either side of the device look like they will offer capacitive controls, letting users tap and slide to navigate the tracker’s settings. Fitbit has put capacitive buttons on past devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199567/fitbit-charge-4-tracker-gps-nfc-spotify-sp02-announcement-price"&gt;Charge 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;Fitbit Sense&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re far from universally adored. In our own...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beta Android accessibility feature uses facial expressions to control your phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mxo-ZN-6YmbL9cubgMG8MxogZ00=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69730234/acastro_180413_1777_android_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8zaKXC"&gt;Google is developing a new accessibility feature for Android that lets you control a phone using facial expressions like a smile or raised eyebrows, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-with-face/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The “Camera Switch” feature has arrived with version 12 of Android’s Accessibility Suite app, released alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619546/android-12-beta-4-released-platform-stable-af"&gt;Android 12’s fourth beta&lt;/a&gt;. The new version of the app isn’t available via Google Play just yet, &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; reports, but there’s an APK to sideload if you want to give it a try. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkHebg"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;, facial expressions (which also include looking left, right, or up) can be used to access a number of controls, ranging from scrolling, going home, or viewing quick settings or notifications. Screenshots show you can adjust how sensitive the software is when...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Dopesick, Impeachment: American Crime Story, Midnight Mass, and more</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sam53s"&gt;In addition to keeping up with &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;(seems like people either really &lt;a href="https://www.avclub.com/the-ted-lasso-christmas-episode-is-a-gift-1847472927"&gt;loved&lt;/a&gt; or really &lt;a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/apple-tv-plus/ted-lasso-season-2-episodes-4-christmas-review/"&gt;hated&lt;/a&gt; the latest Christmas-themed episode; I liked it but admit I found it a bit jarring that the show hit pause on several promising plot lines so Ted could wear a Santa hat&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;, I also got caught up in &lt;em&gt;The White Lotus, a &lt;/em&gt;series that everyone on Twitter is apparently watching. &lt;em&gt;Lotus&lt;/em&gt; has its first-season finale tonight, and while I’m an episode behind right now, I’m sort of pushing myself to see it through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yleKGI"&gt;There are standout performances by Steve Zahn and Jennifer Coolidge, but the show’s just not clicking for me so far. Bad things happen to mostly awful people and one dies, but we don’t know who yet. The show takes place in Hawaii...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile investigating report of customer data breach that reportedly involves 100 million people</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9wio2Z"&gt;T-Mobile confirmed Sunday that it’s looking into an online forum post that claims to be selling a large trove of its customers’ sensitive data. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that it was in contact with the seller of the data, who said they had taken data from T-Mobile’s servers that included Social Security numbers, names, addresses, and driver license information related to more than 100 million people. After reviewing samples of the data, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported it appeared authentic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxW1fJ"&gt;“We are aware of claims made in an underground forum and have been actively investigating their validity,” a T-Mobile spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We do not have any additional information to share at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First Asian giant hornet (aka murder hornet) sighting of 2021 confirmed in Washington state</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;An Asian giant hornet attacking a paper wasps’ nest is all kinds of nope.  | Washington State Dept. of Agriculture&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xjQCqG"&gt;The Washington State Department of Agriculture has confirmed the first sighting of a live Asian giant hornet (nickname: murder hornet) in the state this year, the agency said &lt;a href="https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=32673"&gt;in a news release.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLu70Q"&gt;Yes I am back on my murder hornet BS. And coincidentally, I am writing this about an hour after a regular-sized (enormous) wasp was prowling around in my kitchen and I had to shoo it outside with a broom handle and a lot of swearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1pgf2"&gt;You may recall last year, when many of us were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/3/21245617/tldr-murder-hornet-2020"&gt;introduced to the Asian giant hornet&lt;/a&gt; after it was spotted in the US for the first time. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/2/21350034/murder-hornet-asian-washington-state-trap"&gt;WSDA trapped its first specimen&lt;/a&gt; last August, and &lt;a href="https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=31892"&gt;eradicated its first Asian giant hornet nest&lt;/a&gt; in October. I encourage you to read the news release of that eradication event...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter unblocks Indian politicians’ accounts after suspending them for violating disclosure law</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPkrcE"&gt;Twitter has reinstated the accounts of several politicians in India’s opposition party, which were suspended after party leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted a photo of himself with the parents of a girl who was allegedly raped and murdered in New Delhi, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-reinstates-accounts-indias-rahul-gandhi-other-opposition-leaders-2021-08-14/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1422779132249788416?s=20"&gt;Gandhi had tweeted his support&lt;/a&gt; of the girl’s family, saying that they deserved justice and others had shared his tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJRBC2"&gt;However, Indian law prohibits the disclosure of the identities of children and sexual assault victims. According to a notice posted on the Lumen database, India’s National Commission for Protection of Child Rights requested Twitter take action. A Twitter spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Gandhi submitted a copy of an authorization letter from the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jury decides Apple should pay $300 million in patent dispute</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple ordered to pay $300 million in a patent dispute | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2gSIul"&gt;Apple must pay $300 million in royalties following a retrial in a patent dispute, a Texas jury determined Friday. As &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/jury-awards-optis-300-million-second-patent-trial-against-apple-2021-08-13/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the jury found that Apple should pay patent company Optis Wireless Technology and its related companies because the technology Apple used in its iPhones, iPads, and Watches allegedly infringed Optis’ patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVPd4m"&gt;Last year, a jury &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/apple-told-to-pay-506-million-in-texas-patent-trial-verdict-1"&gt;awarded Optis $506 million&lt;/a&gt; in the dispute, but a judge vacated that award in April, and ordered a new trial focused on damages only. US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said the first jury had not been allowed to consider whether the amount was awarded on the “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory,” or FRAND, terms required in standard-essential patent cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krgeS3"&gt;The five patents...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford asks court to dismiss GM’s lawsuit over “BlueCruise” driver assist feature</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLoa4K"&gt;Ford has filed a motion asking the US District Court in San Francisco to dismiss a lawsuit from rival GM over Ford’s BlueCruise self-driving feature. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591805/gm-cruise-lawsuit-trademark-infringement-hands-free-driving-autonomous"&gt;GM filed a trademark infringement lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the name BlueCruise was too close to Super Cruise, the name of GM’s hands-free driving tech, which it introduced in 2017, as well as its autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbysi7"&gt;Ford said in its motion that the term “cruise” has been been in “ubiquitous use” over the past 50 years to refer to driver-assist features. “Consumers understand “cruise” to refer to a feature in their vehicle that performs part of the driving task or assists them in driving, and they do not associate that term with any one company or brand,” Ford...&lt;/p&gt;
