    <title>Tesla’s co-founder is teaming up with Specialized to solve the problem of e-bike batteries</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ydsas2"&gt;The growing popularity of electric bikes has raised a lot of exciting possibilities about the future of transportation, but it also presents a number of unique challenges. Chief among them is what to do with all those e-bike batteries when they eventually run out of juice. Rather than send them to a landfill, one major bike manufacturer is teaming up with a co-founder of Tesla to ensure those batteries have a second life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNWVvZ"&gt;Specialized, the third largest bike maker in the US based on market share, is partnering with a firm called Redwood Materials, which is run by Jeffrey “JB” Straubel, a co-founder and former chief technology officer of Tesla, to figure out a process for recycling the company’s e-bike batteries. Those batteries, which...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Fire TV is adding local news in many more cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QA5U5p09Vv1QUaG0OiJvn8cnzUk=/0x15:831x569/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68987359/FireTV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RC2Xu"&gt;Back in December, Amazon launched an ad-sponsored news app on its Fire TV platform.  At that time, the app offered local news coverage in 12 cities, including New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Miami, and more. But today, Amazon says it’s expanding local news to “88 major cities” across the US, “including popular local stations from news distributors such as ABC Owned Television Stations, CBSN, TEGNA, Cox, The E.W. Scripps Company, and Altice USA.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGh3FV"&gt;The news app now comes built into the Fire TV software, and local news gets its own tab in the app. “Amazon’s thoughtful expansion of local news content on its Fire TV devices is a strong testament to the power of local news to keep communities safe and informed through everything 2020 has...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Echo Show 8 smart display is over 40 percent off at several retailers</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7CRfvv"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724867471427496922#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VegeDailyDeals03182021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $75 right now. While this is not its lowest price ever (the previous best price was only $5 less), it is still an incredible deal on the normally $130 smart display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;The Echo Show 8 includes a slightly larger display than the Echo Show 5 and also includes support for videoconferencing apps, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="nDC3T7"&gt;If you’re looking for a good virtual reality headset but are intimidated by the $300 price tag for the relatively affordable Oculus Quest 2, you’re in luck. Over on Oculus’ official website, the company is selling &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a refurbished first-generation Quest for $199&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>You will watch the Snyder Cut in 4:3 aspect ratio because HBO Max respects cinema</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nnbEPeTGQFT9_zzccR8pcA6E0_s=/228x0:2943x1810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986833/snyderwarning.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7MYsyZ"&gt;Lest anyone worry that &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=SnyderCut031821"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; would tarnish Zack Snyder’s auteur work &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;, for which the company &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/02/the-true-story-of-justice-league-snyder-cut"&gt;spent $70 million&lt;/a&gt; on reshoots and new digital effects in order to meet the director’s requirements and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22334362/zack-snyder-justice-league-fandom-release-cut-star-wars-twitter"&gt;satisfy years of fan demand&lt;/a&gt; for a better cut of the widely panned movie, the service is prefacing all streams of the film with a short disclosure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="815KjL"&gt;“This film is presented in a 4:3 format to preserve the integrity of Zack Snyder’s creative vision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9DaXXJ"&gt;That’s right. HBO will not artificially crop the image just to satisfy your natural demand for widescreen viewing. Nor would it tell Snyder that, hey, &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/03/zack-snyder-explains-justice-leagues-first-cow-connection.html"&gt;maybe &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;isn’t &lt;em&gt;First Cow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and doesn’t need to be presented in a tight boxy format in which it’s unclear if the entire film...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to file and pay your 2020 taxes online </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="irs (ray tsang flickr)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP0xxiL-v-HhVA274y3XwS_qa2o=/0x3:1100x736/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68687934/irs.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSUmXj"&gt;In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic took everyone, including the IRS, by surprise. Because of the issues people were dealing with last spring, the filing deadline for federal tax payments was moved from the usual mid-April date to July 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NH5z8m"&gt;This year, it looked look like we weren’t going to get the same tax vacation — until &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-day-for-individuals-extended-to-may-17-treasury-irs-extend-filing-and-payment-deadline"&gt;the IRS announced on March 17th&lt;/a&gt; that tax day has been pushed back a month. As a result, the new due date for your 2020 taxes is May 17th, 2021.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1IHJ6"&gt;Meanwhile, the IRS has also made it known that the &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-operations-during-covid-19-mission-critical-functions-continue"&gt;pandemic is slowing down some operations&lt;/a&gt;, such as processing returns filed on paper. As a result, it might not be a bad idea to start working on those taxes as soon as possible — and to submit them online. In fact, whether...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3I8qce"&gt;OnePlus has an upcoming event on March 23rd, where it’ll be formally announcing the OnePlus 9, and OnePlus 9 Pro. As with any smartphone event these days, there’s a ton of information about what will be revealed at the event, thanks in no small part to OnePlus itself doling out pieces of news over the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VbxpkT"&gt;Confirmed by OnePlus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WmyBTC"&gt;OnePlus has been in the habit lately of trying to build up suspense for its events, which is why you see it and its executives just tweeting out information about the phones. Here’s what we’ve learned from them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8N3qvy"&gt;Chargers? In the box&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kgVwo9"&gt;OnePlus’s CEO, Pete Lau, has confirmed on a forum post that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319657/oneplus-9-charger-in-box-pete-lau-announcement"&gt;will be including a charger in the box&lt;/a&gt; with the 9-series phones, instead of going the route that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware’s latest gaming laptops can now be configured with Cherry MX switches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_0zYZDwXDjIK0ppak_gDbITOyA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986482/cfaulkner_200826_4165_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M15 R3 is pictured here, though the switches can only be configured on the latest R4.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5lrIud"&gt;Alienware and Cherry have worked together to cram what both companies are calling the “first true” mechanical keyboard into a gaming laptop. Starting March 18th, you’ll be able to purchase Alienware’s M15 R4 or M17 R4 laptops and upgrade them to a Cherry MX mechanical keyboard for an extra $150 at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZSGfR"&gt;The laptops will house a new kind of Cherry switch called the MX Ultra Low Profile, which is 3.5mm thick (compared to the 11.9mm-sized MX Low Profile switch). The switch is built with stainless steel wings that swing open and push down — picture the way a DeLorean’s car doors open and close. (Cherry not-so-subtly teased these new switches with a picture of the famously heavy car that’s built with stainless steel). The rest of the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Shorts arrives in the US to take on TikTok, but the beta is still half-baked</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRwCZZ"&gt;YouTube Shorts, the company’s short-form answer to TikTok, is launching in beta in the United States starting today. The short video format has already been available for several months in India, but today marks its debut stateside (along with the addition of several new features).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ILMCqB"&gt;For the beta launch, YouTube Shorts will feature all the basics of any TikTok clone: a multi-segment camera that makes it easy for creators to quickly string together clips, a wide selection of music tracks (with catalogs from “over 250 labels and publishers”), and a robust-looking captioning tool, the last of which is debuting alongside the US launch. “We really want to create a playground of creativity here where we give creators the raw materials to produce...&lt;/p&gt;
