    <title>Nvidia teases GeForce RTX 3080 Ti announcement for May 31st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IPFgKC"&gt;Nvidia is teasing a GeForce event for May 31st, the same day the company is rumored to be launching its new GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card. A mysterious 11-second teaser video has appeared on Twitter today, simply revealing a GeForce event for 10PM PT on May 31st, or 1AM ET on June 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJLZoD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419668/nvidia-rtx-3080-ti-leak-may-launch-rumors"&gt;Recent rumors have suggested&lt;/a&gt; the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will be revealed alongside the RTX 3070 Ti on May 31st. The RTX 3080 Ti will reportedly include 12GB of GDDR6X memory, a 2GB increase over what’s found on the existing RTX 3080. A wider 384-bit bus is also rumored, matching the RTX 3090 — and an increase to the memory bandwidth over the RTX 3080. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch two whole seconds of the increasingly real Uncharted movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxRqgWBJKfCv3SwkJIQzT_PbGLk=/58x0:1849x1194/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345755/Screen_Shot_2021_05_26_at_8.37.42_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark Wahlberg in the &lt;/em&gt;Uncharted&lt;em&gt; movie.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yox4PV"&gt;After more than a decade in development and several directors, release dates, and scripts, the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie increasingly seems like it may actually, really, for real become a movie we can watch, thanks in part to our first actual footage (via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1397505699308048388"&gt;Twitter user @Nibellion&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lWQ1x"&gt;The sneak peek is in this &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TF8MrJPTy7w"&gt;YouTube video from Sony&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TF8MrJPTy7w?t=92"&gt;timestamped here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to skip right to it). Get excited:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mRSHbk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xPeF5A"&gt;Did you blink? If so, you might have missed everything that happened. I made a GIF to make sure you can see it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="487EfB"&gt;Okay, so maybe the two whole seconds here aren’t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; exciting. And disappointingly, none of the footage shows any of the &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt;-inspired action for which the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; game series is known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPX6eZ"&gt;But seeing Tom Holland’s Nathan...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Merlin Labs wants to fill the sky with pilotless planes carrying cargo and passengers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RrxerP"&gt;Autonomous flight startup Merlin Labs is coming out of stealth mode to announce that it’s raised $25 million in funding from Google Ventures and First Round Capital. The company has also struck a deal with aviation services contractor &lt;a href="https://www.dynamicaviation.com/"&gt;Dynamic Aviation&lt;/a&gt; to begin putting its pilotless plane technology into commercial operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFZg2J"&gt;The two announcements are the first steps toward Merlin Labs’ larger goal of filling the sky with pilotless planes carrying cargo and passengers. As part of its deal with Dynamic, the startup will supply its autonomous flight technology to 55 of the contractor’s King Air aircraft. Merlin is already conducting test flights with the first King Air plane outside its dedicated flight facility at the Mojave Air and Space...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google to use patient data to develop healthcare algorithms for hospital chain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X6gjOu"&gt;Google has made a deal for access to patient records from HCA, which which &lt;a href="https://investor.hcahealthcare.com/news/news-details/2021/HCA-Healthcare-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;operates 181 hospitals&lt;/a&gt; and more than 2,000 healthcare sites in 21 states, so the tech company can develop healthcare algorithms, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-strikes-deal-with-hospital-chain-to-develop-healthcare-algorithms-11622030401"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGoAsz"&gt;Google will store anonymized data from patient health records and internet-connected medical devices. That data will be used to build programs that could inform medical decisions made by doctors. The deal is described as “multiyear” by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ, &lt;/em&gt;without specifying how many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAFLzj"&gt;As health records moved online over the past few years, hospitals and tech companies jumped at opportunities to take advantage of the glut of digitized medical information collected at each doctor’s visit. Microsoft and Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-give-tech-giants-access-to-detailed-medical-records-11579516200?mod=article_inline"&gt;a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford is making an electric Explorer, boosts EV investment by $8 billion</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPMEFK"&gt;Ford will spend $30 billion on electric vehicles by 2025, and says 40 percent of its global fleet will be all-electric by 2030. The company is working on an all-electric versions of its Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs. And it’s developing two new electric vehicle platforms: one that will power full-size pickup trucks, and one that can easily flex between all- and rear-wheel drive to fit multiple vehicle types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlW9we"&gt;The company had previously committed $22 billion to EVs and had announced a goal to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;all-electric in Europe by 2030&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2dAvl"&gt;Ford is also creating a standalone business for its commercial vehicle division called Ford Pro. The company hopes that by offering more dedicated services to these customers, it can build on what is already a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lockheed Martin and GM are working on an electric Moon buggy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpdfPC"&gt;Lockheed Martin and General Motors unveiled plans on Wednesday to build an autonomous buggy-like vehicle that future astronauts can use to zip around the surface of the Moon. The two companies collaborated to pitch a conceptual Lunar Terrain Vehicle to NASA’s Artemis program, a Moon exploration campaign that calls for various robots, vehicles, and scientific bases to be planted on the lunar surface within the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I09IIE"&gt;Ahead of a presentation Wednesday morning, Lockheed and GM said in a joint press release that the vehicle will use the automaker’s autonomous driving technology and is “being designed to traverse significantly farther distances” than Apollo-era buggies. Just like those Moon buggies from the ‘70s, the Lockheed-GM concept...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More Americans believe in climate change but still can’t quit fossil fuels</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0GLLqC"&gt;Nearly two-thirds of Americans now believe that climate change is an urgent problem to address, but they aren’t nearly as enthusiastic about giving up oil and gas, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/05/26/gen-z-millennials-stand-out-for-climate-change-activism-social-media-engagement-with-issue/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; by the Pew Research Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNCsqO"&gt;Only one-third of people surveyed supported completely phasing out fossil fuels. Less than half of respondents are okay with phasing out new gas-powered vehicles. Taking those steps might seem drastic, considering fossil fuels currently&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;make up about 80 percent of the &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/"&gt;US energy mix&lt;/a&gt;. But phasing out most, if not all, fossil fuels is pretty much in line with what’s needed to meet the scale of the climate crisis, according to climate experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5d6ue"&gt;Now that many Americans are taking the threats posed by climate change seriously,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sweet Tooth’s post-apocalyptic world is meant to be a ‘storybook dystopia’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tq3UIB"&gt;Jeff Lemire’s &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; is a comic book about a young boy surviving in a world ravaged by a pandemic. He also happens to be a “hybrid,” a new breed of half-human, half-animal creature that began to appear alongside the deadly sickness. It’s a dark story, one that had the potential to be incredibly bleak and uncomfortable when translated to television. That’s particularly true now, as the real world continues to deal with its own pandemic. For the team adapting the story for an upcoming series on Netflix, all of these factors combined to create a slightly different approach. “It made us lean more into the hope,” executive producer Amanda Burrell says of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95Mwbd"&gt;Netflix’s eight-episode &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; series will debut on June 4th. It’s a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb’s CEO thinks the platform can replace your landlord</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dJa8tz"&gt;Airbnb doesn’t want you to forget about Airbnb, especially when you’re planning post-pandemic vacations. So on Monday, the company &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2F2021&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;made multiple announcements&lt;/a&gt; all seemingly designed to get people renting, traveling, and, crucially, choosing Airbnb to do so. It announced flexible booking, which lets people search across days, weeks, or months to plan a trip, as well as more location flexibility when looking for a place to stay. It also launched a faster onboarding process for hosts, during a time when competitors &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vrbo-isnt-airbnbs-problem-11621510202"&gt;like Vrbo&lt;/a&gt; are trying to poach them, as well as a new service for Super Hosts that’ll allow them to reach out to the Airbnb team directly for support issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGOYoA"&gt;“We just think there’s this huge inflection point in travel brought on...&lt;/p&gt;
