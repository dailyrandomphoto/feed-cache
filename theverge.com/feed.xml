    <title>SpaceX’s Starlink is in talks with ‘several’ airlines for in-flight Wi-Fi</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mS4vVL"&gt;The team behind SpaceX’s growing satellite internet network Starlink is in talks with “several” airlines to beam internet to their airplanes, the project’s vice president said during a conference panel on Wednesday. Expanding Starlink from rural homes and onto airlines is an expected move for Elon Musk’s space company as it races to open the broadband network commercially later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsmHBp"&gt;“We’re in talks with several of the airlines,” Jonathan Hofeller, SpaceX’s VP of Starlink and commercial sales, told a panel at the Connected Aviation Intelligence Summit on Wednesday. “We have our own aviation product in development… we’ve already done some demonstrations to date, and looking to get that product finalized to be put on aircraft in the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Say goodbye to the Keystone XL pipeline, for real this time </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Biden Blocking Keystone Threatens To End Mega Pipelines Era" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PCPC_DnJyTctBN_5qAo-qAyrE8Q=/0x32:4607x3103/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69430795/1230819697.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Crews work on a right of way for the Keystone XL pipeline near Oyen, Alberta, Canada, on Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2021. U.S. President Joe Biden revoked the permit for TC Energy Corp.’s Keystone XL energy pipeline via executive order hours after his inauguration, the clearest sign yet that constructing a major new pipeline in the U.S. has become an impossible task. | Jason Franson/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jHNrnw"&gt;It’s official: the Keystone XL is going away for good. The pipeline’s developer &lt;a href="https://www.tcenergy.com/announcements/2021-06-09-tc-energy-confirms-termination-of-keystone-xl-pipeline-project/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that it’s terminating the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BYOfC"&gt;For years, the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations have gone back and forth on allowing the massive transcontinental project to move forward. On his first day in office, Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240466/joe-biden-keystone-xl-pipeline-canceled-executive-order-climate-change"&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt; the Presidential Permit that his predecessor had granted. Apparently, that was the nail in Keystone XL’s coffin. Soon after, TC Energy suspended work on the project to &lt;a href="https://www.tcenergy.com/announcements/2021-01-20-tc-energy-disappointed-with-expected-executive-action-revoking-keystone-xl-presidential-permit/"&gt;“consider its options,”&lt;/a&gt; but hadn’t fully given up on the pipeline until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6rpxB"&gt;“We took on a multi-billion dollar corporation and we won!” Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer for the nonprofit Indigenous Environmental Network &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dallasgoldtooth/status/1402730374682320898"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “The People made this...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first five minutes of Netflix’s Philippine folklore anime Trese</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cjvl8kd26nujyvkMtZZzsGavBz4=/0x13:1387x938/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69430596/Screen_Shot_2021_06_09_at_2.15.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jQO8P8"&gt;Netflix has released the first five minutes of its upcoming anime series &lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt;, which is based on the Philippine horror comic of the same name. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/RKuSsvKjPBQ"&gt;In the clip&lt;/a&gt; (which I’ve embedded at the top of this post), you’ll get a brief look at some of the show’s terrifying-looking monsters and be introduced to detective Alexandra Trese, the show’s protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E35JYO"&gt;Here’s the official synopsis of &lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt;, from Netflix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vr5XwX"&gt;Set in Manila where the mythical creatures of Philippine folklore live in hiding amongst humans, Alexandra Trese finds herself going head to head with a criminal underworld composed of malevolent supernatural beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VRONHA"&gt;Count me intrigued. The monsters seem quite scary, and I love the supernatural elements hinted at even in these initial minutes....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple may have accidentally confirmed the existence of an M1X MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQZIHF05TX0m46MhjejfbxYvORg=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69429868/retina-macbook-pro-15-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not the new MacBook Pro, but it does have ports that are tipped to return!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GWELYT"&gt;Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote came and went this year without a new MacBook Pro — but it looks like that wasn’t the original intent! Intriguingly, Apple quietly included the phrases “M1X MacBook Pro” and “M1X” as tags &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TD96VTf0Xs"&gt;on its YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; of the live keynote, as spotted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/maxbalzer_/status/1402626084265500679"&gt;by Max Balzer&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/09/m1x-macbook-pro-referenced-in-metadata-for-apples-wwdc-youtube-video/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cl9C5u"&gt;Not only does that sound like tacit confirmation of at least one new Arm-powered MacBook Pro, it also corroborates the rumors that it’ll include a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 chip&lt;/a&gt;, and that Apple will likely market it as an enhanced “X” variant, like it used to do with its high-end iPads, rather than going straight to M2. (Or, as some are pointing out, it could means that someone on the social media team decided to try for an SEO boost and made...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to sign up for Amazon Prime</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8NVy7p"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;announced that its annual Prime Day sales&lt;/a&gt; are scheduled for Monday, June 21st and Tuesday, June 22nd; and if you feel as if it hasn’t been a year since the last event — you’re right, it hasn’t. Last year, Prime Day happened on October 13th and 14th, three months later than usual, due to the coronavirus pandemic. But this year we’re back on schedule, and as before, Amazon will be dropping prices on a lot of its products for its Prime members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rspoie"&gt;If you’re attracted by the goodies being offered, but you haven’t signed up for Amazon Prime, don’t worry — Amazon makes it very easy. (As you’d expect, it’s the sorry vendor who makes it difficult for people to become new customers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zWYyYc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you’re attracted by the goodies being offered, but...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p1z5Ah"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — all of which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release in the fall — and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The creator economy is running into the Apple Tax — this startup is fighting back</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VxoadZ"&gt;Apple is clashing with the platform &lt;a href="https://fanhouse.app/"&gt;Fanhouse&lt;/a&gt; over whether it gets to take a cut of in-app payments to creators. The incident underscores just how little Apple understands about the creator economy, with the likely outcome being less money in creators’ pockets — and more money for one of the world’s most profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQfXy8"&gt;Founders of Fanhouse — which is basically OnlyFans without the nudity — say the platform will be kicked out of the App Store in August if it doesn’t start forking over 30 percent of the fees people pay creators when purchases are made through the iPhone app. One of Fanhouse’s creators, the streamer &lt;a href="https://fanhouse.app/breadwitchery/fanwall"&gt;Breadwitchery&lt;/a&gt;, says that cut would mean losing two months of rent from her earnings to date. The company doesn’t have...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1IVJrU"&gt;Former CEO Martin Winterkorn has agreed to pay the company 11.2 million euro ($13.6 million), while former Audi boss Rupert Stadler will pay Volkswagen 4.1 million euro ($5 million).

&lt;p id="3w5cZx"&gt;Most of the rest of the money — some 270 million euros (nearly $330 million) — will come from what’s known as “directors’ and officers’ insurance,” or D&amp;amp;O insurance, which normally helps protect executives from individual liability but can also be used...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Senate just advanced the beef between SpaceX and Blue Origin</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZZAMXi"&gt;A controversial amendment pushed by Jeff Bezos’ space firm Blue Origin passed the Senate Wednesday night, inching closer to becoming law. Crammed inside a mammoth science and technology bill designed primarily to counter competition from China, the amendment would allow NASA to spend up to $10 billion on its embattled Moon lander program. Aside from countering China, it also marks the latest development on Bezos’ warpath to counter competition from Elon Musk’s SpaceX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3Y5Z1"&gt;For Blue Origin, the $10 billion boost is a key weapon in an enduring rivalry between the country’s two richest people — one way or another, the company hopes parts of the funding could help give it a better chance to compete with SpaceX. It’s just one front in a...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YOn248"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch &lt;/em&gt;launched in 2016, but it’s getting a significant feature soon. Blizzard Entertainment is releasing a cross-play beta that will let PC and console gamers play in matches together. The developer says the update is coming “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xv8ka"&gt;Until now, the communities on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch were segmented, but this update should make it easier to find online matches to join, whether it’s with your friends or with random players. Some of the most popular online titles feature cross-play support, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21175222/call-of-duty-warzone-battle-royale-review-impressions-hands-on"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Warzone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it bodes well that this feature may be supported earlier on in the game’s upcoming sequel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446374/overwatch-2-preview-five-player-multiplayer-new-maps-changes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChGXQF"&gt;Cross-play is a welcome, if overdue, feature to have in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, but it might...&lt;/p&gt;
