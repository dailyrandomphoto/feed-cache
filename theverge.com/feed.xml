    <title>COVID-19 hospitalization rates in adolescents went up during March and April</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VNQruz"&gt;In March and April, when COVID-19 vaccinations were starting to keep older adults out of the hospital, more and more children between 12 and 17 years old were being admitted. Many were seriously sick: around one-third of kids in this age group who were in the hospital for COVID-19 this year were in the intensive care unit, a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7023e1.htm?s_cid=mm7023e1_w"&gt;report shows&lt;/a&gt;. None died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fJ0mI"&gt;The risk of getting seriously ill and needing to be hospitalized from COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html"&gt;increases with age&lt;/a&gt;, but kids and teenagers can still get sick. Hospitalization rates from COVID-19 in this group were, overall, around 2.5 to 3 times higher than those from the flu over the last three flu seasons. The new CDC data underscores the importance of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14 basics: how to quit an app on your iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fgEerp6jUFsMW4StV7QQVqy-HvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406377/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBAgE4"&gt;Even iOS apps occasionally misbehave — they can crash, or freeze, or otherwise stop working. If you’re new to iOS, or just haven’t had this happen before, you may not know how to actually quit an app (as opposed to just swiping it off your screen). Here’s how to quit an app using iOS 14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fFpjG3"&gt;Open the App Switcher by either swiping up from the bottom of the screen and then pausing in the middle, or (if you have a Home button) double pressing the Home button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vYnTbm"&gt;You’ll see an overlapping view of all your open apps. Swipe to the right or left until you find the app you want to quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HZCbTg"&gt;Swipe up on the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open the App Switcher and swipe sideways to find the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you’ve found the misbehaving app, swipe...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>TikTok updates US privacy policy to collect ‘faceprints and voiceprints’ (but won’t explain what they are) </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uonr3tviUKodKdtIHzcj405XuX8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406214/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7xqmQ"&gt;TikTok has updated &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy?lang=en#privacy-us"&gt;its privacy policy in the US&lt;/a&gt; to notify users that the app might, in future, collect new types of biometric information including “faceprints and voiceprints.” But when reached by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, TikTok was unable to explain what types of data these terms referred to, or why the app might need to access this information in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhUGNi"&gt;The company’s privacy policy was updated on June 2nd, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (An archived version of the old policy can be &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210601030054/https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy"&gt;read here&lt;/a&gt;.) The new policy lays out in some detail the ways in which the TikTok app now has permission to analyze users’ content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7UKOS"&gt;The policy states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hDZaBQ"&gt;“We may collect information about the images and audio that are a part of your User Content, such as identifying...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p id="xW0scO"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0UHIl"&gt;This week, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; dedicates the show to operating systems — updates, releases, and rumors from this past week. Nilay and Dieter talk with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior editor Tom Warren and managing editor Alex Cranz about what to expect at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457534/apple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect"&gt;Apple’s developer conference next week&lt;/a&gt; (HomeOS?), where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;Microsoft will take their OS next&lt;/a&gt; (Windows 11?), and the debut of some new systems like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463666/huawei-matepad-pro-harmonyos-tablet-features-specs"&gt;Huawei’s HarmonyOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452620/google-fuchsia-os-nest-hub-smart-display-update-operating-system-linux-kernal"&gt;Google’s Fuchsia OS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Sweet Tooth makes the end of the world a little cozier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sweet Tooth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bCohRwsmb8x6OeGALsRXWOEKxKU=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406102/STOOTH_101_Unit_03788R.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bJVY1z"&gt;Gus may have antlers like a deer, but he’s a puppy dog at heart. The main character of Netflix’s new series &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt;, based on the comic by Jeff Lemire, is a young boy struggling to survive in a world ravaged by a pandemic. But while the world around him descends into chaos, Gus, played by Christian Convery, never loses his sense of wide-eyed optimism. His ears perk up — literally — if he hears about chocolate or candy apples, and he has an almost naive belief in people who shouldn’t always be trusted. At a time when we’re inundated with grim post-apocalyptic stories about how dark humanity can get, &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; and its adorable lead offer something very welcome: hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeUwpk"&gt;Most of the set-up is familiar territory. A pandemic has killed off...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Max are $30 off at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9st56iOy91X0sdGE_jo8wjIUbJQ=/0x0:2075x1383/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69405646/AirPodsMax.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1FZwy8"&gt;Apple’s over-ear AirPods Max are $30 less than usual at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733321576396561727#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; today. Normally $549, every color option is $520 (Best Buy has most, but not all, colors at this price). Are they worth the purchase even with this slightly more affordable cost? If you’re a discerning shopper looking for unparalleled design and build quality, as well as great sound quality and ease of use, then perhaps they’ll be worth it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXCx2k"&gt;This price is hundreds more than the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;, both of which will serve most people very well. My colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Welch notes in his review&lt;/a&gt;, though, that the AirPods Max are tough to beat on the little details that might make a big difference with your...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple WWDC 2021: iOS 15, new MacBook Pros, and what else to expect</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrPAza"&gt;Apple’s annual developer extravaganza, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), is coming up fast, kicking off with the keynote presentation on June 7th at 1PM ET. Like last year, WWDC will be an entirely digital and online-only event due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and for the keynote, that means we can likely expect another tightly produced video highlighting everything Apple has in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcZ4wB"&gt;While we aren’t expecting any announcements on the level of Apple’s shift to custom silicon in its computers, which was WWDC 2020’s big news, Apple presumably has some notable changes in the works for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and its other operating systems. And if the current rumors pan out, we could also see brand-new MacBook Pros with the return of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s proposed budget keeps a block on recreational weed sales in Washington, DC</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="48XIFE"&gt;A rider that has effectively blocked recreational cannabis for years in Washington, DC appears in President Joe Biden’s proposed 2022 budget, which may keep weed on the back burner yet again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4Ufdh"&gt;Even though residents of DC &lt;a href="https://wamu.org/story/14/11/05/pot_legalization_approved_by_dc_voters/"&gt;voted to legalize&lt;/a&gt; possession of recreational marijuana in 2014, the measure has been in limbo since then, &lt;a href="https://dcist.com/story/21/06/01/biden-budget-keeps-ban-on-weed-sales-in-dc/"&gt;derailed by a rider&lt;/a&gt; to DC’s appropriations bill first introduced by Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), that prohibits the District from spending its local funds on commercialization of recreational cannabis, such as dispensaries. And Biden’s proposed 2022 budget includes the rider’s language yet again.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmKpWy"&gt;Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) &lt;a href="https://norton.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/norton-secures-major-victories-for-dc-in-biden-budget-disappointed-with"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; she was having a hard time reconciling the Biden administration's...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="mwtjs4"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2848"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-investigates-facebook-s-use-of-ad-data"&gt;UK regulators&lt;/a&gt; have opened antitrust investigations into Facebook over concerns its Marketplace service is unfairly distorting competition for classified ads. Both are interested in whether or not Facebook unfairly used advertising data to compete in the classified ads market, and are collaborating as part of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgCYVc"&gt;“Facebook collects vast troves of data on the activities of users of its social network and beyond, enabling it to target specific customer groups,” the European Commission’s competition head, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement. “We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage in particular on the online classified ads sector, where people...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new TV remote is great, but only when apps properly support it</title>

  &lt;p id="JbNWB6"&gt;Users are complaining that the Disney Plus and HBO Max Apple TV apps aren’t properly supporting the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;new Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;. Disney Plus has &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/nrem4m/disney_doesnt_work_with_new_apple_tv_remotes/"&gt;yet to be updated&lt;/a&gt; to make use of the remote’s helpful scroll wheel scrubbing feature, which works on rival Netflix and Apple TV Plus apps. The HBO Max app has more issues, &lt;a href="https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-tvos-update-breaks-several-key-features-degrading-experience-significantly"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, and lacks support for several of the remote’s features and voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNBA7o"&gt;When we tried the HBO Max app for ourselves, we found it doesn’t seem to support the new remote’s D-pad. Instead, we could only use the remote’s touchpad circle, which is technically an element of the remote you’re supposed to be able to disable. Scrubbing using the touchpad works, just very badly. The cause of these problems...&lt;/p&gt;
