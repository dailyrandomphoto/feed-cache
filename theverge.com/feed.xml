    <title>The Matrix Resurrections won’t hit HBO Max until 3AM ET on December 22nd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DL1TKUMhpo8aX8jtePH9iY3GrBs=/471x0:1950x986/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70299184/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_12.22.59_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Exa6EF"&gt;Bad news, &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; fans: Warner Bros. isn’t going to be releasing &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; early on HBO Max &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22737133/dune-hbo-max-stream-it-early-denis-villenueve"&gt;like it did for &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the highly anticipated fourth film in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix &lt;/em&gt;franchise will make its streaming debut on December 22nd at 3:01AM ET / 12:01AM PT — meaning you’ll either have to stay up &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; late to catch the movie when it first comes out or (more sensibly) wait until Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlL6Ni"&gt;The news isn’t entirely surprising given that HBO Max usually releases new episodes and movies at 3:01AM ET (or the equivalent time in other time zones) the date that they come out. Still, the company has broken its pattern a few times when it comes to major HBO Max releases: &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, as noted earlier, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22737133/dune-hbo-max-stream-it-early-denis-villenueve"&gt;hit the service a few hours ahead...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Meta cracks down on phishing scams that use its trademarks</title>

  &lt;p id="bqzIt3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/taking-legal-action-against-phishing-attacks/"&gt;Meta is taking legal action&lt;/a&gt; against the bad actors who allegedly impersonated Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram to conduct a phishing scam. The company claims that since 2019, the defendants created over 39,000 websites in an attempt to replicate Meta’s services, subsequently deceiving users and collecting their login information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="datAvp"&gt;In the post on its blog, Meta explains that the defendants used a relay service, Ngrok, to send internet traffic to the phony login pages they created, all while concealing their identity and location. Those who clicked the phishing link were brought to a login page that resembled Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, or WhatsApp. When the user attempted to log in, defendants would collect their victims’...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cortana would be named Bingo if Steve Ballmer had his way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cortana Windows Phone 8.1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DFK0l3MLFteUajVaO7FkWr8FW9A=/0x0:636x424/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70298845/cortanawp811_640.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o54yAL"&gt;Steve Ballmer wanted Microsoft’s Cortana AI to be called “Bingo” so it would be more Microsoft-branded, according to &lt;a href="https://bigbets.substack.com/p/cortana-with-sandeep-paruchuri-big"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Big Bets &lt;/em&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;That’s according to former Microsoft product manager Sandeep Paruchuri, who recounted the story of how Microsoft’s AI assistant got its name to writer&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Alice Newton Rex as part of a deep dive into Cortana’s origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcabL1"&gt;While we’ve gotten a pretty good idea of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/2/5570866/cortana-windows-phone-8-1-digital-assistant"&gt;Microsoft’s ambitious vision for the AI assistant&lt;/a&gt; in the years since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/20/5430188/microsoft-cortana-personal-digital-assistant-windows-phone-8-1"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; then launched, Paruchuri and Rex gave the inside story of how Cortana was named, pitched to management, and the clash that happened between dreams and reality. Also included are interesting details about how the assistant became one of the main advertising points for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The EV revolution’s next big roadblock: access to chargers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Transportation Secretary Buttigieg Highlights New Electric Vehicle Charging Station On Earth Day" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kFKxY5ujJ8Hj15FVs2SryY-8d50=/0x0:7987x5325/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70298803/1232464133.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electric vehicles are displayed before a news conference with White House Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg about the American Jobs Plan and to highlight electric vehicles at Union Station near Capitol Hill on April 22nd, 2021 in Washington, DC.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Drew Angerer / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="14FCNy"&gt;Electric vehicles are set to play a critical role in our clean energy future, but in order for everyone to reap the benefits of EVs, they’ll need access to chargers. While the Build Back Better bill &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/12/19/manchin-climate-build-back-better/"&gt;suffered a major setback&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend that could mean significantly less funding for the transition to electric vehicles, there’s still hope that the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/"&gt;bipartisan infrastructure law&lt;/a&gt; passed in November could bring EV charging infrastructure to places that have been left out until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fak77t"&gt;That could make it easier for drivers from marginalized communities to switch to electric vehicles, while also cleaning up the air in their neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2JfWDa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The way charging stations are spread out now is neither equitable nor convenient&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2YERa"&gt;The way charging...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former head of Sonic Team releases new self-made mobile game</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2eoPOW"&gt;Yuji Naka — former head of Sonic Team — released a new game under his one-man studio Prope called &lt;a href="http://iprope.com/SHOT2048.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shot2048&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Naka was the lead programmer for the original &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; (which seems to be playable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834023/sega-genesis-sonic-1-tesla-arcade"&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt; nowadays) and most recently left his short stay at Square Enix to spend his time working on this hyper-casual title for mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nP75bx"&gt;The goal in &lt;em&gt;Shot2048 &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1594889891"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PropeLtd.SHOT2048"&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;) is to roll dice to the end of an alley and combine (multiply) enough like-numbers to create at least one die valued at 2048. It did take me about five attempts to win my first game... and about four tries to understand the game. There aren’t much in terms of instructions other than this iOS App Store description (though admittedly, after reading it again...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to add a background to Safari in iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RZoXuKPRgK9Wg83jqbtTM1aaQ8s=/0x61:828x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70298532/IMG_7C05618AF24F_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;div id="XkjXR2"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zHUp55"&gt;iOS 15 has brought with it a number of features that don’t affect your privacy, your efficiency, or your fitness. They’re — well, just nice. One of them is the new ability to change the background of the mobile version of Safari so that when you open a new page, you’re looking at something beautiful or wildly colorful. Or just nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBqVCk"&gt;The process is almost ridiculously simple. Here’s how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UHuOaj"&gt;Once you’re in the Safari app, you’re going to open a new page. Not sure how to do that? Look for the double square in the bottom-right corner and tap on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="li37sR"&gt;You’ll see thumbnails of all the pages currently open in Safari. (If there are loads of them, you may want to take this opportunity to get rid of a few.) Tap on the plus sign in the...&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>EV startup Canoo loses chief technology officer and two co-founders</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I8vfHd"&gt;EV startup Canoo is losing three top executives, including its chief technology officer Peter Savagian, as part of an apparent shakeup of its leadership team. Savagian, the former chief engineer of General Motors EV1 electric car, will leave Canoo by the end of the year, according to the &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/76/canoo-expands-executive-team-to-execute-business-and"&gt;last line of a press release published Monday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tuv8Sl"&gt;The two others are some of Canoo’s remaining co-founders, according two current employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on the condition of anonymity, though they weren’t named in the press release: Bill Strickland, the head of Canoo’s vehicle programs and a longtime Ford executive, and Alexi Charbonneau, who worked at both SpaceX and Tesla and oversaw Canoo’s powertrain division. Strickland and Charbonneau did...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The QuietOn 3 earbuds use ANC to help you sleep</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vQ8yw8eZ8gbhopA4ToGLLgNz3gc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70298318/bkrasnoff_211202_4936_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q871O3"&gt;I’ve always been a light sleeper, and that has not improved over the last few years. So I thought I was the perfect person to try out the latest version of the QuietOn active noise-canceling earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rULbA7"&gt;The QuietOn 3 earbuds, which cost $239, are the third iteration of these devices. They are smaller than the previous version, the QuietOn 2, but the basic functionality is the same. Unlike other “help to sleep” earbuds such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review"&gt;Bose Sleepbuds II&lt;/a&gt;, they don’t generate white noise, or play quiet music, or let you hear rain or other soothing sounds. The idea is simply to eliminate low-frequency noises, such as the hum of a nearby appliance, that may keep you from sleeping while allowing you to still hear an alarm clock going off. &lt;a href="https://quieton.com/technology/"&gt;According to...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brian Eno is not a fan of NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="brian eno-shamil tanna-01" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FM-EZi2GPcZyJu9GmcJFxOWFVOs=/0x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297916/shamil_tanna_2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u4B6v3"&gt;If you were saving up Ethereum for a set of &lt;em&gt;Discreet Music&lt;/em&gt; NFTs, we’ve got bad news. In &lt;a href="https://the-crypto-syllabus.com/brian-eno-on-nfts-and-automatism/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Crypto Syllabus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (conducted by longtime tech critic &lt;a href="https://www.evgenymorozov.com/"&gt;Evgeny Morozov&lt;/a&gt;, of all people), Eno outed himself as a skeptic of cryptocurrency — and NFTs in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSan1x"&gt;“NFTs seem to me just a way for artists to get a little piece of the action from global capitalism, our own cute little version of financialization,” Eno told Morozov. “How sweet — now artists can become little capitalist assholes as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="yMARuX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yFY9xX"&gt;Best known for his pioneering ambient work and prolific producer credits, Eno seems like the perfect artist for the NFT era. He’s spent decades making art with an eye towards technology and its social implications, often made available as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/8/3475456/brian-eno-scape-ipad-app-ambient-music-creation"&gt;s...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
