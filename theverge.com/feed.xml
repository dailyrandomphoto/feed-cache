    <title>The NFL jumps to Twitter Spaces after initial Clubhouse partnership</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DqhaEz"&gt;The National Football League is signing on to use Twitter Spaces. As part of &lt;a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/National-Football-League-and-Twitter-Extend-Partnership-Through-Multi-Year-Deal.aspx"&gt;a new deal&lt;/a&gt; with Twitter — which will see the social network continue to run game highlight videos — the NFL has agreed to host 20 live audio rooms throughout the 2021 season. Those will include “current NFL players and other NFL talent” as hosts discussing the season’s matchups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrmx2F"&gt;Twitter’s partnership with the NFL would appear to be a blow to Clubhouse, which &lt;a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/clubhouse-announces-exclusive-content-deal-with-nfl-its-first-official-spo/599005/"&gt;previously partnered with the league&lt;/a&gt; to host live audio rooms during the draft in April. It was Clubhouse’s first official sports league programming — and now the NFL has jumped to Twitter and signed on to be Twitter’s first sports partner. A Clubhouse spokesperson said the company has an “ongoing...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vilo’s three-router mesh Wi-Fi system covers your home for just $59</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PwlKbQFebammfwQw-YAShwk-PY0=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556536/Vilo_March2021_ErinLodiPhotography_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A single Vilo router costs $19.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Vilo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z9Qg9R"&gt;Vilo is a new mesh Wi-Fi company that promises a three-device system that covers up to 4,500 square feet for just $59. That’s much more affordable than the mesh Wi-Fi systems offered by more established brands like Eero, whose &lt;a href="https://eero.com/shop/eero"&gt;comparable system costs $199&lt;/a&gt; for a three-pack. Vilo is also selling a single standalone router for $19, compared to $79 with Eero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RmKtj"&gt;As you might expect, Vilo’s affordable pricing means you’re not getting top-of-the-line specs. There’s no Wi-Fi 6 here, so it’s not ready for the next-generation standard, and it’s also dual-band rather than tri-band, meaning it lacks the extra 5GHz band that other systems use to provide better communication between their routers and satellites. Each base station has three...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will comply with India’s new rules to keep its legal immunity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SF--h8t0tW4sygh1wK1_hv70mjQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556381/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ADWtNc"&gt;Twitter has outlined how it intends to “fully comply” with India’s new social media rules after the government said its lack of compliance meant it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564768/twitter-india-legal-liability-users-posts-defamation-digital-media-ethics-code"&gt;could be held legally liable&lt;/a&gt; for its user’s posts, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/twitter-pledges-to-fully-comply-with-india-internet-rules?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. In response to the government’s filing, a lawyer for the company said it has already appointed an interim chief compliance officer and that it would soon have a grievance officer and an employee to respond to law enforcement requests, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-appoints-india-interim-compliance-exec-fill-other-jobs-soon-2021-07-08/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter is required to fill each of the roles under new regulations introduced this year. The company also said it would be setting up an India liaison office in the next eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRsXVw"&gt;Had Twitter not pledged to comply with the rules, it faced being made legally liable for users’...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen, BMW fined $1 billion for colluding to make dirtier cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="File: Global Carmakers Brace For Tariff Whiplash" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aDR3F_siHbDdbfVSJhOSCgdlLWE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556348/989626420.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IMkxPd"&gt;Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler spent years illegally colluding to slow the deployment of cleaner emissions technology, says the European Union, which is &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3581"&gt;dishing out fines as a result&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgHabJ"&gt;The EU’s executive branch hit the Volkswagen Group (which owns Audi and Porsche) and BMW with a collective €875 million ($1 billion) fine on Thursday for their role in the scheme. Volkswagen Group must pay €502 million ($595 million), while BMW will pay €373 million ($442 million). Daimler, however, evaded a €727 million fine of its own because the automaker revealed the collusion to the regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gCst8"&gt;The scheme described by EU authorities is separate from the Volkswagen Group’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352646/volkswagen-dieselgate-investigation-damages-winterkorn-audi"&gt;massive Dieselgate scandal&lt;/a&gt;, in which...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hori’s Split Pad Pro for the Switch is $10 off at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DHmsWglKjz3FA0yIohWeLOxYqPk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556244/DSCF7116.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJUBaZ"&gt;The deals are thin today, but there are a few that are worth sharing with you. If you already have a Switch or are planning to get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565307/nintendo-oled-switch-screen-news-updates"&gt;the OLED model launching in October&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll definitely want to get Hori’s Split Pad Pro controllers. You can get them in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FJ7XY3B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the translucent black colorway (in my opinion, the best option available) for $40 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $10 off their normal price. These slide in just like Joy-Con controllers but are more accommodating for larger hands than Nintendo’s. They make the Switch less portable, but it might be worth it for you. Unlike Joy-Con, though, these don’t feature rumble, and they only work while connected to the Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpYrmR"&gt;If you need more convincing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871866/hori-split-pad-pro-controller-nintendo-switch-daemon-x-machina-review"&gt;check out my colleague Sam Byford’s hands-on with the...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PodcastOne’s ‘free’ podcast hosting service will cost you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ta1rnYRTeTKxYJMv1u9PgNMaC7Q=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556234/launchpadone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;PodcastOne&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K2ccgh"&gt;PodcastOne, the podcast network behind shows from people like Mike Tyson and Tom Green, is looking to make more money off shows outside its network. The company is expanding and rebranding its free hosting service, now known as Launchpad One, with more perks to make it appeal to indie podcasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOCQ3r"&gt;The free hosting platform allows podcasters to not only host their show, but also accept PayPal donations (a new feature), distribute the show across platforms, and insert their own ads. PodCastOne says it’ll also market shows that use its platform across its own network, a benefit that many hosting services don’t or can’t offer. It says 1,000 shows are already on the service, which was previously known as LaunchpadDM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKpQwB"&gt;At the same time, there’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LiveWire One is Harley-Davidson’s second chance at electric motorcycle dominance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Qf4no"&gt;Harley-Davidson is renewing its push into electric motorcycles with the reveal of its latest battery-powered product, the LiveWire One. While the new bike will roughly have the same specs as the company’s first LiveWire motorcycle, it will be more attractively priced in the hopes of attracting more customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrhmWZ"&gt;The LiveWire One will start at $21,999, without factoring in any federal, state, or local tax benefits. (Any electric motorcycle that can go at least 45mph is eligible for a 10 percent federal tax credit, up to $2,500.) When you take into account these credits, Harley-Davidson said the price will actually fall below $20,000 for most customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zotZyS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Harley-Davidson said the price will actually fall below $20,000 for most customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to start posting videos on TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8sHCdpts5gdHAM2YF1HU-euSCZo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556155/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7pP10h"&gt;Okay, this article is for those who have never posted a video on TikTok. The rest of you? Stop snickering, and go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tf4ObF"&gt;Are we alone? Okay, here we go. To begin, there are actually more TikTok newbies than you’d think. But the service is definitely worth exploring: TikTok is a really fun (and sometimes even educational) app. And after you’ve swiped through a bunch of videos — some great, some really funny, and some that you wish you’d never seen — you may want to try your hand at creating your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBCmCP"&gt;TikTok has its own culture: straightforward, brash, sometimes (actually often) pushing past the bounds of what many would consider good taste. That’s why it’s so creative. But while you can be as wild as you want (within &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en"&gt;certain boundaries, of...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Huge leap’ for NASA’s Mars helicopter ushers new mission support role</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o5Rboo"&gt;The Séítah region on Mars, filled with rocks and sand dunes, was too treacherous for NASA’s Perseverance rover to drive across. So Ingenuity, the tiny helicopter accompanying the rover, flew over the area on Monday and snapped some photos of a key spot on the other side. In less than three minutes, Ingenuity spared Perseverance the months it would have had to spend driving to take its own photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iEhjh"&gt;The quick Monday morning jump across Séítah was Ingenuity’s ninth flight on Mars so far, but it marked the first time the chopper lent a helping hand to Perseverance in its hunt for ancient signs of life at the Red Planet’s Jezero Crater. The four-pound helicopter arrived on Mars on February 14th, attached to Perseverance’s underside, and became...&lt;/p&gt;
