    <title>Oculus’ latest Quest update brings mixed reality capture that only requires an iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oculus Live Overlay" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qx2j4P7bOpiv5Rz3lbJiNRL73EQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300645/oculusliveoverlay.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Oculus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PO5Lxs"&gt;Oculus will soon roll out its v29 software for Quest and Quest 2 headsets, and this one adds more features and functionality to the lineup. The most exciting one is a new Live Overlay casting feature that will give you an easy way to capture a mixed reality view of you using VR superimposed over the content displayed in your headset. Any VR app that supports casting and recording will work with this feature, according to Oculus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUoflT"&gt;All you’ll need is at least an iPhone XS or newer, a Quest headset, and the Oculus app for iOS updated to a new version that’s coming to “a subset of users.” Then you turn on the feature and have someone aim the camera at you (or aim it at yourself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzQWF1"&gt;There are other highlights to mention in this software...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot suspends Valorant pro six months for failing to cooperate in sexual assault investigation</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iuUrNP"&gt;Professional &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; player Jay “Sinatraa” Won has been suspended for six months by Riot Games for “failing to fully cooperate” with an ongoing investigation into an allegation of sexual assault. The investigation stems from an allegation dating back to March of this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323695/jay-sinatraa-won-valorant-suspended-sexual-assault-allegations"&gt;when Won was accused of sexual abuse by a former girlfriend&lt;/a&gt;, which was supported by recordings and screenshots of messages. At the time, Won was indefinitely suspended by both Riot, which develops &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; and organizes most online competitions, and Sentinels, the team for which he plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiRFvI"&gt;According to Riot, this latest suspension is related to Won’s behavior during the investigation. &lt;a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/esports/competitive-ruling-jay-sinatraa-won/"&gt;In a statement&lt;/a&gt;, the company said:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s WorkingWell will attempt to fix employee health issues with stretching and guided meditation</title>

  &lt;p id="W9pC5t"&gt;Amazon is launching &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/body-mechanics-mindfulness-amazon-launches-employee-designed"&gt;a new series of health programs&lt;/a&gt; called WorkingWell designed to prevent workplace injuries in the company’s expansive system of warehouses and distribution centers in the US. While the new health program is an attempt to address the 40 percent of work-related injuries Amazon has identified as musculoskeletal disorders (think carpal tunnel syndrome or back pain), it doesn’t come with any changes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266369/amazon-ten-hour-overnight-shifts-warehouse-workers"&gt;the long shifts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493752/amazon-warehouses-robots-higher-injury-rates-report-reveal"&gt;demanding working conditions&lt;/a&gt; that might cause them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxQvKK"&gt;As part of WorkingWell, workers will have dedicated meetings to watch videos covering health and safety topics, and designated spaces for stretching and meditating at work. Depending on the station and job, some workers will also receive timed video...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WarnerMedia CEO reportedly negotiating departure after being left out of AT&amp;T–Discovery deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hulu LLC CEO Jason Kilar News Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pvwdbmt3R-BsyxlN6KFbs_R2jxY=/0x84:3000x2084/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300401/123197464.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1PwyTd"&gt;WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, who was appointed to the role &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203135/warnermedia-hulu-jason-kilar-ceo-john-stankey-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-wars-netflix-disney"&gt;in April 2020&lt;/a&gt;, is negotiating his departure from the company following AT&amp;amp;T’s announcement that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;merging WarnerMedia with Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/business/jason-kilar-warnermedia.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Kilar was “kept in the dark about the deal until recent days,” sources told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AztT9k"&gt;Kilar has been overseeing all of WarnerMedia, including Warner Bros., Turner, and HBO. But it was unclear how he would slot into the new company given that Discovery’s president and CEO David Zaslav &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/warnermedia_discovery.html"&gt;is set to head it up&lt;/a&gt;. Kilar joined AT&amp;amp;T just a month before HBO Max launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21268490/hbo-max-launch-price-warnermedia-att-dc-harry-potter-friends-disney-netflix-peacock"&gt;in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and he orchestrated a major reorganization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21359128/warnermedia-reorg-bob-greenblatt-kevin-reilly-hbo-max-jason-kilar-streaming"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; that gave HBO Max even more of a priority at the company.

    <title>Unannounced Beats Studio Buds appear in Apple’s latest beta software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZn4KWrHQuA-cJuq6ZJjQ6McE0c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300318/DSCF5800.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YVUMMi"&gt;Aside from churning out some limited edition colors, Beats has been in a bit of a quiet period since the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;the Beats Flex last October&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems that the Apple-owned brand is preparing to launch some new, high-end earbuds. As spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/beats-studio-buds/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are images of “Beats Studio Buds” in the latest beta releases of iOS and tvOS. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/17/exclusive-these-are-apples-new-truly-wireless-in-ear-beats-studio-earbuds/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also uncovered images of the charging case and some system animations of the earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0cddl"&gt;The unannounced earbuds look much different than the Powerbeats Pro, which have become a popular pick among the fitness crowd. These don’t have any ear hooks whatsoever, and they seem to have a diagonal steam that extends slightly upward. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Server glitch allowed Eufy owners to see through other homes’ cameras </title>

  &lt;p id="NHzHSV"&gt;Last night, a number of Eufy home security camera owners discovered they were able to access smart camera feeds and saved videos from users they had never met, due to an apparent security glitch. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/17/huge-eufy-privacy-breach/"&gt;First reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the issue came to light in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/neayuo/access_to_random_cameras_in_another_country/"&gt;an extended Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;, in which users from around the world detailed their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H76KJQ"&gt;“Basically I could see every camera, their front door and backdoor bells, master bedroom, living room, garage, kitchen, their motion recordings, everything,” one Eufy owner noted. “I was wondering what was going on as it still had my email and name as signed in and noticed that some unknown email, I’m guessing of the Hawaii owner, was in my shared guest account.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Phone app can now announce who’s calling when the phone rings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5 in “Sorta Sage” green" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bG99qIER1grtTGL-hNvbWMfIxf8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299471/akrales_201012_4137_0117.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7banju"&gt;Google is rolling out a new feature for the Google Phone app that announces who’s calling when the phone rings, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/17/google-phone-gains-caller-id-announcement-feature-to-help-you-manually-screen-calls/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If it’s rolled out to you, you can set whether you want the app to announce caller ID every time the phone rings, only when you’re wearing a headset, or never, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyJmwN"&gt;iOS has had a feature like this for some time, and it seems like Google’s version for the Phone app works similarly to Apple’s implementation. On my iPhone, I find caller ID announcements to be really useful — it’s very handy to know who’s calling before I even look at my phone. Caller ID announcements are also a great accessibility feature, allowing people with visual disabilities to more easily know who is calling them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4lDqf3"&gt;Sadly,...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JDychf"&gt;Consumers lost over $2 million in cryptocurrency to scammers impersonating Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk over the last six months, &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/05/spotting-cryptocurrency-investment-scams"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission reported Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BmjA9"&gt;“Promises of guaranteed huge returns or claims that your cryptocurrency will be multiplied are always scams,” the commission said in its Monday report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="561eGT"&gt;For years, scammers have posed as Musk in order to fraud social media users out of cryptocurrency. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17096128/twitter-vitalik-buterin-elon-musk-cryptocurrency-scams"&gt;They use deceptive tactics on sites like Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, often using the same avatar images as Musk’s own account and slightly misspelling his username. Pretending to be Musk, the scammers will ask victims to send...&lt;/p&gt;
