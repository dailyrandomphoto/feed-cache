    <title>Twitter begins analyzing harmful impacts of its algorithms</title>

  &lt;p id="kCijza"&gt;Twitter is starting a new initiative, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-responsible-machine-learning-initiative.html"&gt;Responsible Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;, to assess any “unintentional harms” caused by its algorithms. A team of engineers, researchers, and data scientists across the company will study how Twitter’s use of machine learning can lead to algorithmic biases that negatively impact users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o68rLo"&gt;One of the first tasks is an assessment of racial and gender bias in Twitter’s image cropping algorithm. Twitter users have pointed out that its auto-cropped photo previews seem to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;favor white faces over Black faces&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;began testing&lt;/a&gt; displaying full images rather than cropped previews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nznhs"&gt;The team will also look at how timeline recommendations differ across racial subgroups and analyze content recommendations...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Edge’s new Kids Mode is ideal for shared family PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Edge Kids Mode" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZCDSI84GG8SA4tuD81zp1cFiqc=/80x0:958x585/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69131123/KM_news_feed.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NEXWTJ"&gt;Microsoft is launching a new Kids Mode for its Edge browser today. It’s built directly into Microsoft Edge on Windows and macOS as a free option that’s simple to enable and doesn’t require much work for parents to manage. The mode can be enabled by selecting it from the Edge profile option, and it will lock kids into the Edge browser with access only to approved sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HwJh4"&gt;“It’s a free, protected online environment for kids 12 and under that gives parents peace of mind when their kids browse the web on a shared device,” explains Divya Kumar, product director of Microsoft Edge, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches $200 million fund for climate change</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z0P1J5"&gt;Apple has created a $200 million fund to invest in forestry projects to help remove carbon from the atmosphere while also generating financial returns for its investors, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-and-partners-launch-first-ever-200-million-restore-fund%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F15%2F22385552%2Fapple-200-million-fund-climate-change-environment" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company said Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The Restore Fund will invest in forest properties that are managed to increase carbon removal and produce timber. The goal is to remove 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoAfi6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332461/apple-carbon-neutral-2030-climate-change"&gt;Apple said last year&lt;/a&gt; it wants to eliminate its contributions to climate change and become carbon neutral by 2030. The company says it will directly eliminate 75 percent of emissions from its supply chain and products by 2030, and the Restore Fund will help address the other 25 percent of its emissions. Apple’s partners in the Restore Fund...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook hit a key climate goal</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UwtAkk"&gt;Facebook announced today that it exceeded&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;one of its biggest environmental goals: it managed to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 94 percent in 2020. It had previously pledged to cut planet-heating emissions by 75 percent. The company said that it had also achieved its goal of “net zero emissions” — not putting any more emissions into the atmosphere than it can take out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzcRqm"&gt;Facebook also announced that it had achieved another goal: it now purchases enough renewable energy to cover 100 percent of its global operations, which includes its offices and data centers. But that doesn’t mean that all of its operations are actually powered by renewables like solar and wind energy — at least not yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="6mPJK6"&gt;“With more options for getting started, and staying active and healthy during pregnancy as well as at any age or fitness level, we hope even more people will be inspired to keep moving with our amazing team of passionate trainers,” said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s senior director of fitness technologies, in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Peloton Bike Plus’ GymKit support no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes</title>

  &lt;p id="ZiuLwt"&gt;Peloton debuted its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22238974/peloton-bike-plus-review-price-features"&gt;Bike Plus&lt;/a&gt; with a much-desired feature: GymKit support. But now, the company’s pulling back some of that functionality. A Peloton spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today that GymKit no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes and instead will “only be available in cycling classes for now.” The spokesperson also said: “Peloton is committed to bringing the GymKit integration to all workouts and disciplines within Apple’s terms of service,” seemingly suggesting bootcamp workouts didn’t fall under those terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYdBuC"&gt;This change is a disruptive one for users who might have purchased the Bike Plus specifically for its GymKit support. It’s the first piece of hardware from the connected fitness company to support GymKit, and the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Chromebook Spin 513 with a Snapdragon 7c processor starts at $480</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dsskNS"&gt;We already knew Acer was working on the first two Chrome OS devices powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c chips. And today, the company has released two product listings for its Chromebook Spin 513, but you can’t buy this laptop just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wv9jHs"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/acer-chromebook-spin-513-starts-at-479-with-snapdragon-7c/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;AboutChromebooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Chromebook Spin 513 with the Snapdragon 7c processor has two configuration listings that have appeared on Acer’s website, with a starting price of $479.99. Acer announced in October that the Chromebook Spin would start at $399.99. Additionally, both laptops also do not show 4G LTE for connectivity, which is something that was noted to be a configuration option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtiAuV"&gt;The key difference between the two is the RAM configuration, which is only a $20 price difference. Although...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZtfUjM"&gt;Core, the platform that hopes to help creators build games and players experience them, is launching for free in early access today. It’s available exclusively on the Epic Games Store and already includes over 20,000 free playable games across a wide variety of genres including team-based multiplayer shooters, RPGs, and side-scrollers. Core’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;developer, Manticore Games, says that over a million players and creators have used the platform while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21158189/core-free-game-creation-tool-pc-youtube-twitch"&gt;it’s been in alpha over the past year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOZEA6"&gt;The aim with Core is to make it easier for creators to develop and monetize games, similar to what YouTube did for online video, while gamers get “an endless arcade of high-quality, user-built games and worlds.” The platform’s development tools are built on...&lt;/p&gt;
