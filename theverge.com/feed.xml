    <title>Valve is working with AMD to make the Steam Deck Windows 11-ready</title>

  &lt;p id="8vC3yB"&gt;Valve is aiming to make its Steam Deck handheld gaming PC ready for Windows 11. While we’ve known for weeks that the Steam Deck &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578879/valve-steam-deck-handheld-pc-windows-support"&gt;can run Windows&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t clear how well this would be supported by Valve, or whether an option for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;Trusted Platform Modules (TPM)&lt;/a&gt; would be enabled to get Windows 11 on the Steam Deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WrWAX"&gt;Now, Valve has confirmed it has been heavily focused on Windows support. “There’s work looking at TPM just now,” says Greg Coomer, a Valve Steam Deck designer, in &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/steam-deck-windows-11-tpm-compatibility/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve focused so much on Windows 10, so far, that we haven’t really gotten that far into it. Our expectation is that we can meet that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKSqvN"&gt;Valve is working with AMD to make sure that TPM is supported at a BIOS level, and that the Steam Deck...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple pushes back against child abuse scanning concerns in new FAQ </title>

  &lt;p id="ZGzBGm"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"&gt;new FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has attempted to assuage concerns that its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;anti-child abuse measures&lt;/a&gt; could be turned into surveillance tools by authoritarian governments. “Let us be clear, this technology is limited to detecting CSAM [child sexual abuse material] stored in iCloud and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it,” the company writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeChzT"&gt;Apple’s new tools, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;announced last Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, include two features designed to protect children. One, called “communication safety,” uses on-device machine learning to identify and blur sexually explicit images received by children in the Messages app, and can notify a parent if a child age 12 and younger decides to view or send such an image. The second is designed to detect known CSAM...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SteamVR beta lets you arrange desktop windows inside your virtual world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/is9-k_gW9UY3Gy3jnHGeUHbBeXo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69697994/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="65t9Xd"&gt;As of its &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/2979680118212870441"&gt;latest beta release&lt;/a&gt;, Valve’s SteamVR software can add floating desktop windows inside VR games, letting you keep an eye on other apps without leaving VR. It’s a helpful addition, allowing players to keep an eye on anything from Discord, to a Twitch chat, or Netflix during a lower-intensity game. &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/steamvr-update-1-19-6-floating-desktop-windows/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Road to VR&lt;/em&gt; suggests&lt;/a&gt; you could even watch YouTube during longer flights in &lt;em&gt;Elite Dangerous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2Icnn"&gt;The ability to interact with the rest of your desktop from within SteamVR’s dashboard is not a new feature, but recently Valve has been making the system more flexible. Earlier this year it added the option to view individual application windows in the dashboard, and to be virtually &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/steamvr-beta-update-virtual-desktop-window-view-controller-attach/"&gt;attached to VR controllers&lt;/a&gt; ingame. This made apps viewable at a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New report reveals how the climate crisis is supercharging extreme weather</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Southeast Texas Inundated After Harvey Makes Second Pass Over The Region" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oCAEcIdhTjlHTPH-shO53PhcM20=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69697962/841346500.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A home is surrounded by floodwater after torrential rains pounded Southeast Texas following Hurricane and Tropical Storm Harvey on August 31, 2017 near Orange, Texas. Researchers later determined that climate change supercharged the storm, and was was responsible for up to $67 billion of the $90 billion in damage caused by Harvey.  | Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bZMAGw"&gt;We now have the clearest picture yet of how different the world is today as a result of human-driven climate change. The most comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; to date on the physical science of climate change was published today by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ4DzF"&gt;“Climate change is a problem that is here now. Nobody’s safe, and it’s getting worse faster,” Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme said in a press conference today. “We must treat climate change as an immediate threat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNxERe"&gt;Extreme events — from floods to heatwaves and droughts — have gotten worse, it says in a nutshell. And scientists are even more certain than they were before that humans’ greenhouse gas...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Venom: Let There be Carnage, Y: The Last Man, The Great, and more</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PEGNRi"&gt;So in addition to watching &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, missing &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesdays, and keeping my Paramount Plus subscription current so I can watch the extremely underappreciated show &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt;, I’m still slogging through &lt;em&gt;Manifest. &lt;/em&gt;I’m halfway through Season 2,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the plot has become weirdly elaborate and yet the show remains so cheesy that I must see how things end up. Of course, we’re awaiting word from Netflix about whether there will be any seasons past the show’s third, but &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/netflix-reconsiders-saving-manifest-1234985839/"&gt;recent developments look promising&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tesla will reportedly require masks as its Nevada plant | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kXhAhv"&gt;All Tesla workers at the company’s battery factory in Reno, Nevada will be required to wear masks indoors beginning Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-to-require-masks-at-nevada-battery-factory-11628444515?mod=latest_headlines"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The plant already required workers unvaccinated against COVID-19 to wear masks indoors, but the new rule includes vaccinated workers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrUexZ"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/us/nevada"&gt;Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center,&lt;/a&gt; Nevada has seen more than 26,000 new COVID infections in the past month, and 298 deaths. The center estimates that nearly 47 percent of the state’s population has been vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJLkfZ"&gt;At the beginning of the pandemic last year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk pushed back against COVID restrictions, including stay-at-home orders in Alameda County, California, where its Fremont plant is located. While...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Report finds Doximity, a social network for doctors, is riddled with anti-vaccine comments</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vaccine misinformation appears rampant on a social media site for doctors | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H5wAkq"&gt;A social media site for doctors is seeing “hundreds of comments”— many with false claims and conspiracy theories— on posts about the COVID-19 vaccine and the pandemic, according to a new report &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/doximity-social-network-for-doctors-full-of-antivax-disinformation.html"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Doximity is limited to healthcare professionals in the US— it verifies members before they can join— and no one who posts to the site is anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9Y9VI"&gt;Doximity also doesn’t allow users to post articles or stories; instead it posts items from medical and science publications and mainstream news articles. Each user has a feed of aggregated content that is customized for them, based on the user’s preferences including area of medical practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9If3m"&gt;But Doximity members &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; comment on articles, which is where the misinformation and conspiracy...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla Cybertruck production delayed to 2022</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IxlLAz"&gt;Production on Tesla’s Cybertruck, the automaker’s first electric pickup truck, has been delayed until 2022 according to its order page on the company’s website. First reported by &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/07/tesla-confirms-cybertruck-electric-pickup-delay-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, under the “due today” section of the Cybertruck’s order page it now reads “you will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in 2022.” This appears to apply to the single- dual- and tri-motor versions of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The configuration page for Tesla’s Cybertruck as of August 8th, 2021.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MuWtJf"&gt;The delay isn’t a huge surprise to those who have been following Cybertruck news closely. When Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date"&gt;Elon Musk unveiled it in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the plan called for the first Cybertrucks to roll off the assembly line in late 2021. In January...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="EfTQjg"&gt;When you buy something on Amazon, the e-commerce giant isn’t always the one making the sale; an &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/259782/third-party-seller-share-of-amazon-platform/"&gt;estimated half of all products&lt;/a&gt; sold on Amazon come from third-party sellers. Amazon says it’s merely the conduit between buyer and seller, and doesn’t bear responsibility if a third-party product is defective (although some recent court cases have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414185/california-appeals-court-amazon-marketplace-responsible-third-party-hoverboard"&gt;challenged that stance&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFrHdP"&gt;Third-party sellers aren’t supposed to be able to email Amazon customers directly outside of the platform, but a new report in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-amazon-customers-leave-negative-reviews-some-sellers-hunt-them-down-11628420400"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that some sellers can find ways to get in touch with buyers who leave negative product reviews, and some businesses even offer “email extraction” for buyers as a service to sellers. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="SPcl2U"&gt;The Tokyo Olympics have ended, with the closing ceremonies &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/tokyo-2020-olympics-08-08-21-spt/index.html"&gt;wrapping things up Sunday&lt;/a&gt; (NBC will broadcast them Sunday evening in the US). But before we bid farewell to one of the more unusual Olympics in recent memory, the astronauts aboard the International Space Station have a few last-minute entries for judges’ consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dppdyC"&gt;French astronaut Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency posted a series of four videos to Twitter showing some of the ISS  astronauts performing — I guess we’ll call them “routines”— in zero gravity that would make fine additions to future Olympics. They even hung little flags of all the countries represented over their performance area. The videos are pretty adorkable (and watch with the sound on, I promise...&lt;/p&gt;
