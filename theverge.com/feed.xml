  &lt;p id="WmMrK3"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones are an important piece of tech if you enjoy having zero distractions or outside noise while you jam to funky tunes or listen to podcasts. And, as you might have expected, Cyber Monday is a good time to invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC95lA"&gt;While not as convenient as popping earbuds into your ears, noise-canceling headphones do a better job of erasing sound distractions when stacked up against popular wireless earbuds like Apple’s AirPods Pro or Jabra’s 75t. But if you prefer earbuds over headphones, we have rounded up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611428/black-friday-earbuds-deals-wireless-cyber-monday"&gt;the best wireless earbud deals this Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVgfg2"&gt;We are picking out all of the best deals going on right now on several brands that offer noise-canceling headphones. If you want more deals for other tech categories, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;check...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhitJa"&gt;During Cyber Monday this year, you can expect to find many of the best wireless earbuds on sale for their lowest prices yet. Apple’s AirPods Pro, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus, and other popular models from Jabra, Sony, 1More, and more companies have never been more affordable. If you haven’t yet treated yourself to a set of truly wireless earbuds that connect via Bluetooth, prepare to never look back to using wired earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAI1eM"&gt;We have collected deals across multiple retailers below, and they’re all significantly lower than their usual asking price. As new deals become available or go out of stock, we’ll update this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tdoco8"&gt;If you’re looking for even more Cyber Monday deals, be sure to check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21579415/black-friday-best-deals-sales-tech-headphones-gaming-tvs-laptops"&gt;continuously updated roundup&lt;/a&gt; with all of the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple fined €10M by Italian watchdog over iPhone waterproofing claims</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xnOK2n"&gt;The Italian Competition Authority, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato or AGCM, has fined Apple €10 million (around $12 million) for making misleading claims about the waterproofing of its iPhones, &lt;a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-italy-apple-antitrust/italys-antitrust-fines-apple-10-million-euros-for-misleading-commercial-practices-idUKKBN28A0OH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Affected iPhone models go back to 2017’s iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otrdLk"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2020/11/PS11578"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the AGCM criticized Apple for not being clear enough about its water resistance claims. It said that claims about iPhones being water resistant for up to 30 minutes at depths of up to four meters only apply in certain circumstances like controlled lab tests with pure water. The regulator also criticized Apple’s disclaimer that said water damage is not covered as part of the iPhone’s warranty, despite marketing the phones’ water...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PvCD0L"&gt;Best Buy was one of the first retailers to launch Black Friday deals — all the way back in mid-October to go up against Amazon Prime Day. Now that Cyber Monday is essentially here, Best Buy is back with a bunch of great sales that you can take advantage of. And, you can do all of your shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7NDsp"&gt;Below, you’ll find the best deals currently happening at Best Buy.

As new deals come out, we’ll add those to the top so you can see them easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66OMsk"&gt;Latest deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="hjBsWu"&gt;You don’t often see iPads on sale, even on Cyber Monday, but Best Buy has &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725227826478218776" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the latest model of the iPad mini&lt;/a&gt; with WiFi and 64GB for $300, which is $100 off its usual...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7QychB"&gt;Cyber Monday is here. It’s the last big shopping opportunity of 2020, and if you didn’t already take advantage of some deals that debuted over the weekend, now’s your chance. Every retailer has debuted at least a few new deals earlier than ever, and we’re focused on adding them here — in addition to the great Black Friday deals you can still get. As you’re expecting, there are some great deals on gaming laptops, wireless noise-canceling headphones, earbuds, tablets, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHCSuC"&gt;We’ll be doing our best to keep this post updated during Cyber Monday, and stay tuned throughout Cyber Week as we give you as many chances as possible to get everything on your holiday wish list. We’ve put the latest deals right at the top for easy viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5VU3Q"&gt;It’s rare that Apple slashes the prices on its own products. Fortunately, other retailers are putting a lot of Apple products on sale for Cyber Monday. A bunch of retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Walmart, and Woot are slashing the prices on everything from wearables to its wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIuihu"&gt;Additionally, the online Apple store will have a special promotion on Friday, November 27th, and running until Monday, November 30th. The promotion will allow &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you to get up to $150 in an Apple gift card&lt;/a&gt; if you purchase an eligible product during the four-day event as listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VKYPYw"&gt;Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy an &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-3#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wOJmIA"&gt;Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy AirPods (&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMRXJ2%2Fairpods-with-wireless-charging-case#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wireless&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMV7N2%2Fairpods-with-charging-case#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wired case&lt;/a&gt;) or a pair of &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMWP22AM%2FA%2Fairpods-pro#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;....&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Oculus has discounted VR games and experiences for Cyber Monday</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AUmEQY"&gt;Oculus is hosting a big sale on virtual reality games and experiences for Cyber Monday. There are plenty of standalone deals if you just want one or two titles, but Oculus has also curated several bundles, each one on a different theme. Those will help you save the most money, and Oculus will dock the cost if you already own one of the titles. What’s more, you can gift titles to other people from the Oculus store, too. You’ll just need their email address when checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZcS8g"&gt;According to Oculus, all of the games in the bundles below will work with Quest standalone headsets. Be aware, though, that only some of them support cross-buy, meaning one purchase will work both as a standalone app on Quest and when wired to your PC via Oculus Link....&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9vRnJt"&gt;If you’re looking to improve your home Wi-Fi situation, the best thing you can do is invest in a mesh router. Mesh router systems make it easy to cover all corners of your home with a strong Wi-Fi signal and are easily expandable depending on how much square footage you have. Fortunately, a number of the best mesh router systems on the market are heavily discounted for Cyber Monday, so you can save quite a bit on one right now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1wTGS"&gt;If you have a basic home internet plan of 300Mbps or less, you can do fine with a Wi-Fi 5 based system, such as the entry-level Eero or Google’s Nest Wifi. If you have faster internet at home, up to a gigabit connection, you might want to invest in a Wi-Fi 6 system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live wireless earbuds are cheaper than ever for Cyber Monday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ilYaTK"&gt;Woot is offering the best price yet on the bean-shaped Samsung Galaxy Buds Live wireless earbuds. This model has gone as low as $130 during Black Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-wireless-earbuds-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but they’re currently at $110 for Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Given that the Galaxy Buds Live debuted at $170 in the summer alongside the Note 20-series phones, this is a sharp price drop in a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iY8Z9m"&gt;It’s obvious from looking at them that they offer a bold design, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;according to our review&lt;/a&gt; from Chris Welch, these offer lengthy battery life and powerful sound. They also support wireless charging. The noise cancellation isn’t as effective as he’d hoped, but it’s a nice feature to have in a pinch. You’ll be able to find the Galaxy Buds Live available in a few colors at Woot, including...&lt;/p&gt;
