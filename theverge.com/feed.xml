    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple retakes second place in smartphone shipment rankings as sanctions bite Huawei</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pesyUj"&gt;Apple overtook Huawei to reclaim its spot as the second-bestselling smartphone manufacturer in the world in 2020, according to new research reports from &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-shipped-record-iphones-q4-2020-global-smartphone-market-continues-recover/"&gt;Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-shipment-Q4-2020"&gt;Canalys&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung was still the leading seller in terms of number of smartphones shipped, while Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo took the next three spots, according to Counterpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwdPw2"&gt;It was just under a year ago that the same research analysts reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114885/huawei-overtakes-apple-2019-analysts-strategy-analytics-counterpoint-research-canalys"&gt;Huawei had overtaken Apple&lt;/a&gt; to take second place in 2019. But since then, US trade sanctions seem to have hit Huawei hard. The Chinese company’s smartphone shipments were 21 percent lower in 2020 compared to 2019, according to Counterpoint, and Huawei dropped out of the top five entirely in the fourth quarter of the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After buy ban, GameStop hypebeasts are looking for a Robinhood alternative</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Smd00e"&gt;In the wake of Robinhood’s surprise trading block, a new class of Reddit investors are looking for apps that will let them plow their money into their favorite stocks. On Thursday morning, Robinhood announced that it would temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;block investors&lt;/a&gt; from purchasing or trading companies including GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond, and Nokia, all of which have been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;unexpected rallies over the past few days&lt;/a&gt;. But for the online communities that fueled those rallies, the block is being treated as an outright betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLCypZ"&gt;Discussion about switching ramped up on Twitter and in investment discords after Robinhood halted buying and trading on stock, citing “recent volatility” in the market with the aforementioned stock as...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With Parler down, QAnon moves onto a ‘free speech’ TikTok clone</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Clapper&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7b6NKq"&gt;After this month’s deadly attack at the Capitol, QAnon has been widely banished from the internet. Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have all banned Q-related content, and the right’s favored platform, Parler, has been forced offline for weeks. But it hasn’t all disappeared. A new platform called Clapper, a “free-speech” TikTok clone, is becoming a home for QAnon followers.         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kD5LiA"&gt;Clapper launched last July as a “Free Speech Short Video” app — it’s basically TikTok, but the company promises a lot less moderation. In the six months since its launch, the app has been downloaded over half a million times, with a considerable amount of that growth coming in just the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Yjqtb"&gt;Once you download Clapper, you can start scrolling through a...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="u1gqgv"&gt;In Steve Gaynor’s attic, there is a box that does not belong to him. He bought his Portland home from a family who put the house up for sale after the death of its elderly owner. Months later, Gaynor and his wife discovered a cardboard box full of letters and other artifacts from a stranger’s life. “There was this backstory about this person who had been part of this family that was all contained inside this one cardboard box,” Gaynor said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcJsyK"&gt;It’s an anecdote almost too good to be believed: a co-founder of Fullbright, a studio known for pioneering “walking sim” games, living out his very own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/15/4621514/gone-home-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-style adventure.

    <title>Facebook Oversight Board overturns hate speech and pandemic misinformation takedowns</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H0ZI1U"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board has issued its first round of rulings, upholding one removal and overturning four decisions involving hate speech, nudity, and misinformation. Together, the rulings take an expansive view of what users can post under the current policies, based on concerns about vague rules and protecting freedom of expression online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l94zG4"&gt;The Oversight Board — composed of experts outside Facebook — accepted its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755133/facebook-oversight-board-supreme-court-first-cases-hate-speech-pandemic-misinformation"&gt;first set of cases&lt;/a&gt; in December. While the original slate included six incidents, a user in one case &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-KBHZS8BL/"&gt;proactively deleted their post&lt;/a&gt;, rendering the decision moot. Facebook has pledged to follow its rulings within seven days and respond to recommendations for new policies within 30 days. &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/responding-to-the-oversight-boards-first-decisions/"&gt;In a response to the rulings&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s new Viper 8K promises the fastest performance of any gaming mouse</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Viper 8K weighs two grams more (71g) than the original Viper (69g).&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sKmd4N"&gt;Razer’s Viper 8K is a refresh of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750672/razer-viper-gaming-mouse-optical-switches-price-specs-features"&gt;2019 true ambidextrous Viper&lt;/a&gt;. For the most part, it’s identical and is now available at the same &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming%2Fmice%2Frazer-viper-8khz&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$79 asking price&lt;/a&gt;, but it has some key upgrades for competitive gamers who are hoping that tech might help them get the edge over their opponents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkRGQQ"&gt;First off, Razer now includes the Focus Plus 20,000DPI sensor used in many of its other 2020 mice, along with the latest generation of optical switches that have a more tactile click feel, according to the company (although it didn’t stand out as noticeable to me when I tested the mouse). The biggest news is that, according to Razer, the newly revised Viper can achieve the fastest polling rate of any mouse currently available: up to 8,000Hz — far higher than the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>General Motors, maker of giant trucks and SUVs, vows to be carbon neutral by 2040</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="U.S.-ILLINOIS-GM-AUTO SALES-FALLING" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4eZBc-hehIjJER7aeVcvzaDp7Ss=/20x0:6529x4339/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734083/1230446564.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Xinhua/Joel Lerner via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1xwv5W"&gt;General Motors, an automotive company that sells hundreds of thousands of giant gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs every year, says it will be carbon neutral by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrZzfE"&gt;The company says it will achieve this goal by “removing emissions from all our products, including every vehicle we produce, and all of our global operations in the next twenty years.” And when removing those emissions aren’t possible, GM says it will purchase carbon credits to offset the pollution for which it is responsible. Notably, though, GM wouldn’t commit to ending its sale of gas-powered vehicles within its targeted time frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B58Oq"&gt;The announcement comes a day after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;President Joe Biden signed a series of executive orders&lt;/a&gt; aimed at combating climate change. The new...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These great-sounding Master &amp; Dynamic earbuds are $80 off at Best Buy</title>

  &lt;p id="knEHLH"&gt;If you are in the market for a new pair of wireless earbuds and want something with an unconventional design, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730705444314954977" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Master &amp;amp; Dynamic’s MW07 Go true wireless earbuds are $120 at Best Buy today&lt;/a&gt;. That’s $80 off their usual price of $200. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KjOmr"&gt;At first glance, the MW07 Go look like they might be uncomfortable inside your ears, but don’t let the looks fool you. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Cameron Faulkner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20918033/master-dynamic-mw07-plus-go-truly-wireless-headphones-review-noise-cancellation"&gt;reviewed these earbuds&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and noted they are much more comfortable than their appearance suggests.

    <title>Microsoft turned its sustainability report into a Minecraft map</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5eui9zu7Gs_80HFpdIHS40rOYMc=/9x0:1458x966/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68733501/Sustainability_City_Map_A.0.png" /&gt;

&lt;p id="C0SLNI"&gt;The map features six included lessons, which Mojang says are “designed to give students a sense of stewardship for the planet.” The lessons cover topics like sustainable food production, water outflow and treatment, and responsible forestry. One lesson tasks players with exploring a home built entirely from sustainable materials; another has them venture to a landfill to learn what happens to non-recyclable materials.&lt;/p&gt;
