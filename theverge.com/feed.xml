    <title>The Dish ‘fix’ for the T-Mobile-Sprint merger seems more shortsighted than ever</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/my8K5uIl5Ie7w6wkVmMn7HcqoaQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610250/acastro_200804_1777_dish_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S5QtMQ"&gt;To sell regulators on their $26 billion mega merger, T-Mobile and Sprint executives told anyone who’d listen that the deal would provide &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634195/t-mobile-sprint-merger-conditions-access-coverage"&gt;near-miraculous benefits&lt;/a&gt;. But economists warned that US telecom merger promises &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962739/t-mobile-sprint-nextel-merger-prices-rural-coverage-promises"&gt;are historically meaningless&lt;/a&gt;, and the reduction in overall competitors would — sooner or later — result in higher prices and job cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2G54r"&gt;Instead of heeding their warnings and blocking the deal, US antitrust enforcers &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/sprint-t-mobile-merger-antitrust-official.html"&gt;concocted an elaborate workaround&lt;/a&gt;: they would erect Dish Network as the nation’s new fourth major wireless carrier. Under the plan Dish received some T-Mobile spectrum, the Boost Mobile prepaid brand, and the assurance that T-Mobile would help Dish run a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) while it got its own...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods update to arrive later this year with iPhone SE refresh coming 2022: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csz6F4-t8Kc9zJwssBSsQVlCehg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610248/akrales_170124_1410_A_0093.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-generation AirPods will reportedly have a shorter stem than current models (above). &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CtMfh8"&gt;Apple will start production on updated AirPods next month, with plans to launch the third-generation earbuds later this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-to-go-all-in-on-5G-for-its-2022-iPhone-lineup"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the latest rumor regarding Apple’s product schedule, which will reportedly include an all-5G iPhone line-up in 2022, including a revamped iPhone SE sporting the as-yet-unannounced A15 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5QeOa"&gt;A refresh of Apple’s entry-level AirPods have been rumored for a while now, with previous generations launched in 2016 and 2019. Back in May, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the earbuds will have a design similar to the AirPods Pro, with “a new case and shorter stems poking out of the bottom of each one.” If &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; is right about production starting next month, we can expect to see the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve will replace Big Picture mode with the new Steam Deck UI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xJ_x0TfJoS9yUVFESBJoQ5x4mGE=/0x0:1612x1075/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610106/steam_deck_004.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qsneG1"&gt;Big Picture, the mode that converts Steam’s user interface into a more console-like design better suited to TVs and controllers than monitors and mice, may not be long for this world. According to austinp_valve, a Valve employee &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigpicture/discussions/1/5167301764850695635/"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; on the Steam community forums, the plan is for the new UI from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;just-announced Steam Deck handheld PC&lt;/a&gt; to replace Big Picture mode on the desktop version of Steam as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1YNsg"&gt;Valve announced Big Picture mode in 2011 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/3/3723508/valve-steam-big-picture-leaves-beta-launch-sale"&gt;released it the following year&lt;/a&gt;. The mode formed the basis of the UI for SteamOS, the version of Linux that shipped on console-style devices that were part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/5/8733139/valve-steam-machine-half-baked"&gt;Valve’s ill-fated Steam Machine project&lt;/a&gt;. With the Steam Deck running an all-new version of the operating system called SteamOS 3.0,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Green travel rewards app Miles raises $12.5 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rTteoSt1KtFcpzsh78TzvUKpwVw=/214x0:1947x1155/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69609858/Miles_screenshots_1a.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Miles&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VgIKNG"&gt;Three years ago, a startup called Miles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17604438/miles-app-tracking-transportation-deals-discounts"&gt;launched a free app&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of becoming a sort of rewards program for all travel — with an emphasis on clean transportation. Cover enough ground by bike, bus, subway, or even on foot, and you’d be rewarded with “miles” (aka points) that could be exchanged for perks at Starbucks or discounts to services like Audi Silvercar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNzjrI"&gt;I was curious, so I used Miles for a little over a year. I lived in New York City at the time and did a lot of daily walking and subway-riding, with occasional biking and bus travel. I was in a great spot to rack up miles without having to change my habits, so I shook the icky feeling of letting another app know my location to see if that occasional free coffee would be...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One of the biggest myths about EVs is busted in new study</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Geely Targets Apple, Big Tech With Its New Zeekr Electric-Car Unit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQIvIC63IHAynHTF3NTDNWPYzXE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69609851/1232320777.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vehicle bodies on the production line of the manufacturing plant for Zeekr Co., an electric-car unit of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China, on Wednesday, April 14, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Photographer: Gilles Sabrie/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DGmj74"&gt;A new study lays to rest the tired argument that electric vehicles aren’t much cleaner than internal combustion vehicles. Over the life cycle of an EV — from digging up the materials needed to build it to eventually laying the car to rest — it will release fewer greenhouse gas emissions than a gas-powered car, the research found. That holds true globally, whether an EV plugs into a grid in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577162/european-union-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; with a larger share of renewables, or a grid in India that still relies &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/IND"&gt;heavily on coal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q32XhA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zu8uIv"&gt;This shouldn’t come as a big surprise. Fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis. So governments from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576994/european-union-gas-vehicle-ice-ban-2035-electric-cars"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; have proposed phasing out internal combustion engines by 2035. But there are...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brokered cell location data led to the outing and resignation of a Catholic official</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EKcZHM"&gt;Location data from a cell phone, obtained and sold by data brokers, has lead to the alleged outing and resignation of a priest working for the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2021/07/20/bishop-misconduct-resign-burrill/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; The traffic data, which was linked to the priest and appeared to show when and where he was using the LGBTQ dating app Grindr, was obtained by a publication and shared with the Conference, where the priest worked as the general secretary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Q9q92"&gt;This incident is another example of how invasive the collection and sale of location and other personal data by brokers can be. While the data sold by these companies is ostensibly anonymized, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029992/smartphone-location-tracking-legal-technology-privacy-new-york-times"&gt;shown that individuals can be picked out and tracked&lt;/a&gt;. The data broker industry...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces Unpacked event for August 11th with Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip teaser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ymloVB"&gt;Samsung has officially announced when it will hold its next Unpacked product event: August 11th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT. It is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572858/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2021-leak-evan-blass-galaxy-z-fold-flip-3-s21-fe-watch-4-buds-2-date"&gt;widely expected&lt;/a&gt; to announce the next version of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;both of which have already leaked quite a bit&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung’s not being shy about those expectations, as a quick look at its invite reveals the outline for both of those devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMCaRV"&gt;Samsung is also expected to announce new Galaxy watches, which would be the first to use the new combined Wear platform that was announced at Google I/O earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63RkvA"&gt;Samsung is holding the event virtually again on its website, and it promises to post more &lt;a href="https://smsng.news/2TqTjNm"&gt;details on the livestream here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also keeping up another Samsung trend: &lt;a href="https://shopsamsung.page.link/A1gWkiA6yiC9Xvvt7"&gt;letting customers...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fix is coming for those locked out of their Chromebooks by Google’s update</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zvs0vw"&gt;A bad update to Chrome OS, version 91.0.4472.165, has left some users unable to log in to their accounts, or reportedly with boot-looping computers (&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/second-major-chrome-os-update-bug-leaving-users-locked-out-chromebooks"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you’ve found yourself locked out of your Chromebook, help is on the way: Google posted &lt;a href="https://support.cloud.google.com/portal/system-status"&gt;on its system status page&lt;/a&gt; that it’s working on a fix, which it expects to release on Wednesday. It’s also pulled the update, which should prevent more users from experiencing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRKjwL"&gt;According to Google, the only options to immediately regain access to your Chrome OS device (if it unfortunately downloaded and installed the update) will lead to the local data on the device being wiped. If you can wait until the new fix the issue is released, though, your device should...&lt;/p&gt;
