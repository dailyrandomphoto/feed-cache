    <title>Google adds option to instantly delete your last 15 minutes of search history</title>

  &lt;p id="YDRprS"&gt;Google is launching a new privacy feature for search that lets you instantly delete your last 15 minutes of search history on mobile, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/new-privacy-tool-search/"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The new option &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe/"&gt;was first revealed&lt;/a&gt; alongside several other search and Chrome improvements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/google-io"&gt;at I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt; and is now rolling out to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19UyiI"&gt;The option to delete your last 15 minutes of search history is currently only available in Google’s iOS app and is headed to Android later this year. On desktop, your options for deleting searches are limited to setting your history to auto-delete every three, 18, or 36 months (18 months is the default for new accounts), or deleting searches by hand. You can see what the new option looks like in the iOS app below:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PVY1MR"&gt;Twitter said Thursday it was hearing from users who were seeing too many topic suggestions in their home timelines and was moving to remedy the situation. “We’re fixing that now, and will continue to improve Topics and find ways to show you the very best of Twitter. Things you want to see, that is,” its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1415757630836981764"&gt;Support account tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. To its credit, Twitter has seemed more responsive to users’ complaints — or their lack of interest — of late; in addition to Thursday’s topics announcement, Twitter said this week it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;kill off Fleets&lt;/a&gt;, its ephemeral disappearing tweets that apparently no one was using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZqvgt"&gt;But instead of showing us more things we want to see, I think Twitter should lean into taking away things we don’t want. I have a suggestion...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Video game handhelds didn’t die after all</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MbZPFL"&gt;When the beloved PlayStation Vita eventually died out, many blamed the rise of mobile gaming. “I think the PS Vita, while ahead of its time in many ways ... launched at exactly the wrong time in terms of market opportunity,” former Sony vice president of marketing John Koller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545198/playstation-vita-10-year-anniversary-sony-handheld"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about going up against smartphones. But despite the Vita’s demise, dedicated gaming handhelds didn’t die out — in fact, the space is arguably as vibrant as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wl0Okd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;Valve just announced the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, a chunky portable PC that looks like a Sega Game Gear from a parallel universe. It’s designed to let players take their Steam library of PC games on the go. Just a few hours later, preorders opened for the latest iteration of the Nintendo Switch, one that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Self-driving startup Aurora will raise $2 billion in SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6M6UtTJ_OVjlGpEOz8gl6217hO0=/342x0:2364x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587551/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_2.45.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vmJI52"&gt;Self-driving technology startup Aurora, which was founded by the former head of Google’s autonomous vehicle program, is the latest company to announce that it’s going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC). The deal will give Aurora about $2 billion in new cash when it closes, which will help the startup in its quest to become a provider of self-driving hardware and software to companies in the trucking and ride-hailing industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwgA16"&gt;Aurora is merging with a SPAC called Reinvent Technology Partners Y that’s already listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, and is run by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus, and investor Michael Thompson). That trio is also in the process of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;taking electric...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s payment system extends to online retailers in August</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jRCmCK"&gt;Online shoppers will eventually see another option listed next to the usual payment methods, now that &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/integrate-facebook-pay-directly-into-business-website"&gt;Facebook Pay will expand beyond the company’s own platforms&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after credit card companies dropped out of its Libra cryptocurrency project, Facebook launched its payments system for use across the main site, as well as WhatsApp and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook Pay is coming to online shopping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ThDddn"&gt;Now, just like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17358034/google-pay-how-to-mobile-payments-android-iphone"&gt;Google’s stored cards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/19/22541286/paypal-raise-seller-fees-transactions-online-payments"&gt;PayPal integrations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/17970466/amazon-prime-shopping-behavior-streaming-alexa-minimum-wage"&gt;Amazon Pay&lt;/a&gt;, and others, Facebook Pay is opening itself up for use in transactions with participating retailers.

    <title>Elgato’s Facecam is a $200 webcam with streamer-friendly features </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Facecam includes a monitor mount, but you can also mount it to a tripod with its quarter-inch thread.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Elgato&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwM7nL"&gt;Elgato has attempted to be the brand of choice for streamers and content creators who need gear to get started — even if it’s rarely the most affordable option. It makes its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172438/elgato-key-light-display-streamers-youtube-ces-2019"&gt;LED lighting rig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/26/20886205/elgato-multi-mount-extendable-rigging-system-twitch-youtube-streamers-creators"&gt;multiple kinds of mounts&lt;/a&gt; for lights and mics, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22311223/elgato-light-strip-wifi-app-ios-android-sound-panels-stream-price"&gt;app-controlled adhesive light strips for your monitor or desk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22311223/elgato-light-strip-wifi-app-ios-android-sound-panels-stream-price"&gt;sound-dampening pads&lt;/a&gt; for podcasting, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314075/elgato-green-screen-mousepad-mat"&gt;a mouse pad that doubles as a green screen&lt;/a&gt;, and a lot more. Now, it has a $199.99 webcam to sell you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpuC3M"&gt;The Elgato Facecam is a 1080p webcam that can record at up to 60 frames per second. It has a Sony Starvis CMOS sensor, with an eight-element prime fixed focus lens with an f/2.4 aperture, 24mm full-frame equivalent focal length, and up to an 82-degree field of view.

    <title>Where to preorder the Nintendo Switch OLED model</title>

  &lt;p id="lH6wtc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 15th, 4:55PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The Nintendo Switch OLED model is no longer available for preorder in either color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guw0Bh"&gt;After months of speculation and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346041/oled-nintendo-switch-dlss-nvidia-chip-report"&gt;sea of rumors&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;officially announced&lt;/a&gt; the next iteration of its popular gaming console: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;. The upcoming device serves more as a midlife update than anything else, a refinement of the 2019 model as opposed to the more powerful “Switch Pro” that was rumored (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565469/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-timing-chip-shortages-cpu-nvidia-tegra"&gt;may still launch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKuikp"&gt;On sale for $350 starting October 8th, the aptly-titled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565307/nintendo-oled-switch-screen-news-updates"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt; is the next iteration of what has become one of the best-selling consoles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562530/nintendo-switch-lite-sales-october-2020"&gt;over the last two years&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>New Anthony Bourdain documentary deepfakes his voice</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZBWBLx"&gt;In a new documentary, &lt;em&gt;Roadrunner, &lt;/em&gt;about the life and tragic death of Anthony Bourdain, there are a few lines of dialogue in Bourdain’s voice that he might not have ever said out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNo5No"&gt;Filmmaker Morgan Neville used AI technology to digitally re-create Anthony Bourdain’s voice and have the software synthesize the audio of three quotes from the late chef and television host, Neville &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-haunting-afterlife-of-anthony-bourdain"&gt;told the&lt;em&gt; New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b80fjO"&gt;The deepfaked voice was discovered when the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s Helen Rosner asked how the filmmaker got a clip of Bourdain’s voice reading an email he had sent to a friend. Neville said he had contacted an AI company and supplied it with a dozen hours of Bourdain speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rh72d1"&gt; “ ... and my life is sort of shit now. You are successful, and I am...&lt;/p&gt;
