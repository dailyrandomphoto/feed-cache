    <title>The sound of neurons firing</title>

  &lt;p id="aXIAdc"&gt;Looking through a microscope, doctoral candidate Simón(e) Sun takes a tiny glass pipette and gently attaches it to a neuron in a petri dish. She’s taking recordings of synaptic activity, the electrochemical signals neurons use to communicate with each other. The data Sun gathers will be used to understand microprocesses in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onvraj"&gt;It will also be turned into music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irlddi"&gt;Bridging science and art, Sun wrote a computer program that takes her data and &lt;a href="https://www.simonesun.com/music"&gt;converts it into song&lt;/a&gt;. And the ethereal MIDI sounds aren’t just nice to listen to — they can actually teach us a lot about how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkiZ3b"&gt;Sun is studying something called “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5984303/"&gt;homeostatic plasticity&lt;/a&gt;,” which is how neurons regulate their activity. Her research has broad implications for the...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WZZHEp"&gt;Virgin Orbit is gearing up for its debut commercial mission from Southern California, five months after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22221212/virgin-orbit-rocket-test-launch-satellites-nasa-branson"&gt;first reached orbit during a January test flight&lt;/a&gt;. Seven satellites from three different countries are loaded onto a rocket that will blast off in midair from Virgin Orbit’s modified Boeing 747 less than an hour after the plane departs the Mojave Air and Space Port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFYdK3"&gt;Take off of the carrier aircraft, the modified Boeing plane named Cosmic Girl, is expected for 9:50AM ET. About an hour later, a 70-foot-long two-stage rocket called LauncherOne will ignite its single engine and take off from under the plane’s left wing over the Pacific ocean, zooming out of Earth’s atmosphere. The Netherlands’ first military satellite, three...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DAZN will stream UEFA Women’s Champions League free on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvyUiI"&gt;Sports streaming service DAZN announced today that it has acquired exclusive rights to stream the UEFA Women’s Champions League. As part of the deal, an overwhelming majority of the matches it streams over the next four seasons will be available for free on its YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oByNYZ"&gt;DAZN — best known in the US as a hub for boxing events — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162594/dazn-international-expansion-200-countries-canelo-nfl-nhl"&gt;expanded to over 200 countries&lt;/a&gt; in December. It’s backed by billionaire Len Blavatnik who aspires to make DAZN the “Netflix of sport.” Former Disney exec Kevin Mayer &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/kevin-mayer-on-leaving-disney-and-tiktok-joining-dazn-pay-tv-decline.html"&gt;joined DAZN as chairman in March&lt;/a&gt; to help make that happen, after Mayer abruptly quit TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403698/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer-resigns-trump-administration-ban-microsoft-disney"&gt;due to Trump’s meddling&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Sony’s WH-1000XM3 are a great deal at $190</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sony WH-1000XM3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_QFRjkI3-Qwy846tlcGJf-_DEjc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523337/jbareham_180823_2895_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vdkYWH"&gt;There’s a fantastic discount happening on the previous generation Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless, noise-canceling headphones at Best Buy. Originally $350 (but usually around $250 or so these days), &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743780474724360893#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get them for $190 new&lt;/a&gt;. While these lack some niceties found in the newer XM4 model (concurrent Bluetooth connections, auto play / pause when you remove them or put them on), the package is overall similar in terms of nailing the fundamentals. These have great battery life, USB-C charging, among the best noise cancellation effect around, and sound quality that’s tough to beat at this price. In addition, these come with a zip-up case that makes them easy to stow. I bought these in 2018 and am still patting myself on the back for that decision.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to block and report text spam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4L-IfKtQ76K7Il4nXctrhDAQtl4=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69520154/texting_lumia.0.1437583471.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xS9Cl4"&gt;Spam texts can be incredibly irritating — you get a notification and stop what you’re doing to check your phone, only to find somebody is trying to sell you something you don’t want. How can you prevent it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz3VXk"&gt;Unfortunately, there are no absolutes in preventing text spam. But there are some ways you can at least minimize the number of spam texts that get through. Here are some strategies to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kZBYfb"&gt;Do not answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6jYMm1"&gt;Top of the list is — as you probably already know — never reply to a spam text, and never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; click on a link within a spam text. If you’re not sure whether a text is spam or legitimate, hold off on replying until you’ve done a bit of research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6qez8i"&gt;Use the spam filter on your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rIeftn"&gt;Android phones and iPhones have spam-filtering features...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s Mini LED TVs to release in the US starting in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kqTZTekFcsJkJVlsFbhVgsF5iRM=/0x108:1863x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69522668/LG_8K_QNED_Mini_LED_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Mini LED use an array of thousands of tiny LEDs as a backlight.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="98Wumc"&gt;LG’s new range of Mini LED TVs, which it’s branding “QNED,” are releasing worldwide starting next month, the &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/06/now-rolling-out-worldwide-lg-qned-mini-led-tv-sets-new-standard-for-lcd-picture-quality/"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The lineup consists of three sets, the 8K QNED99 and QNED95, and the 4K QNED90, ranging in size from 65- to 86-inches. LG says the TVs will launch first in North America, with additional regions following “in the weeks ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyb1U3"&gt;Mini LED is a relatively new kind of display technology which uses an array of thousands of tiny LEDs as a screen’s backlight. Because there are so many (up to 30,000 in the case of the 86-inch QNED99), they can create a sharper contrast between light and dark areas of an image. LG says the technology, which has previously been used on some TVs from TCL as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Apple’s latest...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple isn’t backing down from its hybrid work model, according to internal note</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfXTiO"&gt;Apple isn’t backing down from its hybrid work model that will require most employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Fully remote positions will be extremely limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fST2ny"&gt;“We believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future,” said Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, in a video recording viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If we take a moment to reflect on our unbelievable product launches this past year, the products and the launch execution were built upon the base of years of work that we did when we were all together in-person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiBoeB"&gt;The news comes nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook sent out an email&lt;/a&gt; telling employees the company was rolling out a new work...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="KwQpF0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-to-acquire-kites-gmbh/"&gt;Zoom has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s acquiring a company known as Kites (short for Karlsruhe Information Technology Solutions), which has worked on creating real-time translation and transcription software. Zoom says the acquisition is a move to help it make communicating with people who speak different languages easier, and that it’s looking to add translation capabilities to its video conferencing app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCEVrd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kites.ai/"&gt;According to its site&lt;/a&gt;, Kites began at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and its technology was originally developed to &lt;a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2020-10-ai-outperforms-humans-speech-recognition.html"&gt;act as in-classroom translation&lt;/a&gt; for students who needed help understanding the English or German their professors were lecturing in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku launches its new originals with a Demi Lovato talk show</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Demi Lovato Show will debut July 30th.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HZ7nt2"&gt;The first of a dozen-plus Roku Originals to premiere on the Roku Channel will kick off July 30th with &lt;em&gt;The Demi Lovato Show&lt;/em&gt;, a series that had originally been slated for a debut on Quibi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqCtrC"&gt;The show will now launch as Roku’s first “original” to land on the Roku Channel, the platform’s free and ad-supported streaming offering. While originally intended for Quibi, the show will be brand new to audiences when it arrives on the Roku Channel this week. Each episode will be 10 minutes long, feature a celebrity guest, and will cover topics as wide-ranging as UFOs, activism, mental health, gender identity, and police reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3Bmr3"&gt;In a statement, Lovato said that they have “never been one to shy away from speaking candidly about things.” The show had...&lt;/p&gt;
