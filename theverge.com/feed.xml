    <title>The Galaxy Watch 4 is still more a Samsung wearable than a Google one</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="XqMAWD"&gt;This week was supposed to be the first day of Google’s big reentry into flagship smartwatches. Samsung is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;back on board&lt;/a&gt; after years of Tizen-based wearables, with its new Galaxy Watch 4 that runs the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;new, revitalized Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the smartwatch OS that merges the best of Google and Samsung’s discrete platforms together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVOqm0"&gt;But there was just one issue: Google was strangely absent from the proceedings. In fact, aside from a few oblique mentions of working with Google on the software, you might have watched Samsung’s whole presentation and not even caught that the new watches were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617462/galaxy-watch-4-classic-samsung-apple-watch-google-ecosystem"&gt;running on Wear OS at all&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMomM2"&gt;On the one hand, this is extremely par for the course for Samsung. It’s practically a running gag at this point that Samsung goes...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Honor’s Magic 3 is its first post-Huawei flagship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EtkKQORn-43zg0BXgxFue7BGK40=/60x0:2940x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714885/HONOR_Magic3_Pro_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic 3 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cRDra4"&gt;Honor has announced its first flagship smartphones since being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;sold off by former parent company Huawei&lt;/a&gt;: the Magic 3 series. The lineup consists of three phones, the Magic 3, Magic 3 Pro, and Magic 3 Pro Plus. They’re coming first to mainland China, but Honor says they’re getting a global release at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgGMug"&gt;When they launch globally, the phones will come with Google’s apps and services, which Honor wasn’t previously able to include while a subsidiary of Huawei due to US sanctions. It should make the Magic 3 series much more competitive outside of China compared to Honor’s recent Huawei-era phones, which had to rely on Huawei’s own services and AppGallery to download software. This setup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;came with significant drawbacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jabra’s Elite 65t are just $50 at Best Buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pTHZAWQmgqUG-S6ZdWa3NODcdX4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714831/akrales_180411_2462_0052.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;With decent sound and a stable connection, the Elite 65t were once our go-to alternative to the AirPods. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="synnAq"&gt;It seems like the market for true wireless earbuds becomes more and more crowded each week, with products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing Ear 1s&lt;/a&gt; being two of the latest contenders to jump into the already-burgeoning field. And while the Jabra Elite 65t are beginning to show their age in comparison and are by no means top of the field, they’re still a great pair of earbuds with enjoyable sound and a customizable fit, not to mention a two-year warranty that covers any potential damage they may sustain from prolonged exposure to sweat or dust. Normally $80, you can pick up the copper-black model at &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fjabra-elite-65t-true-wireless-earbud-headphones-copper-black%2F6230036.p%3FacampID%3D0%26cmp%3DRMX%26irclickid%3DQJaSroQtuxyLRzW0UfQwQyYMUkBRJYTkExnTRM0%26irgwc%3D1%26loc%3DNarrativ%26mpid%3D376373%26ref%3D198%26skuId%3D6230036&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $50&lt;/a&gt;, slightly more than their best price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17247354/jabra-elite-65t-truly-wireless-earbuds-review-airpods"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit is now valued at more than $10 billion</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U58DcO"&gt;Reddit, the self-declared ‘front page of the internet,’ says it is now &lt;a href="https://redditblog.com/2021/08/12/reddit-secures-funding-to-continue-growth-plans/"&gt;valued at more than $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; after raising an additional $410 million in funding, with the final round expected to grow to up to $700 million. The company continues to build and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21364019/reddit-bans-racist-subreddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-twitter-thread"&gt;sanitize its business&lt;/a&gt;, removing racist, misogynist, and otherwise controversial communities, as it prepares to go public at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="574zEp"&gt;“We are still planning on going public, but we don’t have a firm timeline there yet,” Reddit’s co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/reddit-new-funding.html"&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt;. “All good companies should go public when they can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4LUZJ"&gt;The company previously raised $250 million in funding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274077/reddit-funding-round-250-million-double-employees-investment"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for a valuation of $6 billion. But Huffman told the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet users have more options to add co-hosts, limit screen sharing, and mute others</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nsy-EcbVP9_BlHit8lD1XT7MNFc=/0x0:1980x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714425/googlemeetnewui.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svljGT"&gt;Google is adding a bunch of &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/add-up-to-25-cohosts-expanded-safety-features-for-meet.html?"&gt;new features to Google Meet&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier for users to control and direct meetings. However, exactly which controls will be available depends on whether you are using Meet as a regular user or as part of a Google Workspace team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKoHZC"&gt;The main update is that all users will now be able to assign up to 25 co-hosts per meeting, who will have access to host controls. This will let them limit who can share their screen and send chat messages, as well as mute all participants with a single click, end the meeting, and control who can enter the meeting (though this last feature is only available to certain Google Workspace versions). Previously, assigning co-hosts was only available to Google Workspace for Education...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s Wear OS app is getting offline playback in the coming weeks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-_d13u-UaD3xsRI6anxOz-YpYVo=/591x0:1416x550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714396/Spotify_wearOS_banner01_1_1440x550.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wNFepC"&gt;Spotify’s updated Wear OS app is releasing “over the coming weeks,” &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-08-11/enjoy-all-your-music-and-podcasts-offline-on-smartwatches-running-wear-os/"&gt;Spotify has announced&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll support offline playback on smartwatches running Wear OS 2.0 and up. The new functionality was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442880/spotify-youtube-music-download-offline-playlists-podcasts-updates"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt; alongside the news of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;Google’s collaboration with Samsung&lt;/a&gt; on the next-generation of the wearable operating system, Wear OS 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUFVtq"&gt;The fact that offline downloads will be available on Wear OS 2 means that it’s not exclusive to upcoming Wear OS 3 watches like Samsung’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22618532/galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4 and the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify says it should work on watches from the likes of Fossil, Mobvoi, and Suunto. Meanwhile Google’s new YouTube Music Wear OS app, which also supports offline listening, is &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/11/youtube-music-wear-os-maps-release/"&gt;exclusive to Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Warhammer’s new subscription streaming service is coming to iOS, Android, and smart TVs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gt_N9DpOPPvzY_uSo-x0vreyp7M=/0x24:1500x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714336/WH40K_GuillimanvsBlackLegion2018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Roboute Guilliman, primarch of the Ultramarines, takes on the Black Legion. | Image: Games Workshop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eaIsRk"&gt;Games Workshop is preparing to launch Warhammer Plus, a niche subscription streaming service for fans of the sprawling, lore-dense Warhammer universe (or rather, universes: the sci-fi world of &lt;em&gt;Warhammer 40,000&lt;/em&gt;, and fantasy setting of &lt;em&gt;Warhammer Age of Sigmar&lt;/em&gt;). The &lt;a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2021/08/11/warhammer-is-packed-with-amazing-shows-and-features-heres-how-youll-access-them-all/"&gt;company now says&lt;/a&gt; Warhammer Plus will not only be available on iOS and Android through a number of dedicated apps, but also on Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Roku services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCJtCl"&gt;The launch comes at a rather awkward time for Games Workshop, given that some fans are currently boycotting the firm after a recent change to its intellectual property policy. &lt;em&gt;Warhammer 40k&lt;/em&gt; in particular has an extremely vocal and active fanbase (check out &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Grimdank/"&gt;r/Grimdank&lt;/a&gt; for a taste) that produce memes, cosplays,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom’s new focus mode could keep students from distracting each other</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzV_MaSwms1V28pRwGWiMWiEYeo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69713469/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S7VKng"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/back-to-school-hybrid-learning/"&gt;Zoom has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new Focus mode, &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360061113751"&gt;which it says&lt;/a&gt; is meant to keep students from getting distracted while in a virtual classroom, while still allowing the teacher to keep an eye on everybody. When activated, Focus mode will make it so that a meeting’s participants won’t be able to see each other’s videos or screen shares, while the host is still able to see everyone’s webcams. It provides some of the control &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004834466#h_01EYVHFHQMD1G3YSZB8TNG9E8P"&gt;found in Webinar mode&lt;/a&gt;, without the &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/when-to-use-meetings-vs-webinars/"&gt;complexity and lack of flexibility&lt;/a&gt; that comes with it — for instance, a teacher could turn on Focus mode while presenting, and then turn it off when it’s time for a class discussion. And, while &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fpricing%2Fwebinar&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F11%2F22620822%2Fzoom-virtual-learning-classes-focus-mode-teachers-students" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting a Webinar costs money&lt;/a&gt;, Focus mode appears to be available to free accounts, based on my testing.&lt;/p&gt;
