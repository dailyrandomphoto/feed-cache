    <title>Juiced’s new fat-tire electric bike targets a younger generation of riders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tgbsdCFekeiaTm-KNV2ur7DQVjk=/0x216:5184x3672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122548/Copy_of_PB032678.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B9Q8Hz"&gt;Juiced, the San Diego-based electric bike company known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22537406/juiced-hyperscrambler-2-ebike-moped-price-specs"&gt;extremely fast, extremely heavy, moped-style cruisers&lt;/a&gt;, wants you to know that its newest model, the RipRacer, is “fun-sized.” Not like tiny-Snickers-bars-you-hand-out-at-Halloween-fun-size, but like a smaller frame size for a younger generation of riders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5Osw6"&gt;Electric bikes are typically marketed and sold to adults, but increasingly, companies are seeing an opportunity around selling bikes to teens and young adults. Juiced is the latest to try its hand at making bikes that are smaller and cheaper than the typical e-bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pp28PS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The RipRacer may be fun-sized, but it will no less powerful than Juiced’s other hulking models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XjMOkW"&gt;The RipRacer may be fun-sized, but it will no less powerful...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube gives dislikes the thumbs-down, hides public counts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JAirWZ9ULkKMC5lbId49dI2yKU=/49x0:913x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122512/Exvh5P5WUAg5Nwy.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S3u7bx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/"&gt;YouTube has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be hiding public dislike counts on videos across its site, starting today. The company says the change is to keep smaller creators from being targeted by dislike attacks or harassment, and to promote “respectful interactions between viewers and creators.” The dislike button will still be there, but it’ll be for private feedback, rather than public shaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSpOFu"&gt;This move isn’t out of the blue. In March, YouTube announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358992/youtube-hiding-dislikes-experiment-creator-review-bomb"&gt;experimenting with hiding the public dislike numbers&lt;/a&gt;, and individual creators have long had &lt;a href="https://www.the1janitor.com/blog/2018/11/30/why-i-disable-ratings-on-my-youtube-videos"&gt;the ability to hide ratings on their videos&lt;/a&gt;. But the fact that the dislike counts will be disappearing for everyone (gradually, according to YouTube) is a big deal — viewers are used to...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus is trying to make its shows go viral with new Twitter partnership</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t2cKKCLCuccCoE6eswVQIh7QWq8=/0x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122499/paramount_plus.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="smMQ1O"&gt;Paramount Plus has announced a new partnership with Twitter centered around better promoting its exclusive shows and events, in addition to hosting three Twitter Watch Parties with fans for “select highly-anticipated original series.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQjv79"&gt;Or, more practically speaking, Paramount Plus would really, really like its shows to be viral on Twitter, with the kinds of trending topics and engagement that ultra-popular shows like HBO’s &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; enjoy on a weekly basis. And what better way to be popular on Twitter than to cozy up to Twitter directly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4T2EB0"&gt;A lot of this deal is deeply boring stuff, things like granting major Paramount Plus shows “Twitter marketing support and brand sponsorship sales rights via Twitter’s Amplify program.” ViacomCBS will...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb improves accessibility search filters for its accommodations</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lKYJic"&gt;Airbnb has updated its search filters and accessibility review process with the goal of making it easier for people with disabilities to find accommodations on its platform, the company &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/accessibility-review/"&gt;announced in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnpyuM"&gt;Hosts can now submit pictures of the accessibility features in their homes, and “a specialized team of Airbnb agents” will review them to determine if they’re suitable for people with disabilities. On its &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Faccessibility&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accessibility review page&lt;/a&gt;, Airbnb says that this team works “with engineers, designers, and others across the company” but doesn’t specifically state whether they’re trained or how they’re qualified to recognize accessibility features. It notes that its staff has already reviewed and approved 100,000 accessibility features in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch SpaceX’s Crew-3 mission to the International Space Station</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d4ra4r"&gt;SpaceX is launching another crew to space this evening, sending four astronauts to the International Space Station for a six-monthlong stay in orbit. Traveling inside SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft, the crew will get an early start on their mission, with liftoff scheduled for 9:03PM ET on November 10th out of Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5T1RE"&gt;The mission is called Crew-3, and it will carry NASA astronauts Thomas Marshburn, Raja Chari, and Kayla Barron, as well as European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer. This will be the first trip to space for Maurer, Barron, and Chari — the mission’s commander. For Marshburn, this will be his third flight to space, and for each of his missions, he’s flown on a different vehicle. His first flight was on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro vs. Pixel 6 Pro: what 2,000 photos tell us</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wh4LrChgh-_HYNao1Gus5lOdFho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121885/BFARSACE_FULLFRAME_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k3ztZx"&gt;When the iPhone 13 Pro launched earlier this fall, we said it had the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;“best camera” in a smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. The larger sensor behind the main wide-angle lens coupled with a wider f/1.5 aperture left us saying, “Whoa, look at this photo,” more often than we were used to. But a few weeks later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, with its 50-megapixel sensor that is hard-coded to produce 12.5-megapixel images, was finally released, proving a worthy competitor for the iPhone 13 Pro’s 12-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro has a massive 6.7-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ty7jhO"&gt;So this year, in order to settle the score, I set out to take 1,000 photos on each device. I carried them...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft partners with Meta to integrate Teams into its Facebook-like Workplace</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G7BzNm"&gt;Microsoft is partnering with Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, to integrate Microsoft Teams into Zuckerberg’s Workplace platform. Facebook Workplace, or Workplace by Meta as it’s now been rebranded, will soon integrate Microsoft Teams to livestream video into Workplace groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKpIny"&gt;The Microsoft Teams integration into Workplace will also allow employees using Teams or Workplace to view, comment, and react to meetings in real time without having to switch between apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GhM3EJ"&gt;Microsoft is also integrating Workplace into Teams, which will enable Teams users to access Workplace content through an app within Teams. The app will be pinned to the Teams...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Updating The Verge’s background policy</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p class="p-large-text" id="Xj8P20"&gt;Today, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is updating our public ethics policy to be clearer in our interactions with public relations and corporate communications professionals. We’re doing this because big tech companies in particular have hired a dizzying array of communications staff who routinely push the boundaries of acceptable sourcing in an effort to deflect accountability, pass the burden of truth to the media, and generally control the narratives around the companies they work for while being annoying as hell to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDO9R1"&gt;The main way this happens is that big companies take advantage of a particular agreement in the media called “background.” Being “on background” means that they tell things to reporters, but those reporters agree to not specifically...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This affordable robot vacuum is even cheaper right now at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yeedi K650 robot vacuum" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LImgF3OzO8n6pM-fi7Jb6HsfDlU=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121641/yeedik650skittles.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This isn’t my house. Skittles operate well outside of the five-second drop rule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLAyaC"&gt;The latest (and even the not-so-new) robot vacuums from iRobot tend to cost, at least, a few hundred dollars. The sky is the limit, so to speak, when it comes to how much these can cost. But there’s a fantastic sale happening at Woot on this affordable model from a company called Yeedi. Its K650 Wi-Fi connected model with an 800-milliliter bin &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142096?sid=VergeDeals111021&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhome.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs just $130 right now&lt;/a&gt;. It’s currently sitting at $180 from Amazon, to give you a sense of how much it usually costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ye8Dz"&gt;This model claims to be great for pet owners, and through its companion app, you can schedule cleaning times, adjust the suction strength, and customize Yeedi’s optional magnetic boundaries, among other things.
