&lt;p id="ZZrBoN"&gt;Details on this website are murky, however. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said today that “We will have more information as it is available including what the website looks like,” she said, adding, “We will make the website available as soon as these tests are available.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4zbsC"&gt;President Biden also said that his administration is working with Google to make it easier for Americans to find COVID-19 testing locations. “We’ve...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ad board tells Mint Mobile it should stop abusing the word ‘unlimited’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_aRpxdGb8biWnqf05c2BGG6LHA=/0x51:1202x852/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70303317/Fox_Art_04_resize.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mint Mobile says it will comply with the board’s decision.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Mint Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iZRFey"&gt;The National Advertising Review Board &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/nad-clamps-down-mint-mobile-unlimited-ad-claims"&gt;has denied Mint Mobile’s appeal&lt;/a&gt; defending its use of the word “unlimited” in its advertising since its unlimited prepaid plan includes a high-speed data cap of 35GB per month. That’s not unusual — most unlimited plans include a cap on high-speed or “premium” data — but Mint actually slows customers down to unreasonably slow 2G speeds after 35GB. That &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;unusual, even in an industry that has rendered the term “unlimited” virtually meaningless, and &lt;a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/decisions-details/mint-mobile-unlimited-claims-appeal"&gt;the ad board sides with AT&amp;amp;T’s argument&lt;/a&gt; that it’s slower than a customer would reasonably expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNM4a0"&gt;Carriers and MVNOs have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13330158/t-mobile-unlimited-data-settlement-fine-discount-free-data"&gt;throttled heavy data users&lt;/a&gt; more or less since unlimited plans made a comeback. And to be sure, the vast majority of wireless customers...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scammers steal $150K worth of crypto from NFT project with Discord hack</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kv0Llt"&gt;Buyers hoping to get a limited-edition NFT from Fractal, a new marketplace for game item NFTs, were given an unpleasant and costly surprise on Tuesday morning when it was revealed that a link sent through the project’s official Discord channel was a scam set up to steal crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnPs5X"&gt;Users who followed the link and connected their crypto wallets, expecting to receive an NFT, instead found that their holdings of Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency were emptied and transferred to the scammer’s account. An analysis posted on Medium by Tim Cotten, founder of another NFT gaming project, estimated the value of SOL stolen &lt;a href="https://blog.cotten.io/the-150k-discord-crypto-hack-b3dde6698072"&gt;to be around $150,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TSA checkpoints will start supporting Apple Wallet IDs in February</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jYAdNe"&gt;When Apple introduced its updated Apple Wallet in June, the company said it was working to ensure you could use it to get through airport security — and now, we have our first word from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) on exactly when that will happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8swX2y"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.securetechalliance.org/secure-technology-alliances-mobile-drivers-license-workshop-showcases-mdls-role-in-the-future-of-identification/"&gt;an event recap from the Secure Technology Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the TSA is planning to support Apple Wallet IDs in two airports in February. If successful, the test will expand to airports in two more states the following month. The Apple Wallet is the first digital ID the TSA will accept (not counting &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/clear-conquered-u-s-airports-now-it-wants-to-own-your-entire-digital-identity-15d61076e44d"&gt;privately run pre-check programs like Clear&lt;/a&gt;), but the program is expected to expand to other platforms in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyFen6"&gt;“Instead of TSA staff examining a physical ID card,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla rewarding timely holiday travelers with free supercharging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CFgw6CJwCrXxUMtMj2shIj6lZNI=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70303225/akrales_160419_1019_A_0257.0.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jtypuy"&gt;Tesla announced an early Christmas present for all those pre-dawn road trippers: &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/holiday-supercharging"&gt;free vehicle charging at certain Supercharger locations&lt;/a&gt; if you get there before 10AM (or after 7PM if you’re more of a night rider).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5wsev"&gt;The announcement comes right before peak holiday travel season, when an estimated &lt;a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2021/12/tis-the-season-more-than-109-million-americans-to-travel-for-the-holidays/"&gt;100 million&lt;/a&gt; Americans will be on the road to visit family or friends. For those using electric cars, this can also mean delays at &lt;a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC&amp;amp;ev_levels=dc_fast"&gt;any of the almost 7,000&lt;/a&gt; DC fast charging stations in the US as the country continues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22846965/ev-charging-stations-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-equity"&gt;building out its charging infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7JVcOy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Avoid the rush this holiday season and charge for free during off‑peak hours at Superchargers along select travel routes in the United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See locations and hours:  &lt;a href="https://t.co/1hlTTGGsNn"&gt;https://t.co/1hlTTGGsNn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/CmQj9oeYvN"&gt;p...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="b7Fj87"&gt;&lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/12/set-custom-rules-for-incoming-google-voice-calls.html"&gt;Google Voice now lets you create rules&lt;/a&gt; that dictate how the service responds to incoming calls from specific contacts. And yes, this includes having Google Voice automatically ignore certain contacts for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cR2n9t"&gt;Even though Google Voice already has a call forwarding feature, the new rules let you customize it even further — you can set up a rule that forwards calls from a contact (or a group of contacts) to any of your linked numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After Build Back Better, here’s how the US can still clean up its power grid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Democrats Meet on Capitol Hill" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qz04zIR--VXB10OBo60RFB7tfok=/0x0:5701x3801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70303110/1359569121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) is followed by reporters as he leaves a caucus meeting with Senate Democrats at the US Capitol Building on December 17th, 2021 in Washington, DC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Anna Moneymaker / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hkoCTm"&gt;The future of America’s electricity grid hangs in the balance as Democrats try to salvage their giant environmental and social spending bill. After West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin imperiled Democrats’ Build Back Better bill — which would have transformed the grid and helped stave off catastrophic climate change — environmental advocates are figuring out a plan B. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yR5AOP"&gt;The most recent version of Democrats’ environment and social spending bill included $555 billion to tackle climate change, which would have been the biggest US investment ever on the crisis. At the heart of the bill was a plan to wean the power grid off fossil fuels. But over the weekend, Manchin (who has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/12/19/22845060/joe-manchin-climate-change-build-back-better-clean-energy"&gt;earned millions&lt;/a&gt; off investments in coal) seemingly killed those plans by &lt;a href="https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-statement-on-build-back-better-act"&gt;s...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ahONZf"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://fyi.bulletin.com/bulletin-at-six-months"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Meta marks the six-month anniversary of its newsletter publishing platform, Bulletin. Amid its plugs for the writers who publish work on the service, the company lets us know just how many publishers it has on board to help compete with companies like Substack and Twitter: 115.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkTDRi"&gt;Unlike Substack, the buzziest newsletter platform of the moment, you can’t just start writing with Bulletin — Meta has &lt;a href="https://fyi.bulletin.com/406506571000005"&gt;continued to add writers to the platform&lt;/a&gt; in batches instead of having a public sign-up process. While the number implies that the company isn’t doing a huge push to get people on the platform as fast as possible, that does appear to be on purpose, at least to some extent (there’s always the possibility it hasn’t been as...&lt;/p&gt;
