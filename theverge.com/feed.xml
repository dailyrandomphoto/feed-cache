    <title>Telegram gets Discord-like group voice chats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4pvzOc9Uq9mxhPeGNbbN8geZNVQ=/0x0:540x360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68571180/groupchats.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p9V7Ue"&gt;Telegram is adding a new group voice chats feature that’s similar to an always-on Discord room. Voice chats are now part of existing text chats, and operate as a persistent option to speak live with friends or family. As they’re always available, you can dip in and out of voice chats just like you would in a Discord room or call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LT4Gfu"&gt;Telegram is supporting “a few thousand participants,” so even bigger groups for things like live events will include voice chats. The feature appears at the top of an existing group chat, if enabled, allowing anyone to join the conversation freely. On the desktop versions of Telegram for Windows and Mac, you can also use a push-to-talk key for voice chats to control your microphone input.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Nearly half a billion users played Among Us in November</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Among Us" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AMrVnjByV-VHm4Gi6ofI05026Sw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68570242/ss_a0f2416e11bf5b47788eaa3617e092b73962b145.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: InnerSloth&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qKHiUD"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/worldwide-digital-games-market"&gt;roughly half a billion people&lt;/a&gt; reportedly playing it in November, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; has had the most monthly players for a mobile game ever, beating giants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060877/pokemon-go-record-revenue-2019-niantic-labs-ar-growth"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon GO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt;. According to Nielsen’s SuperData, the game is “by far the most popular game ever in terms of monthly players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CS899C"&gt;The success is even more remarkable because InnerSloth — the company that makes Among Us — &lt;a href="http://www.innersloth.com/About.php"&gt;only has four employees&lt;/a&gt;. That’s roughly 125 million players per person who works on the game. It’s proven to be so popular that the studio decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;cancel a sequel that was in the works&lt;/a&gt; and just put all its effort into improving the original. It even caught the attention of sitting congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526164/aoc-among-us-twitch-debut-top-concurrent-viewers"&gt;who livestreamed herself...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roast your own Spotify listens with this snarky AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NdXN5hc2dG3WoIKkFKxPL3vS7mg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569959/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h9pJGW"&gt;The yearly Spotify Wrapped is a rather upbeat affair, which doesn’t doesn’t quite match everyone’s mood this year. For the more sullen among us, there’s another option: &lt;a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/"&gt;a bot from The Pudding&lt;/a&gt; that will judge us for our crimes of listening to terrible music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWfXOF"&gt;If you want to be judged, you open a page titled “How Bad is Your Spotify” and you log in with your Spotify account. (It might take a couple refreshes on the “Loading your music library” page.) This absolute jerk of an AI then drags you mercilessly while it pulls your playlists and top tracks. It asks you questions before it shows any results, in phrasing that gives the plain text the same aura as the girls who bullied me in middle school. &lt;em&gt;Did you really listen to Clementine by Sarah...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC says third-largest cryptocurrency was sold all wrong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYTrTHQ5OR_09PmtitMZ_W3seOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569791/acastro_1901001_3701_indieGameDevs_still.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="vp9aWN"&gt;Ripple, its former CEO and founder Christian Larsen, and its current CEO Bradley Garlinghouse are being &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338"&gt;sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The SEC says that they raised more than $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XfLHO"&gt;The suit claims that Ripple violated securities laws by selling XRP, which &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ripple-to-face-sec-suit-over-xrp-cryptocurrency-11608598800"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; calls&lt;/a&gt; “the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value,” over a seven-year period starting in 2013. According to the complaint, the “illegal securities offering” created an information asymmetry that let Larsen and Garlinghouse sell XRP to investors who only knew what Larsen and Garlinghouse chose to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQ2a72"&gt;At the heart of the suit is a basic question about XRP: &lt;a href="https://www.iflr.com/article/b1m2pm9g4n65mk/cryptocurrencies-and-us-securities-laws-beyond-bitcoin-and-ether"&gt;is it a security or a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Substack says readers and writers are really in charge of moderation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0h-ISkZBHEPqPMJ0eq14-4UgNwo=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569677/Untitled_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCZC4j"&gt;Substack plans to take a “hands-off approach” to determining who can use its newsletter platform and “resist public pressure” to remove writers seen by some as “unacceptable.” &lt;a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/substacks-view-of-content-moderation"&gt;In a blog post this afternoon&lt;/a&gt;, the company outlined a relatively lax content moderation policy designed to let writers know they won’t be removed from the platform as long as they comply with basic rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgKGu3"&gt;While it does have &lt;a href="https://substack.com/content"&gt;a short list of prohibitions&lt;/a&gt;, Substack says that “readers and writers are in charge.” The idea is that readers don’t have to pay for or subscribe to writers who they don’t agree with, and writers can leave — and take their mailing lists with them — if they don’t like the platform. “We just disagree with those who would seek to tightly constrain...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony says it’s already seeing some benefits from WarnerMedia’s big HBO Max bet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CqCu0jOOUkgkLjoXQjSBP9XV9bI=/589x0:1876x858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569501/Spider_Swing.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Sony Pictures Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wvj9gD"&gt;Sony Pictures saw a “bit of a boom” in interest from Hollywood creatives who want to work with a studio committed to theatrical releases, according to the company’s CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbyp2b"&gt;The uptick in interest comes just after WarnerMedia announced its 17 movies planned for 2021 will premiere on HBO Max the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;same day they hit theaters&lt;/a&gt;. For WarnerMedia executives trying to figure out how to bolster subscribers for its new streaming service and release films in an era when the return to theaters is uncertain, the move makes sense. Plus, WarnerMedia executives will tell you they’re still committed to theatrical releases, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-warnermedia-studios-and-networks-group-chairman-ceo-ann-sarnoff-speaks-with-cnbcs-squawk-alley-today-.html"&gt;pointing to &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;’s release&lt;/a&gt;. Others in the industry will point to &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;as a reason &lt;em&gt;for &lt;/em&gt;the HBO Max move. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rESR5i"&gt;While Sony could &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/studio-dilemma-risk-a-box-office-flop-sell-netflix-1246354"&gt;sell a title...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A OnePlus smartwatch is finally coming in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mXiItR5tE0zza51oi_UsVzhx1Ik=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569422/vpavic_4112_20200721_0052.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gco3Ay"&gt;OnePlus will finally be making a smartwatch in 2021, CEO Pete Lau has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1341392977973960707"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, marking the first foray into wearable devices for the smartphone company. There’s not many details yet on the upcoming device,  including what smartwatch OS it’ll run, a price, or even a firm release date — Lau only notes that it’ll be “released early next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKQ2Uj"&gt;The idea of a OnePlus smartwatch isn’t a new one; the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/4/11859138/oneplus-canceled-smartwatch"&gt;had reportedly designed&lt;/a&gt; a Wear OS (then still called Android Wear) smartwatch a few years ago. OnePlus ultimately nixed that product, though” “We had completed the design but we still decided to scrap it,” Lau said in &lt;a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-smaller-smartphone-makers-feel-the-markets-squeeze-1464947768?mod=e2twd"&gt;an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We have to be focused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Awm2nv"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Many of you said you wanted a watch, and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s nationwide 5G can be slower than its LTE network, tests show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ey6Zvi67ahwauofHpqKcjEfHho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569332/vzw-042.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoFTeg"&gt;Verizon’s new nationwide 5G network is reportedly slower than its LTE network, to the point that users are apparently better off just disabling 5G entirely unless they’re near a mmWave network. The results come from &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/heres-why-verizon-iphone-users-must-turn-off-5g-right-now"&gt;testing done by &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;’s Sascha Sagan&lt;/a&gt;, who points to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509364/verizon-5g-network-ultra-wideband-nationwide-apple-event"&gt;Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, or DSS&lt;/a&gt;, as the culprit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8EPRy"&gt;The tech lets carriers run LTE and 5G networks side by side, which is useful if, like Verizon, you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418981/verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-auction-winner-fcc-dish"&gt;don’t yet have enough dedicated 5G spectrum&lt;/a&gt;. While the carrier has largely focused on its mmWave network until recently, it also has begun rolling out a mid-band nationwide 5G network, which promises to avoid mmWave’s range issues by using DSS. The only catch is that, with Verizon, it seems like this tech leads to worse...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Google and Nickelback really want you to look at your photographs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6sFS-uBcXdlkmt8A0K6Lmjh4Lg=/97x0:1252x770/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569309/Screen_Shot_2020_12_22_at_1.56.54_PM.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="92b5r1"&gt;Nickelback has created &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km3sqKZ7CPE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;a parody version of its own song “Photograph”&lt;/a&gt; for a new Google Photos ad, and it’s a lot more entertaining than you might suspect. In the ad, Nickelback lead singer Chad Kroeger mercilessly makes fun of himself, fully leaning into the “Photograph” meme and its usefulness in explaining all sorts of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIlNIVXpIns"&gt;graphs&lt;/a&gt; and in illustrating &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/NSUe_-3PIFk"&gt;framed copies of other memes&lt;/a&gt;, as Kroeger instructs viewers to “look at them” in his unmistakable, raspy voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtmEtU"&gt;The ad’s lyrics and photos touch on Kroeger’s “noodle hair” and his passion for photographing dessert. That it manages to both be a nice example of Google Photos’ features and a cute use of the old meme makes it worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;
