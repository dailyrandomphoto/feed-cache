    <title>Brave browser replaces Google with its own search engine</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XFlq9C"&gt;Brave, the privacy-focused browser that blocks third-party ads and trackers by default, is switching to using its own search engine by default, &lt;a href="https://brave.com/search-and-web-discovery/"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The change will be applied for new users, and will affect which search engine is used via the browser’s address bar. Brave Search will replace Google in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, Qwant in France, and DuckDuckGo in Germany. More countries will be switched over in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mG9AvH"&gt;It’s a significant step for Brave’s fledgling search engine, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547158/brave-search-beta-browser-private-independent-index"&gt;launched in public beta&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, since most people just take what they’re given. The search engine set as the browser default is a valuable promotion tactic, and so important that the practice has...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How NFTs are creating a generational divide between platforms  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RrQZNW"&gt;Today, let’s talk about a fault line that’s beginning to open up in the gaming world, one I suspect will soon be coming to most platforms and app stores. It’s a divide that begins with a simple question: will your platform allow NFTs? Crypto payments? You know … &lt;em&gt;blockchain stuff&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldZEbU"&gt;Like it or not, the rise of non-fungible tokens as an engine for fun and profit has been one of the tech world’s big stories in 2021. Using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;the blockchain&lt;/a&gt; to create unique digital objects with verifiable, transferrable ownership has opened up new possibilities in art, digital trading cards, and gaming. At least for the moment, it seems likely that other forms of media will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6IMGp"&gt;Recently I’ve written about ways in which NFTs are challenging the current...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix boss says he “screwed up” over Chappelle special fallout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pBxNE5fsWQNw8aJuMe2O8JuGU3o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018988/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fMxCI1"&gt;Mere hours before a planned walkout from Netflix’s trans and allied workers over comments made by Dave Chappelle in a recent special, co-CEO Ted Sarandos has said he “screwed up” over his response to employees over outrage from within the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ryo4xU"&gt;Chappelle’s special &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt; debuted on the streaming service earlier this month and immediately came under fire from members and allies of the LGBTQ+ community as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;Netflix employees&lt;/a&gt; who criticized the special as being transphobic. Sarandos, for his part, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;stood by the special&lt;/a&gt;, telling employees that Netflix doesn’t allow titles on its service “that are designed to incite hate or violence, and we don’t believe &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt; crosses that line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JERKz"&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/dave-chappelle-netflix-ted-sarandos-i-screwed-up-1235093098/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo reportedly developing own chips for flagship phones</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XUEALA"&gt;Oppo is developing its own high-end chips for flagship mobile phones, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/China-s-Oppo-joins-race-to-develop-own-smartphone-chips"&gt;according to a report in &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Two people who spoke to the newspaper said that the plan was to release custom SoCs in 2023 or 2024 “depending on the speed of development.” Oppo reportedly wants to use TSMC’s advanced 3nm process technology for the chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBVSiO"&gt;If plans come to pass, Oppo would be the latest major smartphone manufacturer to take control of its own SoC design. Yesterday Google launched the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, its first phones with a custom SoC called Tensor. Apple and Samsung also design their own smartphone chips, as did Huawei before US sanctions decimated its mobile business.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The IATSE’s strike-averting deal means better pay on streaming</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TyhxQH"&gt;Streaming services may pay up to 30 percent more to production workers as part of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees’ (IATSE) deal with major Hollywood studios to avert a strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFiIrw"&gt;The union tweeted a document that specifically outlined the new streaming terms of the tentative Basic Agreement. According to the one-sheet, the new agreement would secure higher wages for episodic streaming productions, including longform miniseries with runtimes longer than 66 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZweH5c"&gt;Payouts on some miniseries could increase up to 30 percent, which will depend on how the project is classified. Longform productions that cost between $20 and $32 million, meanwhile, will no longer get a discount on account of the production heading to a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is planning to rebrand the company with a new name</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3BQkSw"&gt;Facebook is planning to change its company name next week to reflect its focus on building the metaverse, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dN7MdP"&gt;The coming name change, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to talk about at the company’s annual Connect conference on October 28th, but could unveil sooner, is meant to signal the tech giant’s ambition to be known for more than social media and all the ills that entail. The rebrand would likely position the blue Facebook app as one of many products under a parent company overseeing groups like Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, and more. A spokesperson for Facebook declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="roHgyg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook intends to transition to “being a metaverse company”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Ib1oil"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6zB7gp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7VHZD"&gt;The application claims that the DFEH is represented in the case by lawyers who previously worked for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (or EEOC)  — a federal agency that investigates claims of workplace abuse.

    <title>PSA: the MacBook Pro 14-inch’s $20 power brick upsell is probably worth it</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dSAcBZ"&gt;If you’re looking at buying the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;$1,999 base model MacBook Pro 14-inch&lt;/a&gt;, there’s one upgrade that you may really want to make — the $20 one that gets you the 96W power adapter instead of the 67W included power adapter. That’s because, according to some wording on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-space-gray-8-core-cpu-14-core-gpu-512gb#"&gt;Apple’s MacBook Pro configuration page&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-67w-adapter-cant-fast-charge/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), you’ll need the more powerful charger if you want to take advantage of the computer’s fast charging feature, which can charge the laptop up to 50 percent in half an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="om07HD"&gt;Is it ridiculous that Apple is basically taxing the people who want to buy its least expensive (but still very pricey!) new MacBook Pro? Yes, absolutely — but you should still probably pay it if you want to charge your laptop up quickly. The...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="l4ikZY"&gt;“Users will still get at least 3 years of OS updates, after which we’re committing to ensure that Pixels will stay up-to-date and secure,” Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The frequency and categories of updates will depend on the capabilities and needs of the...&lt;/p&gt;
