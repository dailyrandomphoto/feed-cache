    <title>Google launches new features to help users shrink their carbon footprints</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mKdvyf"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbHuSHGZf5U&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a suite of new features that it says will help people who use their platforms make more sustainable choices. The new services focus on reducing planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions and are primarily found on Search, Maps, Travel, and Nest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0vVye"&gt;But before we get into the details of how their new tools work, a quick note of context; some environmental advocates have called out companies for &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/climate-change-focusing-on-how-individuals-can-help-is-very-convenient-for-corporations-108546"&gt;shifting responsibility&lt;/a&gt; for the climate crisis onto individual consumers. Holding big corporate polluters accountable for their emissions &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/10/business/what-can-you-do-about-climate-change/index.html"&gt;far outweighs any one consumers’ individual impact&lt;/a&gt;. And Wednesday’s announcements from Google aren’t really designed to reduce the company’s own carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zVfXIZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holding big corporate polluters...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Nest Renew could make your smart home smarter </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bU0JTETN52e0Jt0K0n-6X9FJQA=/0x90:3767x2601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69957993/Person_Adjusting_Thermostat_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select Nest thermostats will soon be able to tell you when you are using green energy.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google Nest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GqvbPT"&gt;Google has announced several new features for its Nest thermostats centered around helping the smart home become a bigger partner in the battle against climate change. These features are wrapped up in a new service called Nest Renew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A194Cn"&gt;The service will use intelligent automation to allow the thermostats to communicate with energy providers and make it easier for Nest users to know when there is cleaner and / or cheaper energy on their local power grid. The device will then automatically adjust to use that energy at optimal times without you having to do a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ym1RA"&gt;Nest Renew is the “First program of its kind,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and it is entirely opt-in. It includes five main features: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    <title>Canon’s new dual-fisheye EOS R lens is for creating 3D VR content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9N33hK1vdP9UfzNxpbz0UWvC5UY=/0x0:675x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69957825/f5.2mm_f2.8_l_dual_fisheye_675x450_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PgRv0B"&gt;Canon has announced what’s easily the oddest glass yet for its EOS R mirrorless camera system: a dual 5.2mm f/2.8 fisheye. The fisheye lenses are 60mm apart and are designed for creating 3D VR images and video content; Canon calls out the Oculus Quest 2 as a potential hardware destination and says this is “the world’s first digital interchangeable lens that can capture stereoscopic 3D 180° VR imagery to a single image sensor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Rezit"&gt;The lens can be used to shoot up to 8K footage on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318398/canon-eos-r5-announced-8k-price-specs-release-date"&gt;the EOS R5&lt;/a&gt;, which appears to be the only camera it’ll work with. Canon is releasing a 1.5.0 firmware update for the R5 as well as a Premiere Pro plug-in and a standalone file conversion app called EOS VR Utility. Canon calls this combination the EOS VR System and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Zuckerberg breaks silence to say the Facebook whistleblower’s claims ‘don’t make any sense’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Committees Confront Tech CEOs Over Online Spread Of False Info" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/znRkkzEJTHdrEluqCu7Hvpl5c2Q=/698x183:3497x2049/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69957278/1231932411.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPrOyu"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg posted a staunch defense of his company in a note to Facebook staffers, saying that recent claims by an ex-employee about the social network’s negative effects on society “don’t make any sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApfTy2"&gt;On Tuesday, a former Facebook product manager named Frances Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified before Congress&lt;/a&gt; about a trove of internal documents she gave to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. The focus of the hearing was on Facebook’s&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt; internal research that showed Instagram can have a negative effect on young people&lt;/a&gt;, but Haugen took the opportunity to also attack the company’s business model and News Feed algorithm. One of her main arguments was that Facebook’s business of selling ads based on engagement leads it to keep users on the service at all costs,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google files document production demand against one of its biggest public critics</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BLutbu"&gt;Late Monday night, Google filed for a court order to produce documents from longtime Google critic Luther Lowe, as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;ongoing federal antitrust case&lt;/a&gt;, US vs. Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxMmEZ"&gt;The motion arises from an apparent breakdown in negotiations between Google and Lowe’s employer, Yelp. Yelp has agreed to document production from a number of its employees, but has resisted on Lowe in particular, leaving Google to ask the court for a subpoena that would compel email archives and other documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yX5Xkc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Yelp cannot deny Google the documents it needs to defend itself”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="du0Vot"&gt;“Yelp’s allegations against Google conceived and advanced by Mr. Lowe, are a central part of the government’s case,” the filing reads. “Now that the very governmental action Yelp advocated...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel tries to bash Apple again with a terrible ‘social experiment’ ad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U2HNQ08e7DW7WVFvoBPCvzcT_04=/242x0:2638x1597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956919/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_2.12.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a59JUa"&gt;I regret to inform you that Intel has again &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp0xzapm-zY"&gt;made a terrible ad&lt;/a&gt; to showcase how absolutely not mad it is about Apple switching to its own processors. This one, called “Breaking the Spell,” follows a classic format — people are put in a room and told about features supposedly coming to MacBooks. Then, after they get all excited, the twist! They were actually being told about Windows computers, powered (of course) by Intel. The folks in the ad (which the fine print says are “real people paid for their time and opinions”) are speechless and then clamor to buy or take the laptops, presumably now that they’ve awoken to the possibilities of the PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwy2Wj"&gt;It’s an ad format that’s never been great, but the real kicker is that it makes absolutely no...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is making live video quality better by removing one feature</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ul7y1O4h_m2BgMRyiWblv12J5kQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956896/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AWfFIW"&gt;Twitter announced Tuesday that it’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1445415924564176901"&gt;dropping a feature&lt;/a&gt; from its live broadcasts tool, but the company is removing it in service of making your video broadcast quality better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jt3cM7"&gt;What’s gone? Now, you aren’t able to invite guests to join you in a broadcast via audio ahead of going live. That feature was added in March 2020. Now, when you go live, your broadcast will just feature you and whoever else happens to be in the frame, though people can still post in the chat or tap to add a heart to interact with you while you’re broadcasting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HDkQTE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As of today we’re removing the option to invite guests when you go live, so we can improve your video broadcast quality.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your viewers can still interact with you through chat and hearts. &lt;a href="https://t.co/bymoq55VIy"&gt;h...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1CF4dO"&gt;Using Apple’s Find My app, it was already possible to view the location where your AirPods were last paired with your iPhone or play a sound to make them easier to dig out of the couch cushions.

The feature could be useful if you wish you had a bit longer before Alexa replied to what you were saying, but it’s also a useful accessibility feature, particularly for people with speech impediments who may need more time to say something.
