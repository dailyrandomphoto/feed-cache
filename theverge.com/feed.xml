  &lt;p id="3UH00l"&gt;Marvel superhero Black Panther is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1341171593242963969"&gt;now available&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite.&lt;/em&gt; You can get him, Captain Marvel, and Taskmaster as part of the Marvel Royalty and Warriors Pack, which costs $24.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K47Xx5"&gt;Epic had hinted toward Black Panther’s eventual arrival with the release of the Wakandan Salute emote &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1341028166861787136"&gt;Monday morning&lt;/a&gt;. The salute has become an iconic greeting — something that many of the cast members of the 2018 &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; movie have spoke publicly about in the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expKmfdoo28"&gt;months after its release&lt;/a&gt;. The film grossed $1.35 billion at the box office, including an astounding &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt1825683/?ref_=bo_se_r_1"&gt;$700.4 million domestically.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big tech companies including Intel, Nvidia, and Cisco were all infected during the SolarWinds hack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v8gXS1"&gt;Last week, news broke that IT management company SolarWinds had been hacked, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/12/19/22190371/pompeo-russia-hack-us-agencies-solarwinds-microsoft"&gt;possibly by the Russian government&lt;/a&gt;, and the US Treasury, Commerce, State, Energy, and Homeland Security departments have been affected — &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/us/politics/russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html"&gt;two of which may have had emails stolen&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the hack. Other government agencies and many companies are investigating due to SolarWinds’ extensive client list. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;is now reporting that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/solarwinds-hack-victims-from-tech-companies-to-a-hospital-and-university-11608548402?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;some big tech companies have been infected, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pN0u9m"&gt;Cisco, Intel, Nvidia, Belkin, and VMware have all had computers on their networks infected with the malware. There could be far more: SolarWinds had stated that “fewer than 18,000” companies were impacted, as if that number is supposed to be reassuring, and it even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176053/solarwinds-hack-client-list-russia-orion-it-compromised"&gt;a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple wants to build its first car in 2024, Reuters says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yhU4W60hCQ5McMPuRNpxKJYdzMc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562849/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCaIgR"&gt;Apple once again appears to be seriously looking at making a car. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple is pursuing production of a passenger vehicle by 2024 as well as the creation of self-driving systems and a “breakthrough battery technology.” The report is vague on how it all comes together — it’s not clear that all of this tech is going into the first passenger vehicle Apple hopes to make — but it indicates that Apple is considering vehicle production, after previously shutting down plans to make a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="co7fxC"&gt;There have been rumors of Apple developing a car going &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-titan-car-project-to-challenge-tesla-1423868072"&gt;back to 2015&lt;/a&gt;. But in 2016, the project was scaled down significantly, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/17/13303710/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-focus"&gt;development of a full car being scrapped&lt;/a&gt; and Apple’s team refocusing on providing software that could be licensed...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s leaked Galaxy Chromebook 2 is oranger than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jhDht9-t5s5BVe0ElpEhEM2PEa8=/338x0:2162x1216/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562779/17a1cca82fdaa085e6a7da0895a7b6855c33cd7b5943c466b0f539c1b260d8b4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-chromebook2-first-images-1608577621-196464122" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZgEl32"&gt;Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Chromebook 2 has been revealed in a new leak, showing off the return of the company’s unique bright orange coloring in an otherwise similar-looking design, &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-chromebook2-first-images-1608577621-196464122"&gt;via Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLhkdU"&gt;There are some visible changes to the new model, including minor adjustments to the port layout and the extension of Samsung’s application of the orange color. The keyboard on the second-generation model has been made a more neutral black, even as the orange hue has extended to the sides of the laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uSps3P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Chromebook review: beautiful to a fault","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="R7n8Gr"&gt;But any more substantial changes will likely be found in the internal specs, which presumably will see some sort of improvement from last year’s model — especially considering that there are new 11th Gen Intel laptop chips out. Combining the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stardew Valley’s jam-packed 1.5 update reminds us why it’s our forever game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TdpxVihGwv5XufbehERSDZaQwn8=/75x0:885x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562581/StardewScreenshot_1.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: ConcernedApe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XABTSp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley &lt;/em&gt;is an idyllic digital space to escape to after a long year — and thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-5-update-out-now-on-pc/"&gt;1.5 update available today on PC&lt;/a&gt;, you can now bring friends and family along to your farm with local split-screen co-op. The &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/30/17304754/stardew-valley-multiplayer-mode-co-op"&gt;multiplayer update&lt;/a&gt; from a couple of years back made it possible to play and share farms online, but this local co-op addition lets you do the same with the people you actually live with, even if they don’t have their own copy of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pTGhk"&gt;You can add the ability for local co-op by having Robin the Carpenter build cabins on your farm, or if you’re starting from scratch, you can select to have the cabins already built when you make a new game. Once the cabins are built, you can start local co-op for up to three other people...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="jXILH2"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/floor/Default.aspx?date=2020-12-21"&gt;congressional leaders unveiled&lt;/a&gt; their massive spending and coronavirus relief measure, including a handful of controversial copyright measures civil liberties activists fear could penalize internet users for everyday online behavior. Congress is expected to vote on the package as early as Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fC24OH"&gt;Congress’ $2.3 trillion spending and relief package includes controversial measures previously introduced as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20703742/case-act-copyright-office-online-designers-congress-bill"&gt;the CASE Act&lt;/a&gt;, the Trademark Modernization Act, and a &lt;a href="https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2020/12/tillis-releases-text-of-bipartisan-legislation-to-fight-illegal-streaming-by-criminal-organizations"&gt;felony streaming proposal&lt;/a&gt; — all significantly expanding the rights and powers of intellectual property owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGcuTF"&gt;Most controversially, the CASE Act would create &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20927545/copyright-bill-house-congress-hakeem-jeffries-case-act-dmca"&gt;a quasi-judicial tribunal&lt;/a&gt; of “Copyright Claims Officers” who would work to resolve infringement claims.

    <title>Slavery and overfishing on the high seas can’t hide from these researchers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Thailand’s Seafood Industry Under Scrutiny" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eAlmsRq9hre23iBXgqGcAPYyBT8=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562296/507983002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fish are seen after being unloaded from a boat at the port in Songkhla on February 2, 2016. Around 100 people have been arrested by authorities in a recent crackdown on abuses involving Thailand’s multi-billion dollar seafood industry. The deep-rooted problem caused the huge global brand, Nestle in 2015 to admit that it had discovered clear evidence of slavery at sea in parts of the Thai supply chain.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Paula Bronstein / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kPTCzS"&gt;A tracking system designed to help ships avoid crashing into each other has become an important tool for spotting bad behavior on the high seas. Researchers can now put a spotlight on corporations that dominate fishing in unregulated international waters where it’s easier to get away with overfishing. And it’s giving us a better idea of how widespread slave labor could be on fishing vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TGwzLM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That all makes it easier to make companies answer for any abuses they commit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E8VutY"&gt;Two recently published papers use this technology, the maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS), to make high-seas fishing a little less mysterious. The first study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;One Earth&lt;/em&gt; on December 18th, traces the origins of thousands of high-seas...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile won’t claim it has a more reliable 5G network following ad board decision</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWEAvQ"&gt;T-Mobile has been asked to stop advertising its 5G network as more reliable than the competition by the National Advertising Review Board (NARB), which investigated T-Mobile’s claims made primarily in an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F405228998&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F21%2F22193839%2Ftmobile-5g-reliability-claims-verizon-competition-nad#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad featuring celebrity scientist Bill Nye&lt;/a&gt; after complaints from Verizon earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koZpLU"&gt;But the NARB also says T-Mobile shouldn’t have to mention the speed of its network when broadly discussing coverage superiority in future ads. T-Mobile has said it will comply with the recommendation. But it cast the recommendations as a partial win in a statement saying it “appreciates that the panel agreed that T-Mobile can continue to advertise its superior 5G coverage without qualification.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2X7Y2"&gt;T-Mobile’s compliance is notable because telecom...&lt;/p&gt;
