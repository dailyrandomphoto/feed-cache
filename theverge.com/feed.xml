    <title>Twitter is shutting down Fleets, its expiring tweets feature</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter just rolled out Fleets to everyone in November. | Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XZ5Fv8"&gt;Say goodbye to Fleets, the row of fullscreen tweets at the top of the Twitter timeline that expire after 24 hours. The ephemeral tweet format is shutting down due to low usage after launching widely just eight months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQE7QK"&gt;Starting on August 3rd, users will instead just see active Spaces — Twitter’s live audio chat rooms — at the top of their timelines. And the composer for traditional tweets will be updated with more camera editing features from Fleets, like text-formatting and GIF stickers over photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yimr8Q"&gt;Twitter’s decision to axe Fleets is not just an admission that the feature didn’t work, but that the company still hasn’t figured out how to get people tweeting more. For years, Twitter has struggled to get new users to post regularly and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will pay $1 billion to creators through 2022</title>

  &lt;p id="vLKxvE"&gt;Facebook plans to pay out &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/investing-1-billion-dollars-in-creators/"&gt;$1 billion to creators&lt;/a&gt; over the next year and a half as part of an effort to court content makers to its many services. The money will be awarded to creators who use Facebook products in different ways: on Facebook, creators can get a cash bonus for running ads on their videos or reaching certain tipping milestones during livestreams; on Instagram, creators can get paid for enabling ads on their IGTV videos, getting tipped in livestreams, or creating popular videos on Reels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6woKzB"&gt;The money is available to creators on an invitation-only basis for now, and new options for making money will be announced later. Facebook indicated it would expand availability to more creators later in the year, launching a “dedicated...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse launches its DM feature Backchannel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cicv7c0XMBuxRGTkPL8GOpkbo6k=/1x0:4516x3010/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581629/clubhousebackchannel.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Backchannel, Clubhouse’s messaging feature | Image: Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BwU93z"&gt;Now, you can slide into people’s Clubhouse DMs. The social audio company is launching its direct messaging feature, Backchannel, today for all users on both iOS and Android. For now, users can chat one-on-one, in groups, and send links. They cannot yet send images or videos, but a spokesperson says that functionality is coming, along with a “few other features.” There will also be an optional secondary inbox where message requests will live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTLTqh"&gt;The functionality is designed to help moderators chat among themselves during an active room; let people connect after an event; and broadly, foster text conversations that otherwise would have to take place in a separate app. We can’t say this development is much of a surprise, though: Clubhouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543877/clubhouse-backchannel-text-chat-private-leaked-feature"&gt;a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 Beta 3 has a wild new way to handle auto-rotation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12 " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e9G7mUHvR5zLXrFDfxtok0cbrYo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581623/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yjww9f"&gt;Google is releasing the latest beta for Android 12 right on schedule. Beta 3 for Android 12 continues adding features, including scrolling screenshots, faster on-device universal search for apps, improved auto-rotate, and more. Google says this version of Android 12 has the “Android 12 APIs and the official SDK,” which means there shouldn’t be major feature changes in the upcoming betas. That should mean Android 12 is still on track for a fall release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ2qkg"&gt;The most interesting new feature in Android 12 Beta 3 is “better, faster auto-rotate.” Google is now using the front-facing camera and face detection to determine what orientation you’re trying to hold the phone (instead of just depending on the accelerometer). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHffI1"&gt;“This is especially helpful...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="fr25r3"&gt;Google is working to make browsing more secure by soon offering an HTTPS-first option, which will try to upgrade page loads to HTTPS, the company announced on Wednesday. If you flip this option on, the browser will also show a full-page warning when you try to load up a site that doesn’t support HTTPS. The company is also announcing that it’s “re-examining” the lock icon in the URL bar and plans to experiment with a change to how that looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3cJEO"&gt;HTTPS is a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/"&gt;more secure version of HTTP&lt;/a&gt; (yes, the “S” stands for “secure”), and many of the websites you visit every day likely already support it. Since HTTPS encrypts your traffic, it’s a helpful privacy tool for when you’re using public Wi-Fi or to keep your ISP from snooping on the contents of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An AI model shows health centers in California aren’t prepared for power outages  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sylmar Converter Station, a piece of power grid infrastructure operated by LADWP, for a story about how an Oregon wildfire almost caused the lights to go out in California on Friday night. Sylmar Converter Station is the terminus of the Pacific DC Intertie" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wwynCGxiwSa8a-fu_1uvIT0Pb-c=/42x0:3959x2611/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581619/1233958488.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildfires in the West can lead to power outages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f1lvuv"&gt;There are around 20 federally qualified health centers in the areas touched by the Lava, Tennant, and Salt fires, which started in Northern California at the end of June. The centers are part of the state’s healthcare safety net and offer &lt;a href="https://www.chcf.org/publication/californias-federally-qualified-health-centers/#related-links-and-downloads"&gt;primary care&lt;/a&gt; to low-income patients in the area. Despite the fire risk to the facilities, none of those 20 centers had backup generators, says Andrew Schroeder, who runs analytics programs at the humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJc5Zw"&gt;That’s key information for officials and aid groups: if the power went out because of the fires, those centers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932780/california-blackout-healthcare-electricity-fires"&gt;might not be able&lt;/a&gt; to keep medications and vaccines refrigerated or turn on computer systems with patient medical records. But before May, that’s not...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>European Union proposes roadmap for slashing greenhouse gas emissions</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aR3LPZ"&gt;The European Union put out a sweeping set of proposals today that could drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions if the plan ultimately becomes law. Internal combustion vehicles would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576994/european-union-gas-vehicle-ice-ban-2035-electric-cars"&gt;phased out by 2035&lt;/a&gt;, and it would rope industries like aviation and shipping, which were previously exempt from some EU climate policies, into compliance. The bloc also intends to influence polluters outside its borders by potentially making importers pay for their pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPPqKd"&gt;All in all, it’s a roadmap to achieving a goal that Europeans have been hashing out for years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21019624/europes-green-deal-on-climate-change-failed-its-first-test"&gt;In 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, put forward a “Green Deal” to get the continent to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Reaching that target...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s rollable OLED TV is finally coming to the US for a staggering $100,000</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="djPmP4"&gt;LG’s futuristic rollable OLED 4K TV is coming to the US for an eye-popping price of $100,000. First introduced as a stunning prototype at CES 2018 (and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171013/lg-rollable-tv-oled-4k-tv-features-photos-video-release-ces-2019"&gt;turned into a real product&lt;/a&gt; the next year), the 65-inch set can roll itself up and then back down to fully disappear into its housing unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQi67S"&gt;That cabinet also contains a front-firing Dolby Atmos sound system. The OLED R has a middle mode between being fully unfurled and rolled down. LG calls this Line View, and you can use it to display a clock, photos, music controls, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is what the back of the OLED R looks like when rolling down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nNvg2F"&gt;From a picture quality perspective, the OLED R has technically already been surpassed by newer LG...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="0VzU4P"&gt;The added feature turns the OP-1 into a full-fledged external audio unit. That means you can directly send audio from an OP-1 to DAW software like Ableton Live, Pro Tools, or Logic Pro on a PC or Mac or mobile versions of those applications on iOS and Android (like Garageband) without having to use any workarounds or hacks. Additionally, you’ll be able to sample and record on the OP-1 directly from a connected USB audio device. &lt;/p&gt;
