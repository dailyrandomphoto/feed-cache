    <title>Huawei’s CEO wants to talk to President Biden</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Billionaire Huawei Founder Ren Zhenfei Defiant in Face of Existential Threat" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dsTdD_1vM1pdBOjbEt_LxPrcR7k=/0x3:4240x2830/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791163/1146396255.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ywa5HK"&gt;Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei has called for a reset in relations between the US and the Chinese tech giant. Speaking to international media in China for the first time in more than a year, Ren expressed willingness to speak with President Biden and said he hoped for an “open policy” from the new administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaSejD"&gt;“I would welcome such phone calls and the message is around joint development and shared success,” Ren said in officially interpreted comments &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-welcome-phone-call-from-us-president-biden.html"&gt;reported by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/huawei-ceo-hopes-reset-us-053713079.html"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3121109/huaweis-ren-zhengfei-calls-more-open-us-policy-towards-china-under"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The US wants to have economic growth and China wants to have economic growth as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBEW63"&gt;“If Huawei’s production capacity can be expanded, that would mean more opportunities for US companies to supply too,” Ren continued. “I...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat will start reminding users to clean out their friends list</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Snapchat stock image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7djfIVKR0LECwGevjPbI7ZG2H8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68790994/snapchat-stock-0963.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wUorx2"&gt;Snap is introducing a new feature it’s calling Friend Check Up. On Snapchat, having someone friended could give them access to your story and even possibly your location, depending on your Snap Map settings, so Snap wants to make sure that everyone on your friends list is still someone you actually want to call your friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLGZ0w"&gt;This feature could help make the platform safer for users, if they choose to use it. It could be a good way to help you realize you might still have somebody friended that you don’t want to see your posts. And I know there’ve been plenty of times when I’ve looked at a friend or follower of mine and said “I have no idea who this person is,” or worse: “oops, my ex can see my sadtweeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltBRxZ"&gt;Snap says that the feature...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood sued for wrongful death by family of 20-year-old who died by suicide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R4E0DF19-tktuXqwLlFsBNRI-rY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68790593/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MBeyyM"&gt;Last June, 20-year-old Alex Kearns &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/young-trader-dies-by-suicide-after-thinking-he-racked-up-big-losses-on-robinhood.html"&gt;died by suicide&lt;/a&gt;, blaming stock trading app Robinhood for his death. He mistakenly believed he’d lost $730,000, and that the company was coming for more than $170,000 of that money in a matter of days. His family now agrees that it was Robinhood’s fault — on Monday, they sued the company for wrongful death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXK3ec"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F493835850%2FKearns-v-Robinhood-complaint&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F8%2F22273600%2Frobinhood-alex-kearns-wrongful-death-lawsuit-stock-options-trading#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the complaint&lt;/a&gt;, Kearns never owed any money at all, but that didn’t stop the Robinhood app from suggesting that he did, or sending him an “immediate action required” email telling him he needed to deposit $178,612.73 by June 17th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQMOAv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillBrewsterSCG/status/1273008513950928896"&gt;Here’s a screenshot&lt;/a&gt; one of his relatives shared on Twitter last June of what the app reportedly showed him at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gwm9Hl"&gt;

    <title>Steam has officially come to China, and Sony’s PS5 is officially coming too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2udUjga_EqE0YEzhxE8IDRFEkK8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68790204/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8ats0u"&gt;Though the international version of Steam has been available in China for years, &lt;a href="https://store.steamchina.com/"&gt;an official Chinese release&lt;/a&gt; of the the popular PC gaming platform has now debuted (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1358859000029274116?s=20"&gt;via analyst Daniel Ahmad&lt;/a&gt;). If Chinese gamers needed more reason to celebrate, Sony also announced that the PlayStation 5 will be coming to the country soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P04ZWe"&gt;The Chinese version of Steam currently only has around 40 titles available, with another 10 or so listed as coming soon. Included in that list are, of course, Valve’s own e-sports titles &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;. The service is a long time coming — Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17451484/steam-china-announced-valve-perfect-world"&gt;announced that it would be bringing it to China back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, though Chinese gamers have been able to access the service with Steam’s global client. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>If you’ve wondered what Horizon Zero Dawn might look like on a graphing calculator, here you go</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hCJS28mamjXeE3Bch7T27-kp-dU=/248x0:2632x1589/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68790161/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_12.15.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RIVVAp"&gt;What are we actually looking at here? A rock? An enemy? Does it even matter compared to the glory of running &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at the eye-watering resolution of 128 pixels wide by 72 pixels tall? Yes, a YouTuber has managed to play &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at 72p, and that’s not a typo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpXhXs"&gt;The YouTuber in question is Kryzzp, who also goes by zWORMz Gaming, and he ran the game at this absurd resolution to test the performance of an Nvidia GT 710, an ultra-budget video card &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/63612-nvidia-launches-dirt-cheap-geforce-gt-710-graphics.html"&gt;that barely cost $40 brand-new back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Incredibly, he manages to fend off one of the robotic enemies, though it’s impossible to tell how much ammo he had left after doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xjEJu9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Did you know the PC Version of Horizon: Zero Dawn lets you toggle the resolution to 72p?...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Facebook will now take down posts claiming vaccines cause autism</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7zzmqU"&gt;Facebook is expanding what false claims &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims"&gt;it will remove from its platforms&lt;/a&gt; related to COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccines, and vaccines in general starting today. The company began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;removing debunked COVID-19 claims&lt;/a&gt; in December of last year and notifying customers when they had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177085/facebook-covid-19-misinformation-notifications"&gt;interacted with a post that has false information&lt;/a&gt; that same month. But now the list of potential claims that could get a post removed has grown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyRP1M"&gt;Highlights from &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/230764881494641/"&gt;the new expanded list&lt;/a&gt; of false COVID-19 and vaccine-related claims that will be removed include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9vM27y"&gt;COVID-19 is man-made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GCcJuD"&gt;Vaccines are not effective at preventing the disease they were created to protect against&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h4igga"&gt;It’s safer to get a disease than to get its vaccine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hjr4Uh"&gt;Vaccines are dangerous, toxic, or cause autism&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Zoom adds facial effects so you can look your weirdest during meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Zooms new Studio Effects feature lets you add facial hair, lip color and eyebrows in any color." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oUtLQ47mtmLcKg3C0Qsg6eIT-iQ=/14x0:1073x706/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789546/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_1.19.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KOH6fb"&gt;While Zoom was originally created as a serious meeting application for businesses, it has since become one of the most-used services during the pandemic for anyone who wants to have a face-to-face virtual conversation. As a result, the company has been adding more fun stuff, such as weird backgrounds, to use for online family gatherings, friend chats, and well, for business meetings. And now, it’s come up with a feature called Studio Effects that gives you the ability to add a variety of eyebrows, facial hair, and lip color to your video image during Zoom sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJ5rUG"&gt;The feature, still in beta, isn’t really new — &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360049041052-New-Updates-for-September-21-2020"&gt;Zoom announced it in September 2020&lt;/a&gt; — but this is the first time &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ParkerMolloy/status/1358880050989457408"&gt;many Zoom users are first discovering it&lt;/a&gt;. At any rate, it’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A West Virginia newspaper chain is suing Google and Facebook over digital ad revenue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mquqLy9a1IyNvqfDZKqWOIv6LZc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789532/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FlgPHE"&gt;The parent company of a West Virginia newspaper chain has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet, alleging the platforms are siphoning away much-needed digital ad revenue. It &lt;a href="https://www.editorandpublisher.com/stories/hd-media-files-first-of-its-kind-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-and-facebook,185360#"&gt;appears to be the first such lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; by a news organization against the digital giants and makes the argument that the platforms represent a digital monopoly that should be broken up, like Standard Oil or AT&amp;amp;T were back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGSDvu"&gt;“Google and Facebook have monopolized the digital advertising market thereby strangling a primary source of revenue for newspapers across the country,” according to the complaint filed by HD Media, which operates the Pulitzer Prize-winning &lt;em&gt;Charleston Gazette-Mail&lt;/em&gt; and several other West Virginia...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This laptop has seven times the average number of screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Expanscape Aurora 7 prototype" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mp7bdSSOZxpfsILFOdQ__IbhrYo=/1x0:2539x1692/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789392/aurora7hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Expanscape&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6tkVC"&gt;A company called Expanscape has created the most Inspector Gadget-like device that I’ve ever seen. It’s a laptop prototype called the Aurora 7 (a working title), and attached to its humongous black box of a chassis are six extra displays that extend out in every direction away from the main screen, each showing its own windows and applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdXSlV"&gt;If you’re like me, the first thought that comes to mind is “that poor hinge!” Yeah, poor hinge, indeed. Many laptop hinges don’t gracefully handle having one screen attached, let alone seven. Piggybacking on the main 17.3-inch 4K display are three other screens of the same size and resolution.
