    <title>US Capitol enters lockdown as pro-Trump protesters storm building</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K7QipC"&gt;Pro-Trump protesters have stormed the US Capitol building, effectively halting a vote to certify the results of the 2020 election. The Capitol is currently on lockdown, and lawmakers from both chambers have been evacuated as the mob has breached both congressional chambers and voting floors. Tear gas has reportedly been deployed in the rotunda in an effort to secure the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyJiMG"&gt;Tear gas has been deployed within the building, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BNONews/status/1346911180665679886"&gt;local media is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that at least one person has been shot. Two nearby federal buildings (Cannon and Madison) have also been evacuated as have private residences near Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lAUElK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They’re in the chamber. One is up on the dais yelling “Trump won that election!” This is insane &lt;a href="https://t.co/p6CXhBDSFT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/p6CXhBDSFT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;—...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Mint is getting new features for tracking subscriptions and managing transactions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oJ4lKhZMzXPymvupwGQylxgDOFg=/71x0:599x352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68629189/INT21_Mint_Mercury_Launch_Blog_Social.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Mint&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MvO0SY"&gt;Mint, the free personal finance app from Intuit, is &lt;a href="https://mint.intuit.com/blog/updates/the-latest-mint-features-are-here-to-help-you-gain-financial-empowerment/"&gt;receiving an update today&lt;/a&gt;, adding more automated features like subscription tracking and new “insights” to keep you informed where your money is spent, &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90591464/intuit-mint-new-version-and-alternatives?partner=rss&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&amp;amp;utm_content=rss"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Mint’s new features may bring it more in line with the competition from banks and companies like Google that have been nipping at its heels with built-in budget tracking features and other services over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzOSko"&gt;Mint’s main function is tracking spending by automatically sorting transactions based on type. By connecting a checking or savings account, Mint can start combing through purchases to see how much is spent in categories like groceries, electronics, or gas. From there, you can create a budget by setting a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new app allows teachers to use their iPhone or iPad as an overhead camera on Zoom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the app that shows it acting as an overhead camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4PLvwcOTk0J0iTFrJEFy5eVDh-Y=/0x1733:1600x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68629107/iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABkAAAArwCAYAAAD8ZvemAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAJ8WlUWHRYTUw6Y29tLmFkb2Jl_2_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gD8eq4"&gt;Teachers who have found themselves holding class over Zoom have probably already figured out clever hacks to show their students documents, but there’s now an app designed specifically for that purpose (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/06/iphone-document-camera-overviewer-zoom"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Overviewer was made by developer Charlie Chapman, and it allows teachers (or anyone, really) to easily use their phone’s camera as a replacement for an overhead document viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyB2Z3"&gt;If it’s been a minute since you were a student, or if your school didn’t have these overhead devices, they’re basically webcams pointing straight down that allow teachers to show students a printed document, book, hand drawing, or other piece of writing or image. It’s a useful ability to have, but many teachers are working from home because of COVID...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get two years of PlayStation Plus for only $58 today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kL1fDL"&gt;If you were gifted a PS5 over the holidays or still own a PS4 and need to renew your PlayStation Plus membership, you can snag two &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year PlayStation Plus subscriptions at Eneba&lt;/a&gt; for $58 when you enter the discount code &lt;strong&gt;2021PLUS&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout (while supplies last). Usually, one year of PlayStation Plus would set you back $60, so getting two one-year subscriptions for less than the normal retail price is a real bargain, and this promotion will likely sell out quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQj3JL"&gt;Ideally, this is great for a PS4 or PS5 user looking to stack up on PlayStation Plus subscriptions for the next two years, or if you want to gift one PlayStation Plus membership to a friend and keep the other one for yourself. If you don’t need more than one PlayStation Plus...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 10’s taskbar is getting a big update with new weather and news widget</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 10 taskbar feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VsJ8oy"&gt;Microsoft is making a big change to its Windows 10 taskbar soon, with the addition of a news and weather widget. The new feature is available to testers today, and it will allow Windows 10 users to access a feed of news, stocks, and weather information straight from the taskbar. You’ll be able to quickly glance at the weather without having to open the Start menu, install a third-party app, or check online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMEstS"&gt;The taskbar feature will pop out into a mini feed of content that can be personalized with the latest sports news, headlines, and weather information. Microsoft is using its Microsoft News network to surface news and content from more than 4,500 sources. The company has been curating this through artificial intelligence in recent...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo once laughed Xbox execs out of the room over a Microsoft acquisition offer</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BESlMO"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox consoles are considered a pillar of the industry, part of a trifecta that makes up modern gaming. The first Xbox launched in 2001; the Xbox Series X and S arrived just last year. Today, Xbox is a powerhouse, yet it wasn’t always so. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-06/xbox-the-oral-history-of-an-american-video-game-empire?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s Dina Bass published an oral history on the creation of Microsoft’s Xbox that recounts the console’s conception, from an executive retreat through release day — with snags like a failed bid at Nintendo detailed along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ncx0EK"&gt;The original Xbox was known as Midway — or Coffin Box to some, according to Xbox technology officer Seamus Blackley, “because they worried that it would fail and end their career at Microsoft.” As part of an effort to lock in exclusive games, Microsoft tried...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="0D2EL1"&gt;Nintendo is winding down support for the Netflix app on the Wii U and 3DS. The app will be shut down for existing users on June 30th, and if you’ve never downloaded it, it isn’t available anymore. You can redownload the app if you’ve downloaded it in the past, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgGTD1"&gt;“Starting Dec 31st, 2020, the Netflix app will no longer be available for new users to download from Nintendo eShop on the Wii U console or Nintendo 3DS family of systems,” Nintendo said in a statement on the listings for the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/netflix-wii-u/"&gt;Wii U&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/netflix-3ds/"&gt;3DS&lt;/a&gt; Netflix app. “During that time, it will be possible for existing users to re-download these applications. Service for existing users will continue until June 30th, 2021. Thank you to everyone who enjoyed Netflix on these platforms over...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump administration finalizes rule that could define gig workers as contractors</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MM2xjF"&gt;The US Department of Labor has finalized a decision that could make it easier for “gig economy” companies to classify their workers as independent contractors, rather than employees that can claim legal benefits. The Trump administration released its &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20210106"&gt;final version&lt;/a&gt; of the rule today, and it’s set to take effect on March 8th, although this could change after President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFJatD"&gt;The DOL proposed a &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/dol-debuts-rule-to-ease-employers-use-of-independent-contractors"&gt;new framework&lt;/a&gt; last year for classifying employees and contractors. It &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa/2021-independent-contractor"&gt;focuses on&lt;/a&gt; two “core factors” for distinguishing the two: the “nature and degree of control over the work” and the “opportunity for profit or loss” based on initiative and investment. It also lists additional “guideposts” that include “the amount...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon marked free podcasts as costing $8.95 with a discount for Audible subscribers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TjK9RZ"&gt;Charlie Harding, the host of the podcast &lt;em&gt;Switched On Pop&lt;/em&gt;, noticed something strange when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/charlieharding/status/1346584298330099712?s=21"&gt;he searched his podcast name on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; yesterday: a price tag. An $8.95 price, to be exact, marked as a “limited deal” with the suggestion to buy an Audible subscription to get a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHYZoP"&gt;Harding’s show, which details the making and meaning of popular music, is already freely available in all podcast apps through an RSS feed. It also recently became available for free inside Audible, which is owned by Amazon, when podcasts were added to its app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536963/amazon-free-podcast-update-catalog"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. But for some reason, Amazon had started advertising the show as paid content. Even more strangely, the Audible promotion was really for a price &lt;em&gt;hike&lt;/em&gt;, marking the show as originally costing $0 and...&lt;/p&gt;
