    <title>How to watch the debut of Tesla Model S Plaid, the ‘quickest production car ever made’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W2_KM0ClvWDR4bb5AHy3cVWYwww=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434160/0x0_ModelS_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5X8n8t"&gt;Tesla will hold a delivery event for its new, high-performance “Plaid” version of the Model S on Thursday. It’s an effort by Elon Musk’s company to reignite interest in its nearly decade-old electric sedan, which is also facing stiff competition from Porsche and Mercedes-Benz. When its released, Musk claims the Plaid Model S will be the “quickest production car ever made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVL4lI"&gt;The event, which will be held at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, CA, will be livestreamed for the public starting at 7PM PT / 10PM ET. It was originally scheduled for June 3rd, but Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/29/22459617/musk-tweets-model-s-tesla-plaid-delivery-delayed-again-june-10th"&gt;pushed it to the 10th&lt;/a&gt; after tweeting that the vehicle needed “one more week of tweak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLuJqJ"&gt;The delivery of the refreshed Model S has also been delayed, with the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;originally stating&lt;/a&gt; that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new health features bring new focus to elder care technology  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbDIdsB8AyFH5gNMa9_bSViPs5k=/0x133:1690x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434102/824_2021_06_07_824_chromescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ksqI6"&gt;Apple’s new health features will be available for anyone with an iPhone. But two of the tools announced at WWDC 2021, walking steadiness and the ability to share health data with family members, could be particularly useful for older adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOBiA0"&gt;People who work with older adults are excited that a company like Apple is interested in tech that could be used for this group. Experts have spent years frustrated that companies don’t design products to meet the needs of that demographic. There have been a few attempts to introduce new tools, but none got much traction, says Richard Schulz, a social psychologist studying aging at the University of Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHXROR"&gt;“I think the reason is that the big boys — companies like Apple — never got into it,”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Record labels sue Roblox for letting users upload pirated songs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lil Nas X performing ‘Holiday’ inside Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yAuhRRK-KRwMIHArBZjXs4lsm7Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434047/LNX_Concert_HOLIDAY.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8tIIML"&gt;The National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) has sued &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; for letting users upload music from Ariana Grande, Imagine Dragons, deadmau5, and other artists without paying a licensing fee. &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.822912/gov.uscourts.cacd.822912.1.0.pdf"&gt;The lawsuit seeks&lt;/a&gt; $200 million in damages and a court order that will make &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; crack down on piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FHKre"&gt;The NMPA filed suit yesterday on behalf of several major music publishers. It accuses &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;massively popular, kid-focused platform&lt;/a&gt; for games and social experiences — of hosting a shared library of copyrighted but unlicensed songs. The complaint alleges that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; “actively preys on its impressionable user base and their desire for popular music, teaching children that pirating music is perfectly acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KeRkpr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“‘Roblox’ allows a prodigious...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Control is free on the Epic Games Store for one week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UNoH1s"&gt;Remedy’s excellent supernatural thriller &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; is available for free on the Epic Games Store from now until June 17th at 11AM ET. All you need is an Epic Games account — just log in to the store while the deal is live, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/control"&gt;claim your copy of the game for PC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdjoPp"&gt;If you haven’t played &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; before, I highly recommend picking it up. I really liked exploring the game’s spooky paranormal world, and using protagonist Jesse Faden’s psychic abilities to fling objects from the environment at enemies is a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIMqD0"&gt;Epic is offering &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale"&gt;Mega Sale&lt;/a&gt;, which also runs through June 17th. Like last year, Epic is offering its $10 Epic Coupons that are applied automatically at checkout on eligible games that cost $14.99 or more...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Hoover Dam reservoir is at an all-time low </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tourists Visit The Hoover Dam" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ChAsHArl0uxSV2BwTQkG0S7c74c=/0x0:4974x3316/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433928/1253437187.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A general view of Lake Mead, a human-made lake that lies on the Colorado River, about 24 miles southeast of the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, in the states of Nevada and Arizona, on December 21st, 2019, in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Nevada. Formed by the Hoover Dam, Lake Mead is the largest reservoir in the United States and serves water to the states of Arizona, California, and Nevada, as well as some of Mexico, providing sustenance to nearly 20 million people and large areas of farmland.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Paul Rovere / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FKF81y"&gt;Lake Mead, the reservoir created by the Hoover Dam, that feeds water to 25 million people across Western states, is historically low. On June 9th, the water level dipped to &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/hourly/levels.html"&gt;1,071.57&lt;/a&gt; feet above sea level, narrowly beating a &lt;a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2016/05/19/lake-mead-declines-new-record-low/84597120/"&gt;record low&lt;/a&gt; last set in &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/lakemead_line.pdf"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaQJpU"&gt;The lake surface has dropped 140 feet since 2000, leaving the reservoir just 37 percent full. With such a dramatic drop, officials expect to declare an official &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona-environment/2021/05/27/hoover-dam-drought-water-levels-lake-mead/5134031001/"&gt;water shortage&lt;/a&gt; for the first time ever. That could affect water and energy that Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam deliver to Arizona, California, and Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPeCDY"&gt;Water levels at Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US, are &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/24mo/2021/MAY21.pdf"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to keep dropping throughout the year. The drought tugging at the lake’s water levels is affecting other...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with true wireless earbuds. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Luckily, many of the most popular models routinely undergo a price cut, even outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;. There are often sizable discounts on the base model as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best AirPods deals available, including those on the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus updates its midrange Nord with new processor and a headphone jack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFsKI0A7E2BNkz8JgQoLdp3_6po=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433448/OnePlus_Nord_CE_5G.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord CE 5G will be available in black, blue, and silver.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OPgJcu"&gt;OnePlus has announced a new addition to its lineup of midrange phones, the Nord CE. According to the company, the “CE” stands for “Core Edition,” an indication that the company is focusing on the fundamentals, rather than inflating the device’s spec sheet with unnecessary extras. The phone is launching in Europe and India, and there are no plans for a US release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egSlyU"&gt;What this focus on the fundamentals means in practice is that the Nord CE is slightly stripped down compared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;last year’s Nord&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s slightly higher-specced than its predecessor, too. So you’re getting a higher-resolution 64-megapixel main camera (up from 48 megapixels), but there are only three rear sensors in total. (There’s also an 8-megapixel ultrawide with a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inside the cryptocurrency scam vortex</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1lpbuE"&gt;On May 22nd, a crypto finance project called DeFi100 posted a message to its website: “We scammed you guys and you can’t do shit about it. HA HA. All you moon bois have been scammed and you can’t do shit about it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qk05mT"&gt;Screenshots of the message immediately went viral on crypto Twitter (always anarchic, easily risible). A popular anonymous crypto-tracking Twitter account called Mr. Whale &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoWhale/status/1396100822245777408"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that DeFi100 had run off with $32 million. Cryptocurrency &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/people-behind-crypto-protocol-defi100-may-have-absconded-with-32m-in-investor-funds"&gt;news outlets&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/people-behind-crypto-protocol-defi100-231952405.html"&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt;, ran with the number. The project owners &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DEFI100/status/1396489770281226244"&gt;denied any foul play&lt;/a&gt;, and it soon became clear the message was a website hack rather than a serious warning — but by then, it was too late. Panic had set in, and the price of the underlying coin was in free...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Summer Game Fest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRI49d"&gt;Summer Game Fest 2021, hosted by Geoff Keighley, is getting started with new game announcements two days ahead of E3 2021 with its “Kickoff Live” event. In addition to news, it’s perhaps the only event to feature both an appearance from Jeff Goldblum and a musical performance by Weezer. The list of partners for the preview event includes 2K, Activision, Blizzard, Capcom, InnerSloth, Epic Games, Sony PlayStation, Riot Games, Square Enix, Ubisoft, Microsoft Xbox, and more. Here’s how to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Jv5JaK"&gt;When does Summer Game Fest start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HTaFNL"&gt;The kickoff show is happening this Thursday, June 10th at 2PM ET / 11AM PT / 6PM GMT. And like last year’s happenings, it’s all online, so you can just hang out at home and watch all of the announcements from your...&lt;/p&gt;
