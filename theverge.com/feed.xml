    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gOJS2X"&gt;Some 49 people accused of taking part in the January 6th riot at the US Capitol building have tried to erase images, videos, and texts from their phones and social media accounts, the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-capitol-siege-business-electoral-college-media-efe0ea1092bc11c6d3f42ea4ef752d98"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported, citing a review of court records. Authorities told the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; that the people may have realized that the many photos and videos posted to social media by people participating in the riot could be used as evidence against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRpeDM"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;AP &lt;/em&gt;cited several cases where accused rioters’ social media posts apparently contradicted what they told authorities about their involvement in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNazWQ"&gt;Hundreds of supporters of former President Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;stormed the Capitol building&lt;/a&gt; on January 6th as members of Congress prepared to certify the results of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>REvil ransomware attacks systems using Kaseya’s remote IT management software</title>

  &lt;p id="ncWJdH"&gt;Just in time to ruin the holiday weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;ransomware attackers&lt;/a&gt; have apparently used Kaseya — a software platform designed to help manage IT services remotely — to deliver their payload. Sophos director and ethical hacker Mark Loman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markloman/status/1411035534554808331"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about the attack on Friday, and reported that affected systems will demand $44,999 to be unlocked. A note on Kaseya’s website implores customers to shut off their VSA servers for now “because one of the first things the attacker does is shutoff administrative access to the VSA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APKSa0"&gt;On Saturday, Kaseya issued another update, saying that it had been advised by its outside experts that “customers who experienced ransomware and receive a communication from the attackers should not click...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dutch court rejects Facebook’s bid to have privacy lawsuit in the Netherlands dismissed</title>

  &lt;p id="D8fBQ7"&gt;A court in &lt;a href="https://linkeddata.overheid.nl/front/portal/document-viewer?ext-id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:3307"&gt;Amsterdam ruled that privacy litigation&lt;/a&gt; against Facebook in the Netherlands can proceed, rejecting the social network’s bid to have the lawsuit from two non-profit groups thrown out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2rvIF"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/dutch-court-will-hear-another-facebook-privacy-lawsuit/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, the Amsterdam-based Data Privacy Foundation and Dutch consumer advocacy organization Consumentenbond are suing Facebook on behalf of users over what they claim are violations of European Union privacy law. The lawsuit says Facebook has not provided enough details about the information it gathers from users, including what it does with the data, and therefore doesn’t have a legal basis to process the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNt9I7"&gt;Facebook tried to block the lawsuit claiming that the Amsterdam court doesn’t have jurisdiction over its...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find the documents behind big legal cases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Supreme Court 3 (Verge Stock)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lE7yPbOrRipyhKI4eLX3HBJEKs=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69537983/Supreme_Court_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pKDf0I"&gt;Earlier this year, I spent a month covering the trial for a dispute between Apple and Epic. The case was one of the biggest antitrust suits in recent memory, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;brought to light revelations&lt;/a&gt; about both companies and the larger tech industry, often in the form of legal filings. I (and other reporters) try to pick out the most relevant details from these filings for readers. But sometimes, the documents are worth checking out in their own right. A site called &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/"&gt;CourtListener&lt;/a&gt; makes that easier than it might sound — if you know how to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sTwLF"&gt;US federal court documents are supposed to be publicly available through the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system. But as somebody who frequently uses PACER, I can confirm it’s a...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ewWslG"&gt;After over a year of indoor living, people are finally able to go out and enjoy the outdoors: beaches, sports, hiking, camping, bird-watching, bicycling, picnics… you name it. We asked some of our colleagues from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; what they were planning to take with them in their outdoor escapes. Here are some of their recommendations, including outdoor tech, camera gear, rugged footwear, and gadgets that help you take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="6TO6UW"&gt;Twelve months predominantly spent indoors did wonders for my battery anxiety. Not only was I using my phone less, thanks to having constant easy access to a tablet and laptop, but even when my phone got close to running out, my trusty charger was never far out of reach. However, I know...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="CGcP7E"&gt;Scooter company Bird is partnering with mobility vehicle company Scootaround on a pilot program that will test accessible electric vehicle rentals in New York City this summer, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/bird-scootaround-offer-on-demand-accessible-mobility-cities/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;. A new button in Bird’s main app will let people with mobility issues choose one of three different models to rent, including three- and four-wheel scooters and the Whill Model Ci2 power wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYn2EW"&gt;Once the rider chooses a vehicle, they pick a rental length between one and 14 days. Riders will get an in-person tutorial the day of their rental to ensure they’re comfortable using, charging, and storing the vehicle. Bird has a toll-free number for questions about the process. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s Boring Company pitches underground transit loop to Fort Lauderdale</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ROtoYc"&gt;The Boring Company, Elon Musk’s tunneling venture, pitched an underground transit system to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the town’s mayor said in a tweet. It’s the latest city to become transfixed by Musk’s quixotic “Tesla in a tunnel” concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoPnEx"&gt;It’s not a done deal, but Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis called it “an innovative and unprecedented approach to addressing traffic congestion and transit needs.” Trantalis said the project, which would be called the “Las Ollas Loop,” would connect Fort Lauderdale’s downtown to the beach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Qh5FHB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Fort Lauderdale has received a proposal from Elon Musk's The Boring Co. to build an underground transit loop between downtown and the beach. Called “The Las Olas Loop,” this represents an innovative and...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;California Highway Patrol&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Z9ZDi"&gt;A California Highway Patrol officer stopped a Toyota Prius on Friday that had what looks like a Starlink dish fastened to its hood, the agency said in a Facebook post. The “visual obstruction,” sitting right smack in the middle of the car’s hood, landed the driver a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnTvb4"&gt;“Sir I stopped you today for that visual obstruction on your hood. Does it not block your view while driving?” an officer said, quoted in a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/CHPAntelopeValley/posts/4704883919562997"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on CHP Antelope Valley’s Facebook page. The driver replied: “Only when I make right turns...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3r0DQg"&gt;The driver told the CHP officer that they were using the antenna to have Wi-Fi for a business they run out of their car, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/chp-tickets-driver-with-apparent-spacex-starlink-dish-on-hood.html"&gt;told CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, which first reported on the traffic stop. &lt;/p&gt;
