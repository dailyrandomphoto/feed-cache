    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QdWdaR"&gt;The union representing thousands of film and television production workers has reached a tentative agreement with studios, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711567/iatse-strike-authorization-negotiations-resume-streaming-pay"&gt;averting an strike&lt;/a&gt; that was set to begin Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSHoK1"&gt;The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) had been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents major production studios like Netflix, Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, and Disney. IATSE sought improved working conditions, including weekend rest periods and higher pay scales on streaming shows for its members, who work in many behind-the-scenes roles in Hollywood, such as broadcast technicians, animators, and makeup artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQTTc5"&gt;The new three-year deal, which still has to be ratified by members,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s October ‘Unleashed’ event: what to expect</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="dNYIIT"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;announced an event for October 18th&lt;/a&gt;, with a video containing the title “Unleashed.” If you’ve been watching the rumor mill, it won’t come as a surprise — the company still has a lot of products that are expected to come out this year but haven’t shown up in an Apple keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGTo0P"&gt;Chief among those are new, more powerful MacBook Pros, which will follow the incredible Apple Silicon-powered 13-inch MacBook Pro that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;launched last November&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also expected to release new AirPods, and it’s got an entire OS that was announced but hasn’t shipped. Read on for a deep dive into the rumors surrounding these products and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8GOXLV"&gt;Redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JOdB06"&gt;Most of the rumors about the event concern redesigned MacBook Pros, which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;e...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russian spacecraft returns to Earth with movie crew aboard</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Actress Yulia Peresild was part of a film crew that went to the International Space Station to film scenes for a movie. She returned to Earth Sunday along with Klim Shipenko and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky. | Photo by Sergei Savostyanov\TASS via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4ekvAx"&gt;A Russian actress and director-producer who spent 12 days aboard the International Space Station returned to Earth early Sunday along with cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy who had been in space for 191 days. Actress Yulia Peresild and director-producer Klim Shipenko &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709501/russia-soyuz-launch-actress-producer-filming-movie-space-station"&gt;went up to the ISS on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, to film scenes for the upcoming movie &lt;em&gt;The Challenge,&lt;/em&gt; about a Russian doctor, played by Peresild, who travels to the space station to treat a sick cosmonaut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nwJJG"&gt;The three were aboard the Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft, which landed at 12:35AM ET in rural Kazakhstan, and will return to Russia later Sunday.    Novitskiy arrived at the ISS on April 9th for his third mission, and has now spent a total of &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2021/10/17/russian-station-veteran-filmmakers-back-on-earth/"&gt;531 days in space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The biggest announcements from DC FanDome</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W-yA-vsO2n9FtMjlAkaBfkrGw4g=/191x0:1679x992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70005058/black_adam.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Black Adam was one of the trailers on display at DC FanDome Saturday | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/TheRock/status/1449422941142196224?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;DC/WarnerBros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hn0LmM"&gt;DC Comics and Warner Bros. held their second annual Fandome on Saturday, revealing new trailers for movies and shows coming up, including &lt;em&gt;The Batman, The Flash&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Black Adam&lt;/em&gt;. We also got a look at the story trailer for the&lt;em&gt; Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&lt;/em&gt; game. Here’s a look at some of the biggest news that dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mZVhDm"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="ZX4OUb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9u9UJx"&gt;The Batman shows off Robert Pattinson’s gritty hero&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HaEUem"&gt;We got a second trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;, at last (and FanDome saved the reveal for the very end of the day). We’re not even sure if he thinks he &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a hero, but Pattison’s Batman is definitely Going Through Some Stuff. We didn’t learn a heck of a lot more about the characters in Matt Reeves’ interpretation of the Dark Knight’s saga. But the trailer showed off a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest trailer for The Batman sees Robert Pattinson’s Dark Knight face off against the Riddler </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="amz8gB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; debuted a brand new trailer at DC FanDome on Saturday, showing off the best look yet at Robert Pattinson’s take on the Dark Knight and promising an even darker, grittier version of Gotham’s Caped Crusader than any that have hit film before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14Lqlu"&gt;Set just a few years in Batman’s career as a superhero, &lt;em&gt;The Batman &lt;/em&gt;promises to show not just a look at the early days of Batman but numerous other proto-villains and allies, including Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman, Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon, Andy Serkis as Alfred, and Colin Farrell as The Penguin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPEvxs"&gt;The new trailer also gives the first real look at Paul Dano’s take on the iconic Batman villain the Riddler, who appears to be going for a far creepier, serial killer-esque style version of the...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjLtmn"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/instacart-shoppers-announce-walk-off-3db7f7208ef3"&gt;Instacart shoppers are striking&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, to protest the company’s pay structure and failure to communicate directly with workers.  The Gig Workers Collective (GWC), which represent some of the company’s shoppers, want the Instacart to address five of its policies. The group is calling for Instacart to pay shoppers by order instead of by batch, reintroduce its item commissions, fix fraud issues with its rating system, provide occupational death benefits, and raise the default tip for shoppers on the platform from 5 percent to 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kNzXR"&gt;The group said the company ignored its demands, which led to the decision to walk off the job on Saturday. “Instacart has refused to finally address these fixes that workers have been begging...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Analogue’s Pocket will have an extremely fancy OS to save games to and from cartridges</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zwqIcZ"&gt;There’s still no firm release date for the delayed Analogue Pocket (outside of the broader “December 2021” window that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667465/analogue-pocket-preorders-delay-december-2021"&gt;last provided in September&lt;/a&gt;), but Analogue is looking to whet players’ appetites with the next best thing: a deep look at AnalogueOS, the new custom software that will power the Pocket whenever it does actually arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AG2vK"&gt;As one might expect for a retro gaming device, AnalogueOS features a minimal, pixel-art style design that’s meant to get you into games as easily as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>International Space Station tilted after thrusters on a Russian craft fired unexpectedly</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The International Space Station | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nnO0JZ"&gt;The International Space Station was unexpectedly tilted on Friday after a test firing of thrusters on Russia’s Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft continued longer than expected. First reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/science/international-space-station-russia.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the personnel aboard the ISS were never in danger according to a &lt;a href="http://en.roscosmos.ru/22425/"&gt;statement from Russia’s Roscosmos&lt;/a&gt; space agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDlCRO"&gt;Ground teams for NASA and Roscosmos were able to regain control of the station about 30 minutes after it lost positioning control at 5:13AM ET. But it’s the second such incident aboard the ISS within the past year, and it occurred with a craft that is supposed to return to Earth early Sunday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vGMcL"&gt;The incident started when cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky was testing the engines aboard the Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft, which is docked...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="uUNI6p"&gt;On October 14th, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727123/apple-fires-leader-apple-too-movement"&gt;fired a leader of the #AppleToo movement&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly failing to comply with an internal investigation. The employee, Janneke Parrish, has been working behind the scenes for months to organize fellow employees who’ve faced harassment and discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mujZpQ"&gt;Now, Apple appears to be cracking down on those efforts — under the guise of trying to stop internal information from leaking to the press. In September, Apple fired Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly violating her confidentiality agreement. Then, it placed software engineer Cher Scarlett on medical leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQWGW4"&gt;Both Gjøvik and Scarlett have filed claims with the NLRB. Parrish’s lawyer, Vincent P. White of White, Hilferty and Albanese, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Parrish plans to...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="stjlW6"&gt;The White House announced Friday that the US is reopening its land and air borders to vaccinated foreign nationals on November 8th. State Department spokesman Ned Price said at a press briefing that details will be available ahead of November 8th for airline passengers and people arriving at US land borders for what they’ll need to show full proof of vaccination against COVID-19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlKs6h"&gt;As part of pandemic restrictions, non-essential travelers from more than 30 countries had been barred from entering the US since March 2020. This latest news comes as the White House announced Tuesday that the US was ending restrictions at the borders and ferry crossings with Mexico and Canada for foreign nationals vaccinated against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
