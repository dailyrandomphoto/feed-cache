    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yOViUs"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has approved genetically engineered pigs for use in food and medical products. The pigs, developed by medical company Revivicor, could be used in the production of drugs, to provide organs and tissues for transplants, and to produce meat that’s safe to eat for people with meat allergies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rT4yX"&gt;“Today’s first-ever approval of an animal biotechnology product for both food and as a potential source for biomedical use represents a tremendous milestone for scientific innovation,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-intentional-genomic-alteration-line-domestic-pigs-both-human-food"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uz6qT"&gt;The pigs are called GalSafe pigs because they lack a molecule called alpha-gal sugar, which can trigger allergic reactions. Alpha-gal sugar is found in many mammals, but not usually...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google discontinues the Google Home Max </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F3D1fk"&gt;Google is no longer manufacturing the Google Home Max, its smart speaker designed with high-quality sound in mind, and it has sold out of the product on the Google Store, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. And indeed, if you check the Google Home Max page &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/google_home_max"&gt;on the Google Store&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see that the white and black models are listed as out of stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOhs3q"&gt;Even though Google is discontinuing the Google Home Max, the company still plans to support it with software updates and security fixes. “Existing Google Home Max users shouldn’t worry as they won’t see any change in their service,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “We’ll continue to offer software updates and security fixes to Google Home Max devices. We’re committed to delivering great...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest settles gender discrimination lawsuit brought by former COO</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N3dVUU"&gt;Pinterest is &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1506293/000150629320000291/pins-20201214.htm"&gt;settling a gender discrimination lawsuit brought by former COO Françoise Brougher&lt;/a&gt; for $22.5 million. Pinterest and Brougher will also jointly contribute $2.5 million to philanthropies supporting women and underrepresented minorities in the tech industry. The remaining amount will be paid to Brougher and her attorneys. News of the agreement was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Hyrb7"&gt;The settlement is one of the largest in a publicly announced, individual gender discrimination lawsuit. Brougher’s lawyer told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that while private agreements can be bigger, they don’t hold companies accountable in the same way. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google pushes return to office to September and will test flexible work week</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HCPruE"&gt;Google has pushed back its return to the office until September, and will experiment with a hybrid model allowing some employees to work from home part of the week, the company said. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/google-delays-return-to-office-and-eyes-flexible-work-week.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Google CEO Sundar Pichai emailed employees Sunday about plans to test a flexible work week once conditions are safe for people to return. Google employees would work three days in the office and the rest of the week at home under the new plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeUpzt"&gt;Pichai said the company is testing whether such a model would lead to greater productivity and employee well-being. “No company at our scale has ever created a fully hybrid work force model — though a few are starting to test it — so it will be interesting to try,” Pichai wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43NPnw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/14/google-ceo-email-delays-return-to-sept-2021-no-permanent-remote-work.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_content=Tech&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1607976163"&gt;A...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber fined $59 million for dodging questions about sexual assaults</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EfNE6aIeei3CYmxhy3nvs_MEABY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512756/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QJe06T"&gt;Uber has 30 days to pay a $59 million fine to California’s Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for failing to answer the regulator’s questions about a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;damning safety report&lt;/a&gt; released by the company in December 2019. If Uber doesn’t pay up &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;answer the outstanding questions, CPUC could suspend the company’s license to operate in the state, an &lt;a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M354/K636/354636771.PDF"&gt;administrative law judge ruled on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yc8ov0"&gt;It’s the latest development in Uber’s long history of trouble with violence and assault between its drivers and passengers — trouble that competitor Lyft shares, too. News of the fine was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/California-to-Uber-Pay-59-million-and-give-data-15801080.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hLPHRr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Regulators want to know more about Uber’s own damning safety report, released in 2019&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHHRZw"&gt;The report, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;Uber itself called...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney World is going to stop photoshopping masks onto people</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SgOYS"&gt;Today in stories that make you go “Wait, &lt;em&gt;what?&lt;/em&gt;”, &lt;a href="https://wdwnt.com/2020/12/update-walt-disney-world-no-longer-placing-digital-face-masks-over-maskless-guests-in-on-ride-photos-statement-issued/"&gt;Disney World is going to stop digitally adding masks&lt;/a&gt; to people who don’t have them in their on-ride pictures, according to a report from &lt;em&gt;WDW News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lT0y7W"&gt;Even if you’ve never been to a theme park, you’ve probably seen these kinds of photos: people on a roller coaster screaming or reacting in some funny way to whatever’s happening, captured by a camera built into the ride and sold at some crazy price. In the age of COVID-19, however, Disney has had to adapt to how it handles these pictures. For example, previously, if someone wasn’t wearing a mask on the ride, &lt;a href="https://wdwnt.com/2020/07/guests-not-wearing-face-masks-on-attractions-will-not-receive-in-ride-photo-at-walt-disney-world/"&gt;neither they nor anybody else in the picture&lt;/a&gt; would be able to download it in the Disney app or get it printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iutd5Z"&gt;It’s understandable...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook launches its Collab music app to the public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Facebook Collab logo next to a smartphone showing a screenshot of the Collab interface." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gqPy438PDczMoiCXhZ8HY3T43qk=/0x15:768x527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512379/Screen_Shot_2020_12_14_at_10.00.57_AM_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iaB9TH"&gt;Facebook has publicly launched Collab, an experimental music-making app that first launched as an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21270640/facebook-collab-npe-invite-only-beta-release-music-making-app"&gt;invite-only beta&lt;/a&gt; back in May, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/facebook-publicly-launches-its-collaborative-music-video-app-collab/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jTqAn"&gt;The app allows users to create short-form music videos by combining up to three independent videos. So, for example, three musicians could each play a different part of a song and combine them into one video. But each video that’s created is also posted to a public “Collab” feed, where people can view and play along with it if they choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FeEiI"&gt;So you could also record one part, then mix it with two other parts you find on the Collab feed that other people have recorded. Or you can just mix other people’s videos together — you don’t need to be a musician yourself. (Every user is properly...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 leak shows off the upcoming 2021 flagship in photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OnePlus 9" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ewUM02R_Z9tORzE39Ylx8ymVTIk=/0x1:1874x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512324/oneplus_9_leaked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images of a prototype device confirm some previously leaked spec. | Photo: PhoneArena&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vov8Sx"&gt;The OnePlus 9 likely won’t arrive until spring 2021, but thanks to some &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/oneplus-9-5g-hands-on-specs-leak-exclusive_id129026"&gt;photos published by &lt;em&gt;PhoneArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;we won’t have to wait that long for a glimpse of it. The images are of an alleged prototype device complete with unique pre-prod branding, and some software screengrabs reveal a little extra detail about the upcoming flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zG6KWK"&gt;First up: the screen. It looks like OnePlus will stick with the flat screen format it used in the OnePlus 8 and 8T – the 9 has a flat 6.55-inch display with a hole punch camera in the upper left corner. The OnePlus 8 Pro’s screen features a design that curves around the edges of the phone, which we found lead to more accidental touches than occurred with the flat version. &lt;em&gt;PhoneArena &lt;/em&gt;reports that the 9’s screen is...&lt;/p&gt;
