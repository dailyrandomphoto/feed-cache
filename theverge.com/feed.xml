    <title>Google still ran ads on climate denial, despite promising to stop </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Z5FjQ"&gt;Google has struggled to uphold its recent &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321"&gt;pledge&lt;/a&gt; to stop running ads on content that promotes climate change denial, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.counterhate.com/post/google-ads-still-serving-climate-change-deniers"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T49mE6"&gt;The new research identified 50 articles that include lies about climate change and that still featured Google ads after the date that Google said they would be banned. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715102/google-youtube-climate-change-deniers-ads-monetization"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; in October that prohibits “ads for, and monetization of, content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change.” The new policy was supposed to kick in for Google advertisers, publishers, and YouTube creators on &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/publisherpolicies/answer/10852414?hl=en-GB"&gt;November 9th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles are available at Target (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/npvAfNtlaJPFSveh-zpJlohFcIU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70280624/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zg3za0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8:30AM ET, December 16th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Target has sold out of consoles for now. This one went fast, but we hope you had some luck on your side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wg1Wx"&gt;Look, nobody is happy about the current state of new consoles and their availability. While the hunt for a good deal is something we’re all about, having to search just to find a normal, full-price product is a whole lot less fun. That’s why we are always doing our best to help you score a new console whenever the chance arises, and today is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTEqZK"&gt;Target’s online listings for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have just gone live, which means there is a narrow window to order one this morning. The &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;subid1=vergeps5restock"&gt;PlayStation 5 is available in the standard $499.99&lt;/a&gt; flavor with a disc drive as well as the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596&amp;amp;subid1=vergeps5restock"&gt;D...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s P50 Pocket is a stylish clamshell foldable launching this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6aRiNRkhbtH8SI2cHbl8CHI_Vk=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70280496/001RBNXygy1gxfadt3cfyj61hc0u07ee02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P50 Pocket appears to have a small external circular screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0qbOuv"&gt;Huawei is set to announce a new foldable phone later this month called the Huawei P50 Pocket, according to a post on the company’s &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4714230723379666"&gt;official Weibo account&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike its previous Mate X foldables, which fold from a device the size of a tablet into a smartphone, the P50 Pocket has a clamshell design that folds out to the size of a smartphone. It’s a similar design to Samsung’s Z Flip devices, or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;Motorola Razr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seNxZo"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/em&gt; photoshoot of the P50 Pocket &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/L6h3qlP5V"&gt;posted on Weibo&lt;/a&gt; makes it look like a stylish little foldable. It appears to have a similar dual-ring camera bump to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598135/huawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras"&gt;Huawei P50&lt;/a&gt;, but its lower ring has been repurposed to work as a small external screen, which appears to be able to show notifications or work as a camera...&lt;/p&gt;

It’s also getting a few new features to make sending and receiving items easier for customers and drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxpvuo"&gt;Uber Connect is now available in 6,000 cities and towns in the US, including major markets like New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego. The service was initially launched in April 2020 as a means to diversify Uber’s business during the early months of the pandemic. Since then, the company has seen incredible growth in Uber Connect, registering a 200 percent increase in trips since the first week of January 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford launches new EV charging project to help commercial customers go electric </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ISXyAN"&gt;Ford is launching a new project to help its commercial customers switch to electric vehicles by selling them EV charging installation equipment and software management tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX1gq6"&gt;The automaker says it expects to sell over 300,000 electric vehicles to businesses and government agencies over the next decade. To help ease the transition, Ford is launching a new project, called Ford Pro Charging, to offer the necessary software and hardware to aid in the charging of their electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVRWaF"&gt;Ford’s commercial vehicles will come with the automaker’s telematics software, which makes it easier for fleet owners to keep tabs on the location, charging status, or the health of their vehicles. This software will help commercial fleet operators figure...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok tests PC game streaming app that could let it take on Twitch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDFW190i498zt3gQ6suyqNOCzD4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70280363/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="otLJyf"&gt;TikTok is testing a new piece of desktop streaming software called TikTok Live Studio that lets users broadcast live footage from games and other desktop applications, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/tiktok-is-testing-a-desktop-streaming-software-called-tiktok-live-studio/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The software is currently being tested with a small number of users across some Western markets, TikTok says, but its &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:IcX8L3AB2AIJ:https://www.tiktok.com/studio/download+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=uk"&gt;official page on TikTok’s site&lt;/a&gt; appears to have been taken down as of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEh4gD"&gt;If released, TikTok Live Studio could mark an interesting change for TikTok’s live streaming strategy. Rather than being focused on users streaming directly from mobile devices, it could expand TikTok Live’s focus to include game streaming, bringing it into competition with the likes of Twitch, YouTube Gaming, and Facebook Gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="UZRV2I"&gt;Adidas is getting into the NFT game. The apparel company is launching a line of NFTs on Friday, called &lt;em&gt;Into the Metaverse&lt;/em&gt;, which will offer buyers access to what’s essentially a very exclusive fan club. NFT holders will be able to purchase special merch drops, and Adidas says members will help to shape what kinds of products and experiences the company puts together for its NFT-owning community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74zuXy"&gt;“Adidas is in the metaverse,” Tareq Nazlawy, Adidas’ senior director of digital growth, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We want to figure out what would be the dopest thing to do in that space and start involving the communities we’re activating through this [NFT] in how we should manifest in the virtual world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNy6gF"&gt;The launch comes after a couple weeks of crypto...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt will pay just $1.85 million in proposed class-action settlement</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fMUBSy"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824847/cd-projekt-red-settle-class-action-lawsuit-cyberpunk-2077-launch"&gt;we reported&lt;/a&gt; that game developer CD Projekt was negotiating to settle a class-action lawsuit over the infamously botched launch of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, a game that came riddled with bugs and poor enough performance on consoles that Sony pulled it from the PlayStation Store and many storefronts offered refunds. CD Projekt says those negotiations are now concluded, and here’s how much it’s agreed to pay: $1,850,000 USD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNVM2S"&gt;While the settlement will likely have to be approved by a court, it sounds like the lead plaintiffs and their lawyers negotiated for a fairly tiny sum here in exchange for “relinquish[ing] any and all claims against the Company and members of its Management Board.” That’s when you consider that the game had a...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="kupS3d"&gt;A ransomware attack is disrupting operations at many major companies, and some workers are concerned that it could affect their last paychecks before the holidays — because their payroll provider, Kronos, is the one that’s dealing with the ransom. The incident has left entire cities and states trying to come up with a plan to get paychecks out to their workers, and could affect HR operations at organizations like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/13/mta-timekeeping-system-goes-dark-after-ransomware-attack/"&gt;New York City’s Metro Transit Authority&lt;/a&gt;, Honda, GameStop, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4Oe3d"&gt;One Whole Foods worker &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/ransomware-attack-threatens-paychecks-just-christmas-rcna8795"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that there’s “a real fear about our paychecks this upcoming Friday,” saying that employees had been to to use “a paper punch sheet to keep track of our hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
