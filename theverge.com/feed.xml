    <title>Epic is giving away 15 free games during its holiday sale, and the first is Shenmue III</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lWtnNjlmR5Fx0OGa0mCdQoL4q5A=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283311/epic_games_store_holiday_sale_15_days_of_free_games_day_1_shenmue_3_1920x1080_695145bd5ec8.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HbubWI"&gt;Epic Games’ annual holiday sale is &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/massive-discounts-and-limitless-10-off-coupons-hit-the-epic-games-store"&gt;now live&lt;/a&gt;, and in addition to offering some nice discounts on many titles, the company will also be giving away 15 free games. Epic is also bringing back the Epic Coupon, which gives you $10 off games that cost more than $14.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAdbHD"&gt;The first freebie is &lt;em&gt;Shenmue III&lt;/em&gt;, which began life as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/16/8788395/shenmue-3-kickstarter-funded-release-date"&gt;hugely popular Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;. The company hasn’t said what games are next, and Epic spokesperson Nick Chester declined to comment on what games are coming down the pike — you’ll have to check the store every day to see what Epic is offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SPY0jN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Epic Coupon is a good deal, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lERu6F"&gt;While you’re browsing the store, you’ll want to keep the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/massive-discounts-and-limitless-10-off-coupons-hit-the-epic-games-store"&gt;Epic Coupon in mind&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Comcast delays new data caps for at least another year, which is weird because it should be forever</title>

But after taking well-deserved flak for attempting to bilk customers in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Comcast delayed them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264430/comcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills"&gt;once&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291469/comcast-delays-northeast-data-cap-rollout-2022"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;, and now a third time — now they won’t arrive until 2023 at the earliest, &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/cable-tech/comcast-will-keep-data-caps-out-of-the-northeast-in-2022/d/d-id/774117"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light Reading &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joTtsb"&gt;“We don’t have plans to implement our data usage plan in our Northeast markets in 2022 at this time,” a Comcast spokesperson told the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ep8n5h"&gt;Does that mean the planned 1.2TB data cap for those states is gone for good, or is Comcast simply biding its time? Hard to say. Technically, “We don’t have plans...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian will build a second, $5 billion EV plant in Georgia</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZoFg65"&gt;Amazon-backed EV startup Rivian is going to build a second factory in Georgia where it will assemble up to 400,000 electric vehicles per year. The company &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521359139/d236890dex992.htm"&gt;made the announcement on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; alongside state representatives after months of speculation over where it would look to expand its manufacturing footprint. Rivian will start construction of the $5 billion facility in the summer of 2022 and expects to start making vehicles there in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsqZEZ"&gt;Rivian is already building its first electric pickup trucks at a former Mitsubishi factory in Normal, Illinois. But the company is getting ready to start building its electric SUV and is committed to producing 100,000 custom delivery vans for Amazon, so it has been searching for a place to create a...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K2Jjes"&gt;Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff is stepping down for health reasons, and the six-year-old company and its products will be folded into Google, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/my-next-chapter-fighting-als-207ce7ca69c8"&gt;he wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. Doctoroff says he’s been diagnosed with what may be ALS and wants to spend more time with his family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3D5sWX"&gt;“Starting next year, Sidewalk products Pebble, Mesa, Delve, and Affordable Electrification will join Google, becoming core to Google’s urban sustainability product efforts,” Doctoroff wrote in the post. “These products will continue to be led by Sidewalk Labs President of Urban Products Prem Ramaswami and Chief Technology Officer Craig Nevill-Manning, both Google alumni, and the teams will continue to execute on their vision and serve customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop is selling PlayStation 5 console bundles in-store on December 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dNavx3OJfdavVFpChqU7EzA-Ad0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282982/vpavic_4278_20201030_0041.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MIOH2S"&gt;GameStop has announced &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a special in-store sales event&lt;/a&gt; for the hard-to-get Sony PlayStation 5 console, taking place on December 17th. The restock event requires &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergegamestopinstoreps5&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a subscription to GameStop’s Pro membership&lt;/a&gt; — which normally runs $14.99 per year but is currently discounted to $9.99 once added to your cart. GameStop &lt;a href="https://gamestop.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/12-17_PS5Event_StoreList"&gt;lists all its participating retail locations&lt;/a&gt; on its site, which spans over 700 stores across the US. While this event is being hosted at many locations, GameStop has indicated that quantities will be limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36Dqxf"&gt;Despite launching over one year ago, Sony’s PlayStation 5 is still very difficult to buy. If you have been struggling to luck out on recent online console restocks from GameStop, Best Buy, Walmart, or other vendors, this may...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta adds sign language interpreters for Portal video calls</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Portal now offers sign language interpreters | Meta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbshGz"&gt;Facebook parent company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/video-relay-services-on-meta-portal/"&gt;Meta is adding video relay services&lt;/a&gt; (VRS) to its Portal video calling devices, allowing users to bring English or Spanish sign language interpreters into video conversations. The new feature is part of a collaboration with ZP Better Together, a tech firm that makes communication solutions for Deaf and hard-of-hearing users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Hm4pq"&gt;Meta spokesperson Lisa Auslen explained in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that users will need to apply for a ZP account to confirm they’re eligible for the service, which is federally funded under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Both the service and the Portal devices are free for those who qualify; they must be VRS users in the US who communicate using ASL.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As promised, Nokia phones started getting Android 12 this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6Ury3w_zy1QZ2X2zQVU4y49ZSc=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282874/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia X20 is HMD Global’s first device to get Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mZCT2X"&gt;HMD Global offered its first Android 12 update this week, starting with the midrange Nokia X20. The company says &lt;a href="https://community.phones.nokia.com/discussion/64559/android-12-on-nokia-x20"&gt;users in this first wave&lt;/a&gt; will receive the update by December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQvmdb"&gt;Good. That’s what HMD said it would do, and it’s doing just that. We love to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfq1o7"&gt;You’re forgiven if you forgot that the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_int%2Fnokia-x-20&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22839883%2Fnokia-x20-android-12-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia X20&lt;/a&gt; exists — it’s a mostly unremarkable device with a 6.67-inch 60Hz display, Snapdragon 480 processor, and four rear-facing cameras. In fact, its most compelling features might just be its healthy support policy (three years of OS updates) and an unusually generous three-year warranty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E0TWvj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Generally speaking, the Android 12 rollout has been a rocky one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kV0pax"&gt;That’s a great policy in theory — as my colleague Jon Porter pointed out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;his...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Treasury claims DJI assists Chinese surveillance of Uyghurs and blocks investments</title>

  &lt;p id="7kWKAX"&gt;DJI is one of the biggest drone companies in the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;last year, the US government added it to the Department of Commerce’s Entity List&lt;/a&gt;, which marked it as a national security concern and banned US-based companies from exporting technology to it. &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20211216"&gt;Today, the Treasury Department placed further sanctions on DJI&lt;/a&gt;, including it as one of eight Chinese companies added to the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies (NS-CMIC) List.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KK1X7U"&gt;Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified eight Chinese technology firms pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13959, as amended by E.O. 14032. These eight entities actively support the biometric surveillance and tracking of ethnic and...&lt;/p&gt;

Spotify says some radio broadcasters, like the Australian Radio Network, already rely on its podcast hosting platform Megaphone, and this Whooshkaa radio technology will be integrated into it. The selling price was not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMjdu7"&gt;Radio networks will be able to prepare shows for publishing by capturing live broadcasts and using the Whooshkaa tech to edit and remove ads to make room for podcast-only spots.

  &lt;p id="PEdX6I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3:25PM ET, December 16th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy has sold out of consoles for now.

&lt;p id="u4bhQA"&gt;If you’re currently shopping for a PlayStation 5 console and have been recently striking out with restocks at Walmart, Costco, and other retailers, you have another chance right now at Best Buy.
