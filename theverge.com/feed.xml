    <title>How to run a battery life report on your Windows laptop</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLEqZP"&gt;When my editor told me about Window’s built-in battery report, my first thought was: “How have I never heard of this before? Also, that sounds pretty useful!” So I looked at the guide he sent (&lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/generate-battery-report-windows-10"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Laptop Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and tried it out. It ended up being just as interesting as it sounded, so I figured I’d share, in case you also haven't come across this handy built-in tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vVa2I"&gt;Windows has been keeping track of how your laptop’s battery is doing since it was installed. The report, which you can run using just two command prompt commands, will show how many cycles you’ve used on your battery and how it’s been used in the past three days. It will also give you a picture of what Windows estimates your battery life &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;be versus what it actually...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s a first look at Mark Cuban’s podcasting platform Fireside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zHd2Py"&gt;Last month, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272148/mark-cuban-fireside-podcast-app-launch-creator-conversations"&gt;broke news&lt;/a&gt; of Mark Cuban and Falon Fatemi’s new app Fireside, which promises to deliver a “next-gen podcast platform,” and today, we can provide a better sense of the app’s functionality and interface. It’s currently in beta on iOS with a limited number of testers, most of whom appear to work in venture capital or as podcasters. However, their chats are visible to anyone, even non-users, through a browser, and from this desktop view, as well as screenshots of the app that &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has viewed, we can get a sense of what Fireside is trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMx8P5"&gt;Broadly, the app is best described as a hybrid between Spotify’s Anchor software and Clubhouse. Although it prioritizes live conversation, like Clubhouse, it tries to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford recalls some of the first Mustang Mach-E SUVs due to loose bolts</title>

  &lt;p id="5s3l7t"&gt;Ford is &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/03/05/ford-motor-company-to-address-subframe-bolt-issue.html"&gt;recalling&lt;/a&gt; dozens of the first Mustang Mach-E deliveries after it discovered loose bolts during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;the quality checks that are holding up shipments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5FRj4"&gt;“[S]ome vehicles may have subframe bolts that the supplier did not tighten to specification,” Ford wrote Friday afternoon. “While the issue in affected vehicles is not to Ford’s standards, the company is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1htERf"&gt;Ford says 1,258 Mustang Mach-Es are affected in the US, as well as 90 in Canada, but that the overwhelming majority of those have not been shipped to customers yet. “Fewer than 75 customers who have already taken delivery” will have to bring their Mustang Mach-E in to get fixed, according to the company. Ford says it...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube has terminated five Myanmar military-run channels as political unrest continues</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="70Efte"&gt;YouTube terminated five Myanmar military channels from its platform on Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-youtube/youtube-removes-five-myanmar-tv-channels-from-platform-idUSKBN2AX0BQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The removals include YouTube channels for the government-run Myanma Radio and Television (MRTV) network and the military-owned Myawaddy Media used to spread military propaganda in Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kkn82D"&gt;YouTube’s action is the platform’s first major intervention following &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22260076/myanmar-coup-military-suu-kyi-explain"&gt;the military coup that was staged in February&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent military crackdowns against protesters that have left &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/myanmar-military-coup-deaths/2021/03/03/076de674-7c85-11eb-8c5e-32e47b42b51b_story.html"&gt;at least 38 dead&lt;/a&gt;. “We have terminated a number of channels and removed several videos from YouTube in accordance with our community guidelines and applicable laws,” a YouTube spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Prior to the coup, the company also terminated 34 channels used as...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Silicon Valley school is using virtual escape rooms to evaluate prospective students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Six small dolls stand in a circle around a globe." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emXxfp2ukbnKiasU3kFFdK5fNAs=/743x180:1921x965/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68919154/TAPISW__00.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The logo on the escape room’s opening screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Paruzal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7mo6f6"&gt;Applying to an elite middle school sounds like a stressful experience, and I’m sure COVID-19 doesn’t help. With things like open houses, campus tours, and in-person interviews off the table, applicants have fewer chances to experience their prospective schools — and admissions offices have fewer chances to meet their prospective students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZaB7p"&gt;One San Jose private school has come up with a unique solution: The Harker School, &lt;a href="https://www.harker.org/about"&gt;self-described&lt;/a&gt; as “one of the nation’s top college prep schools,” is putting teams of sixth grade applicants through a virtual escape room. Over a Zoom call, the 11-year-olds work together to solve a series of Harker-themed puzzles, and admissions officers observe their behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AW0GU4"&gt;Harker let me go through the game...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lo-fi remixes of video game music is my new favorite genre</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVAez45sPQuDyJzu9E9CvgQgULc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68918894/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_9.46.41_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rifti Beats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Frxvc"&gt;I don’t usually work with any music — it often distracts me — but recently, when I’ve needed a little music on in the background, I’ve become obsessed with lo-fi remixes of video game music on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7sIti"&gt;I’ve already gone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21373558/music-video-ebooks-tv-favorites-work-from-home"&gt;on record&lt;/a&gt; that I sometimes listen to video game music while working because a) I’m a huge nerd, and b) a lot of video game music is already designed to be pleasant background noise that can loop endlessly without becoming annoying. It wouldn’t be all that much fun spending hours upon hours in the worlds of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;if the music was always in-your-face and distracting, after all. (I will give &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/aEezCi7ucf4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Ruby &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Sapphire&lt;/em&gt;’s hilariously prominent horns&lt;/a&gt; a pass here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giREIB"&gt;It makes sense, then, that the infinitely listenable quality of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hades almost starred its worst character</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hGjsAXtMpVxdkX3MVVNcQnPZ_z0=/643x0:4693x2700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68918865/Mood_Zagreus_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concept art for Hades’ hero Zagreus, courtesy of Supergiant Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jWI865"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, the legendary Greek hero who killed the Minotaur, Theseus, is a pain in the ass. He’s a bossfight, a blowhard who treats each encounter like an overproduced wrestling match. Zagreus, the cool, collected prince of the Underworld, may have good reason to want to leave, but in Theseus’ eyes, he’ll never amount to more than hellspawn. This dynamic helped highlight just what made Zagreus, &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;’ protagonist, a fan-favorite. But in early versions of the game, Theseus’ role was reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89E1Ka"&gt;Theseus is hero material in legend only, a sentiment that developer Supergiant Games eventually came to share. During a recent talk on Clubhouse, Supergiant co-founder Amir Rao said that early concepts for &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; starred Theseus. It was creative...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus is a powerful nostalgia machine, but it doesn’t feel necessary yet</title>

Outside of that, Paramount Plus is a bit of a head-scratcher. There certainly seems to be a bunch to choose from, but with missing seasons, incomplete film collections, and no immediate “must watch” TV or movie options, the question is still why would anyone sign up for this right now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNYdyB"&gt;The good thing is that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300993/paramount-plus-streaming-wars-netflix-disney-launch-date-price"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;’ positives are hard to deny, but most of those positives fall on the TV side. As someone in their late 20s who grew up on a hearty breakfast of Nickelodeon shows, MTV reality series, and crime procedurals, Paramount Plus has everything I would have...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John McAfee charged with securities fraud for ‘pump and dump’ cryptocurrency scheme</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iv7bld"&gt;John McAfee has been charged with securities fraud over a “pump and dump” cryptocurrency scheme. Federal prosecutors &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.555476/gov.uscourts.nysd.555476.1.0.pdf"&gt;unsealed a case&lt;/a&gt; against McAfee and his executive advisor and bodyguard Jimmy Gale Watson Jr., &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/john-david-mcafee-and-executive-adviser-his-cryptocurrency-team-indicted-manhattan"&gt;claiming the pair&lt;/a&gt; earned nearly $2 million by urging Twitter followers to invest in cryptocurrencies like Reddcoin and Dogecoin, then selling off their own holdings as the price rose.&lt;/p&gt;
