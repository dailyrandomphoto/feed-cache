  &lt;p id="PvCD0L"&gt;Best Buy was one of the first retailers to launch Black Friday deals — all the way back in mid-October to go up against Amazon Prime Day. Now that Cyber Monday is essentially here, Best Buy is back with a bunch of great sales that you can take advantage of. And, you can do all of your shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7NDsp"&gt;Below, you’ll find the best deals currently happening at Best Buy.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7QychB"&gt;Cyber Monday is here. It’s the last big shopping opportunity of 2020, and if you didn’t already take advantage of some deals that debuted over the weekend, now’s your chance. Every retailer has debuted at least a few new deals earlier than ever, and we’re focused on adding them here — in addition to the great Black Friday deals you can still get. As you’re expecting, there are some great deals on gaming laptops, wireless noise-canceling headphones, earbuds, tablets, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHCSuC"&gt;We’ll be doing our best to keep this post updated during Cyber Monday, and stay tuned throughout Cyber Week as we give you as many chances as possible to get everything on your holiday wish list. We’ve put the latest deals right at the top for easy viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s next wireless earbuds are the ‘Galaxy Buds Pro,’ according to FCC filing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sw-8XaKKsfyopLGbxO98QAzz5TQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68000731/DSCF5638.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro are rumored to look similar to the Galaxy Buds Plus (above), but the charging case will be different.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkyQo8"&gt;It was inevitable that Samsung was going to make the switch from “Plus” to “Pro.” Even if there was a “Live” in between. The company has &lt;a href="https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/A3LSMR190L/"&gt;filed the necessary regulatory paperwork with the FCC&lt;/a&gt; for its next set of true wireless earbuds. It was already rumored that these would be called the Galaxy Buds Pro, and now it’s right there in documentation directly from Samsung itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3MuqE"&gt;The FCC filing comes with the usual confidentiality protocols in place, so it doesn’t reveal too much more about the Buds Pro. But an image of the regulatory label offers a preview of the charging case’s shape. It seems the Buds Pro will be housed in a case that more closely resembles the case from the Galaxy Buds Live than the Galaxy Buds Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>This motion-activated poké ball ‘must never be thrown’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rgd_KnRUkqwwe_k0epnah1zRs8M=/0x0:944x629/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68000602/poke_ball_lifestyle_shot_B_3797x2334px_1024x629.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lZLJIU"&gt;The Pokémon Company International and The Wand Company are teaming up to release premium replicas of the classic Poké Ball, Great Ball, Ultra Ball, and Premier Ball. These $99.99 die-cast metal balls come with proximity-sensing tech that causes its button to light up and change color when pressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cODt6E"&gt;You might be thinking that the point of a poké ball, any poké ball, would be to be thrown, as decades of games and cartoons have taught — especially for one that’s motion activated — but not this ball, buddy! This is not a toy. A replica weights in at 10.5oz, which, according to the very first result on Google, is twice the weight of a baseball and 4.5oz heavier than a cue ball. It is distressingly described as having “real heft” and being...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM pumps the brakes on its deal with troubled electric truck startup Nikola</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Td9Po6"&gt;General Motors ditched its plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427009/gm-nikola-acquisition-electric-hydrogen-truck"&gt;acquire an equity stake&lt;/a&gt; in troubled electric truck startup Nikola. GM will also no longer help engineer and manufacture Nikola’s battery-electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131754/nikola-badger-hydrogen-electric-pickup-truck-specs-photos-battery-range"&gt;the Badger pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3cxIh"&gt;It won’t come as a total shock to anyone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454738/nikola-cult-founder-worship-trevor-milton-general-motors"&gt;who’s been following Nikola over the last several months&lt;/a&gt;. Less than a week after GM announced its plan to acquire an 11 percent stake in the buzzy company, short-selling firm Hindenburg Research &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436126/nikola-fraud-allegation-hindenburg-short-seller-electric-truck"&gt;published a bombshell report &lt;/a&gt;accusing Nikola of fraud in showcasing its electric vehicle technology. Nikola founder Trevor Milton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448729/nikola-electric-hydrogen-truck-fraud-allegations-executive-chairman-founder-trevor-milton"&gt;stepped down as board chairman&lt;/a&gt; on September 21st in the wake of the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ANq9sL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM is shifting from partner to customer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id="9yLHtZ"&gt;Whether you’re shopping for a student, an older relative, or anyone in between, a laptop can make a great gift. And the internet’s largest retailers are offering all kinds of laptops at discounted prices for Cyber Monday, whether you’re looking for a convertible, a Chromebook, a gaming rig, or anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8Tv9N"&gt;Note that for some models, only certain configurations may be on sale. Make sure to double-check the specs of the item you’re buying to make sure they’ll suit your workload (and that you’re actually getting the discount) before you check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vRrnV"&gt;To learn more about some of these laptops, and others that may see discounts later this week, check out our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops of 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Cyber Monday deals on Apple devices</title>

      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 looks great. The new design feels both modern and classic." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-5RS9--ma3o46o5wRbuiZq0KX04=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67867332/vpavic_4243_20201017_0088.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5VU3Q"&gt;It’s rare that Apple slashes the prices on its own products. Fortunately, other retailers are putting a lot of Apple products on sale for Cyber Monday. A bunch of retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Walmart, and Woot are slashing the prices on everything from wearables to its wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIuihu"&gt;Additionally, the online Apple store will have a special promotion on Friday, November 27th, and running until Monday, November 30th. The promotion will allow &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you to get up to $150 in an Apple gift card&lt;/a&gt; if you purchase an eligible product during the four-day event as listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VKYPYw"&gt;Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy an &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-3#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wOJmIA"&gt;Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy AirPods (&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMRXJ2%2Fairpods-with-wireless-charging-case#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wireless&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMV7N2%2Fairpods-with-charging-case#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wired case&lt;/a&gt;) or a pair of &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMWP22AM%2FA%2Fairpods-pro#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;....&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new MacBook Air and Pro with M1 are at their lowest prices yet for Cyber Monday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zn4KWt"&gt;Apple’s new computers, based on the company’s own custom M1 chip, have been getting sterling reviews due to their great performance and better life. (Well, &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; sterling reviews; &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Nilay Patel is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;not a fan of the Touch Bar&lt;/a&gt; that still adorns the MacBook Pro. But aside from that...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WDHWO"&gt;Normally, brand-new Apple computers would not be on sale, even during Cyber Monday. But the M1-powered MacBook Pro 13 has already had a $50-off sale at Amazon, and now B&amp;amp;H is discounting the MacBook Pro with M1 chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ln3PC2"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is taking $100 off the M1-equipped MacBook Air with the base configuration, which includes 256GB of SSD storage. It’s the lowest price we’ve seen the new M1-powered Air sell for yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bZTN80"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
