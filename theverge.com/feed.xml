    <title>The US will rejoin the Paris climate agreement, but that was the easy part</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Presidential Candidate Joe Biden Campaigns In Wilmington, Delaware" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/attNW0TQ-B4yDOez4X0FgCfztnw=/0x0:4826x3217/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68697098/1228514843.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joe Biden speaks about climate change and the wildfires on the West Coast at the Delaware Museum of Natural History on September 14th, 2020, in Wilmington, Delaware.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Drew Angerer / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XYNEqB"&gt;President Joe Biden recommitted the US to the Paris climate accord during his first day in office, fulfilling one of his earliest campaign promises. In 30 days, the US will once again be part of the global accord. Rejoining the agreement is as easy as sending a letter to the secretary-general of the United Nations. What comes after that will be much harder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zJVqfb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The world is very tired of seeing the US make promises we don’t keep” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AAFEgO"&gt;The US turned its back on efforts to tackle the climate crisis together as a planet when Donald Trump made the decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21548147/united-states-paris-agreement-climate-change-presidential-election"&gt;withdraw&lt;/a&gt; from the Paris agreement. Trump decimated federal efforts to slash emissions within the US, and he stood by other right-wing leaders — like Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, who similarly...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tech rallies behind Biden’s immigration plans</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="waLAnO"&gt;Hours after taking his oath of office on Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed several executive orders overturning actions taken by the Trump administration regarding immigration, and tech is rallying behind the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RhLor"&gt;Biden signed two executive orders Wednesday that extend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for another four years and overturn the Trump administration’s travel bans on largely Muslim-majority countries. It’s just the start of the Biden administration’s immigration reform efforts. The administration also plans to drop a new bill that would &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/15/biden-immigration-plans-459766"&gt;provide 11 million undocumented immigrants&lt;/a&gt; with a pathway to citizenship and an eight-year waiting period before they can become permanent residents, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/15/biden-immigration-plans-459766"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;P...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Muppet Great Gatsby exists — in script form</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RjFLK"&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/12/31/22205532/the-great-gatsby-public-domain-the-muppets-adaptation-disney"&gt;desperate plea&lt;/a&gt; for a Muppets adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt; has been answered: documentary filmmaker &lt;a href="http://benjamincrew.weebly.com/about-me.html"&gt;Ben Crew&lt;/a&gt; has taken the public domain novel and turned it into &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oi3aqaPQA6g2ThZoJ5eqfcj6BpksOQ71/view"&gt;a downloadable 104-page fan-made script&lt;/a&gt; that marries Muppet antics with existential angst. My request for an adaptation may have been ridiculous, but this script seriously vindicates me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxNEAG"&gt;Crew’s script, “Muppets Present ‘The Great Gatsby,’” may be a silly mashup of a novel you’re forced to read in high school and a puppet comedy variety show, but he said it became a meaningful project when January’s news cycle became too much to bear. “I knew that there was nothing I could do about what was happening in D.C. and that if I didn’t distract myself I was just going to waste away...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inauguration Day was more accessible than ever, but there’s still a ways to go</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Black woman in uniform stands at a podium, holding up her hands in the middle of signing." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kQASgshr54Ls3BlU2AdItt-hT6U=/0x0:3756x2504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696766/1230695751.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhrnY0"&gt;Firefighter Andrea Hall put accessible communication front and center at the presidential inauguration today when she led the Pledge of Allegiance in both spoken English and Signed English. The inaugural committee also hosted several separate accessible live streams of the event on its YouTube page, including one with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/cctCd8jI0e8"&gt;audio description&lt;/a&gt;, one with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/5-dkVhOQRRQ"&gt;live captions and American Sign Language interpretation&lt;/a&gt;, and one with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XyHeDfMgjEc"&gt;Cued Speech transliteration&lt;/a&gt; (the use of hand shapes to signal speech sounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nffV7y"&gt;But despite those efforts,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;many deaf and hard of hearing viewers still found the inauguration inaccessible. Most broadcast stations didn’t have an ASL interpreter on-screen and used automated captions, which are notoriously inaccurate. In what some...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NVho47"&gt;JBL’s Google Assistant-powered smart display, the Link View, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fitm%252F154193201978%26campid%3D5338421468%26toolid%3D10001%26customid%3Dvergegooddeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F20%2F22241056%2Fjbl-link-view-google-assistant-smart-display-ebay-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is on sale for $80&lt;/a&gt; on Harman Audio’s (JBL’s parent company) eBay store. While its original price was $300, this smart display has been slowly getting cheaper since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/2018/8/1/17640698/jbl-link-view-google-smart-display-speaker-release-date"&gt;it debuted in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Both the black and white color variants are on sale, and it comes with free standard shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xn5zSg"&gt;The JBL Link View smart display features an 8-inch touchscreen display with a webcam built into the device. Although it has been on the market for several years, time has been kind to this smart display. And &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/jn538v/jbl_link_view_updated_with_the_new_interface/"&gt;Reddit users have pointed&lt;/a&gt; out that the Link View recently received an update, which includes a new user interface. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch has ‘indefinitely’ banned Donald Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVJnA6Vy5Cy1qAdS9JHpgcJIzZQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696575/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CdjP2z"&gt;Twitch has “indefinitely” banned former President Donald Trump from its platform. The action comes two weeks after the site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219144/twitch-trump-ban-indefinitely-capitol-attack"&gt;disabled Trump’s account&lt;/a&gt;, preventing him from streaming but leaving the account page live, in light of the mob attack on the Capitol. At the time, a company spokesperson told a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reporter that it would reassess his account after he left office — which happened today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzNXWX"&gt;“We have indefinitely suspended President Trump’s Twitch channel due to the ongoing risk of further incitement of violence,” a Twitch spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="f055FH"&gt;The President’s statements continue to be interpreted as calls to action, and we are taking this action to remove the potential for harm to our community and the general...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>WhiteHouse.gov now has dark mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the White House website, showing the dark, high contrast mode activated." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jKVZ56Tusr2DG23Nb-8RLmxd7XA=/53x0:2231x1452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68695583/Screen_Shot_2021_01_20_at_9.26.43_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cpyu7d"&gt;The official website of the White House, &lt;a href="http://Whitehouse.gov"&gt;WhiteHouse.gov&lt;/a&gt;, has been completely replaced with a new version for the Biden administration, and it comes with some unexpected accessibility features: a high contrast mode, which serves as a dark mode, and a toggle to make the font size larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5fy08"&gt;Both options show up along the left rail as big, easy-to-click or tap buttons, and that’s the way you’ll need to toggle them. Even if your device has a system-wide dark mode, the White House website won’t switch over automatically. That’s because it’s really there to serve as an accessibility feature, meant to help anyone who would have trouble reading or looking at a bright white screen with black text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lszlCD"&gt;With dark mode being very popular among heavy...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today, the US welcomed a new president and new Bernie memes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQvc69FeJ0LftAQefxGotvawJ3Y=/0x17:1096x748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696431/EsMWA4aW4AIwkUE.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="21cO1c"&gt;Today’s US presidential inauguration brought many good things, but the thing Twitter seems most excited about is a new crop of Bernie memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6m7bZi"&gt;The meme started with a wire photo of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), sitting on a folding chair watching President Joe Biden’s inauguration. The temperature in Washington, DC was in the 40s, so he’s bundled up with a coat and mittens, and he’s sitting socially distanced from everyone else, as his age and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/us/politics/bernie-sanders-hospital.html"&gt;prior health issues&lt;/a&gt; put him at severe risk for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGEbbH"&gt;Something about Sanders’ chilly body language, his oversized wool mittens, and the fact that he was sitting entirely alone made the photo irresistible as meme material. Of course, the senator is no stranger to memes — including 2016’s Birdie...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon offers to help Biden administration with vaccinations</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuoNCGF2wk_IfHjm8sh0d3tZ8iU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696294/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtIIvD"&gt;Amazon has offered to help the Biden administration meet its goal of completing 100 million coronavirus vaccinations within the next 100 days. “Our scale allows us to make a meaningful impact immediately in the fight against COVID-19, and we stand ready to assist you in this effort,” Dave Clark, Amazon’s worldwide operations leader, wrote in a letter to the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvVhto"&gt;The company’s main interest appears to be in offering vaccinations through its own facilities. Clark writes that Amazon has “an agreement in place” with a health care provider to administer vaccinations on site, though he did not say which Amazon facilities were being considered. The company operates warehouses, Amazon-branded shops, and Whole Foods grocery stores....&lt;/p&gt;
