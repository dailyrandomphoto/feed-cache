    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2w4UOs"&gt;A little over two years ago when Rivian’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"&gt;all-electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt; were still just blueprints, American carmakers Ford and GM were itching to invest. Fast-forward to the present, and Ford wound up becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590848/rivian-raise-amazon-ford-new-factory-ipo-electric-pickup"&gt;one of Rivian’s biggest partners alongside Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. What most people may not realize, however, is that Ford nearly lost its spot to GM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cR456n"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ford-won-the-race-for-rivian-11636171218"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; describes some of the clandestine dealings in cinematic detail, and explores how Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe’s bond with Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s former president of global operations, became the foundation of Ford’s investment in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsHR4P"&gt;According to the&lt;em&gt; WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, Hinrichs first met with Scaringe in 2018. But because Ford had just missed its earnings targets, it wasn’t ready to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk polls his Twitter followers to ask if he should sell 10 percent of his Tesla stock </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Elon Musk polled his Twitter followers | Photo by PATRICK PLEUL/POOL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JchOSd"&gt;Tesla CEO and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;wealthiest&lt;/a&gt; person in the world Elon Musk tweeted out a poll Saturday, asking his Twitter followers whether he should sell 10 percent of his stock in the automaker, ostensibly to pay more tax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coNDYE"&gt;“Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457066048944066565?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. He said in a subsequent tweet that he’d abide by the results of the poll “whichever way it goes.” By Sunday morning, “yes” replies were leading, with 57 percent of more than 3.1 million votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5dcmVn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457066048944066565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QPNAbf"&gt;Musk had been a vocal critic of a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-billionaires-income-tax-would-work-11635325201?mod=article_inline"&gt;proposal to tax unrealized gains&lt;/a&gt; on publicly traded assets for some of the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Arcane is a slick and exciting intro to League of Legends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eEY9sMVp5sF8cH4Pqbx5wSSAxd8=/240x0:1545x870/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70106449/Vi_fight.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWXeqg"&gt;For years, fans have been wondering just when the heck &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot would make an animated series. It seemed inevitable. The studio previously created stunning animated shorts to promote everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336218/league-of-legends-yone-anime-cinematic-riot-games"&gt;new characters&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700154/league-of-legends-world-2021-anthem-music-video"&gt;esports tournaments&lt;/a&gt;. And with an increasing focus on expanding &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;’s storytelling — something that’s tough to do within the confines of a team-based strategy game — a show made a whole lot of sense. Now, it’s real, with a nine-episode series called &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;. The best part: not only is it a lot of fun, but you don’t have to know anything about &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; to get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTbT6U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; is set (mostly) in a city called Piltover early on, which is on the verge of a big change that could impact the entirety of the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp may be working on a Communities feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sE8_Kr6c4stj8ukazGjMdrkuf1Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105878/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NnCDgO"&gt;Evidence is mounting that WhatsApp may be working on a Communities feature. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/whatsapp-new-community-feature-apk-teardown/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; first spotted&lt;/a&gt; the possibility in October, but now &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-communities/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; has come forward&lt;/a&gt; with similar findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjuvdZ"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;, the Communities feature appears to give group admins more power over groups. This includes the ability to create groups within groups, which may be similar to how channels are arranged beneath an umbrella Discord community.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by WABetaInfo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zDSuEp"&gt;Admins may be able to invite new users via a Community Invite Link and then start messaging other members. It’s hard to tell how exactly these chats might look right now, but &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; notes that they appear to be end-to-end encrypted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwYVWd"&gt;It also looks like a subtle...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly is aware of the level of ‘problematic use’ among its users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4cl22QviTCKJZdg_pANy3B-TXbg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105825/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;More leaked documents suggest Facebook is aware of its problems | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DvIzrM"&gt;Facebook’s own internal research found 1 in 8 of its users reported compulsive social media use that interfered with their sleep, work, and relationships— what the social media platform calls “problematic use” but is more commonly known as “internet addiction,” the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-bad-for-you-360-million-users-say-yes-company-documents-facebook-files-11636124681"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="366TOG"&gt;The social media platform had a team focused on user well-being, which suggested ways to curb problematic use, some of which were put into place. But the company shut down the team in 2019, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NB488C"&gt;Pratiti Raychoudhury, a vice president of research for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Meta, Facebook’s new parent&lt;/a&gt; company, writes in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/wsj-report-ignores-our-approach-to-well-being-research/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; misrepresented the research (a claim the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681056/facebook-vp-disputes-report-wall-street-journal-instagram-teens-clegg"&gt;has made&lt;/a&gt; about some of the other articles the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; has...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;New vaccine rules have been frozen by an appeals court | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSYpdy"&gt;A federal appeals court on Saturday issued a stay against the Biden administration’s vaccine rules for US companies. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22757969/biden-covid-vaccine-osha-cms-masking-federal-mandate"&gt;rule announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; requires workers at businesses with 100 or more employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, or submit to weekly testing. The rule requires affected companies to provide paid time for employees to get vaccinated, and to ensure any unvaccinated employees wear face masks while at work. The deadline for meeting the provisions is January 4th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhiljM"&gt;Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TXAG/status/1457045504710356999"&gt;petitioned for an emergency stay&lt;/a&gt; of the rule, which was to be enforced by the Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The petition was joined by attorneys general from Louisiana,...&lt;/p&gt;

According to &lt;a href="https://forums.evga.com/Notice-of-Stolen-EVGA-GeForce-RTX-30Series-Graphics-Cards-m3490851.aspx"&gt;a forum post by EVGA product manager Jacob Freeman&lt;/a&gt;, thieves made off with a whole truckload of EVGA RTX 30-Series graphics cards. The graphic cards were in transit from San Francisco to EVGA’s southern California distribution center at the time of the theft, and it remains unclear how many cards were affected.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things 4 will have a summer 2022 release date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wsXjbNl8B7lcdFbb4eduOtXYTwA=/360x0:1628x845/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105313/eleven_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Eleven is back for Season 4 of Netflix’s Stranger Things series | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1ZQMpp4BdU&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangerThings" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X07yfR"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/netflix/status/1457045171367989251"&gt;tweeted Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;will premiere in the summer of 2022. While not a precise release date, it’s at least something for fans of Netflix’s flagship supernatural series, who have waited through months of delays and a seemingly endless parade of mysterious teasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlL6gs"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/6/22765252/stranger-things-4-teaser-trailer-2022-release-date-netflix"&gt;teaser dropped Saturday&lt;/a&gt; as well, showing Eleven in California, adjusting to her new life and school. She writes in a letter to Mike that everything is great (even though we see her classmates being mean to her), and says she can’t wait for spring break. But of course, our girl can’t have anything nice last for too long; after a fade to black, we get some eerie music under shots of a roller rink and Eleven looking afraid, along with helicopters,...&lt;/p&gt;

After trying out the 30W charger with the Pixel 6, &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; found that the Pixel 6 doesn’t fully harness the power of the charger — instead, it only hits a maximum...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUuzEN"&gt;Restaurant chain Jack in the Box says it is suing cryptocurrency exchange FTX because it “brazenly and illegally copied or derived its ‘Moon Man’ mascot” from its established Jack mascot, and is doing damage to the Jack in the Box brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viRPw6"&gt;In a lawsuit filed in federal court in the Northern District of California this week, Jack in the Box claims that FTX’s Moon Man character, aka Lou Nar, “has a spherical white head also affixed to a talking human actor, with blue-dotted eyes, a nose, and a smile,” which is “strikingly similar to Jack. Both change their facial expressions and clothing throughout ads and appearances,” the suit maintains. Moon Man, however, is a “far inferior version” of Jack, the restaurant chain argues, and is ...&lt;/p&gt;
