    <title>Amazon’s troubled MMO New World pushed back to August</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEWI_dT-Pbjugh3zyPAcuF91veo=/91x0:961x580/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825853/corrupted_porta_1080x580.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLCJJz"&gt;Amazon’s open-world MMO, &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, has once again been delayed. The developer now expects the game to launch August 31st. “We’ve been hard at work on compelling end-game features we believe are important to include at launch,” an update on the &lt;a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/new-world-developer-update"&gt;game’s site&lt;/a&gt; reads. “These features won’t be ready for the Spring timeframe that we had communicated.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vw8CT"&gt;Development at Amazon has been bumpy. &lt;em&gt;New World &lt;/em&gt;has already had its share of criticism as well for its depictions of European colonization. The tentpole game, previously intended for a launch in 2020, was pushed from its August date to spring 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320325/amazon-new-world-delayed-spring-2021-crucible"&gt;last July&lt;/a&gt; — its &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/history-and-magic-collide-in-mmo-new-world-releasing-may-2020/"&gt;second delay&lt;/a&gt;. The news came just days after Amazon-owned studio, Relentless, essentially un-launched its free-to-play shooter &lt;em&gt;Crucible...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RgXyQr"&gt;Winter storms paralyzing the United States have left &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/16/968230163/millions-without-power-in-texas-northern-mexico-as-blackouts-and-bitter-cold-con?utm_campaign=storyshare&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;millions without power&lt;/a&gt; and sent health officials scrambling to protect freezers full of COVID-19 vaccines, which have to be kept at extremely low temperatures or risk going bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHFuDj"&gt;Rolling blackouts through Texas took out at least &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-officials-scramble-administer-8000-covid-vaccines-power/story?id=75911159"&gt;one set of freezers&lt;/a&gt; full of the Moderna vaccine; 5,000 doses were sent to a university, a jail, and a handful of hospitals before they expired. The &lt;a href="https://www.kptv.com/news/winter-storm-causes-power-outages-to-freezers-protecting-covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-oregon/article_95cc2336-7000-11eb-bb34-7362ce54e5e9.html"&gt;Oregon Health Authority&lt;/a&gt; is moving vaccines to places with power, although the agency isn’t disclosing which storage sites have their systems down. As part of its storm preparations, Kentucky made sure places holding COVID-19 vaccines had contingency plans. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Six free alternatives to the LastPass password manager</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Digital lock (Shutterstock)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BS_5Dr3dKivxmRjDEq73BeXLB-g=/0x42:1000x709/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825516/shutterstock_71973916.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nSqJyn"&gt;Free is always nice, and when a free app is no longer free (or when the free version becomes so limited it is virtually useless), then you have to decide whether to pay up or move on. This happened with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12052056/evernote-price-changes-basic-plus-premium"&gt;Evernote note manager almost five years ago&lt;/a&gt;, and now it is time for users of the popular password manager LastPass to make the same decision. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;LastPass is changing its free version&lt;/a&gt; so that it will only work on one type of device — either your computer or your mobile device. If you, like most of us, use both a phone and a computer, then you will have to either start paying $3 a month or find an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldLQTp"&gt;If you’d rather not pay at all, there are other password managers out there that have free versions that may work better for you....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>IBM sets new climate goal for 2030</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jQwMfU"&gt;IBM plans to get rid of its planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions from its operations by 2030, the company announced today. And unlike some other tech companies that have made splashy environmental commitments lately, IBM’s pledge emphasized the need to prevent emissions rather than developing ways to capture carbon dioxide after it’s released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xSBODp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;IBM is pledging to do “all it can across its operations” to stop polluting&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jAujnj"&gt;The company committed to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the end of this decade, pledging to do “all it can across its operations” to stop polluting before it turns to emerging technologies that might be able to capture carbon dioxide after it’s emitted. It plans to rely on renewable energy for 90 percent of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook users rarely saw voting misinformation labeled ‘false,’ says study — especially if it came from Trump</title>

  &lt;p id="IMPjqG"&gt;Facebook addressed false election information with understated warnings like “missing context” rather than more direct flags, &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/02/16/trumps-false-posts-were-treated-with-kid-gloves-by-facebook"&gt;research from &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; suggests&lt;/a&gt; — and the company appeared hesitant to label false or misleading statements from now-banned former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYMMiD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; has released &lt;a href="https://github.com/the-markup/citizen-browser-flags"&gt;new data&lt;/a&gt; from its Citizen Browser, which captures snapshots of what 2,200 volunteers see in their Facebook feeds. Its report covers December and January, two contentious months where then-President Trump falsely claimed victory in the election. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21552064/facebook-election-winner-instagram-notification-president-trump-biden"&gt;implemented special banners&lt;/a&gt; and labeling systems to inform users about election results and fact-check false posts.

    <title>Trello is redesigning its project management platform for a remote work future</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0qkpK"&gt;Productivity app Trello, a virtual whiteboard-style platform for organizing and managing projects, is announcing a major redesign today in addition to new features for helping businesses manage third-party integrations. The platform is getting a visual overhaul, both to its logo and the illustrations it deploys across its website and apps. It’s also getting multiple new ways to both customize cards and view your workload beyond the core whiteboard column view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5Hcou"&gt;“During the pandemic, Trello became many people’s new offices in a remote-first world. The overnight shift to distributed work coupled with the frantic adoption of digital tools led to an exponential increase in digital work artifacts scattered across apps, some of which now...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="eBVSy4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is getting a big update today focused on the UK and Ireland. The World Update III, as Microsoft puts it, includes high-resolution 3G imagery for cities like London, Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, and Oxford. &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/02/16/microsoft-flight-simulator-world-update-iii-uk-ireland-now-available-for-free/"&gt;More than 70 custom landmarks&lt;/a&gt; and points of interest have been improved, including famous bridges, palaces, cathedrals, and famous Premier League football (soccer!) stadiums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzMaK1"&gt;If you’ve tried to visit some Premier League clubs in &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; already, you’ve probably noticed they’re usually just a giant generic-looking apartment block. This update aims to improve that experience with detailed views of exactly where the Premier League is played week in week out. Likewise, Buckingham Palace, the Queen’s...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="emYkbk"&gt;Nvidia is now requiring, not just encouraging, companies selling laptops with its new RTX 30-series graphics chips to be more transparent about the kind of power people can expect. Nvidia tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;these companies will have to disclose specific clock speed stats and total graphics power on online product pages — all of which tells people everything they need to know about a laptop’s graphics potential, for better or worse. &lt;/p&gt;

It’s going to shift its focus entirely to professional audio, including its Neumann microphone division and what Sennheiser calls business communications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJPvJq"&gt;In a press release, Sennheiser says it wants to increase visibility in the competitive headphone and soundbar markets, and it thinks its products can be popular amid “strong competitive pressure.” But it needs an investor to make that happen. It also says that talks with potential partners will start soon.&lt;/p&gt;
