    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n6ej8I"&gt;Google is holding onto &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/collection/offers?hl=en-US"&gt;most of its deals from Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s a lot to like if you’re in the market for a Pixel, Chromecast, or Nest device. The search giant kicked off the deals in the Google Store early, and now many of the big-name retailers are offering equivalent deals on the same items. Google even advertises these deals as running until December 1st, a few days after Cyber Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShDHRU"&gt;There are still many great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; that are live in addition to our retailer-specific roundups for sales at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22783434/target-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday-tech-games"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784145/amazon-black-friday-2021-best-deals-tech-cyber-monday"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Cryptocurrency miners suffer amid major energy crunch in Kazakhstan</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1s9x2P"&gt;Cryptocurrency miners in Kazakhstan are facing widespread electricity shortages amid a surge in mining, as reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/086b7ec7-f71a-4214-bfa0-5644852056f3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Kazakhstan has been grappling with an overloaded energy grid as miners flock in from China, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;cracked down on crypto&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691472/china-central-bank-cryptocurrency-illegal-bitcoin"&gt;banned crypto-based transactions&lt;/a&gt; in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LqE6zW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Over 87,849 “power-intensive” mining rigs have made their way from China to Kazakhstan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rW1b3F"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, Kazakhstan’s demand for electricity has risen about eight percent since the beginning of 2021, a sharp increase from the one or two percent annual growth that the country typically experiences. The &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0dbe4f9f-a433-4288-858e-c4b852f4c340"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times’ &lt;/em&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; also estimates that over 87,849 “power-intensive” mining rigs have made...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6UI9c9"&gt;What can $50 get you these days? Turns out, quite a lot; you just need to know where to look. We’ve already rounded up all the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22523255"&gt;best Black Friday deals still available&lt;/a&gt; if you’re getting your shopping done early at retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22548186"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22547475"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789835/best-buy-black-friday-2021-cyber-monday-tech-deals"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22548167"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. But if you’re on a tight budget or looking for some gifts that won’t break the bank, you’ve come to the right place. Below are a few suggestions, all of which are available for under $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yQnjzd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday weekend deals under $25","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22796420/black-friday-2021-under-25-tech-deals-cheap-cyber-monday"},{"title":"The Verge’s favorite holiday gifts under $25","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22745314/holiday-gift-guide-under-25-cheap-tech-2021-best-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="CZmiWS"&gt;Have a Nintendo Switch, a Go Pro, or phone/tablet/laptop that features a microSD slot? Treat it to a massive boost in storage capacity with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-400GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SanDisk’s 400GB microSD card&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon for just $45. This card usually costs around $50.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="ubHLrb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327706"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="EDphAg"&gt;Amazon’s latest streaming stick is a solid alternative to both...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Black Friday 2021 weekend smart home tech deals: speakers, cameras, robots, and more </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uNHMij"&gt;There is never a better time to dive into the smart home than Black Friday and its close cousin Cyber Monday. Traditionally, tech deals on home gadgets are huge this time of year, plus, it’s the only time you’ll find real bargains on gear from some of the smaller companies, such as Eve, Level, and Nanoleaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjy6kh"&gt;Whether you’re thinking about dipping a toe into this home automation shindig with a smart speaker or maybe a connected door lock, or want to bolster an already impressive smart home setup, it’s worth investing some cash this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRU2qz"&gt;Also, if you just want to upgrade your home cleaning routine or have a way to check in on Fido now that you’re back at work (the separation anxiety is real), this is a good time to get a great...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday weekend deals on true wireless earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mEW4I7-PDUZK-9s8gXZGwyMhAcg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182193/20180319_airpods_mx4_vladsavov.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLBEwG"&gt;One of the most sought-after gifts every holiday — at least, ever since Apple removed the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone — has been true wireless earbuds. They are often the favored listening device of many people because they offer the most convenience, and they’re a product category that frequently goes on sale. Full-size headphones offer superior sound, and those are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796131/black-friday-headphones-2021-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;still seeing their fair share&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday discounts&lt;/a&gt;, but most casual listeners often prefer earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2rBqw"&gt;Here, we’ve rounded up the best Black Friday deals that are still available on wireless earbuds from Apple, Samsung, Bose, Jabra, Beats, and even Google, as well as a couple of lesser-known brands. Each has its own unique qualities or value proposition to offer,...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5aO9CW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are often thought of as times to stock up on smaller investments on the cheap, like headphones, games, and other gadgets you may not have wanted to pay full price for. But it’s also a great time to save on big-ticket items, like that laptop you’ve maybe had your eye on. The shopping holidays have brought some seriously good discounts on laptops, whether you’re keen on sticking with Mac, or you want a Windows PC. Both often come in very slim designs, but for people who don’t mind a heavier laptop, we’ve included some gaming laptop picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UADRPQ"&gt;The kinds of deals you can get on laptops vary depending on the retailer, so that’s how we’ve split up the deals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday weekend deals on cameras and lenses </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AejUlTBdnzMNTngZJQUzI-7kh1Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70188516/akrales_190117_3163_0010.10.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CTXPBN"&gt;Cameras and lenses can be a tricky thing to shop for around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. They are no small investment, though if you’re shopping for that lucky someone — or for yourself — there are some deals to be had that can save you a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cd0NVO"&gt;We have vetted and rounded up the most notable deals from the major camera manufacturers, focusing on the latest mirrorless systems. It’s hard to justify spending big money on a new DSLR in 2021, as it may be better to look to the secondhand market for those older systems. Another hard truth is that some camera manufacturers have been plagued by the chip shortages on the latest models, and the deals on tap show that — many of the deeper discounts are on slightly older cameras, and some newer releases...&lt;/p&gt;
