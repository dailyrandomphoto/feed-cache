    <title>Facebook’s Oversight Board takes its first six cases</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OE-tT5XlBXC5W8V2Xq-VgEiUpM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68061385/acastro_180806_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9TKRb"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board, an independent body that reviews Facebook moderation decisions, has &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/719406882003532-announcing-the-oversight-board-s-first-cases-and-appointment-of-trustees/"&gt;accepted its first cases&lt;/a&gt;. The six appeals involve content removed under Facebook’s hate speech rules, nudity ban, and misinformation policies. They’re now open for seven days of public comment, after which the board will determine whether the posts should have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxeF7l"&gt;Most of the cases involve users outside the US posting non-English content — a known &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-languages-insight/facebooks-flood-of-languages-leaves-it-struggling-to-monitor-content-idUSKCN1RZ0DW"&gt;weak point&lt;/a&gt; for Facebook moderation — and at least two hinge on the nuance of someone publishing hate content to implicitly criticize it. One user posted screenshots of &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/30/malaysias-mahathir-post-on-french-killings-taken-out-of-context"&gt;offensive tweets&lt;/a&gt; from former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, for instance, allegedly to raise awareness of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Bomberman R Online is Stadia’s second totally free game</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Konami&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s6IcmG"&gt;Heading into its second year, Google’s Stadia game streaming service is adding more games and making it easier to play without having to pay. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571699/google-stadia-destiny-2-free-to-play-game-chromebook-phone"&gt;The first free game released for the service was &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now it has another multiplayer companion: &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R Online&lt;/em&gt; will become free today. All you need is a Stadia account, which is completely free. On Android or in the Chrome browser, you should be able to &lt;a href="https://stadia.com/link/aFu2pZmeQSnvPiZ16"&gt;click this link&lt;/a&gt; to launch the game now if you’re logged in to that account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8WUbk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bomberman &lt;/em&gt;is a particularly fitting title to make free, considering it’s got a 64-player battle royale mode that’s exclusive to Stadia, and its lobbies might have been difficult to fill if each player had to pay. Otherwise, it’s an updated 3D take on the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams gets an overhauled calling interface, CarPlay support, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K2TUFgb6SUp_h-igzbSg3RJHMb8=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68058693/microsoftteamscalling.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2qZoZZ"&gt;Microsoft is overhauling its calling features inside Microsoft Teams today. A new calling interface will now show contacts, voicemail, and calling history in a single location. It’s designed to allow Microsoft Teams to more easily replace your desk phone, with built-in spam call protection, reverse number lookup, and the ability to merge calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyMqEd"&gt;Microsoft Teams users will also be able to transfer calls between mobile and desktop soon, allowing people to quickly move locations in the middle of an audio or video call. The Teams app will let people join without audio on an additional device, or simply transfer the call and end it automatically on other devices. Microsoft says this particular feature will be available in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Tesla whistleblower Martin Tripp ordered to pay $400,000 to settle hacking case</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tGDtXv"&gt;Martin Tripp, the former Tesla worker who has been embroiled in a bitter legal battle with CEO Elon Musk for over two years, was ordered to pay his former employer $400,000 after admitting to leaking confidential information to a reporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvjoR9"&gt;The settlement is intended to bring an end to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263757/tesla-elon-musk-employee-hack-spying-whistleblower-gigafactory-martin-tripp-drugs"&gt;one of the more sordid stories at Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, in which Tripp, a former process technician, locked horns with the billionaire CEO over allegations that Tesla was wasting a “jaw-dropping” amount of raw material as it ramped up production of the Model 3 sedan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XeTnH4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The settlement is intended to bring an end to one &lt;s&gt;﻿&lt;/s&gt;of the more sordid stories at Tesla&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Go watch this video about an AI system that can predict how proteins fold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A diagram comparing an AlphaFold prediction with an identified protein shape, showing 99.09 percent Global Distance Test accuracy." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVDQgynabdlgPnprYiR4bBFrd2U=/108x0:1262x769/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68052988/global_distance_result.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eUYngK"&gt;Within any living organism, there are thousands of different proteins, each with its own unique shape. For decades, the exact formation of those shapes has been a pain for scientists to figure out. How exactly does a protein, which starts as a string of amino acids, fold itself into the funky 3D shapes you might recognize from diagrams? AlphaFold, an &lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphafold"&gt;AI from DeepMind&lt;/a&gt;, may have an answer. It can predict, with heretofore unseen accuracy, the shape a protein will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBzmn7"&gt;AlphaFold was put to the test in a global competition called Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction, or CASP, which DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis calls the “Olympics of protein folding” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg7WjuFs8F4"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt;. During the competition, systems like AlphaFold are given the amino...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose adds swipe volume controls to QuietComfort Earbuds and Sport Earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A5NCa7"&gt;One of the few complaints I had in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;review of Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt; was that they lacked onboard volume controls. Well, a few weeks after they went on sale, the company has now resolved that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojhIj6"&gt;In the latest update of the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bose-music/id1364986984"&gt;Bose Music app out today on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a new volume control option in settings. (Presumably this will be coming to the Android app imminently, as well.) Once you toggle it on, you’ll be able to swipe up and down on the right earbud to adjust how loud the audio is. This feature is available for both the QuietComfort Earbuds and less expensive Sport Earbuds. It’s something that was spotted in early user manuals for the earbuds but was removed before they shipped. I’m glad Bose has quickly moved to add this...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Windows Feature Experience Packs are smaller updates to Windows 10</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Windows 10 stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmwbTtUAXoY-N4tK23JhTiNrFvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68045021/mswindows1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5LAMcR"&gt;Microsoft has started testing smaller feature updates for Windows 10 in the form of a Windows Feature Experience Pack. The branding appeared inside Windows 10 earlier this year, but Microsoft has only confirmed what the packs will be used for this week. The Windows Feature Experience Pack will be used to “improve certain features and experiences that are now developed independently of the OS,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/11/30/releasing-windows-feature-experience-pack-120-2212-1070-0-to-the-beta-channel/"&gt;according to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NHHGJ"&gt;The first feature pack has been released to Windows 10 beta testers this week, and it includes the ability to use the built-in screen snipping app to paste screenshots directly into folders within the File Explorer. The pack also includes a split keyboard mode for 2-in-1 touch devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IQvz4h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Feature packs are for the smaller parts...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offer noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that...&lt;/p&gt;
