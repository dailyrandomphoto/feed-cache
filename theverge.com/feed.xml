    <title>Logitech’s new stream light is an affordable, convenient alternative to Elgato</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="blA3sN"&gt;Logitech’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Flighting%2Flitra-glow.946-000001.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F12%2F22879811%2Flogitech-litra-glow-elgato" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Litra Glow&lt;/a&gt; is a small LED light that’s designed to illuminate you while you’re sitting at your desk. It’s designed primarily with content creators like Twitch streamers or YouTubers in mind, but should work just as well for smartening you up on a Zoom call. In other words, it looks like a competitor to &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light-air"&gt;Elgato’s $129.99 Key Light Air&lt;/a&gt;, but at a more affordable $59.99 (€69) price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJKLPM"&gt;It’s not an identical accessory. Rather than having a large desk stand, the Litra Glow comes with a small mount to balance it on top of a monitor. It looks like it might be less versatile than the Key Light Air’s stand, but it could be more convenient if you want to reduce desk clutter. Power is provided via a USB-C port on its back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lime launches its new electric bikes in Washington, DC as part of $50 million blitz</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J6g0DZ943HxU1opcvv9Tg1aN8wI=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378017/DSC_0944.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ovjT90"&gt;Lime’s next-generation electric bikes are finally making their North American debut. Nearly a year after announcing its plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22303364/lime-ebike-expansion-new-cities-50-million-investment"&gt;spend $50 million on a major e-bike expansion&lt;/a&gt;, the San Francisco-based micromobility company says it will deploy the first wave of new bikes in Washington, DC, starting this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbnKWo"&gt;Lime says the new bikes are significantly improved over the ones currently in service, which the company inherited from Jump after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250420/lime-funding-uber-deal-alphabet-scooter-jump-bike"&gt;acquiring the bike-share company from Uber&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. The $50 million investment will largely go toward designing, manufacturing, and assembling its next-generation bike, which start rolling out this year. The new model comes with a more powerful 350-watt motor and a swappable battery capable of up to 25...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze’s security camera pay-what-you-want subscription accepts $0</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Wyze security camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tol4R4"&gt;Wyze has officially launched a new pay-what-you-want subscription tier for its lineup of home security cameras called Cam Plus Lite. In a &lt;a href="https://forums.wyzecam.com/t/we-re-giving-wyze-person-detection-to-all-users-at-whatever-price-you-want-1-11-22/211282"&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt;, the company explains that Cam Plus Lite includes Person Detection, which alerts you when it detects a human being rather than just motion, as well as cloud recordings that are limited to 12 seconds in length, with a 5 minute cooldown period between them. Users can choose to pay as little as $0 a month for the new tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzDtm6"&gt;Wyze also says it’s removing the 32GB microSD card size limit on its cameras, and is adding new rewind and skip buttons to make it easier to scrub through locally-saved footage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcXfiz"&gt;Regarding subscriptions, Wyze started experimenting with its pay-what-you-want model for its...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PCIe 6.0 is coming for the speedy SSDs and GPUs of the future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QdeVMsGIbN6po_nyF9ZRTORefvQ=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377900/pciexpress6.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CsEKcU"&gt;PCI Express 5.0 has only just started arriving on the consumer side, but the specification for PCIe 6.0 has just been finalized. The PCI Special Interest Group has published the &lt;a href="https://pcisig.com/pci-express-6.0-specification"&gt;final specs for PCIe 6.0&lt;/a&gt;, doubling the bandwidth over the 5.0 version up to a theoretical maximum bidirectional speed of 256GBps on an x16 slot (128GBps in a single direction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwYQvk"&gt;The first super fast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851422/samsung-adata-pcie-5-0-ssd-ces-speed-date"&gt;PCIe 5.0 SSDs appeared&lt;/a&gt; just before this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, promising read speeds of up to 14GBps. That was already twice what we’re used to seeing with PCIe 4.0 drives, and with the doubling PCIe 6.0 brings we’d expect to see SSDs offer up to 28GBps in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest phishing scam to watch out for: fraudulent QR codes on parking meters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Parking Meters On City Street In Reading Pennsylvania" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/maGG1bJ4Sq1NDlbdr_7LTqpfrB0=/0x108:4400x3041/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377884/1331145067.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PzC1FZ"&gt;Police in several US cities are warning residents not to pay for their parking using QR codes stuck to parking meters. That’s because these codes have been placed there by scammers, who are using them to direct people to fraudulent sites that capture their payment details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4x9t0U"&gt;Warnings have been issued by law enforcement in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Austin_Police/status/1478122920371232770"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SATXPolice/status/1473025923951775755"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt; over the holiday period (we spotted the story &lt;a href="https://theoverspill.blog/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Overspill&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;). Police say they discovered a number of stickers with illicit codes appearing on parking meters, while a report by local news site &lt;a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2022/01/05/qr-code-scammers-hitting-on-street-parking-in-texas-cities-this-is-what-houston-officials-want-you-to-know/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click2Houston&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows how one of the fraudulent codes directed people to a site promising “quick pay parking.” (The site now appears to be offline.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7nc2t"&gt;Police are advising anyone who inadvertently...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Wordle clones have disappeared from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zZmq0Lstg1m_wcC2YCTG26fErM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377148/VRG_ILLO_4536_001_7.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier today, the App Store was overflowing with games ripping off a viral web app. &lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLIZAP"&gt;Has Apple taken action against apps that cloned the popular web game Wordle? They have now disappeared from the App Store, after &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/psa-wordle-clone-with-annual-subscription-is-the-latest-rip-off-to-hit-the-app-store/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wordle-copycat-app-store-twitter"&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"&gt;including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) called out a flood of copycats so blatant as to be named “Wordle” and that featured the same gameplay and UI, each taking advantage of the fact that developer Josh Wardle didn’t create an Apple app of his own. While we’re still seeing a few clones on the App Store, they don’t use the Wordle name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMeMb6"&gt;The clone apps had a spotlight shone on them today, when one developer &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/tech-dude-rips-off-wordle-angers-internet-1848341422"&gt;started bragging about how many downloads his version of Wordle was getting&lt;/a&gt;. Following some intense backlash from the community, he set his account to private, but people had already started finding many...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile say they’re not blocking Apple’s iCloud Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bVCnW6IcjHg1auWUvneXHpkTC_U=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376980/og__ishslgdhhimq.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gsPVr9"&gt;T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T — the three biggest US cellular carriers — have all confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they aren’t blocking Apple’s new iCloud Private Relay feature, following reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;some customers were having issues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;with the VPN-like feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjO0fq"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon straight-up say they’re not blocking the feature from functioning. Verizon spokesperson George L. Koroneos confirms that Private Relay works on both cellular and Fios internet connections, and AT&amp;amp;T spokesperson Seth Bloom says the carrier’s policy is not to block Private Relay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IG6Sn"&gt;T-Mobile’s situation is a little more complex: most customers shouldn’t have any issues with iCloud Private Relay. But those who use content filtering services (like the carrier’s Family...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copies of the popular web app have made it past App Review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oddcq1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt;, the word-guessing puzzle game that’s &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/09/lifestyle/what-is-wordle-why-is-everyone-twitter-playing-it/"&gt;taken over our Twitter timelines&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t currently have an official app. That may come as a surprise to anyone who’s searched for it on the App Store, though — earlier today, doing so would show you several blatant unofficial copies, each of which use the same name and mechanics as the original, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle"&gt;was made by Josh Wardle&lt;/a&gt; and distributed on the web for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iobEAS"&gt;Most people who’ve been online recently will have had at least some exposure to Wordle if they haven’t been playing it themselves (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it has 2 million daily players). It’s a simple concept but done well: each day, you go to the Wordle website, where you’re given five chances to guess a five-letter word. The game gives...&lt;/p&gt;

At CES, many manufacturers — including LG and Samsung — announced new versions of some of their most popular models, ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22858577/samsung-frame-2022-tv-matte-antireflective-screen"&gt;The Frame&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;LG’s new C2 lineup&lt;/a&gt;. That means we’re probably going to start seeing prices fall on last-gen models as newer models become available throughout the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJ1Fo"&gt;For those looking to pick up a solid deal before the new models arrive, however, fret not, as retailers will also likely be discounting TVs in the run up to the Super Bowl next month. And if you need one now, there are currently a lot of discounted 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It fills me with glee that Canon printers now think Canon’s own toner is fake</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1fi7F8742hPtI_YmQYLctnQgbM=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376666/canon_printer_2400.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sadly, not for consumer inkjets like this one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tLZ9nT"&gt;Printers are the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt;. They’re unreliable, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-printer-ink-so-expensive-2019-8"&gt;they guzzle reportedly $12,000-a-gallon ink&lt;/a&gt;, and their manufacturers have been known to use dirty tricks, scare tactics, and DRM to &lt;em&gt;strongly encourage &lt;/em&gt;you to buy cartridges exclusively from them. But Canon is now getting a taste of its own medicine. Some of Canon’s own toner cartridges are now being detected as fakes — and they’re forcing the company to teach customers how to bypass its own DRM (via &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20220110/06555048260/chip-shortage-forces-canon-to-issue-workarounds-own-obnoxious-drm.shtml"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techdirt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRwALM"&gt;According to Canon’s own support website (&lt;a href="https://www.canon-europe.com/support/business-product-support/interim-toner/"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.canon.de/support/business-product-support/interim-toner/#id2"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;), the company is “currently facing challenges in sourcing certain electronic components that are used in our consumables for our multifunction printers.” In other words, Canon’s been hit by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;the great chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, too — only the...&lt;/p&gt;
