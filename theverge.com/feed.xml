    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1lnJmt"&gt;Amazon Prime Day, the company’s annual shopping holiday, will take place on Monday, June 21st through June 22nd, the company officially announced today. The forthcoming summer dates mark a return to form; the retail giant has historically held its shopping extravaganza in mid-July but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332350/amazon-prime-day-delayed-us-india-august-coronavirus"&gt;postponed last year’s event&lt;/a&gt; until October due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In its &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Amazon-Q1-2021-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;most recent earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon previously confirmed this year’s Prime Day would take place in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFaNVR"&gt;Like previous years, you can expect to find discounts on true wireless earbuds, 4K TVs of all sizes and panel types, video games, and more. Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Prime Day has become one of the best opportunities to get deals, whether they’re for gifts or...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is turning a factory into a gallery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qYDUWfWE4ELXhhfn8Rk1TmOpigY=/109x0:1311x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69375180/photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6GgZjm"&gt;Nintendo has announced that its Uji Ogura plant will be turned into a public gallery to “showcase the many products Nintendo has launched over its history.” The factory, located in the Ogura district of Uji, a city just outside Kyoto, was built in 1969 and was mainly used for manufacturing playing cards and hanafuda cards, which is how Nintendo got started as a business in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHDggt"&gt;“Nintendo has been discussing the possibility of building a gallery, as a way to share Nintendo’s product development history and philosophy with the public,” the company says in a &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210602.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “To this end, the Nintendo Uji Ogura Plant will be renovated to accommodate the gallery, a decision reached after taking consideration of The City of Uji’s plan...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The government’s been worried about DJI drones — the Pentagon now says they’re safe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-VIqtyzzEElicY--QTI7jQBVeY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69375023/vpavic_042029_4003_0162.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VViqYH"&gt;After months of government bans on DJI drones, with lawmakers questioning whether the company was sending information to the Chinese government, the Pentagon has now admitted that the drones being used might actually be safe (&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/556370-pentagon-report-clears-use-of-drones-made-by-top-chinese-manufacturer?rl=1"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), releasing a report saying that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-technology-government-and-politics-business-5854cf8b5eccd03f85d5eba2aef10a22"&gt;two “Government Edition” DJI drones&lt;/a&gt; are “recommended for use by government entities.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2I7cC"&gt;Last year, the Department of the Interior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113533/us-interior-department-chinese-drone-ban-grounding-security-dji"&gt;grounded all its drones&lt;/a&gt;, citing concerns of potential spying by the Chinese government, and the Department of Commerce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;put DJI on its Entity List&lt;/a&gt; after the company allegedly provided the Chinese government with surveillance tech for its Uyghur Muslim detention camps. That second claim isn’t being addressed at all today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qo7cn4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The report isn’t...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Dell has discontinued the Alienware Graphics Amplifier, its external GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0At8coQWAnATTi-CGE73BJpueFs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374949/alienware-dell-11_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZG4To8"&gt;We recently noticed that Alienware’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22440352/alienware-x15-x17-gaming-laptop-intel-h-series-nvidia-rtx-3080-price-release-date-features-specs"&gt;just-announced X15 and X17 thin and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;vaguely light  gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt; are conspicuously missing a port — and it’s not because they’re thin-and-light, it turns out. Alienware has just confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has discontinued the Alienware Graphics Amplifier external GPU, and so these laptops won’t need that proprietary port anymore. The company isn’t saying whether it’ll offer a future eGPU, but pointed us to off-the-shelf Thunderbolt ones instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPSyxA"&gt;The Alienware Graphics Amp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/27/7079879/alienware-new-graphics-amplifier-laptop"&gt;was first introduced in 2014 for $299&lt;/a&gt; and designed to be a companion to the company’s midrange Alienware 13, giving it the vast majority of the power of a desktop graphics card plus four extra full-size USB ports when docked. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/alienware-13-review-the-first-futureproof-gaming-lapto-1651514489"&gt;I...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea’s Sonos-powered picture frame speaker is on its website right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9AfEGC"&gt;Confirming what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370130/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-2021-lamp-wall-art-artwork-speaker"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported back in April,&lt;/a&gt; Ikea tonight listed a new Symonisk “picture frame with Wi-Fi speaker” product on its website. The device, which is listed for $199, has not yet been announced — but it’s one of two new collaborations between Ikea and Sonos set for release in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPKkcf"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-picture-frame-with-wi-fi-speaker-white-50487329%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F1%2F22464111%2Fikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-leak" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the likely-to-be-removed website&lt;/a&gt;, the Symfonisk picture frame measures 22 inches high, 16 inches wide, and 2 inches deep. Ikea says customers will be able to choose between “various interchangeable fronts,” and the frame will be offered in either black or white finishes. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;the previous two Symfonisk products&lt;/a&gt;, the picture frame is designed to blend into your home decor and not stick out as an obvious tech gadget.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As Disney Plus celebrates Pride, its parent is hit with sexual orientation discrimination suit </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="enTWCG"&gt;Even as Disney’s marquee streaming service celebrates Pride Month with a prominently positioned carousel of LGBTQ+ titles on its homepage, the company has found itself at the center of a sexual orientation discrimination lawsuit brought by an executive employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nqqPm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DISNEY-SEXUAL-DISCRIMINATION-SUIT.pdf"&gt;The complaint (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, as reported earlier &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/06/disney-pride-sexual-orientation-discrimination-lawsuit-joel-hopkins-1234767315/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was filed today in a California superior court on behalf of television executive Joel Hopkins, lawyers confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Hopkins had been with the company since 1994. The suit alleges that around the time that he was promoted to vice president of production finance for Touchstone Television in 2000, it became known that Hopkins identified as gay.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="CgM9Z4"&gt;Twitter has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1399876931135356936"&gt;reopened verification&lt;/a&gt; applications after pausing them last week, Twitter announced on Tuesday. The pause, which went in place on Friday, came just eight days after the formal relaunch of verification applications on May 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4pBwJ"&gt;When Twitter first reopened verification applications in May, it said that responses to applications would come back “within a few days,” but warned that they might take up to “a few weeks” depending on the volume of applications the company received. It’s not clear if you should expect similar timelines for a response following the pause and reopening.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook employees call for company to address concerns of Palestinian censorship</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5TaWJr"&gt;Facebook employees are circulating an internal petition calling for the company to investigate content moderation systems that led many Palestinians and allies to say their voices were being censored, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/19da5f33-1c83-42ae-993e-27529e89e8f7"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The news comes weeks after Israeli airstrikes killed more than 200 people in Gaza, including at least 63 children. Israel and Hamas have now reached a cease fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRgwOB"&gt;Palestinian activists and allies have long accused social media companies of censoring pro-Palestinian content — and the issue has only gotten worse during the recent conflict. At Facebook, content moderation decisions are made by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona"&gt;third-party contractors&lt;/a&gt; and algorithms, and the process is less than perfect, particularly in non-English speaking...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yes, the SEC has noticed Elon Musk’s Tesla stock price tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KXtzlFIP0mRJcJ5NfTzIQU--TEM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374615/acastro_191204_1777_elon_legal_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NN4hiI"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission believes Elon Musk has violated his 2018 settlement agreement twice, according to correspondence obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-failed-to-oversee-elon-musk-s-tweets-sec-argued-in-letters-11622582765?mod=hp_lead_pos2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between the SEC and Tesla. The agreement requires a lawyer to approve his tweets about the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bM6Vq"&gt;Tesla lawyers didn’t review Musk’s May 2020 tweet about how Tesla’s stock price was “too high imo” before he published it. The company’s lawyers also didn’t approve a July 2019 tweet about Musk’s goal to make 1,000 of Tesla’s solar roofs per week by the end of that year. The SEC sent the letters to Tesla in 2019 and 2020 shortly after each tweet, but has not taken any apparent enforcement action against Musk or the company.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZU9AIq"&gt;The Biden administration moved forward today with its plans to pause — and potentially halt — oil and gas drilling on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Department of the Interior (DOI) announced today that it suspended leases that the previous administration auctioned off to oil and gas developers just weeks before Donald&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Trump left office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6Sxhz"&gt;Today’s decision follows through on an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; President Joe&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Biden made on the same day of his inauguration, which asked the Secretary of the Interior to put a temporary moratorium on all oil and gas activities in the refuge. Oil and gas leases will be suspended while the Interior Department conducts a new environmental review, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-suspends-oil-and-gas-leases-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; issued today. Based on that...&lt;/p&gt;
