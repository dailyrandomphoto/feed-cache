    <title>How to keep your Zoom meetings safe and secure</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AkqYwl"&gt;Back in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, people who wanted to get together while staying safe from infection discovered that they could meet with friends, families, and co-workers via videoconferencing software. Maybe because many of them were already using Zoom at work for videoconferencing, that app almost immediately became the flavor of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EL3buM"&gt;There were a few hiccups along the way — possibly because Zoom was meant to be primarily a business app. At first, while Zoom included some methods that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197090/zoombombing-zoom-stop-how-to-porn-trolls-video-chat-screen-sharing"&gt;could be used to safeguard meetings&lt;/a&gt;, those features could be hard to find, especially if you hadn’t used the app before. Meetings began to be interrupted by unwanted intruders who would purposely cause disruptions, often in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221421/white-supremacist-zoombombers-target-jewish-community-zoom"&gt;extremely...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla removes 2022 production date from Cybertruck website</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-AUTOMOBILE-TESLA-CYBERTRUCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHnCt22c8lkRBRGEyw5o56tjyqs=/99x0:5469x3580/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382686/1183828053.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z9xAyc"&gt;Tesla has never been fantastic at meeting deadlines, so it’s not too surprising that the company’s ambitious electric pickup — the Cybertruck — is running a little late. Recently, reference to a 2022 production schedule was scrubbed from its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOP5XX"&gt;The Cybertruck was originally announced in 2019, with Tesla promising that the vehicle would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date"&gt;rolling off production lines&lt;/a&gt; in late 2021. Then, in August that year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;full production was delayed&lt;/a&gt; to some time in 2022. Now, that deadline seems to have been waived, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxWy3O"&gt;As first &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fcar-news%2Ftesla-cybertruck-delayed-2022.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F13%2F22881646%2Ftesla-cybertruck-production-date-2022-removed-website" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Edmunds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the order page on Tesla’s Cybertruck site previously told buyers: “You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in 2022.” Now, it just says: “You will be able to complete your...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TSMC earmarks record $44 billion for chip manufacturing expansion in 2022  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) logo..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_An3tBe8ijlf_XkLLLNYNqqtnco=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382501/1235442625.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IS1Fsl"&gt;Chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which supplies silicon for Apple, Qualcomm, and other tech giants, plans to spend as much as $44 billion to increase its manufacturing capacity in 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-q4-profit-rises-164-record-beats-market-forecasts-2022-01-13/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. In its latest earnings release, the Taiwanese firm said it expects capital spending to be between $40 and $44 billion in 2022, up from a previous record of $30 billion in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1NvrwD"&gt;It’s not an entirely unexpected increase, given the company’s previously announced plan to spend $100 billion on expanding its manufacturing capacity through 2023. But the record sum suggests it doesn’t expect demand for chips to slow down anytime soon, despite some analyst warnings of potentials slowdowns in areas like...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft has discontinued all Xbox One consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xbox One S" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qgy1x6lDvzje6GXgcOIy5rfTnwk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382421/tpina_160731_1175_0065.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qgL2LC"&gt;Microsoft has stopped manufacturing all Xbox One consoles. The software giant originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327330/microsoft-xbox-one-x-s-digital-edition-discontinued"&gt;discontinued the Xbox One X&lt;/a&gt; and digital Xbox One S ahead of the Xbox Series X launch, then quietly stopped manufacturing the Xbox One S at the end of 2020, leaving retailers to sell out their remaining stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTmUJS"&gt;“To focus on production of Xbox Series X / S, we stopped production for all Xbox One consoles by the end of 2020,” says Cindy Walker, senior director of Xbox console product marketing, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkz9Ba"&gt;Microsoft’s confirmation comes just as a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-12/sony-tackles-playstation-5-shortage-by-making-more-ps4-consoles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; suggested Sony had planned to end PS4 production at the end of 2021, but that the company will now manufacture around a million PS4 consoles in 2022. Sony has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880062/ps4-manufacturing-sony-ps5-shortage-xbox-one"&gt;confirmed PS4...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nigeria lifts Twitter ban, says the company has agreed to government demands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sS8nBOye7jvdBQ_Z-xJUh8xgrGQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382413/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XWgZty"&gt;Nigeria has lifted its ban on Twitter, first instated on June 5th, 2021. The Nigerian government says Twitter has agreed to meet all of its demands, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/12/africa/nigeria-lifts-twitter-ban-intl/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These include Twitter opening a local office in Nigeria, addressing concerns over its tax payments, and “managing prohibited publication in line with Nigerian law.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dGTz9"&gt;This last condition is particularly important, as the original ban was condemned by many international agencies as an act of censorship. The Nigerian government banned Twitter in 2021 just days after the company deleted a tweet by the country’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, that &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-57336571"&gt;threatened secessionists&lt;/a&gt; in Nigeria’s southeast region. Some had interpreted the tweet as threatening genocide for its...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NHhkXv"&gt;The PC market experienced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;first big growth&lt;/a&gt; in a decade during 2020, when the pandemic began to force people to work and learn from home. Market research firms &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-01-12-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-declined-5-percent-in-fourth-quarter-of-2021-but-grew-nearly-10-percent-for-the-year"&gt;Gartner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48770422"&gt;IDC&lt;/a&gt; are now reporting that the worldwide PC market has grown again throughout 2021, as demand for traditional PCs continued during a global chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaFs5v"&gt;Nearly 340 million PCs were shipped in 2021, according to Gartner. That’s a nearly 10 percent increase over the already unprecedented numbers seen in 2020. IDC puts the figure at 348.8 million, up nearly 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dropbox finally supports M1 Macs natively with new beta  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xv4a7Da6mIzYtDnjwZyi7U2b_F0=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382333/dropbox_logo_2x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dropbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jy6cmn"&gt;Dropbox’s latest beta has added native support for Macs with M1 processors, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/dropbox-releases-long-awaited-macos-version-with-native-m1-support-in-beta/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The addition was confirmed by a Dropbox community manager on the &lt;a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-installs-integrations/Apple-Silicon-M1-Desktop-Sync-Compatibility/td-p/527743"&gt;company’s forums&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve verified it by installing the latest beta of the macOS app. You can grab it yourselves from &lt;a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-desktop-client-builds/Beta-Build-140-3-1903/td-p/570154"&gt;this Dropbox forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59drqh"&gt;The service has always worked on Apple’s M1 Macs, but until now it’s had to use Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer. This allowed the macOS app, which was originally designed for old Intel-based Macs, to run on machines with Apple’s new M1 processors. Offering native M1 support should result in Dropbox having better performance and consuming less power when used with Apple Silicon devices. That said, Rosetta translation is so fast you might not...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and T-Mobile say iOS 15.2 didn’t switch off iCloud Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5mAZc705qkg0L06yKrgETfWWVw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70381863/vpavic_210916_4760_0323.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qF06W"&gt;Apple has denied that last month’s iOS 15.2 update is behind the difficulty some iPhone owners have faced with using the iCloud Private Relay feature on cellular networks. Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile earlier this week said they weren’t blocking the VPN-like feature, but T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22878885/verizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have identified that iOS 15.2 toggled it off by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F54OgM"&gt;Now Apple says that’s not the case. After releasing an updated beta of iOS 15.3 that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880835/apple-clarify-icloud-private-relay-error-messages-ios-15-3-cell-carriers"&gt;clarifies the language&lt;/a&gt; in iCloud settings, Apple &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/apple-reaffirms-icloud-private-relay-availability-refutes-t-mobiles-accusation-of-a-bug-ios-15-2/"&gt;issued a statement to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; saying that iOS 15.2 wasn’t the problem. “No changes were made to iCloud Private Relay in iOS 15.2 that would have toggled the feature off,” the statement reads. “Users are encouraged to check their Settings to see if Private Relay is...&lt;/p&gt;
