    <title>Corsair’s latest headset has improved comfort, but it backpedaled on sound</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eYYQNi"&gt;Corsair impressed me last year with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525271/corsair-hs75-xb-wireless-review-pc-xbox-specs-features-price"&gt;$150 HS75 XB Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, an Xbox-exclusive wireless headset that looked and felt more like a high-end set of headphones than a gaming accessory. They also had great sound quality and an easy-to-learn button layout with the right amount of features. It wasn’t necessarily a flaw that they only worked with Xbox consoles, but no one likes to be excluded. The company has now released the HS80 RGB Wireless for the same $150 price &lt;em&gt;with &lt;/em&gt;PlayStation compatibility, but these aren’t quite the successor that I was expecting or hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQpi7W"&gt;This one works with the PS4, PS5, as well as PC with its USB-A wireless transmitter. Unlike most wireless headsets that use a dongle like this, I couldn’t get it to work with...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel shows off its answer to Nvidia’s DLSS, coming to Arc GPUs in 2022</title>

&lt;p id="z3m6e0"&gt;XeSS looks set to take on Nvidia’s own Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) tech, will make its debut alongside the first Arc GPU architecture, known as Alchemist, in early 2022. Much like DLSS, it will upscale games from a lower resolution to provide smoother frame rates without a noticeable compromise in image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlTdfg"&gt;Intel is also using dedicated Xe-cores in its upcoming GPUs to power its XeSS technology, with dedicated Xe Matrix...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel previews its Alder Lake chip, promises hybrid CPUs for desktops and laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ne-gykhLSYM1E3ocw-cCRf0_wS8=/172x0:1483x874/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746856/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_8.32.05_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sB5Wie"&gt;Intel has spent much of 2021 announcing plans for its future: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;a new IDM 2.0 strategy&lt;/a&gt;, new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;naming schemes for its process nodes&lt;/a&gt;, and new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626912/intel-arc-gpu-brand-alchemist-codename-release-date"&gt;desktop GPUs&lt;/a&gt;. At Intel’s Architecture Day 2021, we finally got a preview of how some of those changes are coming together in new chips, starting with the upcoming Alder Lake lineup later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVi8wD"&gt;As the company has been teasing since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/13/21365544/intel-tiger-lake-11th-gen-xe-graphics-gpu-preview-first-look-architecture-day-2020"&gt;last year’s Architecture Day&lt;/a&gt;, Alder Lake will feature Intel’s latest hybrid architecture: instead of simply offering the next generation of powerful Intel CPU cores, it’ll offer a mix of both performance and efficiency x86 cores, both of which Intel previewed as part of its announcements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15o7Rb"&gt;Additionally, Alder Lake will be the first chip released on Intel’s newly renamed...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM and AT&amp;T are teaming up to bring 5G to Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC cars by 2024</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1GbrA"&gt;General Motors and AT&amp;amp;T are partnering to bring 5G connectivity to “millions” of vehicles over the next decade. The improved connectivity will mean better software performance, enhanced navigation, and faster music and video streaming capabilities, company officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Z8AfB"&gt;Starting with model year 2024, all Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC vehicles will come equipped with 5G. In addition, all of GM’s current model year 2019 and newer vehicles, which are equipped with 4G LTE, will experience “faster connectivity speeds and many of the same performance benefits of future 5G-equipped vehicles” thanks to GM’s fifth-generation cellular network architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vp45w4"&gt;In other words, cars made in 2019 and beyond will have improved data speeds and software...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s first portable monitor looks like it was yanked off an XPS laptop</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LvOX4H"&gt;Dell has announced a 14-inch portable USB-C monitor that’s priced at $349.99 and will be released globally on August 31st. It has a 1080p LED-backlit IPS panel (60Hz refresh rate, 6ms response time) and you can use it as a secondary display for your USB-C laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mM02qc"&gt;The monitor, which Dell refers to as the C1422H, has narrow bezels and a minimalist design that makes it look as if it came off an XPS laptop. It features a built-in stand that tilts between 10 and 90 degrees. The portable monitor weighs less than two pounds, and it can reach a peak brightness of 300 nits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXKEmn"&gt;There’s a USB-C port on each side of the base, both of which can receive and pass through power; they can also handle a video feed via DisplayPort 1.2 alt mode. You can get...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Binance is facing an unconventional new legal claim over May 19th outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOgyRn"&gt;A group of disgruntled investors is pursuing a formal claim against the cryptocurrency platform Binance for allegedly causing millions in damages through an unanticipated outage earlier this year. Filed in an international business arbitration court, the case represents the largest investor action ever brought against a cryptocurrency platform, and a major test of the rights of investors speculating in digital currency markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sWawv"&gt;The case stems from &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2021/05/19/coinbase-binance-outage-crypto-bitcoin-crash/"&gt;a widespread service outage on May 19th&lt;/a&gt;, which coincided with a massive drop in the price of Bitcoin. Binance wasn’t the only platform affected, as a mass selloff clogged blockchain transactions and overwhelmed reserves, but the complex financial products offered by the platform made the damage...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ghost of Tsushima’s purring cats might be my favorite PS5 feature</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1g0Jn2"&gt;Since the PlayStation 5 debuted, we’ve seen lots of novel uses of its DualSense controller. Game developers have utilized the haptic vibrations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"&gt;to simulate weather like falling rain or blowing wind&lt;/a&gt;, while the added resistance in the triggers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"&gt;makes firing a weapon or making an exhausted NBA star sprint all the more immersive&lt;/a&gt;. Often these features help make seemingly small interactions feel more notable — and my favorite new example is the cats in &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; on the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKFu6D"&gt;The new version isn’t really a director’s cut, at least in the typical sense, but rather an enhanced version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai"&gt;the open-world samurai game&lt;/a&gt; that originally launched as the last big PS4 exclusive in 2020. That game married a fairly standard open-world...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil’s upcoming Wear OS smartwatch leaks with Snapdragon 4100 Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VC0jv4LrCJPoRtwaAburEShrUf8=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746604/ezgif_6_c24c8ad20bec.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fossil’s Gen 6 smartwatch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124696.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qXHst6"&gt;Fossil’s upcoming Gen 6 smartwatch has leaked thanks to a retailer listing &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124696.html"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, it appears to be Fossil’s first smartwatch with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307368/qualcomm-snapdragon-4100-google-wear-os-smartwatch-wearables-faster-battery-life"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 4100 Plus processor&lt;/a&gt;, which launched last year but has so far only appeared on a handful of devices. The new watch follows Fossil’s Gen 5 lineup, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835364/fossil-wear-os-smartwatch-android-gen-5-review-price-specs-features"&gt;dates back to 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223834/fossil-gen-5-lte-smartwatch-announcement-skagen-michael-kors"&gt;new LTE-equipped models&lt;/a&gt; this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiG2Ij"&gt;The Gen 6 will be Fossil’s first Wear OS smartwatch since Google announced it was collaborating with Samsung on the third-generation of its operating system. But based on currently available information, the wearable is unlikely to launch with the new software. When Google announced its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/118166873/what-wear-os-3-means-for-you?hl=en-GB"&gt;Wear OS 3 update plans in July&lt;/a&gt; it said that Fossil’s...&lt;/p&gt;
