  &lt;p id="zXFrPb"&gt;Need a new phone? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are a great time to be shopping for a phone for yourself or as a gift to your nearest and dearest this holiday season. This is the time of year when retailers and carriers are dropping their best deals, whether it’s to make room for next year’s models or to sign up new cellular customers. Android users can cash in on a number of excellent deals from the likes of Samsung, Google, OnePlus, and Motorola; however, Apple is notoriously stingy when it comes to iPhone discounts. You might get a gift card or a pair of AirPods when buying an iPhone, or a carrier might offer a higher trade-in value for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22684911/iphone-13-true-cost-of-free-phone-iphone-13-pro"&gt;“free” iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPtDSg"&gt;Here are all the best Black Friday weekend phone deals we’ve found so far. If...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best early Cyber Monday deals for PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch and PC gaming</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EIiXqs"&gt;Gamers are served up all kinds of great deals throughout the year. It’s not uncommon for recently released games to drop as much as 20 percent off in the first few months of release or to snag the occasional one-off deal on a controller or headset. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22803553/black-friday-2021-best-tech-deals-still-available-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"&gt;Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; is something special — a chance to get in on the year’s best offers all at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lUgdw"&gt;Like 2020, the holidays in 2021 are a bit peculiar, what with the ongoing pandemic and chip shortage. There’s no shortage of games and accessories, but fewer consoles are available for first-time buyers to gift, which means the opportunities to get one are very rare and very popular. Some retailers have even taken to charging subscription fees that offer you a boosted chance of getting a console,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Friday 2021 weekend smart home tech deals: speakers, cameras, robots, and more </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZzBxpdIVD7rM7z674DaQ5xUPd_E=/0x0:6033x4022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70178330/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 8 is one of many smart speakers and displays on sale this smart home buying season.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uNHMij"&gt;There is never a better time to dive into the smart home than Black Friday and its close cousin Cyber Monday. Traditionally, tech deals on home gadgets are huge this time of year, plus, it’s the only time you’ll find real bargains on gear from some of the smaller companies, such as Eve, Level, and Nanoleaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjy6kh"&gt;Whether you’re thinking about dipping a toe into this home automation shindig with a smart speaker or maybe a connected door lock, or want to bolster an already impressive smart home setup, it’s worth investing some cash this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRU2qz"&gt;Also, if you just want to upgrade your home cleaning routine or have a way to check in on Fido now that you’re back at work (the separation anxiety is real), this is a good time to get a great...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max accidentally added the TV-14 version of Birds of Prey</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VIgxJSnK3gTlD3ckGF_XXhfQdvw=/9x0:1364x903/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70198130/birdsofprey.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OKPAaa"&gt;HBO mistakenly added the censored version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126386/birds-of-prey-review-margot-robbie-dc-joker"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to its streaming service, but said it will replace it with the R-rated version soon, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/birds-of-prey-hbo-max-edit-unsured-fixed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CBR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hv1g47"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Or… counterpoint. We have a version of the film that airs on broadcast cable and the unedited version of the film for streaming which has been up for a year (which the original post on CBR noted). Will be updated on Max.&lt;/p&gt;— Johanna Fuentes (@jfuentes) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jfuentes/status/1464425626627104776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FjKkEl"&gt;Johanna Fuentes, the head of communications at HBO’s parent company WarnerMedia, confirmed there are two versions of the film: a clean one for broadcast cable, and an unedited version for streaming. Fuentes notes that the &lt;em&gt;Birds of Prey&lt;/em&gt; will be “updated on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Cyber Monday deals at Best Buy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RVBluv"&gt;Several retailers started early with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; in advance of the hectic, no-holds-barred weekend that kicks off right after Thanksgiving. Best Buy is one of a few — aside from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784145/amazon-black-friday-2021-best-deals-tech-cyber-monday"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22783434/target-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday-tech-games"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; — that got things started particularly early this year. If you’ve been paying attention to our Black Friday / Cyber Monday coverage, you’ve likely noticed dozens of deals peppered in, but that’s just a sampling. There’s more where that came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aro9Wa"&gt;Before we get into it, we’ve included some resources below that should make your Cyber Monday shopping experience a little better. And to make things more fun, you can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22771977/mystery-bag-sweepstakes-gear-tech-entry-rules-black-friday-2021-holidays"&gt;enter our sweepstakes for a chance to win a mystery bag&lt;/a&gt; filled with stuff from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s tech closet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals you can still get on Apple devices</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvAANe"&gt;Ironically, if you’re looking for Apple discounts ahead of Cyber Monday, you won’t find them at Apple, even if the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/shopping-event"&gt;bundling Apple gift cards with almost all of its latest products&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t fear, however, as there are plenty of reliable third-party retailers like Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Best Buy that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwzsMr"&gt;Many of these retailers started discounting some of the most popular Apple products ahead of Cyber Monday, dropping prices on everything from the latest MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch Series 7.  Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals we’ve found by category, and we’ll continue to update this piece as more deals are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nunE44"&gt;Also, if you’re looking to save even more, make sure to check out our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best Black...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="K6KslT"&gt;If you’ve been tracking Amazon’s lead-up to Black Friday like we have, you’ve likely seen the online retail giant rebrand its “Deal of the Day” page to “Epic Daily Deals” and finally full on “Black Friday Deals.” We’re now past Black Friday, and that landing page has transformed once again ii this time to Cyber Monday. Amazon has a slew of deals worth jumping on now if time is of the essence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n6ej8I"&gt;Google is holding onto &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/collection/offers?hl=en-US"&gt;most of its deals from Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s a lot to like if you’re in the market for a Pixel, Chromecast, or Nest device. The search giant kicked off the deals in the Google Store early, and now many of the big-name retailers are offering equivalent deals on the same items. Google even advertises these deals as running until December 1st, a few days after Cyber Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShDHRU"&gt;There are still many great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; that are live in addition to our retailer-specific roundups for sales at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22783434/target-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday-tech-games"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784145/amazon-black-friday-2021-best-deals-tech-cyber-monday"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.
