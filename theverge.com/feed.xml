    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PvCD0L"&gt;Best Buy was one of the first retailers to launch Black Friday deals — all the way back in mid-October to go up against Amazon Prime Day. Now that Black Friday is actually here, with Cyber Monday quickly approaching, Best Buy is back with a bunch of great sales that you can take advantage of. And, you can do all of your shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7NDsp"&gt;Below, you’ll find the best deals currently happening at Best Buy.

    <title>ByteDance gets another extension from US government for TikTok sale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wiQPhEt2SZRp3jouY9g5prwQhUU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67993480/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="35nQQt"&gt;The Trump administration has once again extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell video sharing platform TikTok’s business in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-tiktok/refile-us-grants-bytedance-new-seven-day-extension-of-tiktok-sale-order-filing-idUSL1N2IB2E5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has given China-based ByteDance until December 4th to either sell or spin out its US business, according to a court filing. CFIUS reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/26/bytedance-gets-another-week-to-sell-tiktok-us.html"&gt;granted the extension&lt;/a&gt; “to allow time to review a revised submission” that it recently received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5AMbbq"&gt;President Trump said in August that TikTok and its parent company were a national security risk to the US, and issued the initial order requiring TikTok to sell its US business. Trump’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21358093/trump-tik-tok-ban-bytedance-transactions-executive-order"&gt;order would have blocked&lt;/a&gt; all US transactions with ByteDance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7PfG9"&gt;In September, the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445060/trump-tiktok-wechat-ban-us-apple-app-store-google-play-commerce-department"&gt;Commerce Department...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rzQIrV"&gt;Amazon is hosting a wide variety of tech deals for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The company started its deal festivities early by knocking down prices for many of its own devices, including some of its newer products that hadn’t yet seen any discounts. The fourth-generation Echo smart speaker, the latest Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi routers, and more are all discounted right now, in addition to several other Amazon devices, such as the company’s entire range of Fire TV streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7OYsE"&gt;Of course, more deals will come for Cyber Monday, and we’ll be including the best deals we find below. The latest deals to hit the wire will be at the top, while the others will be organized by category. If your search for gifts spans wider than what Amazon has...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals on noise-canceling headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WmMrK3"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones are an important piece of tech if you enjoy having zero distractions or outside noise while you jam to funky tunes or listen to podcasts. And, as you might have expected, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are a good time to invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC95lA"&gt;While not as convenient as popping earbuds into your ears, noise-canceling headphones do a better job of erasing sound distractions when stacked up against popular wireless earbuds like Apple’s AirPods Pro or Jabra’s 75t. But if you prefer earbuds over headphones, we have rounded up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611428/black-friday-earbuds-deals-wireless-cyber-monday"&gt;the best wireless earbud deals this Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVgfg2"&gt;We are picking out all of the best deals going on right now on several brands that offer noise-canceling headphones. If you want more deals for other tech...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="9yLHtZ"&gt;Whether you’re shopping for a student, an older relative, or anyone in between, a laptop can make a great gift. And the internet’s largest retailers are offering all kinds of laptops at discounted prices this Black Friday and Cyber Monday, whether you’re looking for a convertible, a Chromebook, a gaming rig, or anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8Tv9N"&gt;Note that for some models, only certain configurations may be on sale. Make sure to double-check the specs of the item you’re buying to make sure they’ll suit your workload (and that you’re actually getting the discount) before you check out.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7QychB"&gt;Black Friday is here. You know the deal: it’s the biggest shopping day of the year, followed closely by Cyber Monday, which is happening first thing next week. As you’re expecting, there are some great deals on tech, including TVs, laptops, gadgets, video games, and much more — we have it all below. Unlike most years, the ongoing pandemic saw retailers releasing some of their best Black Friday deals earlier than ever, giving shoppers more opportunities to snag gifts. With that, a few deals might look a little familiar, but we’ve aimed to put in just as many brand-new deals that are hitting for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHCSuC"&gt;We’ll be doing our best to keep this post updated during Black Friday, and through the weekend so that you can be certain that...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="gsuB8J"&gt;Tony Hsieh, the former CEO of online shoe retailer Zappos has died, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zappos.com%2Fe%2Fcelebrating-tony%3Fpf_rd_r%3D8506F54544A14D348B7E%26pf_rd_p%3Df021b9ec-f559-4263-a6e3-c07b8bbcfe92&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F28%2F21723817%2Fformer-zappos-ceo-tony-hsieh-dies#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company confirmed Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. Hsieh retired from the Las Vegas-based company in August, after 20 years at the helm. Under his leadership, &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/tony-hsieh-retired-zappos-ceo-dies-46-74435443"&gt;Zappos became known&lt;/a&gt; for its customer service and employee-focused company culture.

&lt;p id="XNCHo3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/02/amazon-closes-zappos-deal-ends-up-paying-1-2-billion/"&gt;Amazon acquired Zappos for $1.2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, and kept Hsieh on as CEO. &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/20100601/why-i-sold-zappos.html"&gt;He said in 2010&lt;/a&gt; he had decided to sell to the e-commerce giant because Amazon recognized “the uniqueness of Zappos’s culture and Amazon’s duty to protect it. We think of Amazon as a giant consulting company that we can hire if we want—for instance, if we need help redesigning...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhitJa"&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; this year, you can expect to find many of the best wireless earbuds on sale for their lowest prices yet. Apple’s AirPods Pro, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus, and other popular models from Jabra, Sony, 1More, and more companies have never been more affordable. If you haven’t yet treated yourself to a set of truly wireless earbuds that connect via Bluetooth, prepare to never look back to using wired earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAI1eM"&gt;We have collected deals across multiple retailers below, and they’re all significantly lower than their usual asking price. As new deals become available or go out of stock, we’ll update this post.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXFrPb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; and Cyber Monday are each a good time of the year to consider upgrading your phone. Whether you’re looking for a deal through a carrier or you’d rather get an unlocked phone, you can save during the holiday season. The best deals on phones for Black Friday are on Android devices, including newer models from Google, Samsung, OnePlus, and more. Predictably, these big price cuts don’t apply to iPhones. Nothing new there, but there is a gift card promo happening if you are interested in picking one up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMRuMl"&gt;Below, you’ll find the best deals we’ve found so far. If you buy an unlocked phone, there won’t be any strings attached to the purchase. If we include a carrier promotion, we’ll be sure to thoroughly list out each requirement...&lt;/p&gt;
