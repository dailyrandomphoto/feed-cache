  &lt;p id="YRrncq"&gt;A ransomware attack last week has left an Albuquerque area jail without access to its camera feeds and rendered automatic door mechanisms unusable. Inmates have been confined to their cells as a result, while technicians struggled to bring systems back online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ic2jk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/2459954/cyber-attack-leads-to-jail-lockdown-settlement-violations.html"&gt;As first reported by the Albuquerque Journal&lt;/a&gt;, visitor access to the Metropolitan Detention Center was completely suspended as the jail was put into lockdown. All internet services at the jail were also knocked offline, leaving staff unable to look up inmate records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tgT7cp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All county internet services at the jail were also knocked offline, leaving staff unable to look up inmate records&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s9jt6h"&gt;Based on the lack of camera coverage, all inmates within the facility were placed on lockdown from the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will redo Bessemer union election on February 4th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NLRB said Amazon broke labor laws in the original election.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4ob1ga"&gt;The second union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama will begin on February 4th, according to a notice posted Tuesday by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which you can read below. The election is a redo of the one that was carried out in 2021, the results of which were declared invalid by the regulatory agency after reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;Amazon had broken labor laws&lt;/a&gt; during the union drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzk62X"&gt;The election will be carried out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;almost a year after&lt;/a&gt; workers originally voted on whether to unionize Amazon’s BHM1 facility. The union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;lost that election nearly two-to-one&lt;/a&gt; but disputed the results, taking issue with a mailbox that employees feared Amazon had access to. The mailbox was installed by the USPS, at Amazon’s request, and at...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peer-to-peer car-sharing service Turo files to go public </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWkSHp"&gt;Turo, the peer-to-peer car-sharing service, has filed for its initial public offering, the latest transportation-related startup to sell its shares on a public stock exchange. The company proposes to sell $100 million of stock, but that figure could change as Turo gets closer to its public debut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2jBdJ"&gt;Founded in 2010, the San Francisco-based company allows people to rent out their personal cars to other customers, much like Airbnb does for homes. In its &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1514587/000119312522005696/d145731ds1.htm#toc145731_4"&gt;S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;, Turo claims it has 85,000 active hosts (meaning vehicle owners), 161,000 active vehicles, and 1.3 million active guests over the period of 12 months ending September 30th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop and Best Buy have Xbox Series X consoles for order right now (update: sold out at Best Buy)</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LfYRnO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:58PM ET, January 11th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Best Buy has sold out of consoles for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZecdP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:30PM ET, January 11th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; GameStop still has both bundles available, and now &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoIQEe59VB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has restocked Xbox Series X consoles. They are available for the standard $499.99 without a bundle. As usual for Best Buy, it is based on local availability at stores in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxxl53"&gt;Another week, another restock of Xbox Series X consoles at GameStop. Hopefully this is a trend that new console availability is opening up in 2022 to a point where soon anyone will be able to walk into a store and pick up their hardware of choice without any fuss. While we’re not quite there yet, the restocks are remaining fairly consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJl8WL"&gt;GameStop has two Xbox Series X console bundles today,...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fqGsRT"&gt;But first, one exciting announcement: On Air Fest &lt;a href="http://onairfest.com/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its in-person return last week with plans to take over Brooklyn’s Wythe Hotel on February 25th and 26th. Here’s the bigger news for us, though: &lt;strong&gt;Hot Pod Summit is returning on February 24th &lt;/strong&gt;as part of the festival&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;For the new folks here, Hot Pod Summit is an invite-only industry conference where we’ll discuss the topics of the moment, interview big names in the space, and broadly, network with the people you want to know.

    <title>Facebook contractors threaten to stop work over missing paychecks</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h0d8Nd"&gt;Facebook moderators at an Accenture site in Austin are facing a payroll disaster that has left many without their holiday paychecks. Workers at the site handle moderation, customer service, and other tasks for Facebook and WhatsApp — and a work stoppage has already been threatened if the situation is not resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wObVO"&gt;The problems began as early as January 4th, when some workers noticed errors in the system that tracks paid time off (PTO), a clerical confusion that was attributed to a recent change in payroll providers at the site. Things got more serious when the January 6th round of paychecks failed to arrive. Internal pay stub systems showed many paychecks as zeroed out, and workers were left with no idea of when they might get their...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego delays Overwatch 2 set as company reevaluates relationship with Activision Blizzard</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0pR7jA"&gt;The name &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; has become synonymous with delay. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrickfan.com/lego-overwatch-2-titan-76980-release-delayed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brick Fan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Lego review site, the extremely popular toymaker is delaying the release of an &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;-themed set as the company reviews its relationship with &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; publisher Activision Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0kCm0"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Alice Carter, Lego’s senior manager of corporate brand communication, said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="v8tJzR"&gt;We are currently reviewing our partnership with Activision Blizzard given concerns about the progress being made to address continuing allegations regarding workplace culture, especially the treatment of female colleagues and creating a diverse and inclusive environment. While we complete the review we will pause the release of a LEGO Overwatch 2 product...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Roku rolls out all-new Live TV Zone </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c7Jyb6"&gt;Roku is making live TV even easier to find with its new Live TV Zone, a one-stop shop for all things live and linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCO67T"&gt;The Live TV Zone will be home to not only Roku’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628020/roku-live-tv-guide-17-new-channels"&gt;Live TV Channel Guide&lt;/a&gt;, which previously existed as a &lt;a href="https://channelstore.roku.com/details/1ac1f6c4b2a10445e55c6fca4f14d064/live-tv-on-the-roku-channel"&gt;standalone channel&lt;/a&gt;, but also third-party services like YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, and Sling, among other apps. Users will also find their recently watched content in this tab, in addition to entertainment programming, sports, and local and national news coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3XfVP"&gt;The Live TV Zone can be found under the Live TV tab from the left-hand navigation menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2dmRr"&gt;Roku has been leaning heavily into its live TV features. The company last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22680133/roku-os-10-5-update"&gt;expanded voice command support&lt;/a&gt; for its live TV guide with the Roku OS 10.5 update. It...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J2zQlb"&gt;A judge appointed by the National Labor Relations Board has ruled that Google must turn over some 180 documents related to an internal campaign to fight union organizing efforts by employees. Dubbed Project Vivian, a Google attorney described the ongoing effort between 2018 and 2020 as a way to “engage employees more positively and convince them that unions suck,” according to one of the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJs7zB"&gt;The documents are part of a case the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint"&gt;NLRB brought against Google&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020, which alleged the internet giant violated US labor law by spying on and firing employees who were organizing protests and trying to unionize. Former Google employee Laurence Berland, fired in 2019, was organizing against the company’s hiring of IRI Consultants,...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xWWkGA"&gt;Microsoft is announcing a new matte black option of its Surface Go 3 today, with optional LTE connectivity. The announcement comes just a day after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876137/microsoft-surface-go-3-matte-black-leak-images"&gt;images of the new Surface Go 3 model leaked online&lt;/a&gt;, with a new matte black finish. The new color option and LTE connectivity are the only changes, as it’s identical to the regular Surface Go 3 otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5YBnY"&gt;Microsoft first launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684608/microsoft-surface-go-3-processor-specs-price-features"&gt;Surface Go 3 in September&lt;/a&gt;, with new Intel processor options. The Surface Go 3 can be configured with an Intel Pentium Gold 6500Y or Core i3-10100Y, upgrades over the Surface Go 2, which launched with a Pentium Gold 4425Y or a Core m3 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
