    <title>New York City’s mayor-elect says he wants to be paid in Bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="UfwR7l"&gt;New York City’s mayor-elect Eric Adams &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1456311827550384129"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that he wants his first three city paychecks paid in Bitcoin, in a bid to show up the mayor of Miami and indicate his hopes that New York will be a place where the cryptocurrency industry is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rABvl"&gt;To put it lightly, the feasibility of Adams &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;getting paid in Bitcoin seems dicey. (Is the city’s payroll even set up for that? How will this work with the fluctuating price of Bitcoin? My goodness, what’s the &lt;em&gt;tax&lt;/em&gt; situation going to be like?) Whether it actually happens or not, though, he’s sending a clear message about his intended plans as a mayor — you probably wouldn’t say something like that if you’re going to ignore cryptocurrency and Bitcoin completely. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian accused of ‘toxic bro culture’ in gender discrimination lawsuit</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3MGjZE"&gt;EV startup Rivian’s former sales and marketing vice president has sued the Amazon-backed company for discrimination, claiming it has a “toxic bro culture that marginalizes women.” The suit, first &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-rivian-executive-sues-for-gender-discrimination-ahead-of-ipo-11636054512?st=ucjb0mosprg2pju&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;comes just days before Rivian is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"&gt;become a publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt;, and a few weeks after it started delivering its first electric vehicles to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UyVRH"&gt;Laura Schwab, the former VP, says she was fired last month after alerting a human resources executive about discrimination. She sued the company Thursday in Orange County Superior Court, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, though the complaint was not publicly available at the time this article was published. Scwhab also published &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@lauraschwab1/life-outside-the-boys-club-why-i-spoke-up-about-rivians-toxic-bro-culture-and-got-fired-15600b999ae7"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; Thursday titled “Life...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taika Waititi is making a movie based on Alejandro Jodorowsky’s The Incal comics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hunt For The Wilderpeople" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_Hu_HiKG9ElmzSjK077UzEhf9A=/248x0:1400x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095918/WaititiWilderpeople.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2EVUdI"&gt;Taika Waititi is set to co-write and direct an adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Incal&lt;/em&gt;, the sci-fi graphic novel from writer Alejandro Jodorowsky with art by Jean Giraud, better known as Moebius, according to a report &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/incal-movietaika-waititi-to-direct-1235041908/"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFuDL3"&gt;Jodorowsky’s name has been a popular one in Hollywood recently due to the release of the latest incarnation of &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year. Jodorowsky was famously working on a surreal and bizarre adaptation of the novel (alongside Moebius and H.R. Giger), but unfortunately was never able to get any major studios to take the risk on his idea. The journey of that process has since been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/14/5410996/jodorowskys-dune-documentary-trailer-adaptation-that-never-was"&gt;its own documentary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jodorowsky’s Dune. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoPro says the chip shortage won’t affect holiday sales</title>

  &lt;p id="Z9B6sv"&gt;GoPro &lt;a href="https://investor.gopro.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/GoPro-Announces-Third-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the global chip and other supply chain shortages won’t affect its holiday sales this year, meaning the action camera company is poised to finish one of its best years in recent memory in strong fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5jhL8"&gt;“Despite supply chain constraints that are affecting many industries, we have successfully partnered with our suppliers to produce inventory to support our fourth-quarter revenue expectations,” CEO Nick Woodman said while &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001500435/000150043521000065/gpro2021-09x30exh992xer.htm"&gt;discussing the company’s third-quarter financial results on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. “GoPro.com and our retail partners will be stocked and ready for shoppers this holiday season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLfdGb"&gt;That’s especially good news for GoPro’s bottom line because the new Hero10 Black is selling incredibly well despite the higher $499 price tag....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly will start phasing out mask requirements for US retail store customers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I0ozwj"&gt;Apple is reportedly planning to begin ending mask requirements for customers at some of its US retail stores as early as Friday (via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;). The company told employees about the change in an internal memo on Thursday,&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported, saying the decision was based on a decline in coronavirus cases and a rise in vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVxdeW"&gt;Like many companies with multiple locations, Apple has changed its masking requirements for customers more than once since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic last year. In March 2020, the company closed most of its retail stores &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/17/21261921/apple-stores-reopening-plans-us-locations"&gt;as the virus spread&lt;/a&gt;. It began reopening &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/17/21261921/apple-stores-reopening-plans-us-locations"&gt;some US stores in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, with many offering only curbside service and not allowing customers inside. Most stores that did open to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on an Android phone </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5oizS_GANTpgtYInVRbIaqiy_-0=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095406/Screenshot_20211104_150854.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFc8fJ"&gt;Sometimes there’s no way around it — you’ve got to use an app. If you need to sign a PDF document from your Android phone, that’s simply how you’ve got to go — unlike iOS, which lets you create a signature using its built-in Markup app, you need to find a third-party source. There are a variety of apps available, but the most well-known is the free version of Adobe Acrobat Reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fTfgT"&gt;So if you want to be able to sign off on contracts and other PDF documents without having to grab your computer, here’s how to use the Android version of Acrobat to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6iryGy"&gt;Download and install Adobe Acrobat Reader from the Play Store. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bsdKWZ"&gt;Sign in (or create an account); if you’ve just installed the app, you may have to go through a number of popups offering...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>DoorDash adds in-app safety features, but couriers need more protection</title>

  &lt;p id="wMt3Ur"&gt;DoorDash is &lt;a href="https://doordash.news/2021/11/03/doordash-launches-safedash/"&gt;adding a set of tools for its delivery workers called “SafeDash,”&lt;/a&gt; which includes a way to contact an agent from the ADT security company or to call 911 through ADT. The company is first launching the tool in major cities like Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, but says it’ll roll out to all its US couriers by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYPydm"&gt;While it’s good that DoorDash is acknowledging the dangers its delivery workers face, some advocates say that SafeDash won’t help solve the problems of thieves targeting them for their money or bikes, and the apps giving them routes that put them in harm’s way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UXgXK"&gt;According to DoorDash, SafeDash will give delivery workers a button that will have an ADT agent call them if they feel...&lt;/p&gt;

They’re free to download and play, just like they are from Riot. When you get them from the Epic Games Store, your computer will install the Riot Client, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679479/riot-games-new-client-pc-launcher-library"&gt;Riot’s new unified launcher&lt;/a&gt;, which is where you can actually install and launch the individual games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yVeeO"&gt;This isn’t the first time Epic has offered a way to get another company’s launcher; you’ve been able to download the Itch.io launcher from the Epic Games Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22395997/epic-games-store-pc-apps-windows-store-brave-discord-itch"&gt;since April&lt;/a&gt;.
