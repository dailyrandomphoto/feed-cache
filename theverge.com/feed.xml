    <title>Facebook will now take down posts claiming vaccines cause autism</title>

  &lt;p id="7zzmqU"&gt;Facebook is expanding what false claims &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims"&gt;it will remove from its platforms&lt;/a&gt; related to COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccines, and vaccines in general starting today. The company began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;removing debunked COVID-19 claims&lt;/a&gt; in December of last year and notifying customers when they had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177085/facebook-covid-19-misinformation-notifications"&gt;interacted with a post that has false information&lt;/a&gt; that same month. But now the list of potential claims that could get a post removed has grown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyRP1M"&gt;Highlights from &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/230764881494641/"&gt;the new expanded list&lt;/a&gt; of false COVID-19 and vaccine-related claims that will be removed include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9vM27y"&gt;COVID-19 is man-made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GCcJuD"&gt;Vaccines are not effective at preventing the disease they were created to protect against&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h4igga"&gt;It’s safer to get a disease than to get its vaccine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hjr4Uh"&gt;Vaccines are dangerous, toxic, or cause autism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Zoom adds facial effects so you can look your weirdest during meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Zooms new Studio Effects feature lets you add facial hair, lip color and eyebrows in any color." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oUtLQ47mtmLcKg3C0Qsg6eIT-iQ=/14x0:1073x706/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789546/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_1.19.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KOH6fb"&gt;While Zoom was originally created as a serious meeting application for businesses, it has since become one of the most-used services during the pandemic for anyone who wants to have a face-to-face virtual conversation. As a result, the company has been adding more fun stuff, such as weird backgrounds, to use for online family gatherings, friend chats, and well, for business meetings. And now, it’s come up with a feature called Studio Effects that gives you the ability to add a variety of eyebrows, facial hair, and lip color to your video image during Zoom sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJ5rUG"&gt;The feature, still in beta, isn’t really new — &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360049041052-New-Updates-for-September-21-2020"&gt;Zoom announced it in September 2020&lt;/a&gt; — but this is the first time &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ParkerMolloy/status/1358880050989457408"&gt;many Zoom users are first discovering it&lt;/a&gt;. At any rate, it’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A West Virginia newspaper chain is suing Google and Facebook over digital ad revenue</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FlgPHE"&gt;The parent company of a West Virginia newspaper chain has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet, alleging the platforms are siphoning away much-needed digital ad revenue. It &lt;a href="https://www.editorandpublisher.com/stories/hd-media-files-first-of-its-kind-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-and-facebook,185360#"&gt;appears to be the first such lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; by a news organization against the digital giants and makes the argument that the platforms represent a digital monopoly that should be broken up, like Standard Oil or AT&amp;amp;T were back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGSDvu"&gt;“Google and Facebook have monopolized the digital advertising market thereby strangling a primary source of revenue for newspapers across the country,” according to the complaint filed by HD Media, which operates the Pulitzer Prize-winning &lt;em&gt;Charleston Gazette-Mail&lt;/em&gt; and several other West Virginia...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This laptop has seven times the average number of screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Expanscape Aurora 7 prototype" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mp7bdSSOZxpfsILFOdQ__IbhrYo=/1x0:2539x1692/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789392/aurora7hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Expanscape&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6tkVC"&gt;A company called Expanscape has created the most Inspector Gadget-like device that I’ve ever seen. It’s a laptop prototype called the Aurora 7 (a working title), and attached to its humongous black box of a chassis are six extra displays that extend out in every direction away from the main screen, each showing its own windows and applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdXSlV"&gt;If you’re like me, the first thought that comes to mind is “that poor hinge!” Yeah, poor hinge, indeed. Many laptop hinges don’t gracefully handle having one screen attached, let alone seven. Piggybacking on the main 17.3-inch 4K display are three other screens of the same size and resolution. Above the left and right displays is a single seven-inch 1200p monitor. You’ll also find one more...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hackers tampered with a water treatment facility in Florida by changing chemical levels</title>

  &lt;p id="XQGUMk"&gt;Hackers successfully infiltrated the computer system controlling a water treatment facility in the city of Oldsmar, Florida, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2021/02/08/someone-tried-to-poison-oldsmars-water-supply-during-hack-sheriff-says/"&gt;report from the &lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so, the hackers were able to remotely control a computer to change the chemical levels of the water supply, increasing the amount of sodium hydroxide before a supervisor was able to catch the act in real time and revert the changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZA5BE"&gt;“At no time was there a significant adverse effect on the water being treated,” Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said during a press conference on Monday, which was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkXDSOgLQ6M&amp;amp;ab_channel=PinellasSheriff"&gt;later posted to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. “Importantly, the public was never in danger.” Sodium hydroxide, commonly known as lye, is used in water to regulate acidity levels, the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Justice Department drops challenge to California net neutrality rules</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D0ONEO"&gt;The Justice Department dropped its 2018 lawsuit challenging California’s state net neutrality rules on Monday, removing one of the law’s major roadblocks preventing it from going into effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3qlBO"&gt;In 2017, the Trump Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776154/fcc-net-neutrality-vote-results-rules-repealed"&gt;voted to repeal&lt;/a&gt; the Obama-era internet regulations banning internet service providers, like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon, from throttling or blocking traffic and implementing paid fast lanes. The following year, California passed its own law instituting net neutrality rules at the state level. That law &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-net-neutrality-lawsuit-against-state-california-0"&gt;was quickly challenged&lt;/a&gt; by the Trump-led Justice Department, which argued that California’s law was preempted by the FCC’s 2017 repeal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eq2YZf"&gt;EA is making a big move into the world of mobile gaming with the acquisition of Glu Mobile, a developer best known for its work on celebrity-focused titles, based on stars like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/16/10287726/katy-perry-pop-glu-mobile-game"&gt;Katy Perry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/4/5966973/kim-kardashian-game"&gt;Kim Kardashian&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="a4Rw1O"&gt;“Mobile continues to grow as the biggest gaming platform in the world, and with the addition of Glu’s games and talent, we’re doubling the size of our mobile business,” EA CEO Andrew Wilson said in a statement.

Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but the Chowbotics team have all become DoorDash employees, and the company will operate independently within DoorDash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3hLeh"&gt;“We have long admired the work that Chowbotics has done to increase access to fresh meals, with its groundbreaking robotics product and vision,” DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang said in statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “With the Chowbotics team on board, we can explore new use cases and customers, providing another service to help our merchants grow.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New California law would exempt employees who speak out about discrimination from NDAs</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9dXsf"&gt;On Monday, California state Senator Connie Leyva introduced the Silenced No More Act, a bill that advocates say will protect employees who speak out about discrimination at work, even if they’ve signed nondisclosure agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raHVAj"&gt;“SB 331 will prevent workers from being forced to sign non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements that would limit their ability to speak out about harassment and discrimination in the workplace,” Leyva said in a statement. “It is unacceptable for any employer to try to silence a worker because he or she was a victim of any type of harassment or discrimination—whether due to race, sexual orientation, religion, age or any other characteristic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga9tqL"&gt;The newly introduced legislation builds on work by Ifeoma Ozoma, a...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="UakKY0"&gt;Mobile app developer Kosta Eleftheriou has a new calling that goes beyond software development: taking on what he sees as a rampant scam problem ruining the integrity of Apple’s App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7m4aTz"&gt;Eleftheriou, who created the successful Apple Watch keyboard app FlickType, has for the last two weeks been publicly criticizing Apple for lax enforcement of its App Store rules that have allowed scam apps, as well as apps that clone popular software from other developers, to run rampant. These apps enjoy top billing in the iPhone marketplace, all thanks to glowing reviews and sterling five-star ratings that are largely fabricated, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
