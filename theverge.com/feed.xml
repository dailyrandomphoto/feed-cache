    <title>Discord now has Threads</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sW1vwj"&gt;Discord is launching its Threads feature today to allow servers to improve the back-and-forth of conversations on the service. Threads is distinctly different from the Replies feature that Discord introduced last year, and users will be able to create new threaded conversations using a new “#” option across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and the web today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2InWF"&gt;Threads work very similar to how they do in many other chat clients, allowing Discord users to branch off a conversation away from a main channel feed. A separate feed is generated for threaded conversations, and Discord server admins will be able to control which members of a server can participate in threads. Moderators will even be able to remove people from threads if they’re...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is making accounts for users under 16 private by default</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook is making Instagram safer for young people while developing Instagram for under-13s. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8svW3F"&gt;Facebook-owned Instagram is introducing changes designed to make the app safer for young people. From now on, anyone signing up to the service who’s under the age of 16 (or under 18 in certain countries) will have their account set to private by default, though the option to switch to public will still be available. Anyone under these ages with a public account now will be sent a notification encouraging them to switch to private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZBQrL"&gt;Instagram has been edging toward making private accounts default for young people for a while. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333580/instagram-bans-adults-messaging-teens-safety-notice-prompt"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;, it started showing young people signing up to Instagram a message extolling the virtues of having a private account. Now, it’s making private the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iGkRlv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Advertisers will only be able to target people...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Watch Joby Aviation’s electric air taxi complete a 150-mile flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cupr_qOWdSn59_XVg8qeSdQlW-c=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638491/Joby_aircraft.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0F9iUM"&gt;Electric air taxis aren’t a real thing yet, but a host of well-financed startups are out to change that. Chief among them is Joby Aviation, an electric aviation company based in Northern California that just posted a noteworthy video of its six-rotor aircraft completing an impressive 150-mile flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdEvLu"&gt;Granted, it doesn’t sound too impressive, but it’s actually among the longest flights ever performed by an electric aircraft. It’s equivalent to a trip between Seattle and Vancouver, or Los Angeles to San Diego — the type of regional trip conducted hundreds of times a day by regional partners to major airlines. Swapping out those polluting airplanes for a zero-emissions aircraft like Joby’s could be a major step toward the reduction of CO2...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Sony ZV-E10 is an E-mount camera for vloggers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uxa1TITpx657RpcTJf1oTgdbKFc=/0x84:2015x1427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638487/zve10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZV-E10 features an E-mount for interchangeable lenses and a large, 24-megapixel sensor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="raXxxl"&gt;Sony has announced the ZV-E10, an APS-C interchangeable lens camera it hopes will appeal to the needs of vloggers. It brings &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328971/sony-zv-1-review-vlogging-4k-camera-price-specs-features"&gt;many of the features we liked from the fixed-lens ZV-1&lt;/a&gt; into a bigger sensor format, including shortcuts to focus and exposure settings vloggers may need to access quickly. Being a bigger camera, there are also some significant benefits that the pocketable ZV-1 didn’t have the real estate to accommodate, like a headphone jack, better battery life, and a larger sensor with more depth-of-field flexibility. And at $799 with a 16-50mm kit lens, it’s a pretty good deal — just over the ZV-1’s current $749 asking price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3b0f0n"&gt;While the ZV-E10 addresses many of our complaints with the ZV-1, the latter still has one feature not...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It looks like Fortnite’s next big event is happening on August 6th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SLt2Mcxds1aWUVNeecQNW62L0z4=/584x0:3221x1758/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638321/Fortnite_20210727091441.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFKsvC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s next big live event appears to be very close. After the game’s most recent update, a new alien ship can be found hovering over the center of the battle royale island, projecting a clock counting down to August 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VOzIP3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s experimental story is an attempt to create ‘the entertainment experience of the future’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSsaSA"&gt;Given &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s history with live events — which have included everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;a Galactus attack&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;an island-destroying black hole&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333635/fortnites-season-6-single-player-event-storytelling"&gt;an actual single-player mission&lt;/a&gt; — it seems likely this countdown will end in the latest such moment. Developer Epic, as always, is being cryptic about what’s happening. “Its intent doesn’t seem to be for harm,” &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-battle-royale-v17-21-update-the-plasma-cannon-enters-the-invasion"&gt;the developer says of the ship&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s predicted its purpose will become clearer in the near future.” &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-20-huge-fortnite-leak-points-to-upcoming-ariana-grande-concert"&gt;Previous leaks&lt;/a&gt; have also suggested an Ariana Grande concert is coming to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing officially reveals its $99 Ear (1) true wireless earbuds</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q6gBSR"&gt;Nothing, the consumer tech startup led by OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, has officially announced its Ear (1) true wireless earbuds. The noise-canceling buds launch after months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564819/nothing-earbuds-price-noise-cancellation-anc"&gt;teases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320915/nothing-true-wireless-earbuds-teenage-engineering-concept-1"&gt;concept images&lt;/a&gt;, and even a presale in which Nothing &lt;a href="https://nothing.tech/blogs/news/nothing-partners-with-stockx-on-first-ever-electronics-dropx"&gt;auctioned off 100 pairs of the earbuds&lt;/a&gt; prior to their official reveal. The Ear (1) earbuds will go on sale on August 17th across 45 countries including the US and UK, priced at $99 / £99 / €99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHqzqV"&gt;In a statement, Pei calls the Ear (1) “a breath of fresh air in a cluttered and indifferent market,” and said the earbuds will “[set] the tone for our connected digital world to come.” Pei has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; his plan for Nothing is to build up an ecosystem of devices across increasingly complex product...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3kGzHg"&gt;Unsurprisingly, Staples isn’t the only retailer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/7/26/22593999/apple-airpods-pro-homepod-mini-brydge-ipad-surface-keyboard-deal-sale"&gt;discounting the AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and other earbuds in the buildup to the fall semester. Best Buy, for instance, is currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747339834917966859#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering a sizable $40 discount&lt;/a&gt; on the second-gen Amazon Echo Buds, bringing the price of both the white and black models down to their lowest price since Prime Day. Now on sale for $80, the 2021 Echo Buds build upon their predecessors in a variety of ways, offering up effective noise cancellation, solid sound, and a first-rate passthrough mode that allows you to stay in tune with the world around you. They also support hands-free Alexa, meaning you can quickly check the weather, queue up your Discover Weekly in Spotify, and carry out a host of other voice-enabled tasks...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch’s data ‘black box’ poses research problems</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wyuJbq"&gt;A Harvard biostatistician is rethinking plans to use Apple Watches as part of a research study after finding inconsistencies in the heart rate variability data collected by the devices. Because Apple tweaks the watch’s algorithms as needed, the data from the same time period can change without warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0EuKP"&gt;“These algorithms are what we would call black boxes — they’re not transparent. So it’s impossible to know what’s in them,” JP Onnela, associate professor of biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and developer of the open-source data platform Beiwe, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttq0Sr"&gt;Onnela doesn’t usually include commercial wearable devices like the Apple Watch in research studies. For the most part, his teams use research-grade...&lt;/p&gt;

The company &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-07-27/here-are-the-first-publishers-and-platforms-getting-connected-with-spotifys-open-access-feature/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; multiple new partnerships today that’ll allow paid shows from third-party platforms and networks to be played on the app — something that’s been impossible until now because Spotify doesn’t support private RSS feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5c6tej"&gt;Among the platforms supporting the tech, called Open Access, are Acast, Memberful, Supporting Cast, Glow.fm, and Supercast. Networks supporting the tech include Vox Media and, more specifically, its Cafe Studios; Slate; Der Spiegel; and Mamamia. (Disclosure: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is owned by Vox Media.) You can see the full list &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-07-27/here-are-the-first-publishers-and-platforms-getting-connected-with-spotifys-open-access-feature/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with each platform and network...&lt;/p&gt;
