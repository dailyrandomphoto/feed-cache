    <title>The best Black Friday weekend deals on true wireless earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mEW4I7-PDUZK-9s8gXZGwyMhAcg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182193/20180319_airpods_mx4_vladsavov.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLBEwG"&gt;One of the most sought-after gifts every holiday — at least, ever since Apple removed the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone — has been true wireless earbuds. They are often the favored listening device of many people because they offer the most convenience, and they’re a product category that frequently goes on sale. Full-size headphones offer superior sound, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796131/black-friday-headphones-2021-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;those have their fair share&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday discounts&lt;/a&gt; to be had, but most casual listeners often prefer earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2rBqw"&gt;Here, we have rounded up all the best Black Friday / Cyber Monday deals we can find on wireless earbuds from Apple, Samsung, Bose, Jabra, Beats, and even Google, as well as a couple of lesser-known brands. Each has its own unique qualities or value proposition to...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m5eueH"&gt;Staples is still offering its Black Friday sales and is discounting a diverse range of items. While some are naturally very specific to office work  — the retailer is currently offering up to 60 percent printer paper, for example — there are also some solid deals on smart displays, earbuds, and other tech products, many of which can also be found in our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;. To help you take advantage of the best deals before they sell out, however, we’ve curated a list of some of the top discounts Staples is currently offering, from the HomePod mini to Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals still at Walmart</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Still plenty of deals to be had at Walmart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AtjyQ3"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; itself is over, several retailers are still offering significant discounts over the entire weekend — and Walmart is no exception. Right now, the retail giant is still dropping deals on everything from the AirPods Pro to the most popular TVs and streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uTIwf"&gt;We’ve featured a few of these items in our guide to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday deals you can still get&lt;/a&gt;, however, the list below highlights all of the best sales Walmart is offering across several categories rather than just a few. It’s perfect, then, for anybody who plans on shopping primarily at Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OVcC4"&gt;If you subscribe to Walmart Plus, the retailer’s equivalent to Amazon Prime, you’ll also gain access to the deals four hours in advance. Regardless of when you plan on...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The best TVs on Sale over Black Friday weekend&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmhxDE"&gt;4K TVs of all sizes and specs see price cuts several times throughout the year, but the time when we usually see the highest concentration of stellar deals is right now, as Black Friday weekend continues and Cyber Monday is just around the bend. You’ve ended up in the right place if you’re looking for a TV deal, and yes, that includes people interested in a TV that has every bell or whistle, with the highest contrast ratio and the right features to eke all of the visual splendor from PCs and the latest gaming consoles or something that’s quite the opposite. We’ll be highlighting affordable TVs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGhjh8"&gt;Our team at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is hard at work on compiling the best Black Friday deals, running the gamut of retailers participating, as well as...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5aO9CW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are often thought of as times to stock up on smaller investments on the cheap, like headphones, games, and other gadgets you may not have wanted to pay full price for. But it’s also a great time to save on big-ticket items, like that laptop you’ve maybe had your eye on. The shopping holidays have brought some seriously good discounts on laptops, whether you’re keen on sticking with Mac, or you want a Windows PC. Both often come in very slim designs, but for people who don’t mind a heavier laptop, we’ve included some gaming laptop picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UADRPQ"&gt;The kinds of deals you can get on laptops vary depending on the retailer, so that’s how we’ve split up the deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Iw3jHO"&gt;Razer is offering a $200 gift card to its online...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Owlet puts smart baby monitoring socks on hold after FDA warning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jbm1SS"&gt;Owlet has stopped selling its lineup of smart baby monitoring socks, which are supposed to track a baby’s vital signs and sleep patterns, after receiving a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/11/24/22801111/owlet-infant-monitoring-sock-pulled-following-fda-warning-wearable-baby-monitor-regulation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deseret News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/owlet-baby-care-inc-616354-10052021"&gt;FDA’s letter&lt;/a&gt; states that Owlet’s Smart Socks are considered medical devices, as they provide heart rate and oxygen level notifications, and that the company has been selling them without the proper “marketing approval, clearance, or authorization” from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x0VPLT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FDA didn’t “identify any safety concerns about the Smart Sock”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GUkS0u"&gt;Owlet has since pulled its family of Smart Socks, as well as any bundles that include the device from its site. “The Owlet Sock family of products is currently...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday weekend deals on cameras and lenses </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kzz4Z2iB6WTkwrrZ9tJ8gs1oErM=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70188516/brose_191203_3824_0009.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CTXPBN"&gt;Cameras and lenses can be a tricky thing to shop for around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. They are no small investment, though if you’re shopping for that lucky someone — or for yourself — there are some deals to be had that can save you a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cd0NVO"&gt;We have vetted and rounded up the most notable deals from the major camera manufacturers, focusing on the latest mirrorless systems. It’s hard to justify spending big money on a new DSLR in 2021, as it may be better to look to the secondhand market for those older systems. Another hard truth is that some camera manufacturers have been plagued by the chip shortages on the latest models, and the deals on tap show that — many of the deeper discounts are on slightly older cameras, and some newer releases...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday weekend deals on noise-canceling headphones 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CXi2TP8qUlAHiVFP0_WedsUgWMc=/5x0:803x532/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177196/Screenshot_2021_11_27_114547.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Embrace the silence&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5KTAD"&gt;Whether you’re overdue for a new pair or are just trying to cancel out the usual onslaught of holiday music, Black Friday season is a great time to invest in some noise-canceling headphones. You’ll find significant discounts on many of our favorite headphones featured in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;noise-canceling headphones buying guide&lt;/a&gt;. These include picks from Sony, Bose, Apple, Sennheiser, and others. In some cases, these deals will save you $100 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKhJxM"&gt;Aside from the steep discounts, another good thing about buying headphones during the holidays is the extended return period at many retailers. That gives you plenty of time to try out your new cans and make sure the sound quality, ANC, comfort, and other factors are all to your liking before you’re stuck...&lt;/p&gt;
