    <title>How an offshore wind boom in the US could boost ocean research </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aQDagO"&gt;The US wants to use offshore wind farms to collect valuable data on climate change and ocean health. Renewable energy giant Ørsted recently signed a memorandum of agreement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), agreeing to help the agency gather data in US waters leased to the company&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; NOAA &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/noaa-signs-data-share-agreement-with-offshore-wind-energy-company"&gt;says the agreement&lt;/a&gt; “paves the way for similar data-sharing agreements with other developers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJsezC"&gt;The Biden administration plans to dramatically &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/03/us-secretary-commerce-gina-m-raimondo-announces-efforts-advance"&gt;expand&lt;/a&gt; the country’s offshore wind capacity. The US currently only has 42 megawatts of capacity from two relatively small projects on the East Coast. If the Biden administration makes good on its commitment to offshore wind development, that’ll grow this decade to 30,000 megawatts...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung tries to woo iPhone users with a browser-based Galaxy test drive</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y70C9m"&gt;Samsung has released &lt;a href="https://www.itest.nz/"&gt;a new website&lt;/a&gt; to give iPhone users “a little taste of Samsung” from their mobile browser. When visited on an iPhone, the site prompts users to add it to their phone’s home screen, after which it turns into a shortcut to a simulated Samsung Galaxy device. The site appears to be the work of Samsung New Zealand, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/samsung-itest-galaxy-device-iphone-experience/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqyLej"&gt;The experience might be limited, but it’s a neatly designed bit of marketing. Open up the camera “app” and a video will automatically play featuring influencer Logan Dodds, who describes Samsung’s camera app features in the interface around him. Poke around the other “apps” in the home screen and Samsung happily markets its phone’s other features and accessories, while text messages and even a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I’m salivating over this new four-volume Philip K. Dick collection by the Folio Society</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IW-TE6zanU9vW-QmRFobZxA0Kuo=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69100273/maxresdefault.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eugdg6"&gt;The Folio Society has released a &lt;a href="https://www.foliosociety.com/uk/the-complete-short-stories.html"&gt;limited-edition, four-volume set&lt;/a&gt; of Philip K. Dick’s collected short stories and I am seriously considering selling my plasma to buy a copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lg2Yux"&gt;Each volume is bound in fluorescent colors, with 2,560 pages of text containing some 118 stories. There are 24 illustrations by 24 different artists, and the set itself has a theme inspired by the symbols found on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_cards"&gt;Zener cards&lt;/a&gt; — famously used throughout the 20th century to test for telepaths (mind-reading being a recurrent theme in Dick’s fiction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XPpBC"&gt;The collection is absolutely stunning, like so many special editions by The Folio Society, but has a hefty price-tag of £495 ($679). There are also only 750 copies available to buy and it looks like they’re selling out...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung reportedly inks deal to buy OLED TV panels from rival LG Display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5U3314OuYNet2bMCJP9OA29F0z8=/120x0:1302x788/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69100165/LG_OLED_TV_Lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fApiIr"&gt;Samsung Electronics is close to ordering millions of OLED TV panels from LG Display, according to &lt;a href="https://m.mtn.co.kr/news/news_view.php?mmn_idx=2021040910490127790"&gt;new reports from &lt;em&gt;MTN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.etnews.com/20210409000074"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ETNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsVIew/22L0NM8RQV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seoul Economic Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Officials reportedly met recently to agree to the deal, which would see 1 million panels supplied to Samsung in the second half of this year, rising to 4 million panels next year. If the deal is finalized, it would be the first time Samsung has bought OLED panels from its South Korean rival and market leader. TVs with LG’s OLED panels consistently rate amongst the best in professional reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrJYhP"&gt;Samsung exited the OLED TV market &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-tv/how-samsung-fell-behind-sony-and-lg-in-the-premium-tv-market-idUSKBN1I24K2"&gt;over half a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;. Today, LG Display supplies OLED panels to a variety of TV manufacturers including Sony, Vizio, and Hisense, as well as LG Electronics....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airplane takes off a metric ton heavier than expected after computer error weighs adults as children</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wh1FQZ"&gt;A flight from the UK to Spain took off with more than a metric ton of unexpected weight after a software error classified female passengers using the title “Miss” as children. This led to the flight’s load sheet estimating the weight of 38 female passengers as 38 kg or 77 pounds each, the standard weight for children, instead of 69 kg or 152 pounds, the standard weight used for female adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePt20H"&gt;The error was classified as a “&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/aaib-investigation-to-boeing-737-8k5-g-tawg-21-july-2020"&gt;serious incident&lt;/a&gt;” by the UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) but did not affect the flight’s safety. Despite a discrepancy of 1,244 kg (2,743 pounds) between the expected and actual mass of the aircraft, the thrust used in takeoff by the pilot was only “marginally less” than what was required. “This meant...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says iMessage on Android ‘will hurt us more than help us’  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CF0be5uHxP1MU1ILYSxxsJAbT9Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69099875/akrales_190513_3338_0008_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBZmZy"&gt;Apple knows that iMessage’s blue bubbles are a big barrier to people switching to Android, which is why the service has never appeared on Google’s mobile operating system. That’s according to depositions and emails from Apple employees, including some high-ranking executives, revealed in &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.407.0.pdf"&gt;a court filing&lt;/a&gt; from Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;as part of its legal dispute&lt;/a&gt; with the iPhone manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVNGvI"&gt;Epic argues that Apple consciously tries to lock customers into its ecosystem of devices, and that iMessage is one of the key services helping it to do so. It cites comments made by Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddie Cue, senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi, and Apple Fellow Phil Schiller to support its...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Imposters steal restaurants’ names in delivery app deception</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0PU7a0"&gt;Ordering delivery through an app like DoorDash or GrubHub saves the trouble of cooking and lets you be a little picky — you can order from your favorite restaurant. But imagine receiving your food, sitting down to eat, and it tasting... &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. And then, following your gut, you learn that you’ve been duped by a fake, an imposter restaurant that stole its name. For many people ordering from two Japanese restaurants in San Francisco, that exact thing may have happened, &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/On-Doordash-these-S-F-sushi-spots-look-like-16078920.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irTysa"&gt;One restaurant, now styled as an izakaya called Chome, originally opened for delivery and takeout in the former location of Blowfish Sushi. Except it didn’t bother to change the name, awning, or logo at the start. Chome, operating as...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PGGXWp"&gt;Neuralink, Elon Musk’s company focused on developing brain-machine interfaces, has posted a video to YouTube that appears to show a monkey navigating an on-screen cursor using only its mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBKK7B"&gt;Pager, a 9-year-old macaque monkey, had a Neuralink implanted about six weeks before the video was shot, the video’s unnamed narrator says. He was first taught to play video games with a joystick for a banana smoothie reward, delivered through a metal straw. While he was doing this, the Neuralink device recorded information about which neurons were firing — learning, essentially, to predict hand movements by recording which regions fired. After learning the patterns, the joystick Pager used to play was disconnected from the computer. The monkey...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NFeYMI"&gt;Hello, yes, it has come to my attention that Matt Gaetz left his Venmo feed public and &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt; has used this public feed to &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/gaetz-paid-accused-sex-trafficker-who-then-venmod-teen"&gt;report a salacious story&lt;/a&gt; about his transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75xmWU"&gt;Yeah, you read that right. His Venmo feed was&lt;em&gt; public&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yXxXdf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A public Venmo feed, &lt;em&gt;especially &lt;/em&gt;one with questionable transactions, is a powerful way to amass personal information&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N9MeBL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-scary-reasons-you-should-make-your-venmo-account-private-2018-07-17"&gt;People have been warning&lt;/a&gt; about Venmo’s public feeds for quite some time. You can figure out a lot about a person by monitoring their financial transactions through Venmo! In Gaetz’s case, we found out he sent money — $900, in two transactions— to Joel Greenberg, who is accused of sex trafficking. The morning after Gaetz sent money, Greenberg sent three young women sums of money that totaled......&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="zrXZwN"&gt;Proctorio, a piece of exam surveillance software designed to keep students from cheating while taking tests, relies on open-source software that has a history of racial bias issues, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gxg3/proctorio-is-using-racist-algorithms-to-detect-faces"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The issue was discovered by a student who figured out how the software did facial detection, and discovered that it fails to recognize black faces over half the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1X4dJ"&gt;Proctorio, and other programs like it, is designed to keep an eye on students while they’re taking tests. However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cham_omot/status/1364376131516854275"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; students of color &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/allseeingKHAI/status/1304421435385851904?s=20"&gt;have reported&lt;/a&gt; that they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kikyo1506/status/1304441930772656128?s=20"&gt;have issues getting the software&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BigLou_42/status/1308943917950398466?s=20"&gt;see their faces&lt;/a&gt; — sometimes having to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JaniceWyattRoss/status/1364032597484056577"&gt;resort to extreme measures&lt;/a&gt; to get the software to recognize them. This could potentially cause the students problems:...&lt;/p&gt;
