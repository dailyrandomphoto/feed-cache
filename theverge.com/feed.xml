  &lt;p id="33h6SW"&gt;Google parted ways with a cloud services executive after he published a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210614065822/https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-one-amr-awadallah/"&gt;LinkedIn manifesto&lt;/a&gt; about Israeli-Palestinian relations and his vehemently antisemitic past. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/google-separates-with-cloud-vp-after-employees-complain-about-manifesto.html"&gt;CNBC reports&lt;/a&gt; that Google faced internal criticism over Amr Awadallah, VP of developer relations at Google Cloud. While Awadallah said he published the piece to promote tolerance and understanding, employees objected to how Awadallah described Jews and expressed concerns about his past beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tez4yX"&gt;Awadallah began the June 13th post — titled “We are one!” — with a declaration that “‘I hated the Jewish people, all the Jewish people’! and emphasis here is on the past tense.” The 10,000-word manifesto discussed his upbringing in Egypt, saying he’d been “very cautious” working with...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Counterfeit wireless earbuds are being seized in record numbers at US border</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kMwSLT"&gt;The number of counterfeit wireless earbuds seized by US border customs in 2021 has already surpassed last year’s total, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/airpods-are-a-huge-hit-with-consumers-and-counterfeiters"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a sign of how eager the makers of these knockoffs are to keep riding the sustained popularity of earbuds like Apple’s AirPods and those from Samsung, Jabra, Bose, Sony, and other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftpC8P"&gt;According to the report, “roughly 360,000 counterfeit wireless headphones” — valued at $62.2 million — were nabbed in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. That’s well above the 295,000 pairs that were confiscated during the whole of fiscal 2020. Just yesterday, US Customs and Border Protection &lt;a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/thousands-fake-apple-airpods-worth-13-million-seized-cincinnati-cbp"&gt;announced a major confiscation&lt;/a&gt; in Cincinnati. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Emergency department visits spiked during June heatwave in US Northwest</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E6ROSc"&gt;The heatwave that scorched the Pacific Northwest in late June resulted in an enormous surge in emergency department (ED) visits in the region, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7029e1.htm#:~:text=Record%20high%20temperatures%20are%20occurring,States%20each%20year%20(2)."&gt;new analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. There were 1,038 heat-related visits to the emergency department during the peak of the heatwave on June 28th in “region 10” — which includes Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska. In shocking comparison, there were just nine similar ED visits in the region on the same day in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bqKjln"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Northwest was home to a disproportionate number of emergency department visits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mVOQLl"&gt;While much of the West was suffering through sweltering heat in June, the Northwest was home to a disproportionate number of emergency department visits....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Netflix turned a slasher trilogy into a summer movie moment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wcZltXgsZf_KuKGOZtwe0XXFdFw=/669x0:2931x1508/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69590973/Fear_Street_Part_3__1666_01_25_50_18r_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kiana Madeira and Gillian Jacobs in Fear Street Part 3: 1666.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nLpAf0"&gt;In order to keep her roles straight, &lt;em&gt;Fear Street &lt;/em&gt;star Kiana Madeira kept a big Five Star binder with her on set at most times. As part of the experimental slasher trilogy from Netflix, Madeira played two different roles across three movies, each set in a different time period. To make matters even more challenging, the schedule was incredibly compact: all three films were shot together over just a few months. So her binder served a crucial role. Inside were all three scripts, and she would write in it constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnCRy0"&gt;“Every time we finished a scene, I would make notes about how it went, how my character was feeling, how I was feeling, what I think we ended with in terms of the tone and the trajectory of the story,” she says. “My binder...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber agrees to reduced fine in fight over sexual assault data</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EB49rt"&gt;Uber has agreed to pay $9 million to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) after refusing to hand over data about riders and drivers who were sexually assaulted, and pay a separate $150,000 fine, according to a settlement agreement reached Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruvrMN"&gt;The CPUC will give $5 million of that money to the California Victim Compensation Fund, and the remaining $4 million will “go to address physical and sexual violence in the passenger carrier industry,” according to &lt;em&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;, which reported on the agreement Thursday. Uber will also now provide data about the assaults to the CPUC, though it will remove any potentially identifying information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dqgoF"&gt;The CPUC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174943/uber-sexual-assault-fine-california-public-utility-commission-report-59-million"&gt;originally fined Uber $59 million in December 2020&lt;/a&gt; and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Automattic, owner of Tumblr and WordPress.com, buys podcast app Pocket Casts</title>

  &lt;p id="OcKBl0"&gt;Pocket Casts has a new owner.

&lt;p id="fLt6aV"&gt;“As part of Automattic, Pocket Casts will continue to provide you with the features needed to enjoy your favorite podcasts (or find something new),” the post states. “We will explore building deep integrations with WordPress.com and Pocket Casts, making it easier to distribute and listen to podcasts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn415Z"&gt;Pocket Casts launched in 2010 and &lt;a href="https://blog.shiftyjelly.com/2018/05/04/the-next-chapter/"&gt;sold to&lt;/a&gt; NPR and a group of other public media groups eight years later. It’s been well-received,...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sj1TjT"&gt;An ancient language and one of the most popular video games of the past year have collided with the launch of the official Irish localization of &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;. The hugely popular sci-fi whodunnit game is now available to play in the Irish language as of this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6vI5l"&gt;The project was spearheaded by Úna-Minh Kavanagh, a fluent Irish speaker, writer, content creator, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22533319/twitch-streamers-minority-languages-basque-gaelic"&gt;Twitch streamer&lt;/a&gt; from Kerry in the southwest of Ireland. After her &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/unaminhkavanagh/status/1336316630050148352"&gt;Twitter callout&lt;/a&gt; for an official version was met with an enthusiastic response, she was approached by Callum Underwood from Robot Teddy, the consulting firm supporting Innersloth developer &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;.
