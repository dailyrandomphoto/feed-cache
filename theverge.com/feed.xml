    <title>Apple announces release date for watchOS 8</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1k0ZQtT__1hJrZNNrbPl7-mnh8E=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857640/lcimg_e0eb6a55_c77c_4513_86a9_1373f1fd5bb0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aNYsAO"&gt;Apple is releasing the next version of its smartwatch operating system, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/watchos-8-brings-new-access-connectivity-and-mindfulness-features-to-apple-watch/"&gt;September 20th&lt;/a&gt;. The company first introduced the new free update at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt; and has been testing it in public beta over the summer alongside iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3RVSE"&gt;WatchOS 8 is a modest change to Apple Watch but still has some nice additions. Apple is adding support for new iOS 15 features like Focus mode for more granular control over app notifications and new types of keys and ID cards in Apple Wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyFBly"&gt;The new watchOS is also getting new watchfaces to take advantage of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7’s larger screen&lt;/a&gt; and new workout types for pilates and tai chi (along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673993/apple-fitness-plus-workouts-countries-languages-pilates-snow"&gt;other updates to Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;).

  &lt;p id="O3b1aE"&gt;Apple says it’s releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-unveils-new-ipad-mini-with-breakthrough-performance-in-stunning-new-design/"&gt;September 20th&lt;/a&gt;. The company announced the new free operating system updates at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt; earlier in June, and offered public betas over the summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJPbqF"&gt;Both of the new versions of iOS and iPadOS offer a grab bag of features. The headliners include changes to notifications like the addition of notification summaries, Focus modes for creating distinct lists of apps and notifications allowed to reach users at different times of the day, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;improvements to FaceTime&lt;/a&gt; that include the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;invite Android and Windows users&lt;/a&gt; to calls for the first time, and a new look for Safari.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iPhone 13 Pro is the first iPhone with 1TB of storage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDFzpLv05LVFb8HlB3JeNO_7VF8=/116x0:1318x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857579/cCGjh1M.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gh8in0"&gt;Apple announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;new iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; handset today during the company’s California Streaming event. It’s the first iPhone to ship with 1TB of storage as an option, allowing owners to store double the maximum capacity of 512GB on the regular iPhone 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTgdWa"&gt;Apple has previously offered 1TB for iPad storage but has kept the 512GB maximum on the iPhone Pro side until today. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670072/apple-iphone-13-pro-models-1tb-storage-kuo"&gt;Rumors had suggested&lt;/a&gt; we’d get a 1TB iPhone this year, and it comes two years after Samsung shipped its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18229628/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-price-full-specs-storage"&gt;Galaxy S10 Plus&lt;/a&gt; with a 1TB storage option for $1,600. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyzWvZ"&gt;Apple is also bumping iPhone storage on the standard models. The base iPhone 13 model will now ship with 128GB instead of the 64GB storage found on the iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HLo1K"&gt;Apple’s iPhone Pro 13 will start at $999 and is shipping...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13’s new camera tricks include cinematic video and macro photography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Un_8IR1cPAm0pRvKn3ypZ5ygUY=/281x0:1780x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857560/camera.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JEHvhP"&gt;With a design that’s largely similar to last year’s phones, Apple is leaning on big upgrades &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; lineups to get people excited. Some of the most substantial improvements to the 2021 iPhones are found in the camera(s), and the company today announced several new features that will produce better still photographs and videos on the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXkYeb"&gt;The first is a new “cinematic mode” for video that replicates the rack focus effect commonly seen in movies. The iPhone 13 smoothly transitions between forefront and background focus based on what’s occurring in the frame. The system is intelligent enough to change focus when a subject looks away from the phone....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus is getting Group Workouts and Pilates</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tIrUqk"&gt;Apple has announced a Group Workouts feature for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Fitness Plus will also be coming to 15 new countries, including Brazil, France, Mexico, and Russia, and workouts will be getting subtitles in six languages. There are new workouts, including guided meditation, Pilates, and programs to help you prepare for winter sports like skiing and snowboarding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftiCN8"&gt;Group Workouts will let Fitness Plus subscribers do a workout with a friend (or a group of up to 32 people), starting it through an iMessage or FaceTime call. On your screen, you’ll be able to see both the instructor and the people you’re sharing the workout with. (Hopefully Apple will include an option to turn your camera off if it gets too embarrassing.) You’ll also see...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max announced with high refresh rate 120Hz displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u07Yi5"&gt;Apple has officially announced the high-end half of the iPhone 13 lineup: the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. They’ve got a faster A15 Bionic chip, three all-new cameras, and an improved display with up to a 120Hz ProMotion high refresh rate that can go as bright as 1,000 nits. The iPhone 13 Pro will start at $999, while the iPhone 13 Pro Max will start at $1099. Both will be available to order on Friday, shipping on September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9Shn0"&gt;The Super Retina XDR displays on both models support variable refresh rates of between 10Hz and 120Hz, and are the same size as last year at 6.1 and 6.7 inches. They have slightly smaller notches that should allow for more space in the iOS status bar. The phones will be available in four colors: graphite, gold,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 and 13 Mini announced with redesigned camera array and smaller notch</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CkNTNs"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 has officially arrived — the baseline, most mainstream model that will set the bar for Apple’s 2021 phone lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FkoaW"&gt;As with last year, the entry-level iPhone 13 will come in two versions: the 6.1-inch “regular” model and the smaller 5.4-inch iPhone 13 Mini. The screen is an OLED panel, although it’s brighter than last year’s, while the sides are still aluminum sandwiched between two slabs of glass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nB9UQs"&gt;Pricing starts at $829 for the iPhone 13 and $729 for the smaller iPhone 13 Mini, although Apple is once again offering a $30 discount for phones purchased through carriers. Storage options for this year’s models have been bumped up, with Apple offering 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB configurations for the two models. Preorders for...&lt;/p&gt;

The display now goes virtually to the edge of the case. That means while the Watch isn’t much bigger, everything on it should be more readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shMhTn"&gt;The bezels around the display are slimmer at just 1.7mm, and the always-on screen mode is 70 percent brighter. Apple claims you can cram 50 percent more text onto the display than the Series 6. The new display also means new ways to interact, with a full keyboard that will support swiping. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All-new iPad Mini announced with 5G, USB-C, and larger 8.3-inch display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQ-Fh3V_HHaNuR5iECA4AxONDP8=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857249/lcimg_7b04f92e_6e3b_4b04_83c7_9381b0d97513.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="atJv07"&gt;Apple has announced its all-new iPad Mini. It features a new enclosure with narrower bezels and rounded corners. The big news is that it’s larger than the iPad Mini 5 with an 8.3-inch display (up from its predecessor’s 7.9-inch panel), making the device even more viable as a driver for multitasking or schoolwork. Apple says the screen can reach 500 nits of brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHmNxr"&gt;The iPad Mini is currently Apple’s smallest tablet, even with the bump in size. Apple was rumored to have been considering a Mini LED display on the new iPad, similar to that of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;largest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;.
