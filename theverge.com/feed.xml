    <title>Samsung made a dedicated smart home dashboard, and we want one</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sbmkzd"&gt;Samsung introduced its first standalone SmartThings smart home controller at its CES 2022 keynote this week. The Samsung Home Hub is designed to be a central place for a household to control and monitor their smart home without having to buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22856937/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-bespoke-ces-2022"&gt;$4,000 smart fridge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SN0ZZg"&gt;The portable, 8.4-inch touchscreen tablet has Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant built-in and will use AI to anticipate what you might need (we’ll see how that pans out). The Home Hub sits vertically in a charging dock and has two microphones and two speakers for hearing notifications and giving voice commands. Based on the images the company has shared so far, it appears to run Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddsf9F"&gt;Samsung says at launch, the Home Hub will “be able to connect to every product within the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sundance Film Festival goes virtual, Grammys postponed over omicron concerns</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CyXAUr"&gt;Both the Grammy Awards and the Sundance Film Festival have changed their 2022 plans due to a rise in COVID-19 cases across the country (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/grammy-awards-postponed-indefinitely-due-to-concerns-about-omicron-covid-spread.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2022/01/sundance-2022-cancels-in-person-1234688754/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indiewire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The Grammy Awards show has been postponed until further notice, and the Sundance Film Festival will go virtual, rather than risk an in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rNxzz5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Grammy Awards was postponed last year because of the pandemic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AP8GDo"&gt;The 64th Grammy Awards ceremony was scheduled for January 31st, but as noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2022-grammys-complete-winners-nominees-nominations-list"&gt;post on the Grammy Awards website&lt;/a&gt;, CBS and the Recording Academy have decided to push it back “after careful consideration and analysis with city and state officials, health and safety experts.” There isn’t mention of a rescheduled date, but CBS and the Recording Academy say that “will be...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dead By Daylight drops Leatherface cosmetics after reports of harassment against Black players</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LujzN2Y4tFPqqYNVVgM0A1sWsug=/26x0:1646x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352079/055_leatherface_key_art.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVKOsu"&gt;Behaviour Interactive, developer of co-op survival horror game &lt;em&gt;Dead By Daylight&lt;/em&gt;, has decided to remove certain cosmetics from the game after years of complaints that they were being used in racist harassment against Black players. Announced as part of a &lt;a href="https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/302915/"&gt;developer update&lt;/a&gt;, the cosmetics will be removed in a forthcoming patch, and players who have unlocked the cosmetics will be compensated with in-game currency. In its update, Behaviour Interactive wrote: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bhzz3g"&gt;“Members of the community have shared their experiences with people targeting and harassing them while using some of these masks. These reports were disheartening to hear, and we absolutely condemn this behaviour. We are not comfortable having these masks in the game when they are used as...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil promises Alexa is coming to its smartwatches ‘soon’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Skagen Falster 6 showing the Alexa widget with a message that reads “coming soon”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r5YDfm4BxmDu2bNvX0wZdizZ4VE=/0x335:4030x3022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70351868/Image_from_iOS_watermarked.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Alexa is “coming soon” to Fossil Gen 6 watches&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Victoria Song/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61DndW"&gt;Although Fossil launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22864897/fossil-razer-skagen-gen-6-smartwatch-wear-os"&gt;two new smartwatches at CES&lt;/a&gt; today, there’s one big elephant in the room: the upgrade to Wear OS 3 won’t arrive for several months. To take the sting out of the wait, Fossil snuck in another new feature for its Gen 6 smartwatches: Amazon Alexa. As for when Alexa will arrive, you’ll have to settle for “coming soon.” Hopefully before Wear OS 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjmEpD"&gt;In a statement to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/05/fossil-amazon-alexa-gen-6-smartwatches/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Fossil says the update will come in the first half of 2022. This tracks with what Fossil told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a CES briefing, in which spokesperson Robyn Sills said Alexa would come to the Gen 6 devices “early this year.” Fossil sent me both the Skagen Falster 6 and the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch, and yup, there’s a widget just for Alexa. If...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Tablo ATSC 3.0 tuner is a DVR for the 4K over-the-air TV future  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H_6sahkeTtTE4IVXW3ipRVsA68o=/73x0:841x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70351824/tablo_atsc3_hdmi_insitu.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This new Tablo box is built to grab TV from the air and record it.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tablo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d1hCwN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.tablotv.com/blog/tablo-atsc-3-quad-hdmi-a-tablo-dvr-for-nextgen-tv/"&gt;new Tablo ATSC 3.0 Quad HDMI&lt;/a&gt; is a DVR meant for the next generation of broadcast TV — which, if all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/2/14488608/4k-tv-broadcasts-ajit-pai-atsc-3-hdr"&gt;goes according to plan&lt;/a&gt;, will involve 4K HDR content being sent out over the airwaves for free. It can record up to four channels at once onto an external hard drive, letting you watch programs back on your schedule, not broadcasters’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcodtg"&gt;In the age of internet streaming, cable, and satellite, it can be hard to remember that there are still local TV stations broadcasting their programs over the airwaves, which anyone can watch for free if they have an antenna and receiver. But for some enthusiasts, viewing broadcast television is the new cord-cutting — and it’s those signals Tablos are made to record and playback.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drone carrying a defibrillator saves its first heart attack patient in Sweden</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="a photo of the ever drone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YA7myZEIlRlSaos1nY4u7GHRBFE=/29x0:5890x3907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70351712/1sN1qEZA.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Everdrone AB&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qLOkhr"&gt;A man in Sweden is alive today thanks to — in part — a drone. The 71-year-old had a heart attack while shoveling snow in December and was resuscitated by a nearby doctor after a drone flew in a defibrillator, Everdrone &lt;a href="https://everdrone.com/news/2022/01/04/for-the-first-time-in-medical-history-an-autonomous-drone-helps-save-the-life-of-a-cardiac-arrest-patient/"&gt;reported Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSvvzO"&gt;Someone having a heart attack needs help within 10 minutes in order to survive. Everdrone’s Emergency Medical Aerial Delivery (EMADE) service is designed to deliver help as quickly as possible — it allows emergency dispatchers to send a drone carrying the device to a caller’s home, kickstarting the lifesaving process before the ambulance arrives at their home. In this particular patient’s case, it took three minutes for the services to deliver the defibrillator to his home. A bystander, who happened to...&lt;/p&gt;

As a part of the expansion, the retail giant says it will hire 3,000 delivery drivers and establish an all-electric fleet of delivery vehicles, thousands of which it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867087/walmart-brightdrop-electric-delivery-van-gm-fedex"&gt;just ordered from the General Motors-backed electric vehicle company BrightDrop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBh6cj"&gt;The InHome delivery service requires you to pay a $19.95 / month subscription fee, along with an optional $49.95 fee for a smart lock (if you don’t already have a garage keypad or a smart lock already) that grants bodycam-wearing Walmart associates access to your home — and your fridge.

    <title>BMW debuts its new color-changing paint technology at CES: E Ink</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S309gS"&gt;If you’ve ever felt indecisive about what color vehicle to buy, BMW may have the car for you. The German automaker showed off its new color-changing paint technology at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that shares more in common with a Kindle than you’d think at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQc7k1"&gt;Relying on E Ink, the electronic paper technology used in e-readers, and the old Pebble watch, the color-changing paint technology is making its debut on a concept version of the BMW iX that is being presented at CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3jt7HB"&gt;The surface coating of the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink contains many millions of microcapsules, with a diameter equivalent to the thickness of a human hair. Each of these microcapsules contains negatively charged white pigments and...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>New Instagram test brings back the chronological feed  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Bb8BTlYaKvhNme0vljYoM8LJqo=/0x0:1428x952/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70351198/Screen_Shot_2022_01_05_at_1.30.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XlGh7L"&gt;Instagram head Adam Mosseri says the company has started testing two new feed settings, including the much-requested chronological option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pYh9M"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1478767105444966401"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; shared today, Mosseri demonstrated a new menu with three options for how Instagram’s feed will display posts. The “Home” setting is what users are familiar with — a feed Instagram creates based on what it thinks will interest each user, ranked using an algorithm. A new “Favorites” feed will be populated with content from a subset of accounts a user chooses (Mosseri says he uses it for siblings, certain creators, and friends). And finally, a “Following” feed will return what many users have been asking for: a chronological stream of posts from accounts you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxLIHK"&gt;Mosseri &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824609/instagram-chronological-feed-adam-mosseri"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; the...&lt;/p&gt;
