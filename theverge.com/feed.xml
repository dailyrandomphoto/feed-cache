    <title>Microsoft Teams usage jumps to 145 million daily active users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KrgEyJvpdH-oMM3vjFh1FmSm9O8=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195378/microsoftteams.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0tcfT"&gt;Microsoft now has 145 million people using its Microsoft Teams communications app. This is another increase of 26 percent since Microsoft revealed Teams usage had jumped during the pandemic to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;115 million daily active users in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Usage of Teams has spiked over the past year, with businesses continuing to flock to services like Teams, Slack, and Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNJcT1"&gt;To put the 145 million figure in perspective, at the beginning of the pandemic, Microsoft had around 32 million daily active users of Microsoft Teams. That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241972/microsoft-teams-75-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;jumped to 75 million&lt;/a&gt; in a matter of weeks, and these numbers have more than doubled since even the early days of the pandemic. It’s an impressive amount of growth, just as Microsoft has been aggressively pushing businesses to...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is getting live hockey, thanks to a new NHL deal</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gsHUzz"&gt;Live hockey is coming to HBO Max, thanks to a new seven-year deal between the National Hockey League and WarnerMedia’s Turner Sports. The news may come as a bit of a surprise,  as, only a few weeks ago, WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar said &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/hbo-max-warnermedia-streaming-jason-kilar-1234713108/"&gt;sports would not appear&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVCGR1"&gt;Alongside HBO Max stepping into the sports streaming spotlight, Turner Sports also announced that TNT and TBS will air the Stanley Cup three out of the seven years outlined in the deal. (Specifically, WarnerMedia’s channels will air the championship series in 2023, 2025, and 2027, &lt;a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-turner-sports-reach-tv-deal-for-games-on-tnt-tbs/c-324075352"&gt;according to the NHL&lt;/a&gt;.) The remaining years will be hosted by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323789/disney-nhl-deal-espn-plus-stream-abc-hockey-sports"&gt;Disney’s ESPN Plus and ABC&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the sports league’s other major streaming deal, now that its contract with NBC is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon confirms there are problems with phone calls in Southern California</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o4yCkB"&gt;Many Verizon customers in Southern California are reporting difficulties making calls on Tuesday afternoon, and the company has confirmed on Twitter that there is a “wireless network issue” in the area right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnTRnZ"&gt;In response to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1387143438316064784"&gt;one person on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon’s support account apologized for the problems and said that “our technicians are aware of this issue and are working to resolve it quickly.” In the interim, the account recommended using Wi-Fi “if possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jrHKmG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We do apologize, Verizon is currently experiencing a wireless network issue in your area. Our technicians are aware of this issue and are working to resolve it quickly. It is best to use Wi-Fi if possible. Please also enable Data Roaming. *AOR&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Wireless CS...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Spotify is okay with Joe Rogan’s anti-vaccine remarks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZcfLO3Af2fkLqrV4vQrUspVU4n8=/220x0:1708x992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195283/Screen_Shot_2020_05_21_at_10.07.14_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Joe Rogan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zWQ6Fz"&gt;In a recent episode of &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt;, the world’s most popular podcaster suggests that healthy young people don’t need the COVID-19 vaccine, contrary to the advice of health professionals trying to stem a pandemic that’s killed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/world/covid-deaths-3-million.html"&gt;more than 3 million people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azdHSN"&gt;Rogan said he believes “for the most part it’s safe to get vaccinated” and that his parents are vaccinated. But then he adds: “But if you’re like 21 years old, and you say to me, ‘Should I get vaccinated?’ I’ll go no.” The remarks were highlighted by &lt;em&gt;Media Matters&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/joe-rogan-experience/spotifys-joe-rogan-encourages-healthy-21-year-olds-not-get-coronavirus-vaccine"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a transcript of Rogan’s April 23rd conversation with fellow comedian Dave Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDDv6h"&gt;A source close to the situation says Spotify reviewed this Rogan episode and left it live because he doesn’t come off...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eddy Cue wanted to bring iMessage to Android in 2013</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="eddy cue" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ZJuycE0C_knwiA0LOubDkGYm1g=/6x0:1020x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195174/iPhone5_0622.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x2NoyR"&gt;Eddy Cue pushed to bring iMessage to Android as early as 2013, according to &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20691843-epic-games-depositions"&gt;a new deposition&lt;/a&gt; made public as part of the Epic case. Currently Apple’s senior VP of software and services, Cue wanted to devote a full team to iMessage support on Android, only to be overruled by other executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIDREN"&gt;The line of questioning is likely to play a significant role in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;Epic’s antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, which argues that iOS app store exclusivity represents an illegal use of market power. Epic has made clear in previous filings that it plans to make iMessage exclusivity part of that argument, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;citing a 2016 email from Phil Schiller&lt;/a&gt; that argues iMessage expansion “will hurt us more than help us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VLFPX2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have the best messaging app and we should make it the industry...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Biden administration says DHS can’t collect even more social media info at the border</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zqgFH2"&gt;The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has denied a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) request to expand its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18647401/state-department-visas-social-media-trump"&gt;collection of social media account information&lt;/a&gt; from people entering the country, &lt;a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202007-1601-001"&gt;saying that the DHS hadn’t proved&lt;/a&gt; the information collection was practically useful. The DHS was mandated by former President Donald Trump to collect and surveil visa applicants’ social media accounts, but President Biden rescinded the executive order requiring it, a fact that was cited in the rejection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNpQyU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/a-promising-first-step-towards-curtailing-social-media-surveillance"&gt;According to the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;, the DHS’s proposal would have required 30 million applicants to include their social media accounts on immigration or foreign travel forms, expanding the measures...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google banks big in Alphabet’s post-pandemic-peak Q1 2021 earnings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YARmSwerMPL3eCEEYXj-YpUluVw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194964/acastro_180130_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sgnfKJ"&gt;During the height of the pandemic last year, Google was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348652/pandemic-earnings-antitrust-google-facebook-apple-amazon"&gt;the rare tech giant&lt;/a&gt; that actually saw a revenue decline — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345014/google-youtube-alphabet-revenue-decline-q2"&gt;the first in the company’s history&lt;/a&gt; — but only by 2 percent. To say Google has now recovered would be the understatement of the week: Alphabet’s just-released Q1 2021 earnings show it raking in a stunning amount of cash this spring, nearly as high as the all-time record revenues and profit it set last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fe9OcK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=0cd3d78"&gt;Alphabet’s filing (PDF&lt;/a&gt;) shows revenues of $55.3 billion, nearly as much as the $56.9 billion it pulled in Q4 2020, alongside $17.9 billion in profit compared to $15.2 billion. That’s also 34 percent more revenue year over year, though that’s admittedly comparing to March 2020 when the effects of some pandemic shutdowns...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reports strong Surface, Xbox, and cloud growth for Q3 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3QXlkyKnIZWU9xrgX6K6brGC6tQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194902/DSCF1179.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BnAHnK"&gt;Microsoft posted the third quarter of its 2021 &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2FInvestor%2Fearnings%2FFY-2021-Q3%2Fpress-release-webcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;financial results today&lt;/a&gt;, reporting revenue of $41.7 billion and a net income of $15.5 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 44 percent. Once again, Microsoft has seen strong growth for Surface, Xbox, and cloud-related services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD6KJK"&gt;The PC market &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380920/pc-market-q1-growth-year-over-year-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;isn’t slowing down&lt;/a&gt;, despite a global chip shortage, and Microsoft is benefiting from this once again. Windows OEM revenue has grown by 10 percent, reflecting the strong consumer PC demand. Windows non-pro OEM revenue also grew 44 percent, and only Windows OEM Pro revenue declined by 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1XLXj"&gt;This is surprising growth for Windows over all, and reflects the pandemic demand we’ve seen for laptops and PCs over the past year....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Nest Wifi router bundle is $80 off at Adorama</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CHjCNK"&gt;Google’s Nest Wifi bundle that includes one router and one Point (Google’s name for an extender) costs $189 at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/1032678/1036?sharedid=VergeGooglesNestBundle042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00822us.html"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen yet for this model. You can get this deal until Saturday, May 1st by adding the offer code &lt;strong&gt;EXTRAOFF80 &lt;/strong&gt;at the checkout screen (located under the payment section). To put that price in context, the router alone usually costs $169 and the additional Point is priced normally at $149. In other words, this is like getting the Point for just $20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="MLvYEi"&gt;Like in most mesh Wi-Fi systems, the Nest Wifi router and extender differ in a few ways, so you’ll want to plan how you arrange them accordingly. The router has two Ethernet ports (one of which will be used by your internet modem), and...&lt;/p&gt;

The decision delivered a partial defeat over its competitors, like Amazon and OneWeb, which sought to thwart the tweak over concerns it would create harmful frequency interference and ramp up risks of satellite collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHbN2g"&gt;The FCC found that allowing lower orbits for Starlink satellites “does not create significant interference problems.” Lowering the orbits, it said, allows SpaceX to make “safety-focused” changes to the constellation, like being able to more quickly discard any dead or broken satellites by steering them toward a...&lt;/p&gt;
