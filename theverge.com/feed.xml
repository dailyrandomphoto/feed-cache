  &lt;p id="WmMrK3"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones are an important piece of tech if you enjoy having zero distractions or outside noise while you jam to funky tunes or listen to podcasts. And, as you might have expected, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are a good time to invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC95lA"&gt;While not as convenient as popping earbuds into your ears, noise-canceling headphones do a better job of erasing sound distractions when stacked up against popular wireless earbuds like Apple’s AirPods Pro or Jabra’s 75t. But if you prefer earbuds over headphones, we have rounded up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611428/black-friday-earbuds-deals-wireless-cyber-monday"&gt;the best wireless earbud deals this Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVgfg2"&gt;We are picking out all of the best deals going on right now on several brands that offer noise-canceling headphones. If you want more deals for other tech...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="9yLHtZ"&gt;Whether you’re shopping for a student, an older relative, or anyone in between, a laptop can make a great gift. And the internet’s largest retailers are offering all kinds of laptops at discounted prices this Black Friday and Cyber Monday, whether you’re looking for a convertible, a Chromebook, a gaming rig, or anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8Tv9N"&gt;Note that for some models, only certain configurations may be on sale. Make sure to double-check the specs of the item you’re buying to make sure they’ll suit your workload (and that you’re actually getting the discount) before you check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vRrnV"&gt;To learn more about some of these laptops, and others that may see discounts later this week, check out our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops of 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals that are still happening</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7QychB"&gt;Black Friday is here. You know the deal: it’s the biggest shopping day of the year, followed closely by Cyber Monday, which is happening first thing next week. As you’re expecting, there are some great deals on tech, including TVs, laptops, gadgets, video games, and much more — we have it all below. Unlike most years, the ongoing pandemic saw retailers releasing some of their best Black Friday deals earlier than ever, giving shoppers more opportunities to snag gifts. With that, a few deals might look a little familiar, but we’ve aimed to put in just as many brand-new deals that are hitting for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHCSuC"&gt;We’ll be doing our best to keep this post updated during Black Friday, and through the weekend so that you can be certain that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh dies at 46</title>

  &lt;p id="gsuB8J"&gt;Tony Hsieh, the former CEO of online shoe retailer Zappos has died, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zappos.com%2Fe%2Fcelebrating-tony%3Fpf_rd_r%3D8506F54544A14D348B7E%26pf_rd_p%3Df021b9ec-f559-4263-a6e3-c07b8bbcfe92&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F28%2F21723817%2Fformer-zappos-ceo-tony-hsieh-dies#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company confirmed Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. Hsieh retired from the Las Vegas-based company in August, after 20 years at the helm. Under his leadership, &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/tony-hsieh-retired-zappos-ceo-dies-46-74435443"&gt;Zappos became known&lt;/a&gt; for its customer service and employee-focused company culture. Hsieh wrote a best-selling autobiography titled “Delivering Happiness” that detailed his philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNCHo3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/02/amazon-closes-zappos-deal-ends-up-paying-1-2-billion/"&gt;Amazon acquired Zappos for $1.2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, and kept Hsieh on as CEO. &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/20100601/why-i-sold-zappos.html"&gt;He said in 2010&lt;/a&gt; he had decided to sell to the e-commerce giant because Amazon recognized “the uniqueness of Zappos’s culture and Amazon’s duty to protect it. We think of Amazon as a giant consulting company that we can hire if we want—for instance, if we need help redesigning...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhitJa"&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; this year, you can expect to find many of the best wireless earbuds on sale for their lowest prices yet. Apple’s AirPods Pro, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus, and other popular models from Jabra, Sony, 1More, and more companies have never been more affordable. If you haven’t yet treated yourself to a set of truly wireless earbuds that connect via Bluetooth, prepare to never look back to using wired earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAI1eM"&gt;We have collected deals across multiple retailers below, and they’re all significantly lower than their usual asking price. As new deals become available or go out of stock, we’ll update this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oQibUb"&gt;Apple AirPod deals&lt;/h2&gt;

Whether you’re looking for a deal through a carrier or you’d rather get an unlocked phone, you can save during the holiday season. The best deals on phones for Black Friday are on Android devices, including newer models from Google, Samsung, OnePlus, and more. Predictably, these big price cuts don’t apply to iPhones. Nothing new there, but there is a gift card promo happening if you are interested in picking one up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMRuMl"&gt;Below, you’ll find the best deals we’ve found so far. If you buy an unlocked phone, there won’t be any strings attached to the purchase. If we include a carrier promotion, we’ll be sure to thoroughly list out each requirement...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PvCD0L"&gt;Best Buy was one of the first retailers to launch Black Friday deals — all the way back in mid-October to go up against Amazon Prime Day. Now that Black Friday is actually here, with Cyber Monday quickly approaching, Best Buy is back with a bunch of great sales that you can take advantage of. And, you can do all of your shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7NDsp"&gt;Below, you’ll find the best deals currently happening at Best Buy. If you want to find out what’s happening at other retailers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;check out our other Black Friday coverage&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="30Yud8"&gt;With a pair of next-gen video game consoles now on the market, it’s a very good time to be shopping for a new 4K TV that can best showcase their capabilities.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5VU3Q"&gt;It’s rare that Apple slashes the prices on its own products. Fortunately, other retailers are putting a lot of Apple products on sale for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. A bunch of retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Walmart, and Woot are slashing the prices on everything from wearables to its wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIuihu"&gt;Additionally, the online Apple store will have a special promotion on Friday, November 27th, and running until Monday, November 30th. The promotion will allow &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you to get up to $150 in an Apple gift card&lt;/a&gt; if you purchase an eligible product during the four-day event as listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VKYPYw"&gt;Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy an &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-3#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt;
