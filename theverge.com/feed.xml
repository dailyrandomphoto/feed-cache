    <title>Apple’s HomePod mini reportedly has a secret temperature and humidity sensor</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="77cWg6"&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini smart speaker has an as-yet-undisclosed temperature and humidity sensor in its casing, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-homepod-mini-secret-sensor-for-smart-home-thermostats?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The sensor’s exact location was confirmed by iFixit, and it appears to be placed away from the speaker’s internal components so it can measure the external temperature. The exact sensor used is a 1.5 x 1.5mm HDC2010 Humidity and Temperature Digital Sensor from Texas Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70XPfF"&gt;Although the sensor isn’t currently usable by HomePod mini owners, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg, &lt;/em&gt;Apple has internally discussed allowing the sensor to provide information to other smart home devices like thermostats or fans. This could give smart heating equipment more information about how warm a room is or allow the speaker to trigger a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft to start reopening headquarters on March 29th, with hybrid workplace focus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L3kUbAJNZQWFne5U2upN_xqabBU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005322/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nDr8uT"&gt;Microsoft is planning to start reopening its Redmond and Seattle, Washington-based headquarters later this month. The software giant originally started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164522/microsoft-coronavirus-response-comment-employees-memo-work-from-home"&gt;encouraging employees to work from home&lt;/a&gt; more than a year ago, just as the coronavirus pandemic began, and the company’s main US offices have remained closed for months as a result. This will start to change on March 29th, with a limited reopening of Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond and Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvMu86"&gt;“Currently, Microsoft work sites in 21 countries have been able to accommodate additional workers in our facilities – representing around 20% of our global employee population,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/22/the-philosophy-and-practice-of-our-hybrid-workplace/"&gt;says Kurt DelBene&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s head of corporate strategy. “On March 29, Microsoft will also start making this shift...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine 79 percent effective in US study</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XjjM7t"&gt;A fourth COVID-19 vaccine has shown that it can protect people against the worst effects of the disease in a large United States-based trial. Two doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine were 79 percent effective at preventing people from developing symptomatic COVID-19, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/astrazeneca-us-vaccine-trial-met-primary-endpoint.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from the company today. No one in the US trial who received the vaccine was hospitalized for COVID-19, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxUm3Q"&gt;It’s a good result for a vaccine that’s been dogged by clinical trial issues, poor transparency, and skepticism &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22274371/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-south-africa-variant"&gt;since last fall&lt;/a&gt;. AstraZeneca said the vaccine was up to 90 percent effective in November based on data from the United Kingdom and Brazil, but that number was based on a half-dose of the vaccine given to trial participants...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s new Envy x360 15 with AMD Ryzen chips starts at $749.99</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Envy x360 15 (AMD). &lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pGhb6Y"&gt;HP has announced two new budget workstations for content creators: an Envy x360 15 and an Envy 17. The 15-inch convertible, starting at $749.99, is available with both AMD Ryzen 7 and Intel 11th Gen processors. The 17-inch clamshell starts at $999.99 and is Intel only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43AIh3"&gt;The Envy x360 comes in either “natural silver” or “nightfall black” and includes a magnetic active pen. Its bezels appear to have shrunk slightly since last year’s model. Models have an 88.7 percent screen-to-body ratio and weigh around four pounds. (Not that last year’s model had terrible bezels, but I’ll never say no to more screen real estate.) You can configure it with a 4K OLED display as well as an Nvidia MX450 graphics chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOL0BS"&gt;The top Intel model will include a Core...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTuber David Dobrik parts ways with disposable camera app amidst controversy  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o9uqrNM-SPFP29Fv-oIttrGaITk=/518x0:2357x1226/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69004826/Screen_Shot_2020_01_09_at_11.05.35_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dispo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlwDjQ"&gt;David Dobrik has parted ways with Dispo, the disposable camera app co-founded by the YouTuber in 2019, after allegations of sexual assault were made against a former member of his Vlog Squad, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/29a2fc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRnICq"&gt;“David has chosen to step down from the board and leave the company to not distract from the company’s growth,” Dispo said in a statement, “Dispo’s team, product, and most importantly — our community — stand for building a diverse, inclusive, and empowering world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="heCs9t"&gt;Dobrik’s decision to leave Dispo follows a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which one of the women featured in a 2018 vlog said a former member of Dobrik’s Vlog Squad engaged in sexual activity with her while she was too drunk to consent. She was 20 years old at the time,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch this amazing footage of a drone flying right through an erupting volcano in Iceland</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qGopej8sIeMsCaFNivAGo8Zzjrg=/47x0:553x337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69004672/volcano_fly_by.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qGpu6o"&gt;Last Friday, the Fagradalsfjall volcano near Iceland’s capital of Reykjavik &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/19/iceland-volcano-eruption-under-way-in-fagradalsfjall-near-reykjavik"&gt;began erupting&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in 800 years after the island nation was hit by thousands of small earthquakes. Thankfully, the eruption was small and has not put anyone in danger. Instead, it’s gifted the world with some awe-inspiring views of lava flowing from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6N2qd6"&gt;The sight has been best captured by Icelandic drone pilot Bjorn Steinbekk, who took the straightforward approach of flying right through the eruption. We spotted the footage from Steinbekk (above) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyQuintano/status/1373787472493170695"&gt;via Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems he flew several sorties through the airborne lava — a daring feat that makes us wonder how his drone survived the high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="faRvlQ"&gt;
&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Burberry designed character skins for China’s biggest video game</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NQdNMm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt; is among the biggest games in the world — and soon, it’ll be among the most fashionable as well. Today, Tencent-owned developer TiMi Studios announced a collaboration with fashion house Burberry on new character skins. The skins were designed by Riccardo Tisci, chief creative officer at Burberry, for the character Yao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nn65GZ"&gt;“Burberry’s signature gabardine, pioneered by founder Thomas Burberry and designed to protect the wearer against the elements, fits seamlessly with Yao, who personifies the role of a protector for her teammates,” the company says. The two skins were designed with the “spirit of nature” in mind and will be available to purchase for players in mainland China, though there’s no word on a release date. You can...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CHawkY"&gt;Images of two of Samsung’s rumored upcoming laptops — the Galaxy Book Pro and Galaxy Book Pro 360 — have leaked early, giving us our clearest look yet at the two devices. The apparent marketing images were &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-and-pro-360-first-looks-1616239064-47310169"&gt;posted to &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by reliable leaker Evan Blass, who says they could launch as early as April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1CUSt"&gt;The Galaxy Book Pro will reportedly be available in both blue and silver, while the Pro 360 will come in navy and gold. Both are available with 13 and 15-inch displays. Blass confirms that the Pro 360 will support Samsung’s S Pen stylus, and his images show that some variants of the laptops will include full size keyboards with numpads. In the images, the Pro 360 appears to have a USB Type-C port, headphone jack, and microSD card slot, while...&lt;/p&gt;
