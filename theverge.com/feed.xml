    <title>Razer no longer claims its Zephyr mask uses ‘N95-grade’ filters</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BafJTT"&gt;Razer’s popular $100 Zephyr mask isn’t a replacement for PPE (because it &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;PPE), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22855795/razer-zephyr-pro-mask-voice-amp-feature-price-ces-2022"&gt;its announcement of the Zephyr Pro last week&lt;/a&gt; spurred a surge of claims that the company had overstated the masks’ protection. Razer responded by scrubbing every instance of “N95-grade” from the mask’s product page late last week (via &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/razer-plays-a-dangerous-game-with-its-misleading-mask-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aurXji"&gt;Previously, Razer used N95 in multiple places to describe the filtration and efficacy of its replaceable filters, which were referred to as “N95-grade” because of their 99 percent bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE). Razer now refers to them as “air purification filters.” While Razer claims that testing showed its filters meet a 95 percent particulate filtration efficiency (PFE), the entire mask (not just the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says App Store developers have earned more than $260 billion</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4MqeMB"&gt;App Store developers have earned more than $260 billion since the store launched in 2008, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-services-enrich-peoples-lives-throughout-the-year/"&gt;according to a Monday press release from Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/apple-services-entertain-inform-and-connect-the-world-in-unprecedented-year/"&gt;last January&lt;/a&gt; that developers had earned more than $200 billion since the launch of the App Store, so the new figure shared Monday indicates developers earned $60 billion in 2021. The iPhone maker also said that spending on the App Store between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve in 2021 grew by a double-digit amount, though it didn’t specify exactly what that number might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yzhint"&gt;While the new numbers suggest that the App Store continues to be a big moneymaker, developer unhappiness with the store is high at the current moment. Many developers have taken issue with what they see as restrictive...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly discontinues the Beats Pill Plus, its last battery-powered speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuIZuyAmqkYZ9OSgp0aZ8TD96Ds=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370987/beats-pill-plus-0797.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zPdmTY"&gt;Apple appears to have quietly discontinued the Beats Pill Plus, with the portable wireless speaker no longer appearing on either Apple or Beats’ websites, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/apple-discontinues-beats-pill-plus/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPABjh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9467123/beats-pill-plus-speaker-apple-dre"&gt;Originally released in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, the Pill Plus was the first speaker released under the Beats brand since the music company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/28/5700530/apple-confirms-beats-acquisition"&gt;purchased by Apple for $3 billion back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. A more refined version of the original Beats Pill speaker, the Pill Plus was an Apple-ified version of the original product, with sleeker monochromatic color options and the addition of a Lightning port for charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oXUrI7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Beats’ Pill+ is its best speaker ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9467123/beats-pill-plus-speaker-apple-dre"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ccL1KU"&gt;Apple and Beats would continue to go on to build out Beats’ lineup of headphones over the intervening half-decade, with products like recent Beats Fit Pro or Powerbeats earbuds,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>23andMe gets FDA clearance for prostate cancer risk test</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gvE5eb"&gt;Genetics testing company 23andMe received Food and Drug Administration clearance for its prostate cancer risk test, the company &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/01/10/2363945/0/en/23andMe-Receives-FDA-Clearance-for-Direct-to-Consumer-Genetic-Test-on-a-Hereditary-Prostate-Cancer-Marker.html"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. It’s 23andMe’s third clearance for a cancer risk report — the company also has tests for genes that predict breast and colorectal cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnzqD8"&gt;The test screens for a specific mutation on the HOXB13 gene linked with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Men with the mutation, the G84E variant, have around a three-fold higher chance of developing prostate cancer than men without, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25595936/"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found. Around one in 70 people of European descent have the variant, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/01/10/2363945/0/en/23andMe-Receives-FDA-Clearance-for-Direct-to-Consumer-Genetic-Test-on-a-Hereditary-Prostate-Cancer-Marker.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from 23andMe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06KSBc"&gt;The prostate cancer risk report is not yet available to 23andMe customers, the company...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldO4TX"&gt;Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike is stepping down as CEO of the company, he announced &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/new-year-new-ceo/"&gt;in a blog post on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Executive chairman Brian Acton will serve as acting CEO until a replacement is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgaLsG"&gt;“Every day, I’m struck by how boundless Signal’s potential looks, and I want to bring in someone with fresh energy and commitment to make the most of that,” Marlinspike wrote. “I now feel very comfortable replacing myself as CEO based on the team we have.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkUctA"&gt;The company has met with several CEO candidates “over the last few months,” Marlinspike wrote, but the search remains ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEoFGO"&gt;Founded in 2014, Signal has grown into one of the most trusted and robust apps for encrypted messaging. The service has more than 40 million monthly users and is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned about the Shazam Chrome extension</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PqXZuwGh_djnMXZ6GVk4YQewQe8=/20x0:620x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370901/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shazam is available in yet another place.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Shazam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kQ9wq6"&gt;Today I learned about &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shazam/mmioliijnhnoblpgimnlajmefafdfilb/"&gt;Shazam’s Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to have been out for about a month and can help you identify music playing on the webpage you’re viewing. Having the app directly in Chrome could help you figure out what song is playing in an ad, trailer, or livestream without having to mess around with your phone. (Thanks to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/10/shazam-chrome-extension/"&gt;finding and pointing out&lt;/a&gt; this nifty tool.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4avPNB"&gt;The extension does everything I’d expect it to — you go to the tab where music is playing, press the Shazam button, and it’ll try to identify the song. If it succeeds, it’ll give you a link to the song in Apple Music (serving as your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444506/apple-ios-14-2-beta-shazam-identify-music-phone-apps-headphones"&gt;occasional reminder&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896350/apple-shazam-app-acquisition-complete-free"&gt;Apple owns Shazam&lt;/a&gt;). It’ll also keep track of the songs you’ve identified in a running list...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Greenhouse gas emissions jumped in 2021, despite Biden’s climate pledges</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pbzVum"&gt;After falling more sharply than at any point &lt;a href="https://rhg.com/research/preliminary-us-emissions-2020/"&gt;since World War II&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, US greenhouse gas emissions rebounded from the pandemic in 2021 — likely growing faster than the nation’s economy did last year, according to a preliminary &lt;a href="https://rhg.com/research/preliminary-us-emissions-2021/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by research firm Rhodium Group. The rise in planet-heating pollution risks putting the US’s climate goals further out of reach, Rhodium warns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXIBkn"&gt;Greenhouse gas emissions rose 6.2 percent last year compared to 2020, Rhodium found. That’s slightly higher than initial estimates for economic growth in 2021: a 5.7 percent rise in GDP, according to Goldman Sachs.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s the latest evidence that as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309374/global-china-carbon-dioxide-emissions-rising"&gt;countries return to their old, polluting habits&lt;/a&gt;, the pandemic will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522736/carbon-dioxide-co2-record-climate-change"&gt;do little to slow down climate change&lt;/a&gt; in the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 8 may not have a body temperature sensor after all</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SqtZvC"&gt;If you were hoping for more exciting updates with the Apple Watch Series 8, you might have to start tempering expectations. While it was initially thought that the next-generation watch would have a body temperature sensor, it’s looking like that may not be the case after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVGhLU"&gt;A body temperature sensor for the Series 8 has been heavily rumored for some time now. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman — who has a pretty good track record when it comes to Apple rumors — first hinted &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;a body temperature sensor was coming&lt;/a&gt; in June. That was echoed by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; in September for &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201#refreshed?mod=latest_headlines"&gt;a potential fertility feature&lt;/a&gt;. Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/apple-watch-series-8-thermometer/"&gt;predicted a body temperature sensor&lt;/a&gt; that same month. All in all, there have been several solid...&lt;/p&gt;
