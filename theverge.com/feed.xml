    <title>TikTok’s parent company acquires VR headset maker Pico</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tmccad"&gt;TikTok parent company ByteDance is acquiring Chinese virtual reality headset maker Pico. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/tiktok-owner-bytedance-acquires-pico-and-takes-first-step-into-virtual-reality.html"&gt;CNBC confirmed the news&lt;/a&gt; today after it was rumored last week and verified by Chinese &lt;a href="https://news.nweon.com/88799"&gt;publication &lt;em&gt;Nweon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. ByteDance told CNBC in a statement that Pico’s “comprehensive suite of software and hardware technologies, as well as the talent and deep expertise of the team, will support both our entry to the VR space and long-term investment in this emerging field,” saying it was “optimistic about the future of VR and its alignment with our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ti8Bih"&gt;Pico is known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/3/13511680/pico-neo-vr-headset-controller-specs-hands-on"&gt;Neo lineup&lt;/a&gt; of standalone virtual reality headsets, most recently the &lt;a href="https://www.vrfocus.com/2021/05/pre-order-enterprise-ready-pico-neo-3-starting-from-699/"&gt;Pico Neo 3&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Electric robotaxis may not be the climate solution we were led to believe</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n51fWE"&gt;For years, we’ve been told that electric autonomous taxis can help fight climate change by reducing air pollution. But new research from Harvard Law School suggests these supposedly “zero emissions” vehicles could actually exacerbate many of the problems we are facing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hoNOf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1bd9/pdf"&gt;A new study led by Ashley Nunes&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow at the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, concluded that fleets of electric autonomous taxis could “dramatically increase energy consumption and emissions that contribute to climate change — not reduce them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vt6sL"&gt;“While electric vehicles themselves have lower emissions than traditional gasoline-powered ones, our work shows that deploying electric robocabs en masse on America’s streets could actually increase the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The N64 controller was a weird but essential introduction to joysticks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FoxWXqXMI55fdVqjdaFhU_1XSE0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792992/akrales_210716_4639_0030.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BbmTds"&gt;In the annals of gaming history, there’s no controller better known than the three-pronged piece of plastic that shipped with the Nintendo 64. That’s likely for a few reasons. There’s the unique design, which renders it instantly and unmistakably recognizable as the N64’s gamepad. There’s the popularity of the console, which helped cement Nintendo as one of the definitive names in gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRf5yV"&gt;But the most important part of the N64 controller isn’t the design or the box it attached to: it was the joystick, which introduced millions to a new way of controlling games and paved the way for modern 3D gaming that’s virtually standard today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p8VDVp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nintendo didn’t invent the joystick, but it did popularize it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The latest iPad Air is $100 off at Best Buy and Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new iPad Air with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRyFBqcgLeiVbP_KU8bQ2OhBeK4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792757/vpavic_4244_20201020_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TLNUp"&gt;It’s almost unspoken wisdom at this point that you should think twice about buying some costly Apple products in the late summer months, as the company usually announces new stuff during its annual September event. But if you really need or want an iPad with a few pro-level features (but without the high cost of the iPad Pro), this $100 off deal at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748634717956796230" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; on the iPad Air released in 2020 might be what you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SztUVq"&gt;Normally $599 for the 64GB version, you can get it now for $499, matching the lowest price we’ve seen yet. This model has a 10.9-inch display, and like the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro, it charges via USB-C and supports the latest Apple Pencil. Uniquely, it sports a Touch ID sensor within the power button along...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil announces new smartwatches for 2021 that won’t have Wear OS 3 until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fossil Gen 6 watches" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ih9HkKecpnYWoYLZHbZ1Yw1kwfc=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792561/FSL4013827_FA21_AD_09_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fossil Gen 6 watches | Fossil&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4kSfGK"&gt;Fossil has announced its fall 2021 smartwatch lineup running Wear OS, which it is calling the Gen 6 Touchscreen. As with the Gen 5 Fossil watches, the Gen 6 will come in a few different styles and sizes and there will also be versions sold under the Michael Kors brand. Prices will start at $299 and they’ll be available for preorder immediately. It does not appear that Fossil will offer LTE options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BzDRh"&gt;Unfortunately, these watches will be shipping with the current Wear OS 2 software and not the new Wear OS 3 that runs on t&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;he latest Samsung Galaxy Watches&lt;/a&gt;. Fossil says that it’s going to offer upgrades to Wear OS 3 for Gen 6 watches in 2022, though exactly &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; in 2022 is a trickier question. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;Google has said&lt;/a&gt; that Wear OS 2 watches wouldn’t...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gumroad announces cheaper pricing for creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TmtludlJk-fFue_jM2e1rOog7QI=/0x63:376x314/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792527/Gumroad_Logo_Color.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Gumroad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8kFL0z"&gt;Gumroad is announcing &lt;a href="https://gumroad.com/pricing"&gt;a new pricing structure today&lt;/a&gt; that streamlines the fees and features of its platform, making it easier for creators to get started selling products or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21572698/gumroad-patreon-like-memberships-support-creators"&gt;memberships online&lt;/a&gt;. Gumroad was one of the early “help people sell things online” businesses, but this change is a sort of reset for the company as the space grows even more crowded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3UBLN"&gt;The first major change is an end to Gumroad’s free and paid “Pro” tiers. Previously, Gumroad locked features like using a custom domain name or offering HD video streams behind a $10 per month subscription. That caused some confusion from users just starting out — did it make sense to commit to paying upfront? Now everyone receives the same features without having to pay extra or worry...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kids in China now restricted to just 3 hours of online gaming per week</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A4LTwD"&gt;Chinese gaming platforms like Tencent and NetEase must limit online gaming to minors to just three hours per week following new rules imposed by regulators on Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/china-limits-minors-to-just-three-hours-of-online-gaming-a-week?sref=D9adxNGw"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; citing state media reports&lt;/a&gt;. The change is being made in response to growing concern over gaming addiction and a broader crackdown on China’s tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECbtmw"&gt;Children under the age of 18 will now be restricted to one hour of gaming from 8pm to 9pm on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday; and on public holidays. That’s a change from the previous limit of 1.5 hours of online gameplay on most days. Gaming companies must restrict online game play outside those hours, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-rolls-out-new-rules-minors-online-gaming-xinhua-2021-08-30/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and must have a real name verification system in place to ensure the new rules...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first Neon Genesis Evangelion Blu-rays you can actually buy ship November 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DNCg8bQJHd4PNxBDDCRgmc42Bc=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792184/eva_blu_ray_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kTk12m"&gt;You might have heard that &lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;, the seminal 1995 anime series seemingly about giant mech battles but &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; deeper and more disturbing than that,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is coming to Blu-ray for the very first time in the US, UK, and beyond. What you might not have heard: when that news was first announced nearly two weeks ago, it was just for a $275 limited-edition &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22632212/neon-genesis-evangelion-blu-ray-release-date-price-ultimate-editiona"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;’s Ultimate Edition&lt;/a&gt; whose stateside release of just 5,000 copies sold out in the blink of an eye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RP36J4"&gt;Today, GKids is rectifying that with a five-disc Standard Edition that costs just $60 and will actually ship a month earlier than those $275 copies, technically making it the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; first official Blu-ray release in the United States when it arrives November 9th....&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="xjif2O"&gt;Clubhouse began rolling out a iOS app update on Sunday that enables &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/spatial-audio-clubhouse/"&gt;spatial audio support&lt;/a&gt;. The Android update is “coming soon,” according to the company. The feature works by introducing subtle spatial cues that position speakers on Clubhouse calls into three-dimensional space around your head, making the remote listening experience a better approximation of being in a room full of people. It works best with headphones, either Bluetooth or wired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkE178"&gt;Clubhouse tweeted out a video allowing you to hear for yourself how it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hear ye, hear ye   spAAaAaAatial audio on Clubhouse!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's like surround sound, but w/ your own headphones. A more vibrant, human experience! Plus makes it much easier to tell who's talking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juberti?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@juberti&lt;/a&gt; for this...&lt;/p&gt;
