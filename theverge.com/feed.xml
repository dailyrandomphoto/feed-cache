    <title>Moto G Stylus 2021 leak suggests a larger screen and higher price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Moto G Stylus 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rfwQ4m86UhQqckE51vhPki_TCsw=/250x0:1750x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68486040/Moto_G_Stylus_2021_leaked.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The upcoming Moto G Stylus 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Image via Phone Arena&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OtVRDQ"&gt;Detailed specs and images of the 2021 Moto G Stylus have leaked by way of an early Amazon listing, as &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-renders-leak_id128790"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This iteration on the stylus-having, budget-friendly device looks to borrow features from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432283/motorola-moto-g9-plus-phone-available-now-brazil"&gt;this year’s Moto G9 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, including a 6.8-inch FHD+ display that’s slightly larger than its predecessor’s 6.4-inch screen. Amazon’s (now removed) page lists a price of $341, which is unlikely to be the final MSRP, but it’s a bit higher than the original G Stylus’ $299 introductory price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WuRkwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new Moto G Stylus and G Power are surprisingly adept cameraphones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OFwmp1"&gt;One of the things we liked best about the prior G Stylus was the image quality from its camera, and Motorola appears to have tweaked the hardware setup in the 2021 version. Aside from a 48-megapixel main rear camera, it adopts the quad-camera...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FTC is suing Facebook to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U5VbIT"&gt;On Wednesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced a massive antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, claiming the social media giant has harmed competition by buying up smaller companies like Instagram and WhatsApp to squash the threat they posed to its business. Forty-seven other state and regional attorneys general are joining the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s9HRV"&gt;The lawsuit centers on Facebook’s history of acquisitions starting, particularly its $1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2011. In addition to its acquisition strategy, the attorneys general allege that Facebook used the power and reach of its platform to stifle user growth for competing services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dl6FFO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook has broken the law. It must be broken up.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Cruise is now testing fully driverless cars in San Francisco</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fpv4cx"&gt;Cruise, the self-driving car company affiliated with General Motors and Honda, is testing fully driverless cars, without a human safety driver behind the steering wheel, in San Francisco. The company is among the first to test its driverless vehicles in a dense, complex urban environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ro4Wgn"&gt;“Getting to driverless in SF took more than five years of rigorous testing, over 2 million miles of driving in one of the craziest driving environments, together with hard work from a huge team of dedicated engineers and others across Cruise, as well as at GM,” Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said in a call with reporters. “And not to mention several billion dollars of investment along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9OLEBR"&gt;To be sure, the vehicles are not completely alone...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s redesigned Fire TV software starts rolling out today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bw409VoTcNy4HtaJSpW11IVPgXU=/119x0:1417x865/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68485133/NewFireTV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hfn4yn"&gt;The software that runs on Amazon’s Fire TV streaming devices is set to undergo a significant overhaul in the coming weeks, and the rollout of the “new Fire TV experience” begins today on some devices. After the update is installed, you’ll have access to new features like multiuser support (with personalized recommendations and watch lists for each profile) and a streamlined interface that makes it faster to reach your favorite entertainment apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk6xjY"&gt;When you’re in the mood to watch something but you’re not sure what, there’s also a new “Find” tab that brings together movies, TV shows, free ad-supported content, and sports from various services. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now have individual user profiles on the Fire TV...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Spider-Man: Miles Morales runs at 60fps with ray tracing in new mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dRF-rG-B6ZEyN7wTLJPstkEwO4k=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68485095/MilesMorales_PS5_Standoff_Legal_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qnd8gn"&gt;At launch, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt; on PlayStation 5 was able to run at 60fps in Performance mode or at 30fps but with ray tracing in Fidelity mode, meaning that you’d have to pick between buttery-smooth frame rates or higher graphical fidelity while playing through the game. Thanks to a new mode added in an update, though, you can now run the game at 60fps &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRaY0E"&gt;The new mode is called “Performance RT,” and you can turn it on in settings. “This is an alternate version of the 60 frames per second ‘Performance’ mode, adding ray-tracing by adjusting the scene resolution, reflection quality, and pedestrian density,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ax_zer0/status/1336643995515170816"&gt;according to the description of the new mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="coKzTW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our new update overnight introduced Performance RT...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch overhauls its rules around harassment and hateful conduct </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6dQAVKL46mPU44aGZ1IjtWRdSa8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484822/acastro_190926_1777_twitch_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DYEAaG"&gt;Today, Twitch is announcing changes to its policies around harassment and hateful conduct. The reason, the company says, is because marginalized people — “women, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, Black, Indigenous, and people of color,” the company wrote in a blog post — are disproportionately harassed on the site. The new policy is far more specific about what constitutes harassment and abuse. The larger changes include stricter protections around sexual harassment, the policy extending off platform to an extent, and that enforcement in cases that are harder to judge will rely on external signals that the behavior was unwanted (like channel timeouts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMgUAv"&gt;A bigger overhaul has come to Twitch’s policy regarding sexual harassment; it’s now...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches health research app</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l4ivc0"&gt;Google announced Wednesday that it is launching a new research app for Android phones, which would allow anyone with a device to participate in medical studies. The first study run through the app, called Google Health Studies, will look at respiratory illnesses like the flu and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJVlhD"&gt;Participants in the study will use the app to report any respiratory symptoms, the precautions they’re taking to prevent disease, and whether they’ve been tested for COVID-19 or the flu. The app will collect &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/09/google-health-studies-apple/"&gt;demographic data&lt;/a&gt;, like age, gender, and race as well. “Researchers in this study can examine trends to understand the link between mobility (such as the number of daily trips a person makes outside the home) and the spread of COVID-19,” Google wrote...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Pro are back down to $190 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="6ufcgT"&gt;If you’re struggling to think of a gift for someone in your life, it’s hard to fail with a good set of headphones. Thankfully, many of the best models currently available have seen sharp discounts in the lead-up to the holidays. Today’s standout deals are on the Apple AirPods Pro at Woot for $190 (around $220 everywhere else). Now that the $550 AirPods Max are a thing, the Pro is no longer the most expensive model. Also worth sharing today is a deal on Microsoft’s Surface Headphones, a noise-canceling over-ear model for $150 instead of its usual $200 asking price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTeiCU"&gt;We’ve also found some noteworthy deals on PS4 games that might be on a wish list you’re in charge of tackling.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will now remove videos disputing Joe Biden’s election victory</title>

  &lt;p id="PsmU55"&gt;On Wednesday, YouTube announced that it will begin removing any content alleging widespread voter fraud influenced the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvfnVL"&gt;In the immediate aftermath of the November 3rd election, YouTube came under fire for allowing channels to publish videos making false claims about election results. In one instance, One America News Network, a verified YouTube channel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562910/youtube-2020-election-trump-misinformation-fake-news-recommendations"&gt;published a video&lt;/a&gt; declaring that “Trump won” the election. At the time, YouTube defended its decision to let the video stand, saying in a statement, “Like other companies, we’re allowing these videos because discussion of election results &amp;amp; the process of counting votes is allowed on YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5dbuP"&gt;The company went on to say that content from...&lt;/p&gt;
