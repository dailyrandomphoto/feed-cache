    <title>Samsung releases eco-friendly watchbands made from apple peel</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prices for the watchbands start at $39.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="632uJc"&gt;Samsung has announced six limited edition watch bands for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; made of recyclable and eco-friendly materials including apple peel. The range was made in collaboration with Sami Miró, a fashion designer whose previous collections have made use of upcycled materials. The bands are available today, with prices starting at $39.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sik6nf"&gt;There are six designs included in the collection. The “Midnight Black” and “Stratus Sky” bands are made out of 100 percent apple peel skin “recovered from the fruit industry.” Samsung claims the material has the “premium look of leather” while obviously not being sourced from animals. The other four designs (“Aurora Night,” “Cloud Navy,” “Earth Sunrise,” and “Dawn Atlas”) are made of a thermoplastic...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is now available for the lowest price yet in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K, a great streaming stick for $50, pictured attached to a TV’s HDMI port." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XVt8BXx7RQzj8cl9pq1P2rxEWX8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839164/cwelch_181030_3054_0442.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bblCn7"&gt;The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K has long been considered one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"&gt;best streaming devices&lt;/a&gt; on the market, especially if you’re already tapped into Amazon’s ecosystem. The arrival of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662985/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-announced-features-price"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; may complicate things next month, however, if you couldn’t care less about Wi-Fi 6 and improved processing power, the current model should suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I94XLn"&gt;As far as specs go, the last-gen Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K checks all the boxes. The 4K streamer offers everything HDR (Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10), as well as Dolby Atmos sound, access to all major streaming apps, and an Alexa-enabled remote that lets you issue commands without having to shout across your living room. Normally $50, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K is now on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfybDjfQNAO#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google sets new water goals as droughts worsen </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NETHERLANDS-TECHNOLOGY-GOOGLE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ZI6bpDDmvs4E7MpkX6x_2cG5Dc=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839116/628050484.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7AKB3I"&gt;With drought sucking the Western US dry, Google announced new plans to protect vital water resources. Google guzzles up water to cool its data centers, three of which are in the drought-stricken West. To offset its thirst, the company said that by 2030, it wants to replenish 120 percent of the water it consumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JotJgA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google guzzles up water to cool its data centers, three of which are in the drought-stricken West&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g9C9in"&gt;Google laid out three strategies to accomplish that goal: using water more efficiently in its operations, partnering with communities to make watersheds healthier, and offering its technologies as tools to predict and prevent water stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svlgc9"&gt;The company has faced &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-04-01/how-much-water-do-google-data-centers-use-billions-of-gallons?sref=7mwUMHq1"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt; from communities near its data center in South Carolina and a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Jio’s smartphone collaboration has been delayed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3U7MdyLIpYSaVzSMTTKwHi5EUq0=/1x0:835x556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838947/jiophone_next_google.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Jio Platforms&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bklin2"&gt;The JioPhone Next, a smartphone being jointly developed by Google and Indian tech giant Jio Platforms, has missed its planned September 10th launch date, the &lt;a href="https://www.ril.com/getattachment/9071467e-5a43-415e-bfed-b831d0360df8/JioPhone-Next-in-Advanced-Trials,-with-Festive-Sea.aspx"&gt;companies have announced&lt;/a&gt;. The delay is needed to give both companies more time to refine the device, and to navigate problems created by the global semiconductor shortage. The JioPhone Next is now scheduled for wide release around Diwali, which will take place in early November. The phone is currently in testing with a small number of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fidBXi"&gt;The phone is designed to be an affordable 4G smartphone to help the roughly 300 million Indian users currently on 2G networks upgrade to 4G. When it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548453/jiophone-next-google-android-smartphone-affordable"&gt;announced the phone in June&lt;/a&gt;, Jio’s parent company Reliance said it would include voice...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi promises its 120W fast charger won’t kill its new phone’s battery</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pf8peD"&gt;If you’ve been following the Chinese phone scene for the past few years, you’ll have noticed the inescapable fast-charging arms race. It feels like every few months there’s a new champion, with high-wattage chargers constantly pushing down the time it takes to fill a phone battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1130hI"&gt;This month, Xiaomi is making its biggest effort yet to bring its “HyperCharge” technology to a mainstream, global audience. The upcoming Xiaomi 11T Pro has a 120W charger, a huge power increase on the current global flagship Mi 11, which uses a 55W charger that can get you to 100 percent in 45 minutes. Xiaomi hasn’t revealed estimating charging times for the 11T Pro yet, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s China-only Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; also had a 120W charger that took just 23 minutes...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam’s downloads page just got a lot more informative</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xmtZWj"&gt;Valve has just released a &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/2941402621044012222"&gt;big update for Steam&lt;/a&gt; that offers a number of small but significant tweaks to the digital games store. Many of these changes have been &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/steam-client-beta-overhauls-downloads-page-and-storage-management-looks-great/"&gt;available in beta for months&lt;/a&gt;, but now they’re hitting the software’s stable release channel. The update overhauls the downloads page and introduces a much improved section for managing your storage, amongst a host of other tweaks and fixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWFF0a"&gt;The downloads page has seen the bulk of the improvements. For starters, as well as showing download progress, the page also now shows installation progress. It should cut down on those frustrating moments when a game appears to be fully downloaded but isn’t playable because it’s not yet fully installed. The priority of downloads in the queue...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Material You design is coming to Gmail, Calendar, and Docs on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qe9tgoEPg8imvzWOdIKxwU63pT8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838608/acastro_201210_1777_gmail_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RitgUJ"&gt;Google is starting to roll out its new Material You design system to Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and more on Android. The new look will include changes to navigation bars, improved action buttons, and Google’s Sans text for better readability. It’s part of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;bigger Android 12 redesign&lt;/a&gt; that includes big, bubbly buttons, shifting colors, smoother animations, and some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663710/android-12-beta-5-ui-updates-features-clock-widgets-search-bar-calculator"&gt;overhauls to built-in apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYtqg5"&gt;The design changes mean Pixel devices with Android 12 or newer will be able to match the colors inside apps like Gmail, Google Meet, and Google Drive with their wallpapers for &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/09/material-you-for-android.html"&gt;what Google calls&lt;/a&gt; a “more dynamic, personalized look.” Existing color schemes and color-coded file types and folders will remain unchanged within the apps, though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly overcomes Watch Series 7 manufacturing issues</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hnmit8"&gt;Apple has reportedly overcome the production issues it’s been having with its unreleased smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 7, and will now begin mass manufacturing the device in mid-September, according to a report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/kuo-apple-watch-series-7-ship-late-sept/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The news comes as Apple gears up for a major launch event on September 14th. The fall event will presumably be focused on its latest iPhone models with the new Apple Watch also expected to make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAzCXE"&gt;Late last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had temporarily halted production of its latest smartwatch while it fixed the problems. The issues were thought to be related to the Series 7’s revamped design, which is said to consist of “&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;a flatter display and edges&lt;/a&gt;”...&lt;/p&gt;
