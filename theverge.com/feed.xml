  &lt;p id="Zy4EVP"&gt;Activision Blizzard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;facing a discrimination lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing&lt;/a&gt; (or DFEH), has filed an application to stay that lawsuit so it can investigate claims that DFEH lawyers engaged in ethical misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ib1oil"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6zB7gp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7VHZD"&gt;The application claims that the DFEH is represented in the case by lawyers who previously worked for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (or EEOC)  — a federal agency that investigates claims of workplace abuse. The application additionally claims such an arrangement is in violation of a California State Bar conflict of interest rule that says, “a lawyer who has formerly served as a public official or employee of the government [...] shall not otherwise represent a client in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: the MacBook Pro 14-inch’s $20 power brick upsell is probably worth it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NIO_tKL0ve33zAqcLcjYg4abcPg=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018348/lcimg_f1ce43fd_90a7_4584_bc4f_63c9935d516b.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dSAcBZ"&gt;If you’re looking at buying the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;$1,999 base model MacBook Pro 14-inch&lt;/a&gt;, there’s one upgrade that you may really want to make — the $20 one that gets you the 96W power adapter instead of the 67W included power adapter. That’s because, according to some wording on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-space-gray-8-core-cpu-14-core-gpu-512gb#"&gt;Apple’s MacBook Pro configuration page&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-67w-adapter-cant-fast-charge/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), you’ll need the more powerful charger if you want to take advantage of the computer’s fast charging feature, which can charge the laptop up to 50 percent in half an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="om07HD"&gt;Is it ridiculous that Apple is basically taxing the people who want to buy its least expensive (but still very pricey!) new MacBook Pro? Yes, absolutely — but you should still probably pay it if you want to charge your laptop up quickly. The...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pixel 6 doesn’t come with five years of Android updates — only three</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nSPoNXX5eOm7F6oh4iKbTkaetyA=/152x0:1768x1077/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018216/qMm7BP1Fye.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VerlUH"&gt;For the first time ever, Google’s new phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;are powered by a Google-designed chip&lt;/a&gt;, giving the company an Apple-like level of control over the inner workings of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.&lt;/a&gt; But if you were hoping that meant they’d also get an Apple-like level of new OS updates, the company is throwing a bit of cold water on that. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#zippy=%2Cpixel-xl-a-a-xl-xl-a-a-g-a-g%2Cpixel-pixel-pro-phones"&gt;Google’s support page shows it’s only promising&lt;/a&gt; to offer Android updates through October 2024 (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-6-three-years-os-updates-five-years-security-patches/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;), &lt;/em&gt;a total of three years after release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4ikZY"&gt;“Users will still get at least 3 years of OS updates, after which we’re committing to ensure that Pixels will stay up-to-date and secure,” Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The frequency and categories of updates will depend on the capabilities and needs of the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A future update to Facebook’s Portal will stop kids from watching content unsupervised</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B7hcVR"&gt;Facebook is delivering an update to Portal devices that will make it possible to turn off the Watch Together feature during calls in Household Mode. The update comes shortly after&lt;em&gt; a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/facebooks-portal-go-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article criticized Facebook’s blatant oversight of not including an “off” switch for the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wy6TwE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21433086/facebook-messenger-watch-together-video-messaging"&gt;Watch Together lets you watch shows, music videos, or funny clips&lt;/a&gt; with distant friends or family members. Choose a video from Facebook’s selection, and it’ll be simultaneously presented to you on your Portal and on your friend’s device, whether that may be a phone, tablet, or Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ytp59q"&gt;Watch Together may sound like a great idea, but it obviously isn’t ideal for parents who want to keep their kids away from videos on the internet. When a Portal device...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard says 20 employees ‘exited’ as part of harassment investigations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard employees stage a walkout in the response from company leadership to a lawsuit highlighting alleged harassment, inequality" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/juGIllfyRRHwaX--E0CGafouQ6c=/110x0:4090x2653/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018110/1234303856.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bounvc"&gt;Activision Blizzard says more than 20 employees have “exited” the company, and more than 20 other employees have been reprimanded following complaints about misconduct. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7cb805b9-4d14-40ee-a1f2-72bc3c3e1ea6"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that the company sent a letter to staff on Tuesday with the details, and chief compliance officer Frances Townsend told the outlet that the list included game developers and “a few” supervisors but no members of the board. Activision Blizzard later &lt;a href="https://www.activisionblizzard.com/content/atvi/activisionblizzard/ab-touchui/ab/web/en/newsroom/2021/10/creating-a-more-accountable-workplace.html"&gt;posted the letter online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8lVxm"&gt;The letter outlines a company attempt to “earn our team’s confidence that, when they speak up, they will be heard” — following a series of lawsuits accusing Activision Blizzard employees of systematic discrimination and gender-based harassment. It says the disciplinary...&lt;/p&gt;

Some unsteadiness is to be expected given the sudden demand, but at 1PM ET, the doors opened, and Google’s store seemed to fall flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGyn0z"&gt;As of 5:40PM ET, Google says the store is operational again, and many of us have been able to put orders through. According to a spokesperson, “The Google Store was temporarily down but is now back up. We apologize for the inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zzX7D"&gt;However, as &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/19/pixel-6-shipping-date-flux/#more-461552"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out, being able to submit an order is only part of it.

    <title>Spec showdown: Google’s new Pixel 6 vs. Samsung, Apple, and more</title>

  &lt;p id="gqqDWH"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;its fall event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, Google announced the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, which feature its custom Tensor processor and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;the first big camera upgrade for Google’s phones&lt;/a&gt; since the Pixel 3. Since the Pixel 6s are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734748/google-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;available to preorder now&lt;/a&gt;, let’s take a look at how Google’s new phones compare on paper to their Android and iPhone competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8OO9p"&gt;At this point, how Google’s Tensor custom chip will perform is the biggest question mark — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; it’s comparable to the Snapdragon 888, but that’s not even Qualcomm’s most powerful chip today, and Qualcomm is &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-tech-summit"&gt;holding an event in November&lt;/a&gt;, potentially to show off &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-tech-summit"&gt;even newer chips&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, though, as we’re working on putting the Tensor through its paces to see how it performs in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox will soon automatically mute your speakers when you plug in headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUwkVmkFKb8cr-7jjvFTV1nrT_s=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017902/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o3eqym"&gt;Microsoft is testing a feature that automatically mutes your speakers when you plug in headphones, fixing one of my biggest pet peeves with playing games on Xbox. The feature is rolling out &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/19/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-skip-ahead-2111-211017-2200/"&gt;to Xbox Insiders on the Alpha Skip-Ahead ring&lt;/a&gt;, which means it will very likely be available more broadly in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8AXc6F"&gt;Right now, when you plug in headphones to your controller on Xbox, your speakers stay on, too, which means if you want to have the audio just play in your headphones, you have to separately turn down the volume on your speakers. The PS5, on the other hand, handily mutes speaker audio when you plug in headphones, and I’m glad Microsoft is following suit by working on a similar feature for Xbox. The option to atuomatically mute...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="8lJc8j"&gt;Netflix will change the public-facing metrics it uses to rank the most popular titles on its streaming service, the company announced Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PGuLq"&gt;In the past, the company has ranked titles based on the completion of at least the first two minutes of a film or TV show in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723452/netflix-squid-game-biggest-ever-show-at-launch"&gt;first 28 days&lt;/a&gt; on the service. More recently, however, the company has released rankings based on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;total number of hours&lt;/a&gt; a movie or series is viewed — a metric it will shift to moving forward beginning later this year, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/FINAL-Q3-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;letter to shareholders&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzeZBK"&gt;“There is some difference in rankings [...] but we think engagement as measured by hours viewed is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of our titles and member satisfaction,” the company...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MuRDpK"&gt;Boeing says it is narrowing down the source of the issue that delayed the launch of its new Starliner spacecraft this summer, blaming the problem on excess water and humidity causing the vehicle’s valves to stick ahead of the flight. The company plans to extensively study the problematic valves over the months ahead and implement design changes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718002/boeing-starliner-test-flight-delayed-nasa-2022"&gt;with the hope of launching Starliner again in mid-2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYQrEh"&gt;Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner is a new passenger spacecraft, designed to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. Before Starliner can carry a crew, however, NASA wants Boeing to launch a successful flight of the vehicle without people on board, to prove the spacecraft can safely go...&lt;/p&gt;
