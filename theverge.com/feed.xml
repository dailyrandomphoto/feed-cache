    <title>Returnal finally adds a ‘suspend’ feature to let you pause the game mid-run</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qmPFGQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/10/26/returnal-2-0-update-brings-suspend-cycle-and-photo-mode/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;’s 2.0 update is out today&lt;/a&gt;, bringing two of the most requested features for Housemarque’s punishingly difficult sci-fi roguelike: the option to suspend the game in the middle of a run without losing progress, and a photo mode for capturing all of Atropos’ most stunning visuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zYRVx"&gt;The lack of a suspend mode has been one of the biggest knocks against the otherwise &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;well-received title&lt;/a&gt;. An average run in &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; can easily take upward of 45 minutes and had to be completed in a single gameplay session. Players were unable to close out &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; and come back to a run later, and if the console was accidentally shut down or lost power, you’d lose all your hard-won progress. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ybu15u"&gt;Amazon is next on the list of companies getting into the live audio game. The company is building a new app, codenamed “Project Mic,” that gives anyone the ability to make and distribute a live radio show, complete with music, according to a presentation viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. This project’s big goal is to democratize and reinvent the radio. The app will be focused on the US initially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnwYUU"&gt;Listeners will be able to tune in through the app, as well as through Audible, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Alexa-equipped devices. With the Alexa devices, listeners will be able to interact with shows using just their voice. The app experience will also be optimized for the car, playing into Amazon’s idea of trying to reinvent radio. A mockup app image viewed...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s broadband satellite venture Kuiper teams up with Verizon to expand 5G coverage</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SdhCxK"&gt;Amazon’s ambitious satellite venture, called Kuiper, is teaming up with Verizon to further expand 4G/LTE and 5G coverage to remote areas of the globe. Through the new partnership, Kuiper’s future satellites could provide connectivity to future Verizon cell towers that don’t require as much costly infrastructure to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFxU7e"&gt;Kuiper is Amazon’s $10 billion initiative to launch a constellation of 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit to provide broadband internet coverage to the Earth below. With satellites flying at altitudes between 366 miles and 391 miles high (or 590 kilometers and 630 kilometers up), the plan is to provide connectivity to remote and rural areas, where it is difficult to provide internet coverage through traditional fiber....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Palm’s brand resuscitated again for true wireless earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uPtsocPVmEGaYCcQn_pWOnqQGYA=/0x203:2000x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046194/ECF37DFD_319C_4CF8_8A54_1C143299ED8D.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Palm Ventures Group, Inc&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YeXGm1"&gt;After launching the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18212311/palm-phone-review-time-well-spent-life-mode-lite-verizon"&gt;Palm Phone in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the reincarnated “Palm” is back again with its next new product. But it’s not another smartphone. Instead, the startup that now owns the Palm brand is jumping on the trend of true wireless earbuds. The Palm Buds Pro — yes, yet another “Pro” gadget — are available to preorder starting today for $99, though they’ll eventually rise to an MSRP of $129. For that price, you’ll be getting a set of earbuds with noise cancellation, bass-heavy 10-millimeter drivers, and IPX4 water and sweat resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1tKzs"&gt;Palm says the earbuds fit into its “lightweight product philosophy” that began with the tiny, TCL-manufactured Palm Phone, which is no longer available. As for who’s making the Palm Buds Pro, Palm Ventures...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch streaming is returning to the Xbox dashboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpAKfmxL6Pdg1slK5iHSiaJ7yk8=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70045961/twitchxbox.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eFWdFf"&gt;Microsoft is bringing back Twitch streaming integration directly into the Xbox dashboard. Twitch first appeared directly integrated into the Xbox One dashboard in 2014, using the original Snap interface to allow players to stream directly to the service. Now it’s coming back into the Xbox Guide interface, with similar integration and webcam support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0ZS4F"&gt;Alpha and Skip-Ahead alpha Xbox testers &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/25/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-skip-ahead-2111-211022-2000/"&gt;can access the new integration&lt;/a&gt; right now, and it’s simple to use. You can adjust game volume or microphone volume, include party audio from friends, and see a list of viewers and how long you’ve been streaming with an overlay on top of your games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DdvqTV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vUbjR0"&gt;The Twitch integration also includes the ability to switch resolution and bitrates from 360p at 500kbps up...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony Xperia Pro-I is a camera first, 5G phone second</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFMkgo"&gt;Sony is ready to throw-down with a new camera-first 5G phone — the Xperia Pro-I — in the battle for smartphone camera supremacy. Less than 12-hours after the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s reviews started dropping online, and all the camera enthusiasts trying to determine whether the Pixel 6 Pro or the iPhone 13 Pro Max has the best smartphone camera, Sony wants to be in the mix with the Xperia Pro-I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uk3hDL"&gt;The “I” in the Xperia Pro-I stands for imaging, which pays homage to Sony’s popular line of Alpha mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras and professional video cameras, rather than point-and-shoot camera model names like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995864/sony-rx100-mark-vii-camera-review-price-specs-features-microphone-jack"&gt;Sony RX100 VII (Mark 7)&lt;/a&gt;. At least that’s what the Sony representatives who were briefing journalists ahead of this...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s value tops $1 trillion after Hertz ordered 100,000 of its vehicles</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QcJ6yp"&gt;Rental car company Hertz has ordered 100,000 Teslas as part of an ambitious plan to electrify its fleet. A first tranche of Tesla’s Model 3 sedans will be available to rent from Hertz in major US and European markets from early November, said the company in a &lt;a href="https://ir.hertz.com/2021-10-25-Hertz-Invests-in-Largest-Electric-Vehicle-Rental-Fleet-and-Partners-with-Seven-Time-Super-Bowl-Champion-Tom-Brady-to-Headline-New-Campaign"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement comes just months after Hertz &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/business/hertz-bankrupcty.html"&gt;escaped bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77ESnD"&gt;After the purchase was announced, Tesla’s stock price reached as high as $998.74 early in the day, increasing its market cap to over $1 trillion before the price dropped again. However, by the time the market closed for the day, its price had risen again, finishing at $1,024.86 per share for a market cap of $1.01 trillion. As &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/tesla-shares-up-on-news-hertz-will-purchase-100000-electric-vehicles.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; notes, that put it in the rare company of other trillion-dollar market...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="CHIdMX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doomsday Machine&lt;/em&gt; is the upcoming television adaption of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22577939/facebook-an-ugly-truth-frankel-kang-stamos-russia-interference"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a book that exposes Facebook’s missteps on issues like misinformation, hate speech, user security. The drama will star Claire Foy as Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and will tackle the chaos surrounding misinformation during the 2016 election, as well as more recent controversies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671565/facebook-xcheck-moderation-system-high-profile-exemptions"&gt;like the XCheck program&lt;/a&gt;, which let celebrities and other high-profile figures bypass content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why smart alarm clocks can’t be trusted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/57HNvUXsSUQ9v36-0_oTiB9mSA0=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70044517/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smart alarm clocks like this Echo Dot with Clock have lots of great features, but are missing one key feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ba4CM5"&gt;When you buy a product labeled “smart,” it should be better than the “dumb” version, especially considering it costs twice as much (at least). But that’s not the case with smart alarm clocks, which are very dumb in one specific way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBNCYI"&gt;Smart alarm clocks are bedside buzzers with smart features, letting you set an alarm with just your voice, waking you up with your favorite Spotify playlist, possibly tracking your sleep, and definitely controlling your smart home. Most have touch screens, some have radar, very few have cameras (thankfully), and others can use lighting to wake you up more naturally than a jarring buzzer. But what none of them have is a backup battery, something that’s been standard on the dumb versions for decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhIMz4"&gt;If your...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="meI0dy"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he’s redirected teams within his company to “make serving young adults their north star.” The comment, made on a call with investors this afternoon, speaks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"&gt;Facebooks’ concerns about declining usage among teens and young adults&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1RV0K"&gt;“So much of our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them, rather than specifically for young adults,” Zuckerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="clYbeu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok is “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LuX6K8"&gt;He suggested the change will be more than just lip service. Facebook usage among older users will grow slower than it otherwise would have because of the changes, Zuckerberg said. Even with those tradeoffs, he said, “I think it’s the right approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
