  &lt;p id="NBEKW7"&gt;Apple’s hardware team is getting its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Fdan-riccio-begins-a-new-chapter-at-apple%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22249393%2Fapple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;biggest shakeup&lt;/a&gt; in nearly a decade, as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fleadership%2Fdan-riccio%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22249393%2Fapple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dan Riccio&lt;/a&gt; — who served as the company’s senior vice president of hardware engineering since 2012 — transitions to “a new role” at the company. He’ll be replaced as Apple’s head hardware engineer by John Ternus, who led the hardware team designing the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, in addition to working on Apple’s M1 chips. Ternus has been vice president of hardware engineering at Apple since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="to8wIv"&gt;The role of senior vice president of hardware engineering at Apple is a key one: the position reports directly to CEO Tim Cook, and is responsible for leading the Mac, iPhone, iPad and iPod engineering teams.

    <title>Biden wants to replace government fleet with electric vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PW58tzRJVIVSLnww26Ctf0oJA3E=/72x0:6368x4197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719405/All_New_Ford_E_Transit_06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zcvx0Y"&gt;President Joe Biden will start the process of phasing out the federal government’s use of gas-powered vehicles and replacing them with ones that run on electricity. The announcement is the fulfillment of a promise Biden made on the campaign trail to swap government fleet vehicles with American-made EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nMouO"&gt;“The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we’re going to replace with clean electric vehicles made right here in America, by American workers,” Biden said during a briefing Monday announcing his “Buy American” executive order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nr3CGT"&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Alexa can now act on its own hunches to turn off lights and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RIscYa8w5azfuiiycAFMbrXgNGQ=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719335/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qGEx5E"&gt;Amazon is enabling a new feature today that allows Alexa to proactively complete tasks around the house, such as turning off lights, based on your habits and frequent requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JceNR"&gt;Alexa has been able to sense these habits and ask about them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17883396/amazon-alexa-hunches-prediction-smart-home-ai"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt; — the company calls them “hunches” — but before this update, Alexa would ask permission before acting on something like lowering the thermostat before you went to bed. If the new proactive hunches are enabled, though, Alexa will skip asking for permission for a task and just do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W6V4DQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="24sgVb"&gt;While proactive hunches seem like they could make Alexa a lot more useful, having granular controls over what Alexa can automatically act on will be important. An Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G26GBKGQ228X44TH&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;support article&lt;/a&gt; seems to suggest you can...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nerf’s new blasters curve their shots a la Angelina Jolie in Wanted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M58h4BhLffvlotymKMnZEDV7qas=/0x3:500x336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719289/nerf_rival_curve_shot_5.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zyu1QZ"&gt;Nerf’s got a new trick up its sleeve: Hasbro’s latest foam-flinging sidearms can &lt;em&gt;curve&lt;/em&gt; their shots, possibly letting you hit targets you can’t even see. (Think Angelina Jolie or James McAvoy in &lt;em&gt;Wanted &lt;/em&gt;but with bouncy balls instead &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1d4BewyhlI"&gt;of bullets&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfYtul"&gt;That’s because each of Nerf’s three new Rival Curve blasters has an adjustable barrel you can twist to change the angle of your shot: left or right to shoot around corners, up to shoot straight, or down to lob balls over cover.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jUU3ug"&gt;Feeling skeptical? I would also be looking at this CG, especially considering &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZ4lCKv1ik"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MythBusters&lt;/em&gt; all but proved you can’t bend a real-life bullet&lt;/a&gt; over a decade ago. But you actually &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;curve toy projectiles like these foam balls. In fact, companies like Hasbro have...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>5G boxes are coming to people’s homes, whether they want them or not</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nDFbTN"&gt;When most people look out their windows in the morning, they likely aren’t expecting to be surprised by a chest freezer-sized box that’s feeding a 5G antenna, but that’s the exact experience some Houston residents have been having. Verizon has been installing the boxes as part of its 5G network rollout since at least 2019, and from the &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Streamlined-5G-buildout-puts-ground-15889021.php#photo-20522171"&gt;reporting done by the &lt;em&gt;Houston Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it seems as if it’s been anything but smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzhQWp"&gt;The boxes are known as “ground fixtures,” and they supply power and data to 5G antennas that are placed on utility poles nearby. The ones gracing people’s front window views are being set up to build out Verizon’s 5G home internet service. It’s well-known at this point that, while millimeter-wave tech is blazing-fast, it...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slow certification process keeps some pharmacists from giving COVID-19 vaccines   </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I8FnQI"&gt;When pharmacist Erin McCreary moved to Pennsylvania in 2018, she didn’t anticipate ever having to administer vaccines. She’d taken a vaccination certification course back in pharmacy school six years earlier, but it wasn’t part of her job description as an infectious diseases pharmacist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. That’s why she wasn’t concerned about the state pharmacy board rule that pharmacists had to file their certificate &lt;a href="https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.papharmacists.com/resource/resmgr/toolkits/Immunization_License_Applica.pdf"&gt;within two years&lt;/a&gt; of receiving it or they’d have to take the course again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2S4KCn"&gt;“Well, now, of course, COVID-19 happened,” McCreary told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. She wanted to sign up to help with COVID-19 vaccination efforts, so she emailed the board asking if they could waive the requirement. “I have my...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony could bring back the Xperia Compact to compete with the iPhone 12 mini</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pQ2Xqo"&gt;Sony is reportedly set to bring back its “Compact” line of phones in 2021 with a new Xperia Compact model. It will offer a 5.5-inch display and dimensions more in line with Apple’s (relatively) diminutive iPhone 12 mini rather than the increasingly large phones that Sony has offered for the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
