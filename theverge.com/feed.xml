    <title>Inauguration Day was more accessible than ever, but there’s still a ways to go</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhrnY0"&gt;Firefighter Andrea Hall put accessible communication front and center at the presidential inauguration today when she led the Pledge of Allegiance in both spoken English and Signed English. The inaugural committee also hosted several separate accessible live streams of the event on its YouTube page, including one with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/cctCd8jI0e8"&gt;audio description&lt;/a&gt;, one with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/5-dkVhOQRRQ"&gt;live captions and American Sign Language interpretation&lt;/a&gt;, and one with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XyHeDfMgjEc"&gt;Cued Speech transliteration&lt;/a&gt; (the use of hand shapes to signal speech sounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nffV7y"&gt;But despite those efforts,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;many deaf and hard of hearing viewers still found the inauguration inaccessible. Most broadcast stations didn’t have an ASL interpreter on-screen and used automated captions, which are notoriously inaccurate. In what some...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JBL’s speaker-packed Google Nest Hub alternative is $220 off</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: JBL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NVho47"&gt;JBL’s Google Assistant-powered smart display, the Link View, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fitm%252F154193201978%26campid%3D5338421468%26toolid%3D10001%26customid%3Dvergegooddeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F20%2F22241056%2Fjbl-link-view-google-assistant-smart-display-ebay-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is on sale for $80&lt;/a&gt; on Harman Audio’s (JBL’s parent company) eBay store. While its original price was $300, this smart display has been slowly getting cheaper since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/2018/8/1/17640698/jbl-link-view-google-smart-display-speaker-release-date"&gt;it debuted in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Both the black and white color variants are on sale, and it comes with free standard shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xn5zSg"&gt;The JBL Link View smart display features an 8-inch touchscreen display with a webcam built into the device. Although it has been on the market for several years, time has been kind to this smart display. And &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/jn538v/jbl_link_view_updated_with_the_new_interface/"&gt;Reddit users have pointed&lt;/a&gt; out that the Link View recently received an update, which includes a new user interface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HLwOWH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10294136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Twitch has ‘indefinitely’ banned Donald Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVJnA6Vy5Cy1qAdS9JHpgcJIzZQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696575/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CdjP2z"&gt;Twitch has “indefinitely” banned former President Donald Trump from its platform. The action comes two weeks after the site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219144/twitch-trump-ban-indefinitely-capitol-attack"&gt;disabled Trump’s account&lt;/a&gt;, preventing him from streaming but leaving the account page live, in light of the mob attack on the Capitol. At the time, a company spokesperson told a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reporter that it would reassess his account after he left office — which happened today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzNXWX"&gt;“We have indefinitely suspended President Trump’s Twitch channel due to the ongoing risk of further incitement of violence,” a Twitch spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="f055FH"&gt;The President’s statements continue to be interpreted as calls to action, and we are taking this action to remove the potential for harm to our community and the general...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>WhiteHouse.gov now has dark mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the White House website, showing the dark, high contrast mode activated." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jKVZ56Tusr2DG23Nb-8RLmxd7XA=/53x0:2231x1452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68695583/Screen_Shot_2021_01_20_at_9.26.43_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cpyu7d"&gt;The official website of the White House, &lt;a href="http://Whitehouse.gov"&gt;WhiteHouse.gov&lt;/a&gt;, has been completely replaced with a new version for the Biden administration, and it comes with some unexpected accessibility features: a high contrast mode, which serves as a dark mode, and a toggle to make the font size larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5fy08"&gt;Both options show up along the left rail as big, easy-to-click or tap buttons, and that’s the way you’ll need to toggle them. Even if your device has a system-wide dark mode, the White House website won’t switch over automatically. That’s because it’s really there to serve as an accessibility feature, meant to help anyone who would have trouble reading or looking at a bright white screen with black text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lszlCD"&gt;With dark mode being very popular among heavy...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today, the US welcomed a new president and new Bernie memes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQvc69FeJ0LftAQefxGotvawJ3Y=/0x17:1096x748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696431/EsMWA4aW4AIwkUE.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="21cO1c"&gt;Today’s US presidential inauguration brought many good things, but the thing Twitter seems most excited about is a new crop of Bernie memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6m7bZi"&gt;The meme started with a wire photo of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), sitting on a folding chair watching President Joe Biden’s inauguration. The temperature in Washington, DC was in the 40s, so he’s bundled up with a coat and mittens, and he’s sitting socially distanced from everyone else, as his age and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/us/politics/bernie-sanders-hospital.html"&gt;prior health issues&lt;/a&gt; put him at severe risk for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGEbbH"&gt;Something about Sanders’ chilly body language, his oversized wool mittens, and the fact that he was sitting entirely alone made the photo irresistible as meme material. Of course, the senator is no stranger to memes — including 2016’s Birdie...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon offers to help Biden administration with vaccinations</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuoNCGF2wk_IfHjm8sh0d3tZ8iU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696294/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtIIvD"&gt;Amazon has offered to help the Biden administration meet its goal of completing 100 million coronavirus vaccinations within the next 100 days. “Our scale allows us to make a meaningful impact immediately in the fight against COVID-19, and we stand ready to assist you in this effort,” Dave Clark, Amazon’s worldwide operations leader, wrote in a letter to the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvVhto"&gt;The company’s main interest appears to be in offering vaccinations through its own facilities. Clark writes that Amazon has “an agreement in place” with a health care provider to administer vaccinations on site, though he did not say which Amazon facilities were being considered. The company operates warehouses, Amazon-branded shops, and Whole Foods grocery stores....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As parting message, Jim Bridenstine leaves Artemis program ‘in good shape’ for Biden’s NASA</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/70enVG2znkIet-J4NT4lvbWSJtw=/0x0:4855x3237/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696201/33044625978_0f7c430472_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Bill Ingalls / NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YGV9Ig"&gt;At 12PM ET today, Jim Bridenstine officially stepped down from his role as NASA administrator. During his time at the agency, the former Oklahoma congressman and Naval aviator used his political chops to drum up bipartisan support for the Trump administration’s Artemis program, the agency’s cornerstone initiative to land humans on the Moon by 2024 — a deadline widely viewed as nearly impossible to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oobCp7"&gt;In anticipation of President Joe Biden taking office and the Senate transitioning to Democratic control, Bridenstine, a Republican, spent his final days as administrator making one last push for the Artemis program, a parting bid to insulate the program from potential cancellation. Last week, he met with top Democrats including Sen....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen boss joins Twitter with a jab at Elon Musk</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="New President Of SEAT Is Presented In Barcelona" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l0P8mq5rtDd-nZEsLfAoxLTlt94=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68695981/1275822696.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hIQ22k"&gt;Volkswagen Group boss Herbert Diess joined twitter Wednesday, and his first tweet was a light trolling of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SF6FrF"&gt;“Hello @Twitter! I’m here to make an impact with @VWGroup, especially on political issues,” Diess &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1351915219094806529"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “And, of course, to get some of your market shares, @elonmusk – after all, our ID.3 and e-tron have won the first markets in Europe. Looking forward to productive discussions!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzHbwf"&gt;Diess — who last year settled criminal charges related to &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20200520-volkswagen-bosses-avoid-trial-over-dieselgate-scandal-with-9-mn-euro-settlement"&gt;his role in the Dieselgate emissions scandal&lt;/a&gt; — was referencing how the first mass-market electric vehicles of its VW and Audi brands performed well in Europe (and &lt;a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/german-electric-car-sales-triple-2020"&gt;especially in Germany&lt;/a&gt;) in their debut year, causing Tesla to lose market share on the continent.

    <title>As promised, Twitter made Joe Biden’s @POTUS account start with zero followers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="22XJ2G"&gt;President Biden is going to need some Twitter followers. Twitter wiped out all followers from the @POTUS and @WhiteHouse accounts once Biden was sworn in, today, January 20th, rather than transferring the accounts’ existing followers over to the new administration. That’s what &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Rob_Flaherty/status/1341406581901189120"&gt;what Rob Flaherty&lt;/a&gt;, Biden’s digital director, said would happen in late December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVImpc"&gt;Here’s the full list of changes today, according to Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EszzjG"&gt;Trump administration Twitter accounts are now publicly archived and include: @POTUS45, @WhiteHouse45, @VP45, @PressSec45, @FLOTUS45 and @SecondLady45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOGeo9"&gt;Accounts for the White House, President, Vice President, First Lady and White House Press Secretary have now inherited their new institutional usernames:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSNr9a"&gt;Streaming services are slowly turning into cable TV — complete &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168484/disney-streaming-bundle-ad-free-hulu-disney-plus-espn-price-release-date"&gt;with bundles&lt;/a&gt;, an ever-growing list of channels, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21291519/justwatch-streaming-search-engine-filter-app-impressions-hbo-max-disney-plus-netflix-hulu"&gt;reinvented TV guide&lt;/a&gt;.
