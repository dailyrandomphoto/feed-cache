    <title>Realme’s bulky magnetic wireless charger is almost as fast as promised</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sCHWRHeVVfHKxufRxvech5n-DSk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69751721/DSCF7747.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The MagDart charger has a hefty cooling fan.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6WaizF"&gt;Earlier this month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607214/realme-magdart-announced-magnetic-wireless-charger-devices"&gt;Realme launched MagDart&lt;/a&gt;, its MagSafe-a-like ecosystem of magnetic wireless charging products. The headline device is a 50W brick that Realme professes to be the fastest magnetic wireless charger in the world — it’s supposed to be able to charge a 4,500mAh battery from 0 to 100 percent in 54 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybi3Mj"&gt;Naturally I was interested in trying this for myself. Realme sent me a 50W MagDart charger, a 65W SuperDart wall charger to plug it into, and a Realme Flash “concept phone” with built-in MagDart compatibility. (The only other Realme phone to work with MagDart is the new GT flagship, and even that requires a specialized case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IY5D6P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aWfnOh"&gt;The Flash isn’t a commercial device, but it’s a very nice phone nonetheless. That’s mostly because...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Calendar will let you record where you’re working to help organize office meetings</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O5O4wR"&gt;Google is adding an option to its Calendar service to let you show where you’re working on any given day of the week, the &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/share-where-youre-working-from-in.html"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The feature will start rolling out from August 30th for users on select Google Workspace plans, and will be accessible via Calendar’s settings menu alongside its existing working hours options, as well as on the weekly calendar view below where it shows each day’s dates. Available work locations include “Office,” “Home,” “Unspecified,” or “Somewhere else.”    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXpiyc"&gt;According to Google, the option is being added so it’s “easier to plan in-person collaboration or set expectations in a hybrid workplace.” It follows a surge in the popularity of home and hybrid working due to the pandemic. This has meant...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fQ5JS0"&gt;Apple is delaying its mandatory return to offices until at least January 2022, citing a surge in COVID-19 cases. The company will give employees a month’s notice before they have to return to in-person work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhOMfs"&gt;In an internal email sent this evening, Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of people and retail, encouraged employees to get vaccinated and noted that Apple retail stores remain open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNPfap"&gt;“I know there are feeling of frustration that the pandemic is not yet behind us,” she wrote. “For many colleagues around the world, this period has been a time of great tragedy, suffering, and heartbreak. Please know that we are all here to support one another and stand with one another during such challenging times.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Tesla is working on humanoid robots</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIAE4V"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his company is working on a humanoid robot and that it will build a prototype “sometime next year.” The humanoid robot will leverage Tesla’s experience with automated machines in its factories, as well as some of the hardware and software that powers the company’s Autopilot driver assistance software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BN7SgY"&gt;Musk, who has spoken repeatedly about his fears of runaway artificial intelligence, said the Tesla Bot is “intended to be friendly,” but that the company is designing the machine at a “mechanical level” so that “you can run away from it, and most likely overpower it.” It will be five feet, eight inches tall, weigh 125 pounds, and have a screen for a face. The code name for the bot inside the company is “Optimus,”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans to prohibit sexually explicit content beginning in October </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4dSzrxwGxj92iIHuL5aoi-hHdyE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749152/acastro_200227_1777_onlyfans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E6qjUz"&gt;Video sharing site OnlyFans, best known for its creators’ adult videos and photos, will prohibit sexually explicit content starting October 1st. First &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it is making the changes because of pressure from its banking and payment provider partners, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22633411/onlyfans-banned-explicit-porn-sex-content-after-bbc-investigation-leak"&gt;a BBC investigation found&lt;/a&gt; that the company had been lenient on creators who had posted illegal content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcpuBo"&gt;“In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of our platform, and to continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our content guidelines,” OnlyFans said in a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1G7ho3"&gt;Creators on the platform will still be allowed to post nude images as long as they comply with the site’s &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/terms"&gt;acceptable use...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans’ inexplicable ban on porn might be explained by this BBC investigation</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UkT6uk"&gt;Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632797/onlyfans-prohibit-sexually-explicit-content-porn-creators"&gt;OnlyFans stunned the world&lt;/a&gt; by revealing it would ditch the thing it’s famous for: sexually explicit videos and photography. Yes, OnlyFans is banning porn, starting October 1st. But at least one publication wasn’t completely shocked by the decision — because it came in the middle of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58255865"&gt;a BBC investigation&lt;/a&gt; into how the video sharing site was &lt;em&gt;knowingly &lt;/em&gt;letting creators slide despite publishing illegal content on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02U8yR"&gt;Instead of banning an account or sounding the alarm, the company explicitly recommends in a “compliance manual” that moderators should first issue a series of three warnings about why each piece of content has been removed. Unless it’s a successful creator, of course, in which case “accounts with higher...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how much it costs to fix a Z Fold 3 or Z Flip 3 with a broken screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OTDk2waIZmsFLjnEJEzqlkj8r94=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750869/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3KW8h2"&gt;Samsung’s new foldables are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;quite impressive&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;making them as durable as possible&lt;/a&gt; — but sometimes, accidents happen. We asked Samsung how much it would cost to replace a Z Flip or Z Fold 3’s screen should something happen to it, and here’s what the company told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eV8jmP"&gt;Samsung provides a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/warranty/?model=N0053854" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one year warranty&lt;/a&gt; with the phones, so if your screen breaks in a way that’s covered, you shouldn’t have to pay for a repair. Out of warranty, fixing the interior folding screen of a Z Fold 3 costs $479. Doing the same for a Z Flip 3 costs $369. Thankfully, the external displays are much less expensive — fixing a broken outer screen will set you back $149 for the Fold and $99 for the Flip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MngxoL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Out of warranty, the Fold’s folding...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Adobe is acquiring collaborative video software maker Frame.io for $1.275 billion</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Frame.io&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dkTUp7"&gt;Adobe &lt;a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2021/Adobe-to-Acquire-Frame.io/default.aspx"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s acquiring the company behind popular &lt;a href="http://frame.io"&gt;collaborative video production software of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, Frame.io, for $1.275 billion. Adobe says it tried to create its own collaboration software on its own, but settled on buying Frame.io because some customers were already using it in their workflows, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/adobe-to-buy-frame-io-for-1-3-billion-in-cash-in-video-push?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgA7wp"&gt;Frame.io takes the frequently time consuming process of reviewing edits and footage, and makes it asynchronous and on the web, Google Workspace-style. Editors, clients, and whoever else can use the company’s cloud-based software to store and view footage, and leave feedback on edits, just by sharing a link. Frame.io also offers integrations with popular video editing software like Adobe’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spawn Together campaign surpasses $1 million fundraising goal for AbleGamers charity</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Du9pe"&gt;Steven Spohn passed a goal this week that he’s been chasing for nearly a year. He raised over a million dollars for &lt;a href="https://ablegamers.org"&gt;AbleGamers&lt;/a&gt;, a charity that seeks to improve accessibility in games and connects disabled people with peer support and adaptive tech for gaming. Spohn has been its COO for 15 years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MyYKf"&gt;The charity’s mission, he says, is about giving people with disabilities access to “that sense of independence and that feeling of exploration or excitement or relaxation, whatever it is you’re going for, to help you mentally get through the tough times.” &lt;/p&gt;
