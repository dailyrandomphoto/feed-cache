    <title>Facebook’s Clubhouse competitor is coming this summer</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook’s Live Audio Rooms will compete with Clubhouse | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N2mXAw"&gt;Facebook is going all in on audio. The company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/"&gt;announced multiple products&lt;/a&gt; on Monday that emphasize voice content over text, images, or video. The products will be released over the next few months and, in some cases, will start with a limited set of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esGGS8"&gt;Most notably, Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;indeed launching&lt;/a&gt; a competitor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms"&gt;the buzzy social audio app Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; with a feature called Live Audio Rooms, which will be available this summer. It’ll first roll out to groups and public figures as a test, but it will eventually make its way to Messenger, too, so people can hang out with friends. Users will be able to record their conversations and distribute them, and eventually, people can charge for access to these rooms through either a subscription or...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Xbox update speeds up downloads by suspending games</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F1j2yS"&gt;Microsoft is rolling out a new Xbox April dashboard update today that will improve the way games are downloaded. A new feature will now let Xbox owners suspend games to speed up download speeds. Currently, Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S systems throttle game updates and new game downloads if another game is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2bpXS"&gt;This new suspend option can be coupled with Quick Resume on the Xbox Series X / S to quickly pause a game, download game updates, or download a new game altogether and then resume the suspended game later. It’s a much cleaner option than having to manually quit a game or app to ensure download speeds aren’t getting throttled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new suspend option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p id="Z4MP2Q"&gt;Alongside this new dashboard option, Microsoft is finally...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony admits it made ‘wrong decision’ and will keep PS3, Vita stores open</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2y8tri"&gt;Sony has announced that it’ll be keeping its PS3 and PlayStation Vita digital storefront open “for the foreseeable future.” The PSP’s store will still be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356791/sony-playstation-store-close-ps3-vita-psp-game-downloads"&gt;shut down on July 2nd, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, as originally planned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar3s3A"&gt;“Upon further reflection, however, it’s clear that we made the wrong decision here. So today I’m happy to say that we will be keeping the PlayStation Store operational for PS3 and PS Vita devices. PSP commerce functionality will retire on July 2, 2021 as planned,” Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/19/playstation-store-on-ps3-and-ps-vita-will-continue-operations/"&gt;announced in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OPYwtS"&gt;It’s been a long time since we’ve heard about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18536028/apex-legends-iphone-android-mobile-ea-respawn"&gt;the mobile version of &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ll be seeing more of it very soon: EA announced that a regional beta for the game will kick off later this month. Initially, the publisher says the game will only be available to “a few thousand players in India and the Philippines,” but the plan is to roll it out to more countries over the course of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5scQ7X"&gt;The company also provided some of the first details of the game. Most importantly, it won’t be a port of &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, but instead a new version built for smartphones. “&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends Mobile&lt;/em&gt; is specially designed for touchscreens, with streamlined controls, and thoughtful optimizations that result in the most advanced battle royale combat...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVjvfb"&gt;Fitbit has announced its new Luxe fitness tracker that looks like a more fashion-focused take on the Inspire 2. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387591/fitbit-luxe-fitness-tracker-photo-leak-news"&gt;leaked last week&lt;/a&gt;, but Fitbit is making it official with the news that the Luxe is available for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/vergeFitbit'sLuxeFashion04192021/https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/trackers/luxe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder starting today&lt;/a&gt;, April 19th, for $149.95.

    <title>Toyota finally gets off its ass and announces a real electric vehicle strategy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0N7qsD"&gt;Toyota, an early pioneer in electrification that has since fallen far behind its competitors, finally announced an electric vehicle strategy that will result in 15 new battery-electric vehicles released by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcbWev"&gt;The company, which helped pave the way for companies like Tesla and others by proving that vehicles with alternative powertrains could be immensely popular, also unveiled a new concept EV at the Shanghai Motor show called the BZ4X. The electric SUV concept will serve as a starting point for other models with the BZ (which stands for “Beyond Zero”) branding in the future. Toyota did not reveal any details or specifications for the BZ4X, but it did say the vehicle would be released in China and Japan later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RASDOu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota said...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Union says Amazon threatened layoffs in formal objection to election results</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EPkFFp"&gt;The Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (RWDSU) has filed a formal objection to the results of a union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, alleging the e-commerce company threatened to lay off workers. The employees voted against unionizing in an April 9th vote, but the RWDSU is arguing that the results should be set aside because Amazon “created an atmosphere of confusion, coercion and/or fear of reprisals and thus interfered with the employees’ freedom of choice,” the union said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGzL0t"&gt;“Amazon has left no stone unturned in its efforts to gaslight its own employees,” RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement Monday. “We won’t let Amazon’s lies, deception and illegal activities go...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Faraday Future was investigated by the Department of Labor in 2020</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFONuk"&gt;Faraday Future was investigated by the Department of Labor in 2020, though the electric vehicle startup says the matter was “resolved,” according to a previously unreported passage in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805521/000121390021020004/fs42021_propertysolutions.htm"&gt;a recent regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emRwYP"&gt;The startup didn’t say what the investigation was about or how much it paid to resolve the legal matter. Faraday Future’s former chief lawyer has &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.793916/gov.uscourts.cacd.793916.1.0.pdf"&gt;claimed in a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; that the company was previously inspected by the Department of Homeland Security’s United States Citizenship and Immigration Services division in 2018, though the startup denied this in court filings. A spokesperson for Faraday Future declined to comment on the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRRJAk"&gt;The regulatory filing, known as the S-4 “registration statement,” was published as part...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ulNwuE"&gt;Apple will allow Parler to return to its App Store, according to a letter first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/19/tech/apple-parler-app-store/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN &lt;/em&gt;on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Ken Buck (R-CO), Apple said “Parler has proposed updates to its app and the app’s content moderation practices” that would bring the app into compliance with the App Store’s rules. Now, Parler is allowed to return once it reintroduces the app to the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="59NFOy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On March 31, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SenMikeLee&lt;/a&gt; and I sent a letter demanding answers about why Apple removed Parler from the App Store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Today, we received a response: Parler will be reinstated on the App Store. Huge win for free speech. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FQBDSSSFGk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FQBDSSSFGk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Congressman Ken Buck (@RepKenBuck) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1384159186209054721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
