    <title>Cameo Calls let you have a video meet-and-greet with a celebrity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZGeWMvt0iCCTsAo5YfSeuktqHIM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69869706/Screen_Shot_2021_09_16_at_3.29.19_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KHqHUp"&gt;Cameo is adding a new live calls feature into its app. Cameo is perhaps most well-known for letting you pay for pre-recorded video messages from celebrities, but the new feature, &lt;a href="https://cameoblog.medium.com/bringing-fans-and-talent-closer-together-with-cameo-calls-fb52f4a40dbc"&gt;called Cameo Calls&lt;/a&gt;, will let you have short video conversations that are designed to be like meet-and-greets. (The app even sets up a photo op at the end of the call.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsPBof"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://imp.i309903.net/c/482924/828354/11642?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cameo.com%2Fcameo-calls&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cameo Calls page&lt;/a&gt; has a full list of whose available for conversations and how much it costs for a certain amount of their time. Cameo says that calls can last up to 15 minutes and that the average price for a call is $31. When I looked, I saw that most people offer two or three minutes per call, and prices ranged dramatically. (The highest fee I saw was $225 for a 10-minute call with Vanessa...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Streaming service Locast permanently barred from operation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Locast NYC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EY6Vnag3A9LI9aIlEVsRTPKPu2g=/0x21:1231x842/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69869433/Locast_nyc.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kJHN8A"&gt;Things looked bad for Locast before, and they just got even worse. A judge this week permanently prohibited streamer Locast from continuing operations of its business, a decision that follows a yearslong legal standoff between major broadcasters and the scrappy streaming provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vh8TZC"&gt;A permanent injunction order signed by Judge Louis L. Stanton this week stated that Locast founder David Goodfriend and his nonprofit Sports Fans Coalition NY, which operates the Locast service, “are permanently restrained and enjoined from operating” the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236704/locast-review-streaming-free-local-programming-tv"&gt;free TV streaming service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7k0Ki"&gt;The injunction follows a series of rapid-succession developments that have led to Locast’s apparent demise, after the big four broadcasters suing the company — ABC, CBS, Fox, and...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>The bitter lawsuit hanging over the Apple Watch’s new swipe keyboard</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, Apple really did type “copy” into its own keyboard during the event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  		 &lt;p&gt;Apple allegedly offered to buy his app; instead, it’s being Sherlocked&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hundreds of T-Mobile stores will be able to fix phones soon</title>

The company says technicians will provide same-day fixes using manufacturer-approved parts to customers who subscribe to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fdevices%2Fphone-protection-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22677969%2Ft-mobile-retail-store-repair-protection-program-increased-claims" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its Protection&amp;lt;360&amp;gt; service&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes device replacement in case of loss or theft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPKppu"&gt;T-Mobile is also improving that device protection plan by letting customers make five claims in a 12-month period, up from the previous limit of three. The claims are handled by Assurant and come with a deductible based on what kind of phone you have and what kind of claim you’re making. Still, it’s likely to be cheaper than buying five new phones if you wind up having &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/s-1WxfsJzPM?t=33"&gt;an 18-karat run of bad luck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZuvseH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Assurant...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Home Assistant Amber is a ready-to-use smart home platform</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Home Assistant Amber is a smart home hub for the free, open source home automation platform.&lt;/em&gt; | Nabu Casa&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6c8cH8"&gt;Home Assistant, the powerful-yet-prickly smart home automation platform, is finally moving toward the mainstream. Nabu Casa, the company behind the free, open-source software, has launched Home Assistant Amber, its first ready-to-use hub that can run Home Assistant software out of the box. Unlike with prior methods of using Home Assistant, there’s minimal programming required and no need to build your own computer when you have the Amber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIW32k"&gt;Debuting on the creators’ crowdfunding platform &lt;a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/nabu-casa/home-assistant-amber"&gt;Crowd Supply&lt;/a&gt; this week, the $149 box is designed for both beginners and experienced HA fans. Shipping is targeted for June 2022, provided the $140,000 funding goal is met (it’s about a third of the way there as of publish).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Helen Mirren finds a side door into Harry Potter with a new game show</title>

  &lt;p id="Hm8PV0"&gt;Dame Helen Mirren is a wizard, reader. Or a witch. Or maybe a concerned Muggle? The details don’t really matter; either way, the Oscar award-winning actress is hosting a new &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; quiz show later this year to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the film series. &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Hogwarts Tournament of Houses &lt;/em&gt;will be simultaneously broadcast on Cartoon Network and TBS, with plans to eventually stream on HBO Max as well, &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/helen-mirren-host-harry-potter-hogwarts-tournament-houses"&gt;WarnerMedia announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ue3WeO"&gt;The four-part special “will unveil Wizarding World fans willing to put their &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; knowledge to the test for the ultimate honor to be named House Cup champion,” according to WarnerMedia. Mirren will shepherd the latest expansion of the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; franchise and lend “some British...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenSea’s product chief is out after insider NFT flipping accusations</title>

  &lt;p id="k5idZc"&gt;OpenSea head of product Nate Chastain, who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676075/opensea-insider-information-nft-trading-nate-chastain"&gt;recently accused of&lt;/a&gt; a form of NFT insider trading, appears to no longer be working for the company. His Twitter bio now includes the phrase “Past: @opensea.” OpenSea has not publicly named the employee involved in the incident, but CEO Devin Finzer says the NFT trading platform asked for and received their resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gv6eC"&gt;Yesterday, Finzer &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/employee-information-use-at-opensea/"&gt;put up a blog post&lt;/a&gt; saying an employee used knowledge gained from working at the company to purchase NFTs that were about to be posted to the popular trading site’s homepage (and would thus likely go up in value). While an investigation is apparently still ongoing, OpenSea does say that it’s implemented clearer rules to prevent employees from doing this kind...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s latest FCC filing reveals a mysterious new controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo Switch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/repAeI8bJJic4tXsu7stEfEgoCc=/100x0:4300x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69868086/NintendoSwitch_hardware_Joy-Con_02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FbrH6n"&gt;Nintendo may have a new wireless controller in the works based on &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/BKEHAC043"&gt;this FCC listing the company filed Thursday&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-files-fcc-listing-for-new-mystery-controller/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Vooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new device has received the model number HAC-043, which, if it matters, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/13/20803344/nintendo-switch-snes-controller-fcc-listing"&gt;is one model number higher&lt;/a&gt; than Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/16/20869382/nintendo-wireless-snes-controller-for-switch-now-available-on-sale"&gt;wireless SNES controller from 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzasG9"&gt;Nintendo submitted a 180-day request for confidentiality to the FCC on July 26th that hides more revealing details of the device, like photos and actual schematics. But there are still a few details to share. The device is wireless and uses Bluetooth, and it appears to draw more power at 3.5mW than &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/BKEHAC015"&gt;the Joy-Con’s 2.7mW&lt;/a&gt;. FCC label placement, which can sometimes reveal a bit more of how a device actually looks, also suggests whatever it is would be a departure from...&lt;/p&gt;
