    <title>Google gives Chrome users an easier way to sync info across devices</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nuWXnB"&gt;Google is making it easier for Chrome users to sync their passwords and payment information across devices, the company has announced &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/12/seamless-payments-and-password.html"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The new features will roll out “over the coming weeks and months,” Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FluKRU"&gt;Chrome on Android will be able to access saved payment information after you log into the browser with a Google Account. Payments can be confirmed by entering a card’s CVC or via biometric security. Logging into a Google Account in the first place on an Android device will also be simplified. If you’re already logged into a Google service like Gmail, the option will be given to sign into the browser with a Google Account on the device “with a single tap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQuWBh"&gt;Chrome’s desktop version is also being updated to give...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FireEye cybersecurity tools compromised in state-sponsored attack</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ltEORH"&gt;One of the US’s leading cybersecurity firms, FireEye, &lt;a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/fireeye-shares-details-of-recent-cyber-attack-actions-to-protect-community.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it’s been hacked by a state-sponsored attacker. Hackers targeted and accessed the firm’s so-called Red Team tools, which it uses to test customer security and find vulnerabilities. Now there’s concern that the hackers could release these tools publicly or use them to attack others, though there is no evidence that this has happened yet. FireEye says that it does not believe any customer information was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uD8hu9"&gt;Although the blog post, authored by FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia, does not say who is responsible, it says that the attacking nation has “top-tier offensive capabilities.” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-cyber-firm-fireeye-says-it-was-breached-by-nation-state-hackers-11607461408?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Russia is a suspect, specifically its foreign-intelligence service...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom, murder hornets, Among Us, and Joe Biden topped Google trending searches in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A2GXCpsrz5xhz8e7tIsVacUUeI4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483016/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vk7wl0"&gt;Google has released its list of the top trending searches in the US for 2020, and as one might expect, “coronavirus,” “election results,” and “Zoom” led the way. To be clear: these aren’t top searches or most-searched topics. Rather, they’re “searches that had a high spike in traffic over a sustained period in 2020 as compared to 2019,” Google said. As year-in-review content goes, it’s pretty depressing; also among the top trending searches were Kobe Bryant, Naya Rivera, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406395/chadwick-boseman-death-cancer-black-panther-marvel-jackie-robinson"&gt;Chadwick Boseman&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom died in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qmrb04"&gt;Google’s top trending searches in news included “stimulus checks,” as the government’s distribution of $1,200 payments &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222749/irs-coronavirus-get-my-payment-portal-payment-status-not-available-stimulus-explanation"&gt;didn’t exactly go smoothly&lt;/a&gt;; “unemployment,” as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html"&gt;millions lost their jobs &lt;/a&gt;due to pandemic lockdowns;...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The hard-to-find PS5 and RTX 3090 have each inspired daring heists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9FQxIVIRj8bFzMNFLuE_xBidDuk=/85x0:988x602/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68482621/kNmhDjg.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dASHp9"&gt;The 2020 holiday shopping season has been defined by how difficult it is to purchase consoles like the PS5 and GPUs like the GeForce RTX 3090, prompting some people to use other, less legal methods to get both products. Bots account for some of the consoles up for resale, but theft is apparently another source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HJj54"&gt;Around $340,000 worth of GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs were stolen from MSI, &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/MSI-nvidia-rtx-3090-stolen-china?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That amounts to 40 containers of the popular cards, based off the translation of an internal document from MSI embedded in the tweet below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QsIP10"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;MSI Chinese mainland factory was stolen, stolen 40 boxes RTX3090, the total value of 2200000RMB ...... &lt;br&gt;MSI has been officially announced and informed to the police ,Reward of 100000 RMB for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cloudflare and Apple made a new DNS protocol to protect your data from ISPs  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3R8UblsExmBhYnwJyU0EgrTYV5s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68481969/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0kug0"&gt;Cloudflare is &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/oblivious-dns/"&gt;proposing a new DNS standard&lt;/a&gt; it developed with Apple that’s designed to help close a blindspot in my (and I’m sure many others’) internet privacy measures (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cloudflare-and-apple-design-a-new-privacy-friendly-internet-protocol/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The protocol is called Oblivious DNS over HTTPS (ODoH), and it’s meant to help anonymize the information that’s sent before you even make it onto a website. Whether that will help you with your overall net privacy is something we’ll tackle in a second, but first, we need to understand how regular DNS works, and what Cloudflare has added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrIyJY"&gt;Basically, DNS lets us use the web without having to remember the IP address of every site we want to visit. While we humans can easily understand names like “theverge.com”, or “archive.org,” computers use IP addresses...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite is officially launching fall 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qozT4rXW7wG-D93n3QbIy8sKGwI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68481593/hi_multiplayer_map_2_1920x1080_4b85484a2b294c07951bec8b636d2270.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: 343 Industries&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hwDPxX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, the next game in Microsoft’s iconic franchise, will officially launch in fall 2021, developer 343 Industries announced in a blog post &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-december-2020"&gt;on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgIZfY"&gt;The game was originally supposed to launch alongside the Xbox Series X / S in November, but it was delayed to 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; due in part to challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since Microsoft hasn’t specified a month or day, this fall 2021 window could effectively mean that the game gets delayed as much as an entire year from its original release date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j1X3Vt"&gt;Microsoft did demo &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; during its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"&gt;July Xbox Series X games showcase&lt;/a&gt;, but received some criticism for the graphics and visuals shown during the demo (a dead-eyed enemy shown then even spawned the now-infamous &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/craig-from-halo-infinite-is-the-new-xbox-mascot-jokes-xbox-chief"&gt;C...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>American Airlines offers at-home COVID tests for US travel</title>

  &lt;p id="M3FLzl"&gt;American Airlines is &lt;a href="http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/American-Airlines-Offers-Preflight-COVID-19-Testing-For-All-US-Destinations-with-Travel-Requirements-OPS-DIS-12/default.aspx"&gt;about to start offering at-home COVID-19 tests&lt;/a&gt; to domestic fliers in order to help them meet various state travel restriction requirements, the company announced Tuesday. The airline is partnering with direct-to-consumer home testing company LetsGetChecked, which will sell the tests for $129 on top of the cost of travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkZ6a8"&gt;The at-home tests help travelers check off one of the most common travel restrictions that states have implemented, which is a negative test result either before departure or upon arrival. It will also help customers get reliable access to testing, which is still hit-or-miss in many parts of the United States. But there are still holes in the process; it is still possible to get infected on the way...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pixel 2 has gotten its last update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Pixel 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_3Bbm49tan4sB3mVTYElmT9rD98=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68481108/jbareham_171013_2050_0159.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL were flawed-yet-likable devices with a camera that stood out from the competition | Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wimsdZ"&gt;After three years of support, the Pixel 2 has received its last update from Google: a delayed November security patch going out to the devices this month, as &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/rip-pixel-2-google-rolls-out-its-final-update-phone"&gt;noted by &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&amp;amp;nexus_devices"&gt;device support schedule&lt;/a&gt; indicates that the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL aren’t guaranteed security updates after October 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXne4T"&gt;Google announced the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL in October 2017. The two devices were identical in every way except size, and they earned plenty of praise for their somewhat groundbreaking camera. Google was early to really lean into camera software and computational photography, and the results showed in the Pixel 2 — its single rear-facing camera was in many ways ahead of the multi-camera-toting competition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix wants to help parents connect with their kids by explaining what they’re watching</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="otJejR"&gt;Netflix is rolling out a new tool for parents to better understand and monitor what their kids are watching. Called the Kids Activity Report, as seen in the image above, the new breakdown includes data on what type of programming kids are spending the most time watching, who their favorite character is, and recommendations for new shows based on their interests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utHhQY"&gt;Emails sent out to customers who have kids accounts enabled started going out this weekend, letting parents know they could opt into the report. The report also comes with a “joke of the day,” coloring pages (based on Netflix characters and shows) to print out for kids stuck at home, and prepared questions to ask their kids based on their favorite show or character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzcrCT"&gt;Parents...&lt;/p&gt;
