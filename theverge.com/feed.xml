    <title>The best Cyber Monday deals happening now</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uocVGt"&gt;Black Friday is technically over, but many of the same deals have carried over into Cyber Monday — plus a few new ones, of course. We’ve adapted our coverage to make sure that you’re only seeing the latest and best deals on tech that you want, and that we recommend, on wireless earbuds, TVs, games, phones, and more. The occasional Nerf blaster might find its way in here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGdVSU"&gt;If you’re hoping to get the majority of your holiday shopping done ahead of mid-December, now is a good time to do that. Though, don’t despair if something you’re looking for either isn’t available, or isn’t as cheap as you were hoping. December always brings more deals, and we’ll do our best to give you every opportunity to score on tech deals before the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Cyber Monday streaming deals for Hulu, YouTube TV, and more</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many can enjoy one year of Hulu’s ad-supported streaming service for just $1 per month.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCw3hh"&gt;Black Friday was longer than usual this year, with deals beginning weeks in advance, though Cyber Monday is the perfect end-cap to it. Several popular streaming services are offering a number of discounts for Cyber Monday. New and even some previous subscribers can, for example, enjoy a year of Hulu for just $0.99 a month. While that’s probably one of the best deals out there this year, other services are also great limited-time offers for new, past, and even existing subscribers alike. Below, we’ve curated some of the best we’ve seen this year to help you get the best bang for your buck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEXWCE"&gt;Also, if you’re looking for deals outside of streaming, be sure to also check out our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796651/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"&gt;best Cyber Monday deals happening now&lt;/a&gt;, where...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The British Fashion Council launches new award category for Roblox designs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UylzrGYk8shqlVaDdd0f6cHPqKU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70203753/Alessandro_Michele__Gucci__and_Roblox_creators_nominated_for_the_award.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8QBIM8"&gt;As part of its annual fashion awards, the British Fashion Council is adding a new category for 2021: an award for “metaverse design.” As broad as that might sound, the award was actually created in partnership with Roblox, and as such, the shortlist is limited to five Roblox creators. The winner, cSapphire, operates an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F62008951%2FcSapphire-Clothing-Store&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F29%2F22800523%2Fbritish-fashion-council-awards-roblox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in-app &lt;/a&gt;clothing boutique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kp7tiL"&gt;In keeping with the virtual nature of 2021, the award will be presented by an avatar of Gucci’s creative director Alessandro Michele (pictured above) inside a Roblox experience. Players will also be able to explore a virtual recreation of Royal Albert Hall to watch the awards. “This unique metaverse space BFC has created in collaboration with Roblox represents the future of fashion, and it’s been...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk tells Tesla employees to stop rushing to increase quarterly deliveries</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wHcYoY"&gt;In a recent memo, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has told the company’s employees to not sprint to make deliveries by the end of this quarter, and to instead focus on minimizing costs, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/27/read-the-e-mail-elon-musk-sent-tesla-workers-on-cutting-delivery-costs.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. In the November 26th memo, Musk wrote that he doesn’t want the company “spending heavily on expedite fees, overtime and temporary contractors just so that cars arrive in Q4.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CrVJO"&gt;“What has happened historically is that we sprint like crazy at end of quarter to maximize deliveries, but then deliveries drop massively in the first few weeks of the next quarter,” said Musk. “In effect, looked at over a six month period, we won’t have delivered any extra cars but we will have spent a lot of money and burned ourselves out to accelerate deliveries in the last two...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmhxDE"&gt;4K TVs of all sizes and specs see price cuts several times throughout the year, but the time when we usually see the highest concentration of stellar deals is right now, as Cyber Monday is just around the bend. You’ve ended up in the right place if you’re looking for a TV deal, and yes, that includes people interested in a TV that has every bell or whistle, with the highest contrast ratio and the right features to eke all of the visual splendor from PCs and the latest gaming consoles or something that’s quite the opposite. We’ll be highlighting affordable TVs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGhjh8"&gt;Our team at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is hard at work on compiling the best Cyber Monday deals, running the gamut of retailers participating, as well as breaking it down on a category level....&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="uNHMij"&gt;There is never a better time to dive into the smart home than Black Friday and its close cousin Cyber Monday. Traditionally, tech deals on home gadgets are huge this time of year, plus, it’s the only time you’ll find real bargains on gear from some of the smaller companies, such as Eve, Level, and Nanoleaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjy6kh"&gt;Whether you’re thinking about dipping a toe into this home automation shindig with a smart speaker or maybe a connected door lock, or want to bolster an already impressive smart home setup, it’s worth investing some cash this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRU2qz"&gt;Also, if you just want to upgrade your home cleaning routine or have a way to check in on Fido now that you’re back at work (the separation anxiety is real), this is a good time to get a great...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Australian PM proposes defamation laws that force social platforms to unmask trolls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hacker (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z-KbuyXdvhvQlETFQgrDFn5FQNY=/3x0:1097x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70202023/hacker-stock1_2040.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ecpXBL"&gt;Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is introducing new defamation laws that would force online platforms to reveal the identities of trolls, or else pay the price of defamation. As &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-28/social-media-laws-online-trolls/100657004"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC News Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; explains, the laws would hold social platforms, like Facebook or Twitter, accountable for defamatory comments made against users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TchGdE"&gt;Platforms will also have to create a complaint system that people can use if they feel that they’re a victim of defamation. As a part of this process, the person who posted the potentially defamatory content will be asked to take it down. But if they refuse, or if the victim is interested in pursuing legal action, the platform can then legally ask the poster for permission to reveal their contact information.&lt;/p&gt;
...

  &lt;p id="JpMOg6"&gt;Welcome to the in-between of deals. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; has come and gone. There were tons of great discounts, many of which even began well before the day after Thanksgiving, and our &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals &lt;/em&gt;team worked to cover as many of them as possible. We even did a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22798952/amazon-lightning-deals-black-friday-2021-tech-gadgets-live"&gt;liveblog&lt;/a&gt; to bring you the latest up-to-the-minute updates. There have been deals on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22792011/black-friday-wireless-earbuds-deals-2021-cyber-monday"&gt;wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796131/black-friday-headphones-2021-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;headphones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22792017/black-friday-2021-best-game-gaming-console-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;video games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"&gt;4K TVs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/26/22803778/black-friday-gaming-pc-prebuilt-sales-deals-rtx-3080-3070-3060"&gt;pre-built PCs&lt;/a&gt;, and even the occasional Nerf blaster. With so many savings already happening across the world of tech, it’s hard to believe Cyber Monday is still approaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92BK11"&gt;That brings us to today, where we find ourselves between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Plenty of deals are continuing on, and fresh ones have cropped up to join the fray. If you...&lt;/p&gt;
