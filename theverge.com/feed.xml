    <title>Sony announces the Xperia 1 III and Xperia 5 III with variable telephoto lenses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III (left) and Xperia 5 III (right) | Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z6gPE7"&gt;Sony is announcing two new phones today, the Xperia 1 III and the Xperia 5 III. Both are the latest in Sony’s campaign to redefine the Xperia brand as a kind of sibling to its well-regarded Alpha digital cameras. As such, the camera system is once again the main focus, and Sony specifically is touting the “world’s first smartphone with a variable telephoto lens paired with a Dual PD sensor” and improvements to its already fast and accurate autofocus system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmODbj"&gt;Pricing was not announced, but they should both be available in the US “this summer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ss7nWW"&gt;Each phone has the basic specs you’d expect on a top-flight Android phone: three cameras on the rear, a Snapdragon 888 processor, and support for 5G. Actually, the 5G support is worth noting...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon announces EOS R3 pro mirrorless camera in development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_5I8F-4sqPa9LkxkctrTQ1TnODM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123207/eosr3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLALPV"&gt;Last month Nikon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322684/nikon-z9-flagship-mirrorless-camera-development-announced-2021"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the development of its highest-end mirrorless camera to date, and now Canon has responded with the &lt;a href="https://global.canon/en/news/2021/20210414.html"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of the EOS R3, which ought to fit in a similar bracket. The R3 is still in development and details are thin, but it’s clear that it’ll be positioned above the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318398/canon-eos-r5-announced-8k-price-specs-release-date"&gt;EOS R5&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently Canon’s flagship mirrorless camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1PkjC"&gt;Like Nikon’s upcoming Z9, the EOS R3 looks to be a hefty camera with a built-in vertical grip for shooting in portrait and landscape orientations. The body design and control layout is broadly similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054254/canon-eos-1d-x-mark-iii-professional-dslr-announcement-news-price-specs-ces-2020"&gt;EOS-1D X Mark III&lt;/a&gt;, Canon’s highest-end pro DSLR, and the body features dust and water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1YASK"&gt;Canon says the EOS R3 will be the first camera to use a new 35mm full-frame...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ludwig ends his 31-day stream by breaking Ninja’s all-time sub record</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_hJP-4_bvzHZvKLCvV5DI0UgZI=/229x0:2640x1607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123034/Screen_Shot_2021_04_13_at_9.04.34_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g6Hjph"&gt;Near the end, Ludwig Ahgren slept a lot. Nestled in his race car bed with a blanket over his face and something new playing in the bottom corner of his screen, Ahgren exuded exhaustion. It was after all another day in the streamer’s Twitch subathon; he’d been live &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352226/ludwig-subathon-twitch-live-two-weeks-straight"&gt;since March 14th&lt;/a&gt;, and now there was less than an hour left on the clock. Though as he knew, this had happened before. A number close to zero was no guarantee that the stream would end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sp1vah"&gt;Except this time was different, because he’d finally reached the limit he’d set for himself — 31 straight days of streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwBsrt"&gt;Since he started his subathon, Ahgren had become the most subscribed to streamer on Twitch. On the 13th, the day before he took his subathon live, he’d amassed 1,730 subs,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Overwatch League is bringing back some live matches with a trio of events in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qY6-nlNd9QU77-tTPmHtkOlNkAc=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123020/NYXL_Fan_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A 2020 &lt;/em&gt;Overwatch&lt;em&gt; League match at the Hammerstein&amp;nbsp;Ballroom in New York.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: steadyprime&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;NYXL.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ao1T5G"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League kicks off its fourth season this week, and while the majority of matches will be played remotely, today the league announced plans to hold multiple live events in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Or9Cj6"&gt;There will be three events spread across three cities — Hangzhou in June, Shanghai in July, and Guangzhou in August — and the league says they will take place in venues with reduced capacity “in order to comply with local safety requirements.” The events will be something of a hybrid between online and in-person competition. Here’s how OWL describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MVt7Ip"&gt;The five China-based teams — Hunters, Charge, Spark, Valiant, and Dragons — plan to travel to each of the events to compete onstage, while the three Korea-based teams — NYXL, Fusion, and Dynasty — are...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="xYFi3f"&gt;Infinite Office is a feature that Oculus includes as part of Oculus Home, which lets users work in a virtual environment. With the v28 update, Infinite Office will have an experimental feature that allows users to add a virtual desk where their real-life desk is, letting users know where they can sit and put real-life physical objects down without having to leave VR. The Quest 2 will also be able to show a virtual representation of the Logitech K830 keyboard, though Facebook says that support for visualizing more...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FBI is remotely hacking hundreds of computers to protect them from Hafnium </title>

  &lt;p id="GW6zzM"&gt;In what’s believed to be an unprecedented move, the FBI is trying to protect hundreds of computers infected by the Hafnium hack &lt;em&gt;by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-effort-disrupt-exploitation-microsoft"&gt;&lt;em&gt;hacking them itself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, using the original hackers’ own tools (via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/fbi-launches-operation-to-remotely-remove-microsoft-exchange-server-backdoors/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Now, the FBI has taken advantage of this by using those same web shells / backdoors to remotely delete themselves, an operation that the agency is calling a success.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US carriers have thankfully abandoned at least one bad plan for RCS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qR0YepDCoxN1VkapUXCRiSdAW6o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69122020/VRG_ILLO_2411_Google_Messaging_3.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span data-author="-1"&gt;GIF by Garret Beard and William Joel / The Verge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ppkPbJ"&gt;According to the telecom industry news site &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ossbsscx/verizon-atandt-t-mobile-blow-rcs-launch/d/d-id/768729"&gt;Light Reading, the big three US carriers are walking away from&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;Cross Carrier Messaging Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. The CCMI was meant to be a joint effort to promote RCS, the next-generation messaging standard designed to replace SMS. But while that might seem like bad news on the face of it, what it actually means is that carriers have given up on a bad plan that would have been bad for consumers. Whether or not they will replace it with a &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;plan remains, as ever with RCS, to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUOqAt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;CCMI was launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and by all indications was a joint effort that was spearheaded by Sprint. It initially seemed like a mixed bag of news. At the time, any effort by carriers to support proper...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung teases ‘the most powerful’ Galaxy device is coming at its April 28th Unpacked event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/swvJsSQ2sPat_1xDSNzq9dIQmyA=/0x32:3582x2420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69121986/most_powerful_galaxy_tease.15.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MPRK9S"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vXN2MOi0s"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new Galaxy Unpacked event set for April 28th at 10AM ET, teasing the announcement of “the most powerful Galaxy” device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWnPZr"&gt;The teaser, as is typical for these invitations, isn’t too forthcoming. But given the nature of the announcement and Samsung’s usual release cycle, there are a few hints we can suss out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbGnAT"&gt;First, the description of whatever Samsung is announcing as “the most powerful Galaxy” would seem to rule out a phone, like the rumored Galaxy Z Fold 3. The most generous depiction of a mobile processor — even one as powerful as Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 888 — still isn’t in the same ballpark as a true laptop processor. And despite recent headlines, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-launch-date-1216922/"&gt;Samsung is still rumored&lt;/a&gt; to reveal the Z Fold 3 at a July...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Detroit man sues police for wrongfully arresting him based on facial recognition</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lO3tqz"&gt;A man who was falsely accused of shoplifting has &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/michigan-father-sues-detroit-police-department-wrongful-arrest-based-faulty-facial"&gt;sued the Detroit Police Department&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html"&gt;arresting him&lt;/a&gt; based on an incorrect facial recognition match. The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit on behalf of Robert Williams, whom it calls the first US person wrongfully arrested based on facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMBe1c"&gt;The Detroit Police Department arrested Williams in 2019 after examining security footage from a shoplifting incident. A detective used facial recognition technology on a grainy image from the video, and the system flagged Williams as a potential match based on a driver’s license photo. But as &lt;a href="https://www.aclumich.org/en/press-releases/farmington-hills-father-sues-detroit-police-department-wrongful-arrest-based-faulty"&gt;the lawsuit notes&lt;/a&gt;, facial recognition is frequently inaccurate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21031255/facial-recognition-algorithm-bias-gender-race-age-federal-nest-investigation-analysis-amazon"&gt;particularly with Black subjects&lt;/a&gt; and a low-quality picture.
