    <title>Microsoft is supporting AMD’s answer to DLSS on Xbox consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fpJH50"&gt;Microsoft is enabling Xbox developers to utilize AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s DLSS on console games. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) appeared recently&lt;/a&gt; on Windows PCs with the aim of boosting frame rates and maintaining image quality. It’s AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and early tests have shown it’s a promising technology that will work across multiple games and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9HLxp"&gt;FSR is now making its way to Xbox games, too. Microsoft has started previewing support for FSR in its Game Development Kit for both Windows and Xbox today. “It’s supported on Windows, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One consoles,” says Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s director of Xbox program management. “FSR was designed to enable developers to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit is experiencing a major outage</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit’s error page.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y7awr5"&gt;Reddit appears to be down for many right now. The site will regularly take a while to try to load a page before showing an error screen with error code 503. Pages are loading more frequently than when I first published this story, but I see the error page often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdnCJw"&gt;Downdetector showed &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/reddit/"&gt;more than 40,000 user reports of issues&lt;/a&gt; at their peak. Reports look to be dipping just slightly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="4sB41Q"&gt;Reddit acknowledges there is an issue &lt;a href="https://www.redditstatus.com/"&gt;on its status page&lt;/a&gt;, though the first message on the page is somewhat vague and suggests that there have been problems with the site for more than an hour. “We’re experiencing an elevated level of API errors and are currently looking into the issue,” Reddit...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Thermapen One promises to make the best meat thermometer even better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NBID9YftBCio6HIqabguTCZFVOY=/208x0:2197x1326/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501379/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_5.19.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZdZfdl"&gt;The ThermoWorks Thermapen is legendary among chefs as the gold standard in kitchen thermometers, affording the fastest and most reliable temperature readings around. And today, the company has revealed its latest model: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2Fthermapen-one%3Fquantity%3D1%26color%3D16&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F24%2F22548839%2Fthermoworks-one-meat-thermometer-faster-grilling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $105 Thermapen One&lt;/a&gt;, which promises to achieve even faster temperature readings: less than a second (hence the name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTafjq"&gt;ThermoWorks says the new thermometer is the only sub-second instant-read thermometer that can take a “full temperature reading” — technically five full readings in order to reduce uncertainty — without using estimations or predictive algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bd8HEP"&gt;The company says it spent more than five years developing the new thermometer, which features an improved thermocouple system developed in conjunction with...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Baltimore spy plane program was invasion of citizens’ privacy, court rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fN6L0i"&gt;The city of Baltimore’s spy plane program was unconstitutional, violating the Fourth Amendment protection against illegal search, and law enforcement in the city cannot use any of the data it gathered, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680040/fourth_circuit_decision_baltimore_june_24_2021.pdf"&gt;a court ruled Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The Aerial Investigation Research (or AIR) program, which used airplanes and high-resolution cameras to record what was happening in a 32-square-mile part of the city, was &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-plane-canceled-20210203-ha3ixtgiyfg4rpgmfftrsd6uwu-story.html"&gt;canceled by the city &lt;/a&gt;in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKTCqd"&gt;Local Black activist groups, with support from the ACLU, sued to prevent Baltimore law enforcement from using any of the data it had collected in the time the program was up and running. The city tried to argue the case was moot since the program had been canceled. That didn’t sit well with civil liberties...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is acquiring a podcast hosting and monetization platform</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MZAWyd"&gt;Amazon Music is getting more serious about its podcast endeavors. Today, the company &lt;a href="https://podcasters.amazon.com/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s acquiring Art19, a major podcast hosting and monetization platform for an undisclosed sum. This means Amazon will now have a hand in hosting podcasters’ shows as well as selling ads against them because Art19 operates an ad marketplace that targets and inserts ads into programming. We’ve reached out to Amazon Music to learn more about what this acquisition might mean for podcasters who host on the service and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRZYor"&gt;This is a major step for Amazon as it looks to take on a bigger role in the podcasting world. Amazon Music only started offering podcasts in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439531/amazon-music-podcasts-prime-titles"&gt;September last year&lt;/a&gt;, as did Audible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536963/amazon-free-podcast-update-catalog"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Microsoft will let devs keep every penny their Windows app makes — unless it’s a game</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="LFZuGI"&gt;As part of its Windows 11 announcements on Thursday, Microsoft revealed &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/"&gt;a major policy change&lt;/a&gt; to incentivize developers to make apps for the Microsoft Store: starting on July 28th, if a developer uses their own or a third-party payment system in their app, Microsoft will let them keep 100 percent of the revenue. But the deal has one important caveat: it doesn’t apply to games, Microsoft confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Uher5"&gt;That omission further muddies the ongoing debate about the differences between an app and a game and app store policies around each — a distinction that is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;core issues&lt;/a&gt; in the ongoing legal battle between &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-maker Epic Games and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKSjej"&gt;Microsoft is largely on the side of apps and games being different because its...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft didn’t kill Skype, but Windows 11 is shoving it out of sight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GqoI_RRu6Fnfk5qIVQtM0K9RDOQ=/296x0:1916x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500923/Panos_Panay_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VeaCGG"&gt;Today’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546829/microsoft-windows-11-event-live-blog-updates-news"&gt;Windows 11 news&lt;/a&gt; is all about where Microsoft sees computing going over the next few years, but it’s just as much the story of how Skype has flourished and ebbed since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/14/2489611/microsoft-skype-deal-complete"&gt;its $8.5 billion acquisition&lt;/a&gt; a decade ago. Five years ago, Skype was the big name in internet calling and video, and Microsoft made it an “inbox app” for Windows 10 that was included at installation and launched at startup by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftAfzH"&gt;Now, after a pandemic year that has had more people using their PCs for voice and video than ever before, Skype was nowhere to be seen in the Windows 11 presentation or materials. Instead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;Microsoft Teams gets a highlight spot&lt;/a&gt; in the new center-aligned taskbar and deep integration into Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11’s Intel-powered Android apps will run on AMD and Arm processors, too</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mbafi7"&gt;One of the biggest announcements at today’s Windows 11 reveal was that Microsoft would offer the option to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;run Android apps on its new operating system&lt;/a&gt;, powered by a new “Intel Bridge” compiler that helps those apps run on x86 systems. But despite being an Intel-developed system, Android apps on Windows 11 won’t just be limited to computers with Intel CPUs. AMD and Arm-based processors will also support Android apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyt4a3"&gt;“Intel believes it is important to provide this capability across all x86 platforms and has designed Intel Bridge technology to support all x86 platforms (including AMD platforms),” Intel confirmed in a statement to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Microsoft further corroborated that Android applications will be available for all silicon...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ViacomCBS again restructures its leadership in its bid to win the streaming wars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ypISp02O941Mtaa7SwStQ3XMx-U=/88x0:1033x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500899/Paramount_Plus.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ViacomCBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g0tSRB"&gt;ViacomCBS is once again changing up leadership to emphasize its focus on streaming and ensure the success of its streaming services, particularly its late-to-the-party content giant Paramount Plus. The announcement comes just a day after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcasts-ceo-built-a-cable-giant-can-he-build-a-streaming-giant-11624473722"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; NBCUniversal had approached ViacomCBS about joining streaming forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCk3aJ"&gt;ViacomCBS &lt;a href="https://ir.viacomcbs.com/news-releases/news-release-details/viacomcbs-announces-enhanced-streaming-content-leadership"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; title changes and additional oversight for several of its executives currently overseeing various ViacomCBS content properties, particularly for its recently launched Paramount Plus streaming service. Leadership reorganizations focused on streaming have become standard for major parent companies of recently launched services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514728/disney-streaming-reorganization-plus-espn-hulu-studios-movies-network-tv-shows-pandemic"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21359128/warnermedia-reorg-bob-greenblatt-kevin-reilly-hbo-max-jason-kilar-streaming"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; — and ViacomCBS has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21524771/viacomcbs-all-access-paramount-plus-reorganization-disney-netflix"&gt;p...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
