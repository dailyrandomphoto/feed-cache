    <title>Nintendo refuses to say if the OLED Switch fixes Joy-Con drift</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G3liC21A-IICAhdzTX58pD5d4PI=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69564804/joy_con_02.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vTJVOB"&gt;Nintendo revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;a new model of the Switch this week&lt;/a&gt; that adds an OLED screen, enhanced speakers, and a much-improved kickstand. One thing it seems the OLED Switch won’t bring, however, is a fix for the Joy-Con drift issues that have plagued Switch owners for years — and frustratingly, Nintendo won’t even confirm that it won’t. A variety of publications including &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;tried to ask the question, but Nintendo won’t tackle it head-on, despite other helpful answers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;like how the new Switch won’t have a new CPU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWj6Bs"&gt;Switch owners have been reporting Joy-Con drift problems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, and the problem is bad enough that it’s the subject &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-lawsuits-nintendo-is-facing-over-joy-con-drift"&gt;of numerous lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; — though Nintendo will unofficially fix controllers experiencing Joy-Con drift &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707849/nintendo-will-reportedly-fix-joy-con-drift-for-free-even-out-of-warranty"&gt;for free&lt;/a&gt;,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung quietly launched its free TV service on the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JNHLWIZitvROTDYEV5iRNFvJ1NQ=/0x0:845x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563857/TV_Plus_main1.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TyGLdg"&gt;Samsung recently launched a web version of its free and ad-supported Smart TV Plus streaming service for live and linear programming as well as added casting support for Chromecast devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEMhCm"&gt;The streaming product, which was previously limited to Samsung TV and mobile devices, launched as a web service in the second quarter, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/samsung-tv-plus-web-chromecast"&gt;Protocol reported&lt;/a&gt; Friday. It’s a curious new player in the streaming wars and launched with seemingly little fanfare, but the rollout makes an app that was previously limited to Samsung users now widely available to just about anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QSrfb"&gt;Samsung did not have immediate comment about the launch when reached on Friday. However, a spokesperson confirmed the launch of the web version of the service to Protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwd1Sp"&gt;Samsung TV...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s executive order puts net neutrality back in the spotlight</title>

  &lt;p id="0dUIWc"&gt;Earlier today President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569869/biden-executive-order-right-to-repair-isps-net-neutrality"&gt;signed the Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy&lt;/a&gt;, and in it there were several provisions relating to net neutrality. The prior administration’s FCC and FTC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17439456/net-neutrality-dead-ajit-pai-fcc-internet"&gt;rolled back Obama-era rules in those areas&lt;/a&gt;, and now there is a clear agenda to restore them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6rBq7y"&gt;Directives for the FCC from the order:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0UwQn6"&gt; (i)   adopting through appropriate rulemaking “Net Neutrality” rules similar to those previously adopted under title II of the Communications Act of 1934 (Public Law 73-416, 48 Stat. 1064, 47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, in “Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet,” 80 Fed.

&lt;p id="yh7X5N"&gt;Tucked into the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; that covered 72 initiatives to promote competition in the US economy, Biden specifically asked the FTC to crack down on “unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items, such as the restrictions imposed by powerful manufacturers that prevent farmers from repairing their own equipment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jk3en3"&gt;The order is a significant win for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549129/massachusetts-right-to-repair-question-1-wireless-car-data-passes"&gt;right to repair&lt;/a&gt; advocates who have long championed a consumer’s choice to have...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="J5FrTy"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Amazon’s acquisition of MGM, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ftc-opens-probe-of-amazons-mgm-purchase-signaling-a-lengthy-inquiry"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; describes the probe as an “in-depth investigation into the deal,” which could signal that it will stretch on for many months. The investigation also means the deal will be scrutinized by an FTC newly headed up by Lina Khan, an antitrust advocate and an Amazon critic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYcjaf"&gt;The FTC is focused on “the larger implications of the deal for Amazon’s market power,” &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported based on information from two people who knew of the probe, and that “the FTC is wary of whether the deal will illegally boost Amazon’s ability to offer a wide array of goods and services, and is not just limited to content...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Space tourism rivalry gets extremely petty ahead of Branson’s spaceflight </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Richard Branson (left) prepares for his flight to space, the rivalry between his space company Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, owned byJeff Bezos (right) is heating up.&lt;/em&gt; | Left: Bloomberg / Getty Images, Right: Alex Wong / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tj9OHe"&gt;A PR war between two billionaire-owned space companies, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, is starting to get spicy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRoVVu"&gt;Ever since Virgin announced it’d try to fly its founder Branson to space nine days before Bezos flies on his own rocket, Blue Origin has been on a warpath to discredit Virgin’s suborbital spaceplane, publicly attacking everything from the vehicle’s peak altitude to the size of its windows. Blue Origin’s CEO Bob Smith wished Branson well after Virgin’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559964/richard-branson-space-before-jeff-bezos-virgin-galactic"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;, but alleged he’s not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; going to space — “they’re not flying above the Kármán line and it’s a very different experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIs2KL"&gt;The Kármán line, 62 miles above ground, is the boundary of space recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="D6p8nI"&gt;This year’s &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; Championship Series (LCS) finale is the latest esports event to welcome an audience to attend in person. Riot Games announced on Friday that the final two matches of the LCS Championship, the league’s postseason summer tournament, will take place at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, on August 28th and 29th, and fans will be able to attend the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSfeJ2"&gt;During the pandemic, the league shifted to an entirely virtual format where players competed online and casters commentated remotely. It has moved slowly toward a return to events with fans. The final two matches of the Midseason Showdown tournament in April brought the players and production crew onstage at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, but there...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon reportedly doesn’t want employees to know when they’re on performance plans</title>

  &lt;p id="RnvSzh"&gt;Managers at Amazon are instructed not to warn employees that they are being monitored under the company’s “Focus” performance management tool, according to documents obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-tells-bosses-to-conceal-when-employees-are-on-a-performance-management-plan/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKvxxj"&gt;Focus is supposed to be a program where managers document how they are coaching employees and bringing their performance up to snuff. But in documents obtained by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, managers were instructed to not discuss Focus with employees, and instead they are supposed to more generally explain that the worker isn’t meeting expectations and how to improve. Managers would only be able to tell an employee they’re on the plan if they’re asked directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKmQ8h"&gt;This means an employee could be on track to losing their job without ever knowing that their...&lt;/p&gt;
