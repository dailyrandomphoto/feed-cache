    <title>Destiny 2: The Witch Queen offers the game’s biggest expansion in years on February 22nd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oZhajc0oAEbMP8CRZ5B5qBrBKxw=/300x0:2127x1218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69769355/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_12.20.54_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nG6w8W"&gt;Bungie has officially taken the wraps off of the next major expansion for &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;, which will continue the story of the sci-fi space series and see players finally face off against Savathûn, the titular Witch Queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dl7Vni"&gt;Savathûn (the sister of Oryx, the main villain in the original game’s &lt;em&gt;Taken King&lt;/em&gt; expansion) is a foe that’s been teased for over seven years, with her machinations behind many of &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;’s previous major events (including the corruption of the Dreaming City). The addition of the Witch Queen marks the first time that players will be able to face off against her in person, though. And, as the trailer has revealed, she won’t be alone: Savathûn has managed to harness the player’s own powers of Light to empower...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Climate change made Europe’s summer floods worse</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qo2e8k"&gt;Climate change raised the risk of deadly floods that swept&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;through Western Europe in July, &lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/heavy-rainfall-which-led-to-severe-flooding-in-western-europe-made-more-likely-by-climate-change/"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; confirms. As people around the world continue burning fossil fuels and pumping out greenhouse gas emissions, the threat of similar disasters grows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmOIc4"&gt;Already, single-day rainfall events in the affected region are between 3 to 19 percent more intense than they would be without human-caused climate change. Global warming also makes extreme rainfall events like the one that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;triggered mid-July floods in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg between 1.2 and nine times more likely to occur in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUplE5"&gt;At least 220 people died in Germany and Belgium because of swollen rivers and floods that raged through entire towns, knocking...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu is adding HDR for some of its original shows and movies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/azcmG1crbYRBvSHCxU4QYl4eFHE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69769092/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Hf68h"&gt;Somehow, it is 2021 and Hulu is only just now adding HDR support — to &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;of its original shows and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3PlyX"&gt;The addition was quietly added to &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/video-quality#HDR"&gt;Hulu’s support page this week&lt;/a&gt;, noting that customers can now “stream select Hulu originals in high-dynamic range (HDR), HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision on select devices.” A new HDR badge will appear on content that supports it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUrT7X"&gt;HDR content with Hulu will be available on the usual streaming suspects to start: HDR-compatible Roku models, Fire TV hardware that supports HDR, Apple TV 4K, HDR-compatible Chromecasts, and Vizio TVs with HDR. Notably missing are mobile devices or consoles, although presumably Hulu will continue to expand HDR support over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBZLnX"&gt;The actual list of shows and movies that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can buy the Oculus Quest 2 again following a pause in sales</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="arMNPI"&gt;You can now &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oculus/status/1430183158515896325"&gt;buy the Oculus Quest 2 again&lt;/a&gt; following a nearly monthlong pause in sales to outfit the headsets with new silicone covers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXh8jz"&gt;Facebook halted sales because the foam part of the facial interface that shipped with the original Quest 2 headsets caused skin irritation for some users. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596076/facebook-oculus-quest-2-storage-upgrade-foam-face-mask-recall"&gt;So on July 27th&lt;/a&gt;, the company announced it would stop selling the Quest 2 until August 24th and that it was participating in a joint voluntary recall with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) over the issue. &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/facebook-technologies-recalls-removable-foam-facial-interfaces-for-oculus-quest-2"&gt;The CPSC said&lt;/a&gt; that it received about 5,716 reports of incidents of skin irritation and “approximately 45 reports of consumers that required medical attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V86lmA"&gt;If you’re a current Quest 2 owner, you can request a free silicone mask to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo starts offering autonomous rides in San Francisco</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d3zLpt"&gt;Waymo is going to start shuttling a wider group of passengers around in its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, California — though they’ll have to sign nondisclosure agreements, and there still will be a human safety driver behind the wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsK9QZ"&gt;It’s the second city where the company has expanded its nascent autonomous vehicle offering, as the Google sibling has been performing fully driverless rides rides without a safety driver in parts of Phoenix, Arizona for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;more than a year now&lt;/a&gt;. Waymo is one of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;handful of companies&lt;/a&gt; trying to get a commercial service off the ground built around autonomous vehicles, like Argo AI (which is backed by Ford and Volkswagen) and Cruise (which is backed by General Motors). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton’s recalled, redesigned Tread goes on sale in the US on August 30th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Peloton Tread" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/01YHN68kQAe9sFjyyD9ZW_CusVA=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768810/2020.07.15_PRISMLAUNCH_DOUBLE_HANDOFF_3QUARTER_2500.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Peloton Tread | Image: Peloton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZOzd2L"&gt;In May, after a series of accidents linked to multiple injuries and one death, Peloton announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt; for its Tread Plus treadmill and a redesigned version of the Peloton Tread. The more serious incidents involved the Tread Plus, which remains on the shelf. However, the new Tread has since received tweaks to keep the screen from loosening and falling off. Now &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/peloton-tread-availability"&gt;Peloton says the $2,495 Tread will go on sale&lt;/a&gt; across the US, Canada, and the UK starting on August 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P10zzv"&gt;Unlike the 32-inch screen on the treadmill &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;we reviewed in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/tread"&gt;cheaper Tread&lt;/a&gt; has a 23.8-inch HD touchscreen with built-in speakers so you can interact with your trainer during a workout and track progress when you’re done. It also has a smaller footprint at 68 inches by...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans CEO on why it banned adult content: ‘the short answer is banks’</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vohdfJ"&gt;OnlyFans founder and CEO Tim Stokely says banks were behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634785/onlyfans-new-terms-of-service-policy-banning-sex-masturbation"&gt;the online fundraising platform’s recent ban&lt;/a&gt; on sexually explicit content. “The change in policy, we had no choice — the short answer is banks,” Stokely &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b8ce71c-a87a-440e-9f3d-58069ca0480b"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an interview published today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wsinH"&gt;Stokely named three major banks that refused service because of “reputational risk” associated with the UK-based OnlyFans’ sexual material: Bank of New York Mellon, Metro Bank, an JPMorgan Chase. He said BNY Mellon specifically had “flagged and rejected” every wire transaction involving OnlyFans, threatening its ability to pay creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vIjqHL"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; more generally that “banking partners and payment providers” had pressured OnlyFans — a platform previously...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s art-inspired Frame 4K TV is $200 off</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Frame camouflages itself as wall art when you’re not using it as a TV. | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aofzh8"&gt;The Frame, Samsung’s HDR-compatible QLED that pulls double duty as wall art, is one of the more unique TV designs that didn’t die in the concept phase or on the showroom floor of CES. Designed to look like a framed and matted photograph, the 120Hz screen hides in plain sight when switched to an Art Mode that displays still imagery instead of a black void when turned off. It’s a stunner of a TV in many ways and, for a limited time, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927639433300823#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are offering the 55-inch model for $200 off, the second-lowest price we’ve seen this year on the high-tech piece of home decor. It’s the perfect way to convince your friends you’re a person of culture and refinement while still being a techie nerd who loves large screens. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>League of Legends’ world championships moved from China to Europe</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AnBQ6n"&gt;The 2021&lt;em&gt; League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;’ World Championship, the end-of-year tournament for arguably the biggest esport in the world, has been moved from China to a currently undisclosed location in Europe, Riot Games announced. The move happens just weeks before the competition is set to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYLKRu"&gt;In a video, John Needham, global head of esports at Riot, said that travel restrictions and COVID protocols made it a challenge to hold the event in China. The move was &lt;a href="https://www.upcomer.com/sources-worlds-2021-moving-from-china-to-europe/"&gt;first reported Monday by &lt;em&gt;Upcomer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNpLXq"&gt;“After considering all potential options, we concluded that moving Worlds to Europe provided the best opportunity for the most teams and their best players to compete,” Needham explained. “We’re not ready to announce where in Europe Worlds will be held this...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="6lzKga"&gt;Some of the biggest Gamescom 2021 announcements are likely to happen during the Xbox stream. The stream will be a 90-minute blast that, according to Microsoft, will focus on “previously announced games” from its internal Xbox Studios and outside partners, as well as new titles coming to Xbox Game Pass. It’s possible that we’ll hear more about &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinit&lt;/em&gt;e, &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;, and more.

&lt;p id="CNsoAJ"&gt;The stream will be presented in 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/23/how-to-watch-the-gamescom-2021-xbox-stream/"&gt;according to the Xbox blog&lt;/a&gt;, so don’t fret if things aren’t looking their best during the debut. Though, if you’d rather wait until a higher-res video is available, a 4K / 60 frames per second video will be released...&lt;/p&gt;
