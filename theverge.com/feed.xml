    <title>Hulu’s animated MODOK series looks like Robot Chicken meets Marvel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bbD2g30xE1GShm8_fcPicggRgNc=/203x0:2279x1384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876431/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_4.25.37_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XcDRm1"&gt;Hulu has released the first trailer for &lt;em&gt;MODOK&lt;/em&gt;, its upcoming animated show that will see Patton Oswalt voice the titular Marvel villain in a more light-hearted,&lt;em&gt; Robot Chicken&lt;/em&gt;-style take on the franchise’s usual portentous superhero dramas. The show also got a release date: it’ll debut on May 21st on the streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62nyve"&gt;MODOK (Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing) has been a long-running bad guy in Marvel Comics as the leader of the evil scientific group AIM. (A more serious take on the character serves as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21422708/marvel-avengers-review-single-player-campaign-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;primary antagonist for Square Enix’s &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; video game, released last year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00FS3z"&gt;In the new Hulu animated series, MODOK has managed to bankrupt AIM, resulting in the supervillain being fired as the organization’s leader and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next Dragon Age will reportedly be single-player only amid other shifts at EA</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0pPVsCTE1IwehNU99toDe7Cddwc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876369/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_12.54.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qy4law"&gt;The next &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt; game will no longer have multiplayer aspects, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-25/electronic-arts-pivots-on-dragon-age-game-removes-multiplayer"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;. The game, made by EA-owned studio BioWare, had reportedly “been designed with a heavy multiplayer component,” but it has been turned into a single-player game “in recent months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USxXBZ"&gt;However, we still haven’t seen much of the game since it was first announced with a brief teaser trailer in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18126070/dragon-age-4-trailer-teaser-ea-announcement-release-date-game-awards-2018"&gt;December 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and we don’t know what the multiplayer component could have looked like. Even though the game has been in the works for some time — development started in 2015, reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; — there’s still no release date for it just yet, meaning it could be a ways off, and things could change. BioWare recently showed fleeting glimpses of the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21404442/dragon-age-4-behind-the-scenes-bts-bioware"&gt;in...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oxford lab studying the coronavirus was victim of a cyberattack</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JyH849"&gt;Oxford University disclosed on Thursday that one of its research labs dedicated in part to studying COVID-19 suffered a cyberattack, following an &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/02/25/exclusive-hackers-break-into-biochemical-systems-at-oxford-uni-lab-studying-covid-19/?sh=3f7d621e2a39"&gt;investigation from &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;indicating external access to a number of the lab’s systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spnFK2"&gt;The lab is part of Oxford’s Division of Structural Biology, known as “Strubi.” There’s no indication the lab or its research had any direct connection to ongoing COVID-19 vaccine development conducted by the Oxford Vaccine Group and the Jenner Institute. But it’s unclear exactly what data may have been compromised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIrDd0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes &lt;/em&gt;says it was shown proof of the intrusion by Alex Holden, the chief technology officer of a cybersecurity firm called Hold Security, who provided screenshots showing access to lab equipment...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it won’t loosen COVID-19 policies after Oversight Board request</title>

Among its responses, Facebook said it would not loosen standards on taking down COVID-19 misinformation, but it would test informing users whether a human or an automated filtering system deleted their post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r62gRv"&gt;The Oversight Board made 17 recommendations based on the six cases it examined. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;Unlike the board’s decisions&lt;/a&gt; regarding the appeals cases, Facebook is not required to adopt the recommendations, but it agrees that it will at least consider them. However, several of the responses were noncommittal, with one promising to “continue to explore how best to provide transparency [...]...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bungie addresses major Destiny 2 player complaints with massive changes on the horizon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eH-NEu8RMLlYFIGUSvABBVKrCsU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876272/media_wallaper_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Y5G0i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, Bungie’s long-running online sci-fi shooter, has a year of substantial changes ahead of it, according to a new roadmap the studio &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Explore/Detail/News/50124"&gt;detailed in an extensive blog post published on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. While the game’s next major expansion, &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;, has been delayed to early 2022, Bungie says it has major overhauls planned for nearly every aspect of the game — from the competitive multiplayer Crucible mode to how players progress and become more powerful across the game’s seasonal expansion model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="miQTtB"&gt;One of the biggest changes slated for &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; is a major crossplay implementation that will, for the first time, allow players on PC and players on consoles to join one another for activities. In its blog post, Bungie said crossplay is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook now wants to make ‘Hey Facebook’ a thing</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6SJQry"&gt;Facebook has introduced a new “Hey Facebook” wake word for its family of Portal smart displays and the Oculus Quest platform. The company only &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fsay-hey-facebook-to-stay-hands-free-with-oculus-quest-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F25%2F22301697%2Foculus-portal-smart-display-hey-facebook-wake-word-quest-headsets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;formally announced it&lt;/a&gt; was gradually rolling out to Quest headsets, but its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F743419682779926%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F25%2F22301697%2Foculus-portal-smart-display-hey-facebook-wake-word-quest-headsets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Portal support page now lists&lt;/a&gt; “Hey Facebook” as an alternative to “Hey Portal.” A look through the Wayback Machine shows it used to only list “Hey Portal” as &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210205040527/https://portal.facebook.com/help/2149102838698668/"&gt;recently as February 5th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARaIyB"&gt;Oculus owners can fret a little less knowing that it’s launching as an opt-in feature, buried in the Experimental Features panel within the headset’s settings. Oculus says it will remain that way, too, which was smart to mention, knowing that some users might fear it’ll become mandatory. You can also still use the Voice Commands app to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Live is down with users unable to sign in</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5usoKn"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Live service is down, preventing users from signing in to the service. The Xbox Live problems started at around 3:15PM ET today, and Microsoft has confirmed it’s investigating the outage. “We are aware that users may not be able to sign-in to Xbox Live at this time,” says Xbox support. “Our teams are currently investigating to fix this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iuq74B"&gt;If you’re not already signed in to your Xbox, the sign-in process will fail with an error, preventing access to certain services like Xbox Party chat. Some apps may also fail to launch without the core Xbox Live services being online, and a number of games will also not launch correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIuAGN"&gt;Microsoft has marked the Xbox Live issues as a “major outage” over at the company’s &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status"&gt;Xbox status...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BYGNKQ"&gt;Fisker Inc. quietly settled a previously unreported trade secret lawsuit with Volkswagen-backed solid-state battery company QuantumScape last July, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. The suit, filed in April 2019 in Santa Clara Superior Court, was centered on a former QuantumScape employee who brought thousands of confidential documents with her to a new job at Fisker Inc. in late 2018 and early 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61jx8k"&gt;While the lawsuit played out, Fisker Inc. locked away those documents and the work done by the employee, and even “quarantined” battery cells made while she worked there, though it ultimately argued the information was public domain. As part of the settlement, Fisker Inc. ultimately agreed to delete or destroy the documents the employee brought with...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A court is forcing Valve to tell Apple how much money 436 different PC games made</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bpkXCPEO1w3CLMq6sjASc7udQeE=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875727/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqMUYh"&gt;Valve has been compelled by a California court to provide sales data on more than 400 Steam games to Apple and possibly reveal its yearly sales, revenue, and profits to Apple as well. The iPhone maker subpoenaed Valve for the data as part of its ongoing dispute with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COCXIQ"&gt;According &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.356.0.pdf"&gt;to a Wednesday order by Judge Thomas Hixson&lt;/a&gt;, Valve will have to provide yearly sales and pricing data on 436 games that are available on both its PC game distribution platform, Steam, and the Epic Games Store. Apple has requested the data so it can define the video game market in its case against Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBOEl4"&gt;In a filing published on February 18th, Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291297/apple-valve-data-steam-sales-epic-games-dispute"&gt;had argued&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s demands were overly broad. Apple had asked for even more data in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use your Oculus Quest 2 to play any PC VR game wirelessly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q8Sb_6aZYKAVgUN-Mu726FoGJrQ=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68643020/hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh hey, it’s all of my PC games available to play on the Quest 2, wire-free, from within a virtual room. This is getting weird.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vDDDh3"&gt;One of the best features of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; is it can be manually linked via USB to your gaming PC to play more demanding VR games you couldn’t otherwise run natively on the headset. That’s great if you want a way to play games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; but the obvious downside is that you’re now physically tethered to a PC — so much for the wireless freedom that the Quest 2 advertises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTupji"&gt;Thankfully, the developers at Virtual Desktop have already figured out the seemingly impossible: how to run system-intensive titles on your PC and stream the visual feed to your VR device while syncing all of your movements over Wi-Fi. It gives you the best of both worlds: letting you play the games you want without being attached by a cable to your...&lt;/p&gt;
