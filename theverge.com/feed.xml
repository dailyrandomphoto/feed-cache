    <title>Time, money, and the new vaccination push </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Florida Vaccination Effort Aims To Vaccinate Migrant Workers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MfPXBp4QmIjP02MhTam0AC5rKk=/0x42:3000x2042/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69327914/1319098831.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ydFcBe"&gt;In the US, COVID-19 vaccines are free, but it turns out that money is still a big barrier to vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cQ39l"&gt;See, even though the vaccines don’t cost a thing, it still takes time to go and get a shot and potentially recover from any side effects. For working adults, that may mean taking time off work — and that isn’t something that everyone can afford to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="hbr6vl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmWA18"&gt;Black and Hispanic people are particularly concerned about the tradeoff between missing work and getting the vaccine, according to new &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/how-employer-actions-could-facilitate-equity-in-covid-19-vaccinations/"&gt;results from&lt;/a&gt; research published by the Kaiser Family Foundation this week. People in both demographics are more likely than their white counterparts to work lower-paying jobs, which may not offer as much paid leave for things like illness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ggjBw"&gt;Those...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Transgender’ will be among more than 350 new tags Twitch is adding next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W3ReoYEDkwbUQMsB-UQSeC7rg_M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69327900/acastro_181026_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozLTd4"&gt;Starting next week, streaming platform Twitch will add more than 350 new community tags to its platform related to gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ability, and mental health, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/05/21/celebrate-yourself-and-your-community-with-350-new-tags/"&gt;new blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The list of tags will include transgender, Black, disabled, veteran, and Vtuber, Twitch said, and it will remove the “ally “ references from its LGBTQIA tag, in favor of a new standalone ally tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nniZUu"&gt;The platform thanked its trans community for pushing for a transgender tag, and admitted “the simple truth is we should have done this sooner.” &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/25/21176485/twitch-trans-streamers-discoverability-tags"&gt;Twitch reportedly had resisted adding a transgender tag&lt;/a&gt; over concerns about targeted harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSKl75"&gt;“When we launched tags in 2018, we did so to boost discovery, to help creators...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China drives its rover on the surface of Mars</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="CHINA-SPACE-SCIENCE-MARS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4NTEAefCmT6C6Y6jBskU52V3CfA=/0x712:3900x3312/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69327823/1232981921.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mvxu3u"&gt;China became the second country to successfully deploy a vehicle on Mars on Saturday, and the first to do so on its inaugural visit to the Red Planet. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/china-says-martian-rover-takes-first-drive-surface-red-planet-2021-05-22/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the solar-powered Zhurong rover drove down the ramp of its landing capsule on to the surface of Mars at about 10:40 AM Beijing time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lohqey"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436072/china-tianwen-1-mars-landing-zhurong-rover"&gt;Zhurong first landed on Mars&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month and started its journey on Mars’ surface on Utopia Planitia, a smooth plain where NASA’s Viking 2 lander touched down in 1976. That’s more than 1,200 miles from the Jezero Crater where the US rover &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Perseverance touched down in February&lt;/a&gt;. A third rover, NASA’s Curiosity, which landed on Mars in 2012, was spotted by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/mars-rover-curiosity-on-mont-mercou-orbit-photo"&gt;climbing up Mars’ Mont Mercou&lt;/a&gt; last month, &lt;em&gt;S...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vox Media’s Eric Arredondo on working as IT support </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7k5orjsovbwa93KfYhmNRG8TLQI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69327773/bfarsace_200407_3962_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2g3kM5"&gt;It’s safe to say that no company in existence today that has more than a couple of employees can exist without a knowledgeable IT support person or team. When you’re trying to run a website, create a solid technological structure, and keep things running even at the most stressful of times, a strong IT support team can make sure that things don’t go completely haywire at the worst time — or, if it does, that somebody is there to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1VUdX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is certainly no different, and so we asked one of the members of Vox Media’s IT team — Eric Arredondo, IT administrator — to tell us a bit about himself and his job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="us5hNN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10508485"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qsKelo"&gt;What do you do for Vox Media?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cgVAW7"&gt;I am an IT administrator for our IT service desk team. I help manage and support the internal...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s excuse for no AirTag in Siri Remote: it’s too thick to easily lose in your couch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDODHZJGTumbrLb4XbxSIy9WYxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69326700/DSCF3923.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0Qos8"&gt;We have poked a &lt;em&gt;considerable&lt;/em&gt; amount of fun at the Apple TV’s Siri Remote over the years, and we’re pleased to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;it’s finally fixed&lt;/a&gt; — except for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/5/10/22429238/apple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design"&gt;the headsmacking decision &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;to stick the company’s AirTag UWB locator technology&lt;/a&gt; into one of the few gadgets absolutely, positively guaranteed to get lost in your couch cushions someday. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlPSKR"&gt;Today, Apple VP Tim Twerdahl &lt;a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2021/05/21/apple-vp-tim-twerdahl-talks-apple-tv-2021-gaming-future/"&gt;answered that burning question&lt;/a&gt; in perhaps the most unsatisfactory way imaginable: simply, that the new TV remote’s thick enough you shouldn’t need to worry about that much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMTTIH"&gt;Here’s the whole exchange &lt;a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2021/05/21/apple-vp-tim-twerdahl-talks-apple-tv-2021-gaming-future/"&gt;between Twerdahl and &lt;em&gt;MobileSyrup’s &lt;/em&gt;Patrick O’Rourke&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="38EvNI"&gt;Q: Was there ever any thought to adding some sort of AirTag-like technology in the Siri remote? I’m always losing the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A 20-year-old Xbox Easter egg has been revealed, and there may still be more </title>

  &lt;p id="676vGD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-an-original-xbox-easter-egg-thats-remained-hidden-1846926839"&gt;has revealed an Easter egg&lt;/a&gt; that’s been hidden on the original Xbox for almost twenty years, after a developer who worked on the console sent in a tip. The Easter egg, which has apparently remained secret until now, can show you the Xbox Dashboard Team’s names after you follow a byzantine set of steps (as is par for the course when it comes to some video game secrets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9z1jOt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; was able to find someone with a working Xbox who could actually carry out those steps, which you can see in the publication’s video below. If you’ve got one of the consoles, you can try it out for yourself by ripping a CD as a soundtrack and calling it “Timmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!” (using 26 “y”s to reach the maximum amount of characters allowed). After...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook faces harsh questions about the App Store from judge in Fortnite trial</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="78jNcW"&gt;Apple called CEO Tim Cook to conclude three weeks of testimony in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple — &lt;/em&gt;and with the end of the trial approaching, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers engaged Cook in a surprisingly tense exchange over Apple’s business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eenHBa"&gt;Rogers noted that most of Apple’s App Store revenue comes from games, and she asked Cook why developers can’t use other payment methods to sell in-app purchases, or at least tell users they can make those transactions elsewhere. “If they wanted to go and get a cheaper Battle Pass or V-Bucks, and they don’t know they’ve got that option, what is the problem with Apple giving them that option?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ghs6I"&gt;“If we allowed people to link out like that, we would in essence give up our total return on our [intellectual...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s the best student laptop? We asked students</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops for high school and college students.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5zZmzF"&gt;Shopping for a laptop can be stressful — doubly stressful if you or your children will be learning online for the first time. Kids of different ages have a range of different laptop use cases and different needs. And as the choices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; evolve, so do students’ needs. So I spoke to some experts on the subject: students themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9ZW8b"&gt;My recommendations here are meant to accommodate a variety of preferences and price ranges. But they’re a jumping-off point rather than an exhaustive list: every student is different. Before making a decision, you’ll want to make sure you read reviews and try out devices yourself if you can. I’ll do my best to keep this article up to date with items that are in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Best laptop...&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>New research shows how many important links on the web get lost to time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dgSfp3Rp-yTwT8XGEjAtUFCU3CY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325496/VRG_ILLO_4489_003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y63Zsg"&gt;A quarter of the deep links in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times’ &lt;/em&gt;articles are now rotten, leading to completely inaccessible pages, &lt;a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/linkrot-content-drift-new-york-times.php"&gt;according to a team of researchers&lt;/a&gt; from Harvard Law School, who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zittrain/status/1395750908349325315?s=20"&gt;worked with the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ digital team&lt;/a&gt;. They found that this problem affected over half of the articles containing links in the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s catalog going back to 1996, illustrating the problem of link rot and how difficult it is for context to survive on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1K0Xf"&gt;The study looked at over 550,000 articles, which contained over 2.2 million links to external websites. It found that 72 percent of those links were “deep,” or pointing to a specific page rather than a general website.
