    <title>Instagram would be better off without Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E7KrIV"&gt;For years, critics have argued that Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram was a missed opportunity to rein in the company. But now, they’ll have the chance to actually undo it. On Wednesday afternoon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission joined with 48 state attorneys general&lt;/a&gt; to call for a court-ordered divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp — essentially, forcing Facebook to undo both acquisitions and spin them back into independent companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AzhMg"&gt;Regulators are still a long way from making that happen, but for the first time, it’s a possibility that Facebook can’t ignore. And for Instagram users, it raises a question that’s both alarming and tantalizing: what would Instagram look like without Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1xcNj"&gt;In the years since the 2012 acquisition,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The good and the bad in the government’s case against Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e18iqEwaA5SNPK8Qj5nz8mpkXeA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490632/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;h2 id="D74t6l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xUclNM"&gt;After writing about the potential breakup of Facebook for years, it’s somewhat surreal for me to see the prospect actually arrive. But it’s here: &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission voted 3-2 to sue Facebook for illegally maintaining a monopoly in social networking&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it has used acquisitions and harsh restrictions on third-party developers to prevent competitors from ever gaining a foothold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFMSzW"&gt;If successful, the FTC’s case — which was joined by 46 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam — could force the company to divest itself of Instagram and WhatsApp, radically reshaping the digital economy. The move comes less than six weeks after the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/justice-comes-for-google"&gt;filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Google of also maintaining an illegal...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 shines on next-gen consoles and Stadia, but older hardware struggles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/juVNgshivECpsca10aIjOVJb1GM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490521/pu15d4e891d784977cacbfcbb00c48f133_1603729915_6192392_screenshot_original.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BsJqNu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just one of the biggest games of the year; it’s also one of the most technically demanding. CD Projekt Red’s ambitious roleplaying game takes place in a huge, dense open world, and — as anyone who has ever played a Bethesda game can attest to — technology is often a step behind the designers in these kinds of experiences. Glitches and bugs are not uncommon occurrences, and early demos are far cries from what the game may look like on the standard hardware most players have in their living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSMDQP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; is also somewhat unique in that it’s releasing across a number of different platforms at launch — nine, to be exact. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;We initially reviewed &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; on PC&lt;/a&gt;, where we ran into a handful of glitches that were annoying...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The century-long quest for worldwide wireless power</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Two hands hold a florescent light and a cellphone next to a Tesla coil" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SceGAnCuyAHR6RRGk5BcXXuVC9g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490281/VRG_SCI_185_Thumb_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TytUTt"&gt;In 1902, famed inventor and futurist Nikola Tesla set up shop on Long Island to begin work on his grandest experiment yet. He imagined the construction of a worldwide wireless power delivery system: a network of towers that could light up cities, send communications, and even power aircraft in the sky, all without wires. On the grounds of his lab, he built the first prototype transmission device, a massive structure that came to be known as the Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mM12Rc"&gt;Today, of course, we live in a profoundly wired world. Over-the-air communication is ubiquitous. But with a handful of exceptions like cellphones and toothbrushes, we still send and receive electricity through wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAhu8o"&gt;So what went happened to Tesla’s big ambition? We traveled to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the 2020 Game Awards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Game Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1002qTtdyze4kqgh-u7j4nVRbVs=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490260/TGA2020_PosterPack1_PosterB_HD.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Game Awards&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X73D3N"&gt;What better way to finish off 2020 than with a bunch of new game announcements? That’s what you can expect when you watch The Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley. As the name implies, it’s also when individuals and companies receive accolades for their work in making the best games of the year. It’ll be hard to top last year’s unveiling of the Xbox Series X, but there should still be a few surprises we won’t see coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMPYsB"&gt;Unlike in years past, this event is online only, so there won’t be any attendees. That should speed up the doling out of awards, making way for the game announcements. It’s what we’re all watching for, right? Here’s how you can tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jJvTZX"&gt;When do the Game Awards start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ieTas0"&gt;It’s all happening on Thursday, December 10th. You...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon boosts renewable energy purchases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Continues To Hire As Demand Soars During Coronavirus Shutdown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HYVSdXojtDp05yoZKnAAr6gBnFs=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490023/1218796210.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s884kP"&gt;Amazon now claims that it is the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world. The company’s investment in wind and solar projects grew to 6.5 GW, enough to power 1.7 million homes in the US for a year. That surpasses Google, which previously said it held the title as the biggest corporate buyer with &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-biggest-renewable-energy-purchase-ever/"&gt;5.5 GW of renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; projects under contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ckgaTZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon surpasses Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5cpAqp"&gt;The move is part of Amazon’s commitment to limit the damage it does to the planet. Last year, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873834/amazon-sustainability-jeff-bezos-climate-change-pledge-emissions-paris-accord"&gt;pledged to reach net-zero&lt;/a&gt; carbon dioxide emissions by 2040, meaning it will take measures to reduce its planet-heating pollution as much as possible and then cancel out the rest with carbon offsets. It also said its physical infrastructure would run...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook outage disrupted Messenger and Instagram DMs</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i7NiBq"&gt;You might have run into trouble messaging someone on Facebook or Instagram this morning. A service outage took down Facebook Messenger and Instagram DMs for many users, with new messages failing to send and old messages failing to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuM82S"&gt;The outage appears to have started around 4:30AM ET and gotten worse (or, at least, more widely noticed) in the following hours. The website Downdetector, which monitors website outages, showed a spike in users reporting issues with these services that peaked around 8:30AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcJsMM"&gt;Facebook says the disruptions have since been resolved. “Earlier today, some people have experienced trouble sending or receiving messages on Messenger, Instagram or Workplace Chat. The issue has since been resolved and we apologize...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leica’s SL2-S trades resolution for speed and sensitivity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgBp3wr7dJz1D0YkTaJu_LbpYn8=/0x2:6000x4002/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489968/SL2_S_Ambients_CL_7_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Leica SL2-S | Photo: Leica&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MY0BzY"&gt;Leica is expanding its line of full-frame interchangeable lens mirrorless cameras with the new SL2-S. As its name implies, the SL2-S is a variation of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950534/leica-sl2-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-ibis-price-specs-announcement-features"&gt;SL2 that came out last year&lt;/a&gt; and it shares many features and similarities with that camera. But that S tagged on to the end means it is something different, and it might as well stand for speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqphul"&gt;The SL2-S has the same body, design, build quality, LCD touchscreen, viewfinder, battery, in-body image stabilization, and autofocus system as the SL2. What’s different is its sensor: instead of the high-resolution 47.3-megapixel chip found in the SL2, the SL2-S has a brand-new, backside-illuminated 24-megapixel sensor. That lower resolution allows it to capture up to 25 frames per second with...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shopping is coming to Instagram Reels globally, turning the whole app into a catalog</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oFdEt3"&gt;Instagram is covering its app with shopping content. Today, the company announced that shopping is rolling out to Reels, its TikTok copycat product, around the world. It announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21499179/facebook-reels-shopping-igtv-retail"&gt;test of this feature&lt;/a&gt; in October. Businesses and creators will be able to tag products when they create Reels, and viewers can tap through those tags to buy or save them. A branded content tag is also available for influencers who are paid for their posts. With this rollout, Instagram now has shopping available in every format on the app — the Feed, Stories, IGTV, and Live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksGWCC"&gt;Shopping is important to Instagram, and Facebook more broadly, as it looks to diversify its revenue. Ads are the primary way both platforms make money, but shopping presents an opportunity...&lt;/p&gt;
