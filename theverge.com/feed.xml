    <title>TikTok is coming to LG’s recent smart TVs</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3y8Sbl"&gt;TikTok has launched an app for LG’s 2020 and 2021 smart TVs, the TV manufacturer has announced. The app arrived on these recent webOS 5.0 and webOS 6.0 models with a firmware update that started rolling out on October 7th, but will also be coming to older 2019 TVs “in the coming months.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFFOtm"&gt;In its press release, LG did not specify which regions the TikTok app will be available in. That’s notable since TikTok’s smart TV apps for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174064/tiktok-tv-app-samsung-uk-fire-amazon"&gt;Samsung TVs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264642/tiktok-android-tv-launch-not-working-google"&gt;Android TV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573707/tiktok-fire-tv-app-uk-france-germany-smart-tv"&gt;Fire TV&lt;/a&gt; have been focused on European countries like the UK, France, and Germany. Meanwhile in the US, TikTok released a more limited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357300/tiktok-amazon-fire-tv-app-launch-free-tv-mobile"&gt;“More on TikTok” app&lt;/a&gt; on Fire TV devices last year. We have followed up with both LG and TikTok to ask which regions the new smart TV app will be available...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Search adds guitar tuner to its smorgasbord of built-in features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjRpA6VKypAoobgoYzGOIW4Ifh0=/0x0:661x441/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967931/xD2C8Qsdpb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You play a note, and the software tells you whether you’re in tune.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Google.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9aWmrb"&gt;Google Search now has a handy built-in tuner, letting you use the microphone on your phone or computer to tune a guitar, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-search-has-an-instrument-tuner/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. To access the feature, which was added this week, just search for “&lt;a href="https://g.co/kgs/qjLuJT"&gt;Google tuner&lt;/a&gt;.” The interface is similar to the dozens of guitar tuning apps that are already available. You play a string on the guitar, and Google will detect the note you’re aiming for, and tell you to “tune up” or “tune down” as required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJ7QJP"&gt;Like other guitar tuning apps, the effectiveness of Google’s tuner seems to depend a lot on the hardware you’re using it with. My iPhone 12 Pro (via Safari) or Windows desktop with a Blue Snowball USB microphone (via Edge) had no trouble hearing and helping me tune an unamplified electric...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OLED Nintendo Switch doesn’t have a Pentile screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u6gOPi"&gt;The new Nintendo Switch OLED Model doesn’t have a Pentile screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIRMXb"&gt;That might not mean much to you, and it wasn’t something we were able to confirm definitively during our review process — other than to say that the screen is a huge improvement. Which it is. But there’s been speculation ever since the OLED Switch was announced that its panel might use Pentile technology, which could have had big implications for image quality. Nintendo devices don’t tend to have the best screens, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ct3roe"&gt;Pentile is a trademark owned by Samsung that refers to various subpixel matrix layouts most commonly used in OLED display panels. In casual conversation, or as casual as conversations about OLED subpixel layouts can really be, Pentile is now...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>SVP of Android offers open invitation to help Apple put RCS texting on the iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside The Samsung Electronics Co. Unpacked Product Launch Event" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eQL9Bb5kUymvqQoti8MsQwG4MQ=/0x3:3000x2003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967396/1200178032.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HlGXtY"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953"&gt;tweet earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, Google SVP Hiroshi Lockheimer called on Apple to support RCS, the next-generation texting standard that’s supposed to supplant SMS. He offered an “open invitation to the folks who can make this right” and said “we are here to help.” Translation: the “folks” are Apple and “we are here to help” is Google’s offer to assist Apple in implementing the new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eefiaP"&gt;RCS is finally starting to gain traction around the world. Its biggest champion has been Google, which finally landed on using it as the default texting solution for Android phones after trying every other solution. RCS is far from perfect, but it’s clearly superior to SMS (which is, of course, a low bar). After securing deals from US carriers to commit to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube says its auto livestream captions are now available for all creators</title>
    <content type="html">

This change, along with some future improvements the company details in its blog, should help make the platform more accessible to deaf or hard-of-hearing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxXkcE"&gt;Some of those updates include making live auto captions available to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-long-form-videos-and-shorts"&gt;12 more languages instead of just English&lt;/a&gt; (including Japanese, Turkish, and Spanish), the ability to add multiple audio tracks to a video to support multiple languages (and audio descriptions for those with limited eyesight), and the expansion of the auto-translate captions feature to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California just made it a lot harder for companies to cover up harassment and abuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g7QrLr"&gt;California governor Gavin Newsom signed the &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB331"&gt;Silenced No More Act&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday night— a historic piece of legislation, authored by state senator Connie Leyva (D-Chino), that should protect workers who speak out about harassment and discrimination even if they’ve signed a non-disclosure agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCZO2G"&gt;Pinterest whistleblower Ifeoma Ozoma began &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB331&amp;amp;showamends=false"&gt;pushing the bill forward last year&lt;/a&gt;, after coming forward with allegations of racism against the tech company. She knew she was partially protected by the Stand Together Against Non-Disclosures Act, a Me Too-era law that banned NDAs in sexual harassment cases, but soon realized the bill did not provide protections for other forms of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06SGwv"&gt;Now, that’s changing. Workers in California will be legally...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A friendly reminder that Hulu’s price is going up October 8th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qWATDI"&gt;Hulu’s prices are going up beginning Friday, October 8th for both its monthly and annual subscription tiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NoMMc"&gt;It was initially reported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22661241/hulu-plans-ads-dollar-price-increase-monthly-subscription-disney"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; that Hulu’s monthly cost would increase by $1 per month or $10 per year (ad-supported) to $7 monthly (ad-supported), $13 monthly (no-ads), and $70 per year, respectively. Both Hulu’s base ad-supported and ad-free monthly subscription prices are going up in price by a dollar, but neither of its live TV tiers will be impacted. (Those plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;got a price increase&lt;/a&gt; late last year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asUaZ8"&gt;In a recent email to subscribers, Hulu wrote that the price hike “will be reflected in your first billing cycle on or after October 8.” Users will be charged the new price unless they cancel their subscription on or...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo engineers suggest Switch Joy-Con drift will never be fixed</title>

  &lt;p id="UoljsC"&gt;One of the Nintendo Switch’s persistent flaws has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"&gt;been Joy-Con drift&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon where players observe false inputs when they aren’t even touching the joysticks on the controllers.  Nintendo has been relatively quiet on the subject for years, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/10/22570868/nintendo-oled-switch-joy-con-drift"&gt;the company refused to say&lt;/a&gt; whether the new OLED-equipped Nintendo Switch OLED had fixed the issue. But today, the company is breaking its silence in a big way — and suggesting that Joy-Con drift may never be fully addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6ENQU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/ask-the-developer-vol-2-nintendo-switch-oled-model-part-4/"&gt;In a new Q&amp;amp;A about the development of the Nintendo Switch OLED&lt;/a&gt;, the company reveals  that it has steadily been making improvements to the Joy-Cons to try and make them more reliable. The joysticks that came with 2019’s Switch Lite aren’t the same as those in the original...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1aWrGd"&gt;Microsoft has agreed to have an independent third-party study the potential impact of it making its devices easier to repair and to make changes based on those findings by the end of 2022, &lt;a href="https://grist.org/accountability/bowing-to-investors-microsoft-will-make-its-devices-easier-to-fix/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Grist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. The agreement was made after As You Sow &lt;a href="https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2021/6/24/investors-urge-microsoft-consumers-right-to-repair-electronic-devices"&gt;filed a shareholder resolution&lt;/a&gt; asking Microsoft to look into the potential impact that it could make by making it easier for consumers to get their devices repaired. &lt;a href="https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2021/10/7/microsoft-agrees-expand-consumers-repair-options"&gt;As You Sow has withdrawn its resolution&lt;/a&gt; in return for Microsoft conducting the study and making parts and documentation more available to repair shops that aren’t official Microsoft service providers based on the study’s results.&lt;/p&gt;
