    <title>Facebook to end special treatment for politicians after Trump ban</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SY6tpr"&gt;Facebook plans to end its controversial policy that shields politicians from the content moderation rules that apply to other users, a sharp reversal that could have global ramifications for how elected officials use the social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1TpWJ"&gt;The change, which Facebook is set to announce as soon as Friday, comes after the Oversight Board — an independent group funded by Facebook to review its thorniest content rulings — affirmed its decision to suspend former President Donald Trump but critiqued the special treatment it gives politicians, stating that the “same rules should apply to all users.” The board gave Facebook till June 5th to respond to its policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEIsJb"&gt;Facebook also plans to shed light on the secretive system of strikes...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is updating AirTags to make them less creepy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oQ4Ki1"&gt;Apple is distributing an AirTags software update that makes it harder for people to use them for surreptitious tracking, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-bolsters-airtag-privacy-measures-to-offer-android-detector-app-later-this-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. According to a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Apple is also working on an app for Android users which will let them detect potentially unwanted trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoHH1q"&gt;AirTags were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as Apple’s solution for helping people keep track of everyday objects. In its marketing, Apple shows people finding their lost keys or bags that have the trackers attached. However, there have been concerns the tiny devices are being used to secretly track people without their knowledge, and we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airtags-review/"&gt;numerous reports&lt;/a&gt; since the AirTags’ release indicating that some tweaks were needed to make the devices more...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden signs order banning US investment in Chinese surveillance companies</title>

  &lt;p id="MCTXS2"&gt;President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/03/executive-order-on-addressing-the-threat-from-securities-investments-that-finance-certain-companies-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; Thursday expanding a Trump-era ban on Americans investing in Chinese companies with purported ties to China’s military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuZtJK"&gt;The order increases the number of restricted Chinese companies from 48 to 59. It also rewrites &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2020/11/12/trump-bans-americans-from-investing-in-companies-that-support-chinas-military/"&gt;a previous order issued&lt;/a&gt; by former President Donald Trump to include companies that create and deploy surveillance technology, like the technology used against Muslim minorities and dissidents in Hong Kong. The move signals that Biden plans to continue some of the same China-related policies previously put in place by the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTLXar"&gt;The order does not include DJI, WeChat, TikTok, or its parent company ByteDance among the 59 companies, despite previous concerns about...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xfpmOJ"&gt;The primary difference between what the service is calling its “essential” plan and the more expensive commercial-free plan — besides the addition of ads — is some missing content. The $10 commercial-free plan includes both local and national news coverage with CBSN and CBS live, whereas the new essential plan only includes national news with CBSN. There’s more sports coverage on the commercial-free plan as well, and premium users also get support for offline downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8WQQg"&gt;Both plans include access to tens of thousands of TV episodes and movies, as well as the platform’s originals, but premium...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="IX1NtC"&gt;The Biden administration will make $1 billion in grants available to expand broadband access and adoption on tribal lands, Vice President Kamala Harris &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/06/department-commerces-ntia-announces-nearly-1-billion-funding-expand"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; at the White House Thursday. The funds, from the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), will be made to eligible Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian entities for broadband deployment, to support digital inclusion, workforce development, telehealth, and distance learning. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford delays Mustang Mach-E deliveries in the UK due to ‘safety risk’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SmtadszCT8KKVkDBy_mp7Q6et7c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69400513/sokane_210125_4386_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GUYK8m"&gt;Deliveries of Ford’s first long-range electric vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E, in the United Kingdom are on hold after a “safety risk” was discovered, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. It’s the latest delivery snafu to hit the automaker’s much-hyped electric SUV, after US customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22234668/ford-delays-deliveries-mustang-mach-e-quality-checks"&gt;experienced similar delays earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bhxrK"&gt;But while the cause of the US delivery delays was unknown, the UK delays are a result of “incorrect location information when using the eCall system,” according to documents viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The eCall system, in which emergency services are notified when a vehicle’s airbags are deployed, &lt;a href="https://www.carbuyer.co.uk/tips-and-advice/155428/ecall-explained"&gt;is a European Union requirement&lt;/a&gt; in all vehicles manufactured after 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gCPc5S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“incorrect location information when using the eCall system”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Nanoleaf’s light-up wall panels now look like wood accent pieces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K7ycSs"&gt;Nanoleaf, the company best known for illuminated panels that you stick to your wall, has announced the new Nanoleaf Elements line, a set of wall panels that are designed to look as nice turned off as they do when on. The new Elements line accomplishes this through a wood-like veneer that allows the light to shine through when its on but doesn’t look blank when the light isn’t in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0Lwaz"&gt;Aside from the new veneer, the Elements lights are very similar to Nanoleaf’s other hexagonal light panels. They glow from both the front and back of the panel, allowing for a double lighting effect, and can be programmed with different lighting patterns and effects. The Elements do not have a full color spectrum LED, but they are adjustable from warm to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome will soon warn you when you might not want to trust an extension</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new dialog box will warn if an extension isn’t considered trusted.&lt;/em&gt; | Image; Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KhXju2"&gt;Google is rolling out new safety features for Chrome which are designed to make it easier to spot dubious downloads and extensions. They build upon the browser’s Enhanced Safe Browsing feature, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262923/google-chrome-privacy-security-safe-browsing-cookies-dns-https-extensions"&gt;launched last year&lt;/a&gt; to offer better warnings against phishing sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kcm933"&gt;When it comes to Chrome extensions, the browser will now show a warning if what you’re installing is not considered “trusted.” In order to be trusted, extensions need to come from a developer that has followed &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program_policies/"&gt;Google’s Developer Program Policies&lt;/a&gt; and has been around for “at least a few months.” That means brand-new developers won’t immediately be considered trusted by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Am9ZS2"&gt;When attempting to download an extension that’s &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;trusted, Chrome will show a pop-up warning that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam now lets developers team up on game bundles</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2tzoXX"&gt;Valve has started letting developers team up to create bundles on the Steam gaming storefront. It outlined the new “DIY collaborative bundles” &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3074248029695078497"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, describing the feature as a way to collect titles with “common themes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CbCp7"&gt;Steam already offered multi-developer bundles, but only ones that were specially curated by the platform. Now, any developer can create a bundle and send an invitation link to other creators, who can then choose to add their own projects. The bundle owner then locks the bundle and participants agree to a name, royalty split, discount amount, and other details. All participants have to approve later game additions, but someone can remove their game from the bundle unilaterally, and the bundle owner can...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
