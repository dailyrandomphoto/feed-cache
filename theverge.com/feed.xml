    <title>Mercedes-Benz fixes error that let drivers watch TV while in motion</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NmGuHZ"&gt;Mercedes-Benz has fixed a server issue that made it possible to browse the internet and watch TV on the 56-inch “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217267/mercedes-benz-hyperscreen-size-specs-eqs-ces-2021"&gt;hyperscreen&lt;/a&gt;” in the new electric EQS and newer S-Class sedans. While the oversight is already resolved, the German automaker filed for a recall with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in “an abundance of caution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OG6JJB"&gt;The company says in &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V931-5554.PDF"&gt;a document filed with the NHTSA&lt;/a&gt; (which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/itskeithbarry/status/1469313981093453827"&gt;spotted by Consumer Reports’ Keith Barry&lt;/a&gt;) that, in November, it found an “incorrect configuration was available on Mercedes-Benz’s backend server and might have been installed on vehicles in the field.” Very few cars were affected (the EQS only just started hitting city streets here), around 227 by Mercedes-Benz’s count. The S-Class sedans...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moderna data shows mRNA isn’t a quick fix for the flu vaccine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tvnYj8MTRVTKMdX_2t8O4tZ6RVY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255851/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JgSW2t"&gt;The first data from clinical trials of Moderna’s mRNA-based seasonal flu vaccine, released by the company Friday morning, were underwhelming — a finding that shows gene-based vaccines might not be a fix for all the problems with vaccine development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n180YK"&gt;The overwhelming success of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, made by Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech, supercharged interest in that strategy for developing shots. The shots inject people with tiny snippets of the gene for a virus, which the body builds and then uses to learn how to fight the virus. Current flu shots contain inactivated copies of the influenza virus. mRNA vaccines are faster to design and produce because manufacturers don’t have to grow copies of the virus, which is why experts have...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta adds Quest 2, Portal, and Ray-Ban Stories updates to its bug bounty program</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HkjjGN"&gt;Facebook parent company Meta is adding updates to its bug bounty program for products from its metaverse division &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;Reality Labs&lt;/a&gt;, including its Quest 2, Portal, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses&lt;/a&gt;, the company announced Friday. The work will play an important role in its “journey to help build the metaverse,” according to a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgOMpR"&gt;The press release emphasized that verified Ray-Ban Stories bug submissions are eligible for awards, which it’s hoping will incentivize more researchers to “analyze the glasses and our other hardware devices.” The minimum award for discovering a bug is $500, and the amounts increase depending on the device and the potential impact of the bug discovered. The biggest payout listed is $30,000 but could go even...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla leak reveals all-in-one ‘Superhorn’ for Model 3 and Y</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model Y" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l_Zi41MATnubH0myWOiKUX7Q8tY=/418x0:3582x2109/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255430/0x0_Model_Y_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QdYCxi"&gt;Tesla may be adding new hardware components to its upcoming 2022 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles — including a new all-in-one “Superhorn” that combines a horn, alarm, and loudspeaker. This feature and more was revealed (&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/08/tesla-model-3-y-new-features-changes-leak/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) in a leaked document on German-speaking Tesla forum &lt;a href="https://tff-forum.de/t/model-3-model-y-technische-veraenderungen-und-details/100784/641"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dr1ErC"&gt;The listed component changes presented in the document appear to be meant for the eyes of European regulators. Tesla generally does not line up new features with model years as closely as most other manufacturers. For instance, the company started adding its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18511594/tesla-new-self-driving-chip-is-here-and-this-is-your-best-look-yet"&gt;new full self-driving computer&lt;/a&gt; (HW3) to cars in April 2019. Then, in September of that year, it began including an &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2019/09/10/tesla-pedestrian-warning-system-model-3/"&gt;external speaker&lt;/a&gt; under Model 3 bumpers (to comply with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/16/13651106/electric-car-noise-nhtsa-rule-blind-pedestrian-safety"&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; requiring electric...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New social media transparency bill would force Facebook to open up to researchers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CHEoH3"&gt;A bipartisan group of US senators have announced a new bill that would require social media companies to share platform data with independent researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wOe2t"&gt;The bill was announced Thursday by Democratic senators Chris Coons (D-DE), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and also Rob Portman (R-OH), a Republican. Named the &lt;a href="https://www.coons.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/text_pata_117.pdf"&gt;Platform Accountability and Transparency Act&lt;/a&gt; (PATA), it would establish new rules compelling social media platforms to share data with “qualified researchers,” defined as university-affiliated researchers pursuing projects that have been approved by the National Science Foundation (NSF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NFS1wU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“this legislation would provide a real pathway for researchers to better understand online harms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Redditors are spamming Kellogg’s job portal to support striking workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kellogg Union Workers Continue Strike For Second Week" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TOC8zCO4KNTy061DEcsdAMJJscU=/0x0:2736x1824/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255347/1236053125.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tutDQj"&gt;Reddit’s r/antiwork is typically filled with horror stories that make you want to quit not just your own job but strangers’ jobs, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBXGqP"&gt;“My boss suggested I might not be able to take forty minutes to see my daughters [sic] first ever school play, so I told him try not to be a cartoon villain and he hung up on me,” reads one post from earlier this month. “That’s permission to take the whole afternoon off, right?” the post concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmqhU1"&gt;The underlying ethos of r/antiwork isn’t just to be a place to vent—it’s to push back on the idea of work as we know it. So it might seem counterintuitive that on Thursday, a thread blew up that was urging members to apply for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAIadk"&gt;The jobs in question are permanent positions at Kellogg’s cereal plants in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel’s Eternals is coming to Disney Plus on January 12th</title>
    <content type="html">

The January 12th date has been floating around the internet for a few weeks already, but today marks the official confirmation from Disney of the streaming release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NARAGx"&gt;The January release for &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is also perfectly placed for Disney to keep Marvel fans from canceling...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="zUoAPt"&gt;Though there have been attempts at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21374933/nubia-watch-hands-on-preview-flexible-oled-kickstarter-price"&gt;wraparound smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, the gadget category itself hasn’t really seen much design innovation for quite a while. Earlier this year, there was talk of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;a flat-edged Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, but those turned out to be mere rumors. While it’s unlikely we’ll see drastic change any time soon, it appears tech companies have been toying with the idea of watching videos and taking photos from the wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZLjY7"&gt;The latest example comes courtesy of &lt;a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/uploads/2021/12/samsung-rollable-smartwatch.pdf"&gt;a Samsung patent&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/wearables-smartwatches/samsung-rollable-watch/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LetsGoDigital&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/12/09/samsung-designs-smartwatch-with-rolling-display-and-centered-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peta Pixel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Originally filed in June with the World Intellectual Property Office (WIPO), the patent depicts a Galaxy Watch with a rollable screen and camera smack dab in the middle. The watch concept looks like an average round-faced watch, but...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;CEO Vishal Garg is reportedly taking time off from Better.com, the company he founded in 2012. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/215031211" target="_blank"&gt;Better.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wkWRnz"&gt;The CEO of digital mortgage firm &lt;a href="http://Better.com"&gt;Better.com&lt;/a&gt;, who fired 900 employees on a Zoom call last week, is taking time off from the company while it conducts a “leadership and cultural assessment,” according to an email to employees from the board of directors. As first &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmpab/better-ceo-taking-time-off-effective-immediately-email"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the board’s email says following “the very regrettable events over the last week,” CEO Vishal Garg will be taking time off “effective immediately,” and Better CFO Kevin Ryan will manage day-to-day operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIX3os"&gt;Better, which Garg founded in 2012, has been in the spotlight after he held a Zoom call with 900 employees on December 3rd to inform them they were losing their jobs. “If you’re on this call, you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off,”...&lt;/p&gt;
