    <title>Adobe Flash rides off into the sunset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Adobe Flash Logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rjBAkOFCA0b9huDqMyHcr2cMP5o=/0x23:600x423/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68603538/adobe-flash-logo.1419969978.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Adobe Flash Logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UIkf8V"&gt;Adobe scheduled to end support for its famous Flash on December 31st, 2020, and today is the day. While Adobe won’t start blocking Flash content until January 12th, major browsers will shut it all down tomorrow and Microsoft will block it in most versions of Windows. It’s over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8XGkk"&gt;Flash enjoyed huge cultural relevance and looms large in web history, which might be why its funeral procession has lasted for years. Browsers started showing Flash the door early in the last decade, and in 2015 Adobe asked developers to move on to HTML5. Things became official in 2017, when Adobe announced it would end support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtpoFm"&gt;While Adobe is finally (mercifully) letting Flash go, it will live on in many historical artifacts. The Internet Archive is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578616/internet-archive-preservation-flash-animations-games-adobe"&gt;preserving...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s fight to overthrow election now falls to the guy who invented the CueCat</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LEBe5D"&gt;In a hopeless attempt to overthrow an American election, a ridiculous cast of characters has heeded outgoing President Donald Trump’s call to misadventure — including, now, the inventor of one of the worst gadgets of all time. His name is Jovan Hutton Pulitzer, and yesterday he gave a poor imitation of a TED talk &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYVzbwL0eUA&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo"&gt;before the Georgia state senate&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that he has the ability to prove whether ballots from the 2020 election were real or fake. He introduced himself to a subcommittee of state senators as an “inventor and pattern recognition expert,” just before implying that he’s a titan even bigger than Apple and Google combined.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“I’m on approximately about 12 billion devices globally,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AirDVC"&gt;We’ll definitely grant that Pulitzer &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;h...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram has once again dropped the ball on a ‘top nine’ year in review feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aT093R-1SGpUQyCHIF0lMEk8cZE=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68602994/Untitled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dlWZMA"&gt;It’s New Year’s Eve, which means that your Instagram feed — if it’s anything like mine — is probably filled with people posting “&lt;a href="https://creatorkit.com/top-nine-best-of-2020/"&gt;top nine&lt;/a&gt;” grids of their most liked photos from this year. But, bafflingly, for yet another year, everyone will be turning to sketchy-looking third-party apps and sites to make them. Because once again, Instagram has failed to offer an official, automated way to curate the images within the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="En9JaQ"&gt;As someone who personally enjoys using the top nine format to look back on a year of baked good photos, I’m left utterly confused by this. Users seem to &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; putting together the collages to look back on their past year of posts. Instagram even already offered grid tools for posting photos to your story in different...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NLYmV0"&gt;If you just got a brand-new Android phone for the holidays, you probably want to play some games on your shiny device. Luckily, that’s especially easy to do this year with Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20878843/google-play-pass-bundles-350-android-games-and-apps-for-4-99-per-month"&gt;$5-per-month Google Play Pass&lt;/a&gt; games and apps subscription service, which offers free access to hundreds of games and apps without pushing ads or demanding in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KDPXZa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Google Play Pass","description":"$4.99 per month, one-month free trial","label":"Subscribe now","url":"https://play.google.com/about/play-pass/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Ce4XjQ"&gt;We’ve looked through what’s available on Play Pass, and the service has a lot of good games to check out. Here are just a few that we recommend. Since all of the games are also available individually — either free with ads and in-app purchases or for specific prices — we’ve included their Google Play links as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qjE3c0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/26/21026128/apple-arcade-best-games-iphone-ipad"&gt;This time last year&lt;/a&gt;, Apple Arcade was still a fledgling service, but one with a lot of potential. For $5 a month, you could get unlimited access to a big library of interesting games, the kind that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893691/apple-arcade-subscription-gaming-price-premium-games-zach-gage-noodlecake-snowman"&gt;no one really sells in the App Store anymore&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still not a place to find the latest blockbusters, but Arcade has steadily evolved into one of the best deals in gaming. Its lineup of games is varied and consistently surprising, with everything from family-friendly multiplayer games to engrossing puzzlers to weird story-driven adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We deserve The Muppet Great Gatsby</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The Muppets promotional still" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PFTr37hCLlfjXIDxDRJ0FSFliaw=/1x0:1020x679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68602419/themuppets.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T2qGaz"&gt;When the clock strikes midnight this New Year’s, &lt;a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2021/#fn1text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt; and other works copyrighted in 1925 will enter the public domain&lt;/a&gt;, becoming freely available for re-publication and — most importantly — puppet-themed adaptation. More than anything in 2021, I need the Muppet version of &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8JnPo"&gt;Picture this: Kermit in period-specific 1920s dress, playing the mysterious host to a huge party in West Egg. Or Miss Piggy, decked out in flapper regalia, in an abusive relationship with Fozzie Bear as her cruel, philandering husband, Tom Buchanan. There’s obvious aesthetic charms to The Muppets version of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s great American novel, but beyond that, &lt;em&gt;The Muppets’&lt;/em&gt; takes on classic stories are often better. Writers for &lt;a href="https://www.brightwalldarkroom.com/2019/12/20/a-grand-yuletide-theory-the-muppet-christmas-carol-is-the-best-adaptation-of-a-christmas-carol/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bright...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This maker built a working Batman grappling gun in only a year</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Built IRL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="13SPgQ"&gt;If you’ve ever watched a Batman movie or played &lt;em&gt;Just Cause&lt;/em&gt;, you’ve probably thought “wow, using a grappling hook would be so much fun.” YouTuber Built IRL, whose name is JT, thought so too — and he’s been working on making that happen for the past year. The end result is a grappling hook gun that functions pretty similarly to the ones we’ve seen in movies and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJzYG1"&gt;As you’ll see in the video above, this new grappling gun is more impressive than many previous attempts. For one thing, it’s self-contained — the entire unit fits on his arm, including the CO2-powered blasting mechanism that shoots the hook using standard cartridges, and a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; powerful 10,000W motor that’s properly fast and can completely pull him up into the air. (He shows...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ESPN Plus is raising its annual subscription price to $59.99 in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hu2w0C"&gt;The cost for an annual subscription for ESPN Plus subscribers will increase from $49.99 to $59.99 in 2021, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/espn-plus-ufc-price-increase-annual-subscription-1234876797/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. ESPN raised the monthly price of ESPN Plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308377/espn-plus-price-increase-date-streaming-disney-hulu-annual-membership"&gt;earlier this year to $5.99&lt;/a&gt;, and now the annual subscription is getting the same treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C04Tpy"&gt;New subscribers will start paying $59.99 on January 8th, 2021, and the new price will reportedly trickle down to existing subscribers a few months later in March. Disney had already announced that Disney Plus and the company’s bundle of Hulu, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus would each &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165869/disney-price-hike-united-states-bundle"&gt;cost $1 more starting in March 2021&lt;/a&gt;, raising those prices to $8.99 and $13.99, respectively. Streaming price hikes have been a theme of 2020; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;YouTube TV raised its price&lt;/a&gt;, Fubo followed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309678/fubo-tv-subscription-price-increase-cost-family-plan-standard-youtube-disney-warnermedia"&gt;not long after&lt;/a&gt;,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ticketmaster will pay $10 million for hacking rival ticket seller</title>

The company and its parent Live Nation admitted to hiring a former employee from rival ticket seller CrowdSurge, then using his knowledge — including old usernames and passwords — to learn CrowdSurge’s inner workings and “cut [the company] off at the knees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXDJVp"&gt;“Ticketmaster employees repeatedly — and illegally — accessed a competitor’s computers without authorization using stolen passwords to unlawfully collect business intelligence,” said acting US attorney Seth DuCharme. “Further, Ticketmaster’s employees brazenly held a division-wide ‘summit’ at which the stolen passwords were used to access the victim company’s computers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJR0S4"&gt;The hacking allegations were &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/songkick-live-nation-ticketmaster-hacking-1201989759/"&gt;r...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="KLSpKX"&gt;LG’s screen-swiveling Wing was one of the most interesting looking smartphones of 2020, but its unique design was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;held back&lt;/a&gt; by poor software support. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsupport%2Flg-wing-update%2F%3FAID%3D11365093%26SID%3D76086X1526367X31585b5296a3eb04e20a82fb2646967f%26vendorid%3DCJM%26PUBID%3D100036542%26cjevent%3Dfa23ec194ae411eb821b096f0a24060b%26cjdata%3DMXxOfDB8WXww&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F30%2F22206901%2Flg-wing-software-update-verizon-dual-screen-apps-media-controls#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A new software update&lt;/a&gt;, out today for the Verizon-exclusive device, looks to help address those issues by adding some new dual-screen functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xu6CK7"&gt;Specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2020/12/30/verizon-lg-wing-gets-big-update-to-take-advantage-of-its-double-screen-fun/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Droid Life&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the new update makes it much easier to send apps to and from the smaller display to the main one (a process that previously involved some convoluted menu wrangling.) With the new update, there’s now a “send” button that shuttle apps from one display to the other, along with a “restart” button to relaunch apps that transition over poorly. You can also use a third-finger gesture to accomplish a similar task....&lt;/p&gt;
