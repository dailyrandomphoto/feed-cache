    <title>Google will stop charging search providers for chance to be Android default in Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hmf_uk4O-EKkA4wdpaMhmT2DVq0=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426645/google_search_choice_screen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen will now show up to 12 providers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KLfT93"&gt;Google is changing how its Android search engine choice screen works in Europe, following complaints from rivals about its pay-to-play model, the company has &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/changes-android-choice-screen-europe/"&gt;announced in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The selection screen appears for users when they first set up an Android device, and is designed to offer a choice of search engines after Google was hit by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust"&gt;record $5 billion antitrust fine&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. From September, the search giant is making it free for search engines to be included, and is increasing the number of services that’ll be shown on the selection screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PdNnl"&gt;Currently, the selection screen includes a choice of just four search providers. One is Google, and the other three are chosen through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20751353/google-auction-android-search-choice-screen"&gt;sealed-bid auction process&lt;/a&gt;. Search providers each “state...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max update fixes the worst of its Apple TV woes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ShSffe4iCzq3nBcS3gixmzmCj4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426541/wjoel_200527_1777_hbomax_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uHisVp"&gt;HBO Max has updated its Apple TV app as it attempts to fix the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525177/hbo-max-apple-tv-broken-button-controls"&gt;myriad issues&lt;/a&gt; that have been plaguing the software since last week. The update &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/"&gt;fixes significant problems&lt;/a&gt; with basic features like fast-forwarding and rewinding, which had been introduced after the software switched away from using the native tvOS video player. The software update brings the native player back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boCiIG"&gt;“We just released an update to our Apple TV app, restoring the native tvOS video playback experience you know and love, with more improvements to come,” HBO Max &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402484711423975426"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Ensuring HBO Max viewers have a quality experience is our top priority and we missed the mark here.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Vivaldi browser now has mail, calendar, and an RSS reader built-in</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="USJQOa"&gt;Vivaldi users will now be able to check their email, calendar, and RSS feeds all through the browser’s built-in tools: &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/vivaldi-4-0/"&gt;the 4.0 release is launching today&lt;/a&gt;, and includes the Vivaldi Mail beta, which promises a more private alternative to web apps made by “Big Tech” companies. Even putting any potential privacy gains aside, Vivaldi is offering something that power users may want: an all-in-one app for browsing, emailing, and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mjoyu"&gt;The email client supports IMAP and POP accounts, so you can connect the vast majority of email services to it, and you can easily have messages open up in tabs rather than taking over the current window — handy if you’re the type who often needs to bounce between emails. The search is also, in my experience,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus to launch stripped-down Nord CE 5G this week</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OnePlus Nord CE 5G. | OnePlus via TechRadar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tUkr43"&gt;OnePlus is planning to announce a new budget smartphone called the Nord CE 5G this week. &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; has a render of the device &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/exclusive-oneplus-nord-ce-design-first-look-and-how-oneplus-designed-it"&gt;straight from OnePlus itself&lt;/a&gt;, showing that, well, it looks quite a lot like the original OnePlus Nord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkjv80"&gt;The CE 5G, however, will be a little cut back in terms of specs. OnePlus’ product head Oliver Zhang tells &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; that CE stands for “Core Edition” and refers to a design philosophy where the company had a goal of “distilling the product down to the most important things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUiITm"&gt;“You see mid-range phones on the market with very exaggerated specifications,” Zhang says. “We actively avoided some of those features and kept the things we felt would really make a difference to the daily smartphone experience, like fast...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s first folding Pixel is apparently still on track for a 2021 reveal</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6nxU1r"&gt;Google may have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22448165/google-samsung-wearable-partnership-wear-os-tizen-merge-smartwatch"&gt;shied away from a Pixel Watch&lt;/a&gt;, but a Pixel Fold still very much seems to be on the way — following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356760/foldable-google-pixel-q4-2021-leaked-internal-document-5-5a-4a-5g"&gt;a leak last August&lt;/a&gt; that revealed the company was planning to release its first folding Pixel phone in late 2021, Korean industry site &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; is now reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung will begin production of folding OLED panels this October for Google, Vivo and Xiaomi’s upcoming folding phones, all of which will reportedly be revealed late this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAfTpk"&gt;Google hasn’t exactly kept its folding phone ambitions a secret; in 2019, it published patent applications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266257/google-folding-bending-screen-display-patent"&gt;for its own folding screens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535863/google-pixel-foldable-phone-prototype-samsung-galaxy-fold-io-2019"&gt;admitted it had been prototyping them for quite some time&lt;/a&gt;, telling &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; that it didn’t have “a clear use case yet.” But now, it appears Google has a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max has been busted for days </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IMhD-qZm5Fgljs7YY1kaw_O9nPY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69425659/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0tRNJ"&gt;If you’ve attempted to stream something on HBO Max from an Apple TV sometime during the last several days, you may have noticed that its player controls are unusable. It’s not just you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqDmgf"&gt;Ongoing issues seem to be related to an &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hbo-max-stream-tv-movies/id971265422"&gt;app update&lt;/a&gt; that supposedly addressed “a few bugs lurking around” on June 5th. Since that update released, users &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1401730242775961600"&gt;have reported&lt;/a&gt; that basic playback functionality — such as fast-forwarding, rewinding, and pausing — is borked completely when you try to use the service on an Apple TV box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POJuAO"&gt;How an update this riddled with bugs rolled out to consumers remains unclear. Unfortunately, it’s also unclear when exactly they’re going to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l3P1rU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There’s legitimately no way to pause, rewind or fast forward on the HBO Max app no...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZW5kE"&gt;Today, let’s talk about one of Apple’s many announcements this week at its Worldwide Developer Conference, which some see as a possible threat to the rise of journalism distributed by email. If that sounds self-indulgent, given that it’s coming from a journalist who distributes his work via email, I apologize. But it touches on so many of the subjects of interest to us here — a tech giant’s ability to reshape markets to its liking; how journalism will navigate the platform era; what we mean when we talk about privacy — that I hope I can pique your interest at least a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xb0lpy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wnk4BD"&gt;Start with the announcement. On Monday at WWDC, Apple announced&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DIn%2520the%2520Mail%2520app%252C%2520Mail%2Cused%2520to%2520determine%2520their%2520location.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22525195%2Fapple-mail-protection-privacy-pixel-tracking-newsletters-substack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Mail Privacy Protection&lt;/a&gt;, which will limit the amount of data that people who send you emails can...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate approves billions for US semiconductor manufacturing</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="spHDan"&gt;After months of political jockeying and procedural hurdles, the Senate approved a massive science and technology bill Tuesday to boost US competitiveness with China. The bill invests billions into emerging technology industries like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and quantum computing in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrtDCD"&gt;The bill — titled the US Innovation and Competition Act or USICA — builds off a previous proposal from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called the &lt;a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/majority-leader-schumer-senator-young-and-representatives-khanna-and-gallagher-introduce-endless-frontier-act-with-12-bipartisan-senators-and-5-representatives-to-dramatically-increase-us-investment-and-leadership-in-science-and-tech-innovation-strengthen-economic-and-national-security-and-keep-the-us-strategically-competitive-with-china-and-other-countries"&gt;Endless Frontier Act&lt;/a&gt;. Endless Frontier was lauded as one of the first big bipartisan bills to come from the Biden administration. But over the last few months, the bill, which was seen as a must-pass piece of legislation for both parties, was bloated with political mush and much...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="elQ9Cv"&gt;Apple’s text selection &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-brings-back-the-magnifying-glass-for-accurate-text-selection/"&gt;magnifying glass has reappeared&lt;/a&gt; in the iOS 15 beta, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22524824%2Fapple-ios-15-iphone-text-selection-magnifying-glass-reversal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s own site&lt;/a&gt; confirms its return by listing it as a feature. Bringing the feature back is a reversal from when Apple made the decision to dump it in iOS 13, which is a bit of a rare occurrence: Apple doesn’t usually go back after it’s done away with something (bringing back scissor switches in its keyboards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;after years of butterfly switches&lt;/a&gt; is a notable exception). The return of the little pop-up is welcome, though: I can only speak for myself, but since iOS 13’s release, I’ve constantly been struggling without the helpful little magnifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YC5WA3"&gt;The new version of the text magnifier seems to be a bit smaller than the old one (in case you’ve forgotten what it...&lt;/p&gt;

The IRS hopes to use the data it collects to develop regulations for the fast-growing crypto industry — if it’s able to get the space’s biggest players to comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRkMp4"&gt;The organization made the request during the Senate Finance Committee’s hearing on the &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/the-irss-fiscal-year-2022-budget"&gt;IRS’s proposed Fiscal Year 2022 budget&lt;/a&gt;.
