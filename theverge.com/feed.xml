    <title>Elon Musk just showed how Clubhouse can succeed</title>

  &lt;p id="6txraP"&gt;Hey, did you hear &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/"&gt;Elon Musk went on Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4332o1"&gt;The media and venture capital worlds were abuzz this weekend in advance of, during, and after Musk’s appearance on the not-quite-year-old audio social network. Musk is not exactly a recluse — he gives interviews more or less regularly to a variety of mainstream outlets, and will sit down with NBC tomorrow — but his arrival on Clubhouse served as validation for the company and the idea of live, interactive audio streaming more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRFlgz"&gt;Despite beginning at 1AM ET on Monday, Musk’s room quickly hit the Clubhouse cap of 5,000 concurrent listeners — as did one overflow room hosting a broadcast of his appearance, and then &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; overflow room after that. All day long, hustlers and hucksters...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The writing’s on the wall for Google Stadia</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="E8M46y"&gt;After fourteen months, Google has decided it doesn’t want to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964386/google-stadia-pre-launch-editorial-cloud-gaming"&gt;a game company&lt;/a&gt; anymore. Where once it had its own cloud-based console, controller, and the promise of homegrown triple-A games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;it no longer wants to build its own games&lt;/a&gt; as of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIY1l0"&gt;And though a Google spokesperson emphasizes that the company continues to “remain committed to Stadia as a platform,” it’s looking increasingly likely that platform won’t be a service where you sign up with Google to buy and rent cloud games.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omavzt"&gt;Stadia boss Phil Harrison announced that Google was shutting down the company’s game studios in a memo today, and I think the exact wording of that memo is extremely telling. &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/focusing-on-stadias-future-as-a-platform-and-winding-down-sge/"&gt;Go read it for yourself&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPFDxz"&gt;Back? Good. Did you see the part about how...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="fQsPrY"&gt;Google has agreed to pay $2.5 million to more than 5,500 employees and job applicants impacted by alleged systematic pay and hiring discrimination. &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20210201"&gt;The US Department of Labor found&lt;/a&gt; that female software engineers were being underpaid. It also identified “hiring rate differences that disadvantaged female and Asian applicants” for Google engineering positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMdHBv"&gt;As part of &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OFCCP/foia/files/2021-01-15_Google_ERCA_PA_Redacted.pdf"&gt;the settlement&lt;/a&gt;, Google will hand over $1,353,052 in back pay and interest to 2,565 female engineers. It will also pay $1,232,000 in back pay and interest to 1,757 female engineering applicants and 1,219 Asian engineering applicants for “engineering positions not hired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyMWk9"&gt;The alleged disparities impacted employees at Google offices in Mountain View, Seattle, and Kirkland,...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgKD6z"&gt;It looks like we’ll be spoiled for choice when it comes to movies about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;WallStreetBets / GameStop saga&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; is reporting that both &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/mgm-ben-mezrichs-the-antisocial-network-wall-street-1234684378/"&gt;MGM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-screenwriter-mark-boal-noah-centineo-scott-galloway-makeready-1234684568/"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; have plans to make one, before the dust has even settled (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/someone-already-sold-the-movie-rights-to-an-unpublished-1846173930"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/1/22260573/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-wallstreetbets"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).

    <title>Robinhood plummets back down to a one-star rating on Google Play</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S9L3Nl"&gt;Investment app Robinhood has plummeted back down to a one-star rating on Google Play, thanks to a flood of thousands of new negative reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhbLzV"&gt;The latest low rating comes just days after Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;salvaged the app’s rating&lt;/a&gt; by removing nearly 100,000 reviews, following a flood of negative ratings after the Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;blocked purchases of popular stocks&lt;/a&gt; from Reddit’s /r/WallStreetBets like GameStop or AMC last week. Google confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time that it was actively removing negative reviews on the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RliLVA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google salvaged Robinhood’s one-star rating by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="E6itFZ"&gt;The review rollercoaster for Robinhood’s rating has been nearly as up-and-down as GameStop’s stock price.

  &lt;p id="jNSFJi"&gt;Stock trading app Robinhood is facing dozens of lawsuits after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;restricted several stocks&lt;/a&gt; popular on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. At least 30 parties across 10 states have sued the company in federal court, many seeking class action status. They allege that Robinhood users lost millions of dollars because they were unable to buy or sell stock during the freeze, and that the company chose to “manipulate the market” to help other financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w824Bt"&gt;Robinhood, which bills itself as a democratizing force in the stock market, helped facilitate an unprecedented boom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;around a handful of “meme stocks”&lt;/a&gt; last month. But on January 28th, it infuriated users by freezing trades on several of these stocks. That included GameStop...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oow6VM"&gt;Elon Musk’s SpaceX is planning to send its first “all-civilian” crew to space at the end of 2021 in a charity-focused mission commanded by tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman. The company said in a press release it’ll pick three people to ride alongside Isaacman to orbit aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CisNc"&gt;Isaacman, a trained pilot and the chief executive of Shift4 Payments, said he donated $100 million to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and wants to help raise $200 million more by inviting people to donate at least $10 to St. Jude for a chance to get picked. Three people will be chosen “to represent the mission pillars of leadership, hope, generosity and prosperity,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005905/en/World%E2%80%99s-First-All-Civilian-Mission-to-Space-Will-Usher-in-New-Era-of-Commercial-Space-Exploration"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; — though one person was already...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NYU researchers find no evidence of anti-conservative bias on social media</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZuAdEy"&gt;A new report finds that claims of anti-conservative bias on social media platforms are not only untrue but serve as a form of disinformation. The &lt;a href="https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/bias-report-release-page"&gt;report from NYU’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; says not only is there no empirical finding that social media companies systematically suppress conservatives, but even reports of anecdotal instances tend to fall apart under close scrutiny. And in an effort to appear unbiased, platforms actually bend over backward to try to appease conservative critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMtqBd"&gt;“The contention that social media as an industry censors conservatives is now, as we speak, becoming part of an even broader disinformation campaign from the right, that conservatives are being silenced all across American society,”...&lt;/p&gt;

He calls it the sPot. &lt;/p&gt;
