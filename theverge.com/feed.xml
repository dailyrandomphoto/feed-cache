    <title>Tesla delivers the first 25 Model S Plaid sedans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tOByZZhkKDdhrCf6BX62Yj4rXQk=/451x72:2692x1566/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69437984/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_10.47.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DxmNkb"&gt;A lucky 25 customers received Tesla’s redesigned Model S “Plaid” at an event hosted by CEO Elon Musk in Fremont, California on Thursday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZrJDH"&gt;The Silicon Valley automaker has billed this new $130,000 version of the Model S — first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;announced in January&lt;/a&gt; and originally slated to ship in March — as the “quickest production vehicle ever made,” with the ability to go from 0-60mph in under 2 seconds. Its name is a reference to the unthinkable speed beyond “Ludicrous” in the comedy classic &lt;em&gt;Spaceballs&lt;/em&gt;. It’s also expected to get around 390 miles of range. (Tesla is selling a less powerful version of the redesigned Model S with more range — 412 miles — that starts at just a hair under $80,000. Deliveries of those start later this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyejPR"&gt;Why so...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Frontier Communications is getting sued by record labels for not disconnecting pirates</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4BqURN"&gt;Frontier Communications, an ISP that serves around 3 million subscribers, has been sued by Warner, Sony, and Universal’s record labels for allegedly not taking action against its users who pirate music (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/record-labels-sue-another-isp-demanding-mass-disconnections-of-internet-users/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFUBGQ"&gt;The record labels &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.561609/gov.uscourts.nysd.561609.1.0.pdf"&gt;allege in their complaint&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) that not only did Frontier fail to disconnect people who repeatedly pirated, but it even encouraged them by advertising the ability to “download 10 songs in 3.5 seconds” and profited from the result. The labels also allege that Frontier ignored its subscribers’ piracy so it could keep collecting subscription fees, saying that the ISP valued profit over legal responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSzyeQ"&gt;Frontier denies wrongdoing, telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has terminated customers when copyright...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Trump administration forced Apple to secretly reveal at least two Democrats’ data</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fXiNUu"&gt;By now, you may have heard that Trump’s Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/us/trump-administration-phone-records-times-reporters.html"&gt;secretly seized the phone records&lt;/a&gt; of journalists working for &lt;em&gt;The New York Time&lt;/em&gt;s, &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, in the hopes of revealing their sources and stopping leaks to the press. But &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/us/politics/justice-department-leaks-trump-administration.html?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;is now reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Trump didn’t stop at journalists — in 2017 and 2018, it forced Apple to cough up metadata on at least two Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee, including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1403151148786278403"&gt;current chairman Adam Schiff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/10/politics/house-intelligence-committee-apple-data-trump-justice-department-doj/index.html"&gt;representative Eric Swalwell&lt;/a&gt;, and as many as a dozen people tied to that committee in total, including family members and at least one child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dDle2"&gt;Like the media outlets, Apple was under a gag order and unable to tell anyone until it expired this year — the only...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyfWR7"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, having helped pioneer the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of three unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney and Starz are in a slap fight over the launch of Star+</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRHm8UO7J3bRudSBnLOolIuYOnQ=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69437050/Disney.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fzm7vK"&gt;Disney is set to launch its standalone Star+ streaming service in Latin America in August, but Starz has filed complaints in Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina alleging Disney is infringing on its brand identity and that the soon-to-launch service will only confuse consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7gmVJ"&gt;In an English language translation of the complaints seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/starz-disney-copyright-suit-star-streaming-service-name-latin-america/"&gt;previously reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wrap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Starz argues that Disney’s “Star Plus” service — which will host content from Disney, FX, 20th Century Studios and National Geographic, as well as Star originals — sounds too phonetically similar to its own StarzPlay offering also available in the regions where it filed its complaints. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox’s Summer Game Fest event featuring more than 40 demos starts June 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z3SkyiTN6SI2ermjfznMD_k0nuw=/211x0:1350x759/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69436931/5bbcebe0_c405_46cb_bc6b_2eae469211ed.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hlRSw2"&gt;Microsoft is hosting another Summer Game Fest event to give you a chance to play demos of some unreleased Xbox Series X / S and Xbox One games. This year’s event is coming up soon, running from June 15th through June 21st, and there will be more than 40 demos to check out, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/06/10/our-second-summer-game-fest-demo-event-coming-june-15-to-an-xbox-near-you/"&gt;the company said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. While Microsoft hasn’t released the full list of games just yet, it has shared a few that you can look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dqBBO"&gt;One that I have my eye on is &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;, which looks like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17462494/sable-xbox-preview-moebius-zelda-e3-2018"&gt;a comic from Jean “Moebius” Giraud come to life&lt;/a&gt; and takes inspiration from &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. &lt;/em&gt;After years in development, &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; is set to release on September 23rd, and you can see some footage from it in this performance from Thursday’s Summer Game...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Japanese Breakfast did a Simlish cover for The Sims 4 because nonsense never gets old</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Intersect Music Festival" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gn_paGBT-yw5CYxmhwgLinTdFEM=/0x85:4677x3203/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69436625/1192724316.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xOv2Po"&gt;Have you even made it as an artist if you’re not singing in a made up language for a&lt;em&gt; Sims&lt;/em&gt; game? There’s a proud tradition of popular musicians like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9871786/carly-rae-jepsen-run-away-with-me-simlish"&gt;Carly Rae Jepsen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM6_ukhoK_g"&gt;Janelle Monáe&lt;/a&gt; re-recording songs in Simlish, the in-game language of &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt;, and now, celebrated alternative artist Japanese Breakfast (Michelle Zauner) is&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jbrekkie/status/1403009020961509377?s=20"&gt; joining their ranks&lt;/a&gt; with a cover of her single “Be Sweet” for &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4 Cottage Living&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09i67F"&gt;Zauner’s track is summer-y and eminently danceable, and it feels just the same underneath a trailer hawking more features for &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4, &lt;/em&gt;even with the chorus transformed to “Ya wana baleesh da voo ya wana baleeeeeeeeesh”. It’s also delightfully weird in the way all covers in “Simlish” are — I just love hearing famous musicians...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="P0NglS"&gt;Ulrich Kranz, a former BMW executive and the recently departed CEO and co-founder of EV startup Canoo, has been hired by Apple, the company has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Kranz will &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/apple-hires-former-bmw-executive-for-its-rebooted-car-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; work on the Silicon Valley behemoth’s electric car under Doug Field, the former Tesla executive who runs the day-to-day operations of the project, which is codenamed “Project Titan.” News of Kranz joining Apple was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/apple-hires-former-bmw-executive-for-its-rebooted-car-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOm0Rh"&gt;Kranz was one of the executives who helped launch BMW’s all-electric i3 hatchback and hybrid i8 sports car. Shortly after he left the German automaker at the end of 2016, he and fellow BMW executive Stefan Krause were tapped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;to help turn around struggling EV startup Faraday Future&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p id="D3aXUg"&gt;Last summer, former President Trump cast TikTok as the mascot for the US’s growing concerns over China when he signed a series of executive orders to erase the popular short video platform off app stores. It set off a wave of lawsuits keeping the orders from going into effect but left the door open for a future administration to take more serious action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dg9Yi9"&gt;That’s what President Joe Biden did Wednesday when he signed his own order revoking these Trump-era bans and beginning the process to set new rules for software tied to the Chinese government. Biden’s order laid out a fresh framework for identifying the actual national security risks posed by these apps — a stark contrast with the chaos spurred on by Trump’s individual bans.&lt;/p&gt;
