    <title>Amnesty International calls for Google to halt cloud business in Saudi Arabia</title>

  &lt;p id="A6JeUa"&gt;Amnesty International is teaming up with 38 other human rights groups and individuals &lt;a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/google-must-halt-plans-to-establish-cloud-region-in-saudi-arabia/"&gt;to call for a halt&lt;/a&gt; to Google’s plans to set up an enterprise cloud business in Saudi Arabia because of concerns over the country’s human rights track record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyVNx3"&gt;The joint statement — signed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Media Matters for Democracy, among others — calls for Google to end its plans in Saudi Arabia until the company conducts a public human rights assessment and makes it clear what kinds of government requests for data it won’t honor. Even more important, the letter writers state, is conducting that investigation in the open, actually consulting with the people Google could inadvertently help Saudi Arabia to hurt, and speaking to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>USB-C is about to go from 100W to 240W, enough to power beefier laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="usb-c" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xfPGJesdR1-knr-FiIU3Kq5eAxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342740/vlad-savov-computex-usb-c-2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tD3Vf4"&gt;Soon, the majority of portable PCs &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; need to be equipped with an ugly barrel jack and a proprietary power brick to charge. &lt;a href="https://usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-cable-and-connector-specification-revision-21"&gt;The USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) has just announced&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/usb-c-upgrade-delivers-a-whopping-240w-for-gaming-laptops-and-other-power-hungry-devices/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that it’s &lt;em&gt;more than doubling&lt;/em&gt; the amount of power you can send over a USB-C cable to 240 watts, which means you’ll eventually be able to plug in the same kind of multipurpose USB-C cable you currently use on lightweight laptops, tablets, and phones to charge all but the beefiest gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXBIkF"&gt;Previously, the USB-C Power Delivery spec tops out at 100 watts, and it’s definitely held the industry back a tad — for example, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20909422/dell-xps-15-7590-2019-review-oled-core-i9-specs-features-price"&gt;my own Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; can technically charge over USB-C, it needs 130W of power to charge and run at full bore simultaneously....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eero 6 and Pro 6 owners are now getting Apple’s HomeKit security features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Eero 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZRxpe6AmJTfRembxdj0gg1Nl6ZE=/0x0:1162x775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342649/eero6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Eero&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iaRHCK"&gt;Owners of Amazon’s Eero 6 and Pro 6 routers will now be able to isolate their HomeKit IoT devices from the rest of their home network and the wider internet, thanks to a new integration with Apple’s HomeKit that’s now rolling out (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/25/eero-6-routers-homekit-support/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new feature is coming as part of a firmware update, and makes the routers some of the first Wi-Fi 6 systems that support Apple’s integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGdrph"&gt;The added feature may be welcome, but it’s probably not a surprise for those who have been paying attention: Eero’s other, cheaper routers were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/2/26/21154531/amazon-eero-routers-apple-homekit-support-internet-connection-security"&gt;updated to support it in February, 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and an Eero Support account &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/jnyua3/got_new_eero_6_pro_no_homekit_support/"&gt;mentioned in November&lt;/a&gt; that the router was going through Apple’s certification process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdjsQQ"&gt;Setting up your Eero (or any other supported routers)...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hundreds of Amazon employees call for Jeff Bezos and Andy Jassy to support Palestine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MmzNnvHAcG5k0tu8EBNvT0TXa0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342425/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8bQtTD"&gt;More than 500 Amazon employees have signed an internal letter to Jeff Bezos and Andy Jassy calling for the company to acknowledge the plight of the Palestinian people. The move comes after Israeli airstrikes devastated Palestinians in Gaza, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-truce-between-israel-hamas-begins-mediated-by-egypt-2021-05-20/"&gt;leaving 248 people dead&lt;/a&gt;. Hamas and Israel have since agreed to a ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zCTFy"&gt;“We ask Amazon leadership to acknowledge the continued assault upon Palestinians’ basic human rights under an illegal occupation... without using language that implies a power symmetry or situational equivalency, which minimizes and misrepresents the disruption, destruction, and death that has disproportionately been inflicted upon the Palestinians in recent days and over several decades,” employees wrote. “Amazon employs...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jaguar I-Pace is Google’s first electric Street View car</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yo0Hgo"&gt;Google finally has its first all-electric vehicle for capturing Street View. The tech giant and Jaguar Land Rover announced today that they have collaborated to rig up an all-electric I-Pace SUV with the equipment required to capture Street View imagery, and deployed the car in Dublin, Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ii5hbB"&gt;The I-Pace will also collect more general Google Maps data, and it will be outfitted with air quality sensors from Aclima — something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/29/9067171/street-view-car-air-quality-detection-google-aclima"&gt;Google has done with its Street View cars for the better part of the last decade&lt;/a&gt;. The I-Pace will collect “street-by-street air quality” data in Dublin, measuring nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions, as well as fine particles. Google will make the data available to the Dublin City Council.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philo is the latest live TV streaming service to get a price hike</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ezTqVe"&gt;Philo has become the latest live TV option for cord-cutters hoping to skirt cable contracts to get a price bump — but there’s a workaround for current subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ja9dwm"&gt;Beginning June 8th, Philo’s monthly subscription cost for incoming customers will hike to $25 from $20. But those who are subscribed to the service before that date will be able to keep their plans at the current cost with no change, Philo CEO Andrew McCollum said in a Tuesday &lt;a href="https://blog.philo.com/posts/package-and-price-changes"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s blog. To offset the price increase, Philo will be increasing its unlimited DVR storage period to a full year, up from 30 days, and existing customers who’d like to upgrade their storage will be able to bump up to the new price tier if they so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QueStn"&gt;McCollum cited an...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA for US Congresspeople: Please do not enter your phone’s passcode on TV</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 looks great. The new design feels both modern and classic." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fIM4IFgjVzP_Qy-U19nbpKnIROA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341948/vpavic_4243_20201017_0088.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jn082c"&gt;Hello again, it has come to my attention that Republican Senator Ted Cruz and I are in perfect alignment on one issue: if you enter your iPhone passcode on live TV, you need to change the passcode. This means you &lt;em&gt;in particular&lt;/em&gt;, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEq677"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I recognize it’s happened before.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P7yehk"&gt;I honestly didn’t think anyone needed to explain this, particularly since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/10/11/17964848/kanye-west-iphone-passcode-trump-iplane-apple-meeting"&gt;Kanye West accidentally revealed his passcode&lt;/a&gt; (000000, in case you are curious) during a video with then-president Donald Trump in 2018. But here we are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rfd31R"&gt;If you are a member of the US federal government, you are a desirable target for all kinds of hackers, most of whom do not have your best interests at heart. Your phone stores a lot of sensitive data about where you...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon workers demand company quit polluting near communities of color</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qa8Zu1"&gt;Hundreds of Amazon tech workers are pressuring Amazon to quit polluting — especially in  communities near its warehouses. More than 600 workers signed a &lt;a href="https://secure.everyaction.com/Xsul4-F6BUuVi_MofTP5YA2"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; asking Amazon to bring its pollution down to zero by 2030. They also called on the company to prioritize deploying zero-emissions technologies near the communities hit hardest by Amazon’s pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJCvMJ"&gt;The petition was started after Amazon rejected a shareholder resolution asking the company to report how much pollution it emits in communities of color. Amazon says the proposal was similar to a resolution that was voted down by shareholders last year. Amazon’s annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for May 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCVx00"&gt;Amazon’s warehouses have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611862/satellite-images-online-shopping-growing-footprint-warehouses"&gt;mushroomed&lt;/a&gt; around working-class communities...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government decides pipeline cybersecurity ought to be regulated</title>

  &lt;p id="NgPfut"&gt;The hack of the Colonial Pipeline — which kneecapped oil availability on the East Coast for almost two weeks — was as disastrous as it was likely preventable. A branch of the Department of Homeland Security, however, is hoping to correct course by changing the rules on cybersecurity and disclosure for Colonial and other companies in the pipeline industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmsd94"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/25/colonial-hack-pipeline-dhs-cybersecurity/"&gt;As reported b&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Transportation Security Administration (yes, the same sub-branch of DHS everyone associates with taking their shoes off in airports) will be requiring pipeline companies to report breaches and other cybersecurity incidents, with additional rules on how to keep these critical infrastructure systems secure from digital threats arriving “in coming...&lt;/p&gt;
