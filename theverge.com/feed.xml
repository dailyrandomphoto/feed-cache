    <title>EPA issues new rule to curb tailpipe pollution, fight climate change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="California Sues EPA Over Ruling Blocking State Emissions Law" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYh0O7HUUFbBD-9UGomhlTEBxHk=/0x1:3501x2335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297558/78713689.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rOcLny"&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency issued a new rule today aimed at reducing tailpipe pollution from cars and light-duty trucks — an effort by President Joe Biden to return to the fuel economy standards put in place by Barack Obama nearly a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ciEaP"&gt;Under the rule, passenger vehicles would be required to achieve an average of 55 miles of travel per gallon of gasoline (mpg) by 2026 — slightly over Obama’s goal of 54 mpg, but a major increase over the 38-mpg rule put in place by President Donald Trump. The EPA estimates the new standard would prevent the release of 3.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide through 2050 and will save car owners $420 billion in fuel costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBUutA"&gt;EPA Administrator Michael Regan called it “the most ambitious vehicle...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb tightens ‘anti-party’ rules for rentals as New Year’s Eve approaches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Airbnb logo displayed on a smartphone " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qfvjXQJFxCfEF3YTWZwXndpM-jg=/79x0:3465x2257/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297544/1234731223.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Airbnb is cracking down on New Year’s Eve parties | Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3et0AT"&gt;Airbnb said Monday it’s tightening &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-plan-to-crack-down-on-new-years-eve-parties/"&gt;its policy&lt;/a&gt; restrictions on New Year’s Eve parties, adding “anti-party” restrictions to some three-night rentals for guests without a history of positive reviews on the platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gvh41"&gt;In the US, Canada, Brazil, the UK, France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand, guests without a history of positive reviews on Airbnb’s platform can’t make one-night, two-night, and now three-night reservations for an entire house that “may pose heightened risks for unauthorized parties.” Airbnb said it would be focusing on local reservations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgAxfk"&gt;Guests on the platform who have a history of positive reviews from Airbnb hosts won’t be subject to the restrictions, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G62zlJ"&gt;Airbnb &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948759/airbnb-brian-chesky-bans-party-houses-halloween-orinda-california-shooting"&gt;banned “party houses”&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 following a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waze now shows EV charging stations on its driving map</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qzby3xsF3v-Yqia1UaKUYuaYL7s=/70x0:651x387/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297462/waze_ev_charging_station_search.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Waze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TghYKB"&gt;Waze can finally help you locate and drive to nearby electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across the US, letting you find EV pit stops just as easily as you would a gas station. You can also search for charging stations along your route, which should make it a bit less stressful to find a place to juice up your EV if Waze is your preferred navigation app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Waze&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BG8ziE"&gt;Waze is partnering with Volkswagen for the initiative. As part of the campaign, you can switch your car icon within the app to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22302883/vw-id4-review-volkswagen-ev-specs-range-photos-video"&gt;Volkswagen’s all-electric ID 4 SUV&lt;/a&gt; (in case you’re tired of polluting the virtual air in your cartoon smiley face on wheels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTiR6Y"&gt;This may give the Google-owned navigation app the boost it needs to catch up with its more...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford Mustang Mach-E joins New York City’s yellow taxi fleet</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5idw25"&gt;The Ford Mustang Mach-E is hitting the streets of New York City as the latest electric vehicle to join the ranks of the city’s iconic yellow taxi fleet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOWlft"&gt;The Mustang Mach-E, with its fresh coat of Rally Yellow paint and classic taxi iconography, is being operated by Gravity, a startup focused on EV fleets and charging infrastructure. This is the first time that Ford’s new, mass-market EV is being deployed as a taxi. But it won’t be the last — Gravity says it hopes to eventually operate a fleet of 50 electric vehicles comprised of both Mustang Mach-Es and Tesla Model Ys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQaK86"&gt;“I think the Mustang and the Model Y are kind of like the ideal taxi vehicles that are available today,” Moshe Cohen, founder and CEO of Gravity, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod Mini is $20 off today at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r9Nnw2"&gt;Apple’s short, stout HomePod Mini usually costs $99.99, but Best Buy is offering a $20 discount today on the smart speaker. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgfi5O0cHlY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can snag one for $79.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is the retailer’s lowest price yet, in addition to one of the best deals we’ve seen for it. If you’re in Apple’s ecosystem of products, there aren’t many other choices for buying a smart speaker that’s fully compatible with the Siri voice assistant, or HomeKit, for commanding certain smart home tech via the speaker. Still, it’s a great speaker that offers good sound quality for its size, and unlike the discontinued HomePod, this one’s compact enough to fit almost anywhere near a wall outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqN51s"&gt;This deal is available on most of Apple’s vibrant colorways for the HomePod Mini, including...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taco Bell had beef with Beyond Meat’s fake carne asada</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2hUjQZ"&gt;Taco Bell, the restaurant known for having ground beef that's utterly indescribable, reportedly told Beyond Meat that its version of carne asada wasn’t good enough to serve. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/taco-bell-abandoned-plan-to-test-beyond-meat-s-carne-asada?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the chain canceled a test product that featured Beyond’s plant-based steak after samples failed to live up to its standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiMfHU"&gt;Beyond Meat denies the report — Shira Zackai, head of communications at the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that “the test between Beyond Meat and Taco Bell was not canceled. Our partnership is strong, and we are actively working together to create a plant-based protein that’s completely new to the national QSR (quick serve restaurant) space. We look forward to sharing more details on what Beyond Meat and Taco Bell...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sen. Warren and Rep. AOC demand answers from Amazon after warehouse deaths</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Six people were killed when an Amazon warehouse in Illinois was struck by a tornado&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L9HN3w"&gt;A group of progressive Democratic lawmakers, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Reps. Cori Bush and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is demanding answers from Amazon after six people were killed in a tornado strike at one of its warehouses in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxRpyq"&gt;A letter sent Monday to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and founder Jeff Bezos says the events that happened on December 10th at the Edwardsville facility “fit a larger pattern: Amazon puts worker safety at risk in everyday situations and emergencies alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dO9Ugc"&gt;“As we work to ensure that tragedies such as this one are not repeated, we seek answers about what happened at your Edwardsville warehouse,” the letter continues, “and whether your policies may have contributed to this tragedy.”&lt;/p&gt;
