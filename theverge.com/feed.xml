    <title>How to use Google’s budget feature on Android so you don’t overspend</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qnCBiu"&gt;Google has provided a budgeting feature in its Play Store that allows Android users to establish a monthly maximum they want to spend on digital content. This applies to apps, games, movies, TV shows, music, ebooks, and so on. As you get close to reaching your budget limit, you’ll see an alert that you’re nearing it — or have gone over the amount you specified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrHNS5"&gt;You access it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qpmLYU"&gt;Open the Play Store on your Android device, tap on your personal icon on the upper right side, and select “Payments &amp;amp; subscriptions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ibqrH5"&gt;From there, select “Budget &amp;amp; history.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BTRG2W"&gt;You’ll see the amount you spent during the current month. Choose the “Set budget” option and enter the amount you’re comfortable spending on your apps, music, movies, TV shows, and...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Volvo announces plans to go public in bid to accelerate shift to electric cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fRGTR7LndinbJDayzQ5PJ4MSbro=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948413/ahawkins_201221_4352_6471.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LNSCwN"&gt;Volvo, the Swedish luxury car maker owned by China’s Geely, &lt;a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/287174/volvo-cars-announces-its-intention-to-launch-an-initial-public-offering-and-list-on-nasdaq-stockholm"&gt;announced its plan&lt;/a&gt; for an initial public offering as it seeks to raise more cash to accelerate its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308851/volvo-electric-cars-only-2030-online-sales"&gt;transition to a fully electric car company.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir54Rk"&gt;The announcement follows the news last week that Polestar, the electric car company that is a joint venture between Volvo and Geely, would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696139/polestar-spac-public-value-ev-startup-volvo-geely"&gt;going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. That deal values Polestar at roughly $20 billion, despite selling only two models — a hybrid luxury coupe and an all-electric fastback sedan. Volvo is choosing a more traditional route by proceeding with an IPO in Stockholm that could value the company at upwards of $25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Deb6LN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Volvo said it aims to raise about 25...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>A surgically implanted brain stimulation device could help treat severe depression</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Deus Ex Brain" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qjmQVNESA4pogOKATHRzS9lwfSo=/0x2:640x429/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948357/Deus_Ex_brain.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WtvAn7"&gt;Sarah had no options left. Over five years, she’d tried every possible treatment for her severe depression, and nothing had helped. “My daily life had become so restricted and impoverished by depression that I felt tortured by each day,” the 36-year-old said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Yy6Nj"&gt;But after undergoing an experimental procedure that implanted a device into her brain, she felt her depression lift for the first time in years. “It was like my lens on the world changed,” Sarah, who is remaining anonymous because of the stigma around depression, said during a press briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBaWGC"&gt;Sarah was the patient in a proof-of-concept trial of a new approach to treating severe, treatment-resistant depression, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01480-w"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. The findings open up...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Music will launch free background listening starting in Canada</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s4Gq5M"&gt;YouTube Music is lifting one of its most annoying limitations — but only in Canada. Today, YouTube announced that beginning November 3rd, customers in Canada will be able to continue listening to their music in the background while doing other tasks on their phone or when the screen is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RS57Pp"&gt;Background listening will support both the standard ad-supported, personalized radio mixes and any uploaded content you’ve added to your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmqOhT"&gt;This is the first time that YouTube Music has offered the feature without requiring that customers step up to a Premium subscription to get it. As for when listeners in other countries can expect to get the same convenience, for now, YouTube is only saying to “stay tuned for additional information and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some must-have Nintendo Switch games are $20 off at several retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlBczm"&gt;This is a big week for the Nintendo Switch. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview"&gt;Switch with an OLED screen and &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; launch Friday, October 8th. Whether you’re a Switch veteran, or you’re prepping for your first console with the $350 OLED model, there are some excellent deals on must-have, cartridge-based titles you should know about. &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; are each $20 off. Amazon is the only retailer honoring this deal for all three games, but Best Buy and Walmart are hosting some deals, too. &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; is $20 off, but only at GameStop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KSEqI"&gt;All of these are noteworthy deals because they’re rarely discounted games. Nintendo sometimes hosts price cuts, but only for a select batch of games —...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin is officially sending William Shatner to space</title>

  &lt;p id="to6ga4"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight venture &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/shatner-powers-announced-ns18"&gt;Blue Origin is launching William Shatner&lt;/a&gt; — aka Captain James T. Kirk of the USS Enterprise — to space on the company’s New Shepard rocket. At 90 years old, he’ll become the oldest person to fly to space, surpassing legendary aviator Wally Funk, who flew on the first crewed flight of New Shepard this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCuLy0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/09/24/william-shatner-going-space-jeff-bezos-blue-origin/"&gt;TMZ first broke the news&lt;/a&gt; that Shatner would be flying on the next New Shepard flight, which is currently scheduled for October 12th out of Blue Origin’s launch facility in West Texas. The outlet claimed the Shatner’s flight will be filmed as part of a documentary. Shatner will be joined by two other customers announced earlier by Blue Origin: Chris Boshuizen, a former NASA engineer who co-founded the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 7 launches October 15th, preorders begin on Friday</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="DEXMH2"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-watch-series-7-orders-start-friday-october-8/"&gt;is opening up preorders&lt;/a&gt; for its Apple Watch Series 7 on Friday, October 8th, with the devices set to ship on October 15th. Apple first revealed the Watch Series 7 at an event last month, but the company simply said it would be available later this fall. Preorders for the Apple Watch Series 7 will now begin at 5AM PT / 8AM ET on Friday, October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U4rsJI"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 includes a display&lt;/a&gt; that goes virtually to the edge of the case, with more rounded corners and a softer design. The Series 7 now comes in 41mm and 45mm sizes, up 1mm from the Series 6. The bezels around the display are just 1.7mm, and the always-on mode is 70 percent brighter than the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the 2021 League of Legends World Championship</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5fUFRE"&gt;The 2021 &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;World Championship (aka Worlds) kicks off tomorrow, October 5th, marking the beginning of a month-long tournament where 22 of the best &lt;em&gt;League of Legends teams&lt;/em&gt; will face off to take home the Summoner’s Cup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7r2Fmy"&gt;While Worlds is one of the biggest esports competitions on the planet, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; isn’t exactly the easiest game to start watching. This time of year is one of the best times to jump in, though, as you get to see the best teams at their peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJQSxf"&gt;If you want to learn more about the game — or are a longtime fan who just wants to know more about Worlds before it starts — we’ve put together this primer for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tIA5YU"&gt;What is Worlds?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RoNnGJ"&gt;Worlds is the concluding tournament in the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; esports year. Teams...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJJcYY"&gt;A Steller’s sea eagle named Kodiak &lt;a href="https://www.aviary.org/birds-habitats/kodiak-the-stellers-sea-eagle/"&gt;escaped from its enclosure&lt;/a&gt; at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh on September 25th, and thanks to the valiant efforts of the Aviary staff, was found and brought back to the Aviary on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nAW7V"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.aviary.org/birds-habitats/kodiak-the-stellers-sea-eagle/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; posted to the Aviary website at 8:15PM Sunday, a team of the Aviary’s animal care experts spotted Kodiak — Kody to his friends— in a suburb of Pittsburgh north of the Aviary. The Aviary team used “professional falconry techniques and equipment” to retrieve the bird and bring him home to the Aviary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTe0Vx"&gt;Kody is a bird that would be difficult to miss: he’s large (although in Pittsburgh we probably wouldn’t call him “giant” because “Giant Eagle” is a grocery store chain here), with a yellow beak,...&lt;/p&gt;
