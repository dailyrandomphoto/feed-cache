    <title>The team behind indie adventure Minit returns with a side-scrolling racing game</title>

  &lt;p id="Qj2xHF"&gt;The indie gem &lt;em&gt;Minit&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/7/17207310/minit-indie-game-review-die-every-60-seconds-love-letter-classic-gaming"&gt;released back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, felt like a breath of fresh air. The monochromatic adventure game took a seemingly absurd time constraint — killing the player every 60 seconds — and turned it into both a passionate love letter to top-down classics like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda &lt;/em&gt;and an ingenious and clever quest that threw constant surprises at the player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xteSAm"&gt;Now, the core team behind &lt;em&gt;Minit — Nuclear Throne &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Disc Room &lt;/em&gt;developer Jan Willem Nijman, designer Kitty Calis, composer Jukio Kallio, and artist Dominik Johann&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;are back with a new spinoff title, &lt;em&gt;Minit Fun Racer. &lt;/em&gt;The game takes the same core idea and applies it to a side-scrolling biking game reminiscent of arcade titles of decades past. All proceeds of the game, which is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tracking down mystery boats on the high seas  </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Tracking down mystery boats on the high seas  " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/23Aewejvca1Uyln0lC_aP0k96_s=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68835882/Thumb_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M5SEST"&gt;Out on the high seas, more than 200 miles from shore, seafood companies can operate with almost no oversight. These are ungoverned, international waters where it’s easier for companies to get away with overfishing and abuses like modern-day slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcP1vY"&gt;Scientists using new hacks for old technology are slowly changing that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYjADs"&gt;Two decades ago, large vessels began carrying a little box that connects to what’s called the maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS). It sends out a radio signal with information about the ship, like an identifying number, and its size, course, and speed. That’s supposed to help ships avoid running into each other. It also helps authorities see where vessels are when they’re close to shore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5C4di"&gt;After the 9/11...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bravely Default is a classic RPG series designed for lapsed fans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cwamv0YKNVNUA4_XsdTe2rLv-Yk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68835901/Switch_BRAVELYDEFAULTII_screen_01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IgAb6j"&gt;When Masashi Takahashi, a producer at Square Enix, started working on &lt;em&gt;Bravely Default&lt;/em&gt;, he had a very specific audience in mind. Takahashi had grown up playing classic turn-based roleplaying games — he distinctly remembers watching his older brother play &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy III&lt;/em&gt; while he was still in kindergarten — and felt that many modern RPGs had become too complex, leaving older players behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4c6QHl"&gt;“They seem kind of impenetrable,” he says of modern games. “I thought if I could make a game that was able to make [older players] recall things they liked about games when they were younger, and create a game for that type of audience, that was one thing that spurred me forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMP1Gh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/6/5383040/bravely-default-nintendo-3ds-review"&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;Bravely Default&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; launched on the Nintendo 3DS in 2014, and it...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Spinning’ is trademarked, and Peloton isn’t happy about it</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jx4gUe"&gt;Peloton is fighting to have the terms “spin” and “spinning” treated as generic terms, arguing that they’ve entered into common usage in spite of being trademarked since the late 90s, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/peloton-dominates-home-spinning-but-rival-won-t-let-it-say-so?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. This week it &lt;a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92076463&amp;amp;pty=CAN&amp;amp;eno=1"&gt;filed petitions&lt;/a&gt; with the US Patent and Trademark Office’s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to try and cancel both trademarks owned by Mad Dogg Athletics, arguing that “spin class and spin bike are part of the fitness lexicon” and that they’re “generic terms to describe a type of exercise bike and associated in-studio class.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rixrua"&gt;Mad Dogg had earlier filed a lawsuit against Peloton, alleging that its products infringe upon its exercise bike patents. While the lawsuit doesn’t make claims on trademarks, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; characterizes...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will add a new label to some climate change posts in the UK</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q7LmGN"&gt;Facebook will start labeling posts about climate change with a banner that directs people to its information page on climate change. It’s the company’s latest effort to weed out lies and myths about the climate crisis, and it follows criticism from lawmakers and scientists concerned that the social media giant allowed false information to proliferate on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHrY84"&gt;For now, the labels will only appear on Facebook posts in the UK. But the company plans to start rolling them out elsewhere “soon,” it said in an announcement on Thursday. Facebook debuted its “Climate Science Information Center” in the US, Germany, the UK, and France back in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437208/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-greenhouse-gas-pledge"&gt;September&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Facebook is also expanding that page to include new information debunking common...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House now says 100 companies hit by SolarWinds hack, but more may be impacted</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cC4u7v"&gt;The US government has released updated figures on the number of companies and federal agencies it believes were impacted by the recent SolarWinds hack. “As of today, 9 federal agencies and about 100 private sector companies were compromised,” Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/02/17/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-and-deputy-national-security-advisor-for-cyber-and-emerging-technology-anne-neuberger-february-17-2021/"&gt;said in a briefing&lt;/a&gt;, though she declined to name specific organizations. Although the hack was “likely of Russian origin,” Neuberger said the hackers launched their attack from inside the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgsB19"&gt;The latest figures revealed are lower than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;250 federal agencies and businesses&lt;/a&gt; that were previously reported to have been infected, though Neuberger cautioned that the investigation is still in its “beginning stages” and that “additional compromises” may be...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s next major Windows 10 update focuses on improving remote work</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FMJvOO"&gt;The next major update to Windows 10, version 21H1, will be delivered in the first half of 2021 and focuses on improving remote work scenarios. Microsoft traditionally delivers two major Windows updates per year, with most of the bigger features dropping in the spring and a smaller update in the fall. While IT admins are used to this approach, Microsoft appears to be reversing this cadence for 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIuFIh"&gt;“Windows 10, version 21H1 will have a scoped set of features improving security, remote access and quality,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/02/17/introducing-the-next-feature-update-to-windows-10-version-21h1/"&gt;explains John Cable&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s head of Windows Servicing and Delivery. “The features we are releasing in this update are focused on the core experiences that customers have told us they’re relying on most right now.” These...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei Mate X2 teaser hints at new folding screen design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Opn_LzVdsY-ozdAuEUQo8VEKXec=/0x0:1035x690/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68835165/matex2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wb4L6R"&gt;Huawei has posted another teaser for its upcoming Mate X2 folding phone &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1839167003/K2tgLpqKW?from=page_1006061839167003_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;type=comment#_rnd1613632260891"&gt;on Weibo&lt;/a&gt;, offering the strongest hint yet that it’ll move away from the original Mate X’s design. The first Mate X, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238269/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-price-release-date-specs-mwc-2019"&gt;announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;refreshed in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, had a single large screen that folded in half so that the display was on the outside of the device. The follow-up phone, however, looks like it’ll fold the other way, more like Samsung’s Galaxy Folds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvXmab"&gt;Making reference to a new design for the Mate X2, the teaser image shows the phone from the side open at an angle, with a glow on the inside of the hinge. The picture is also a reference to the timing of the event, which will take place at 8PM China time (7AM ET) on February 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mMWdo"&gt;Here’s the full teaser image:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s One UI 3.1 update brings some S21 camera features to last year’s flagships</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X3yWys"&gt;Samsung has announced that its &lt;a href="https://smsng.news/2ZmI4EW"&gt;latest One UI 3.1 software update&lt;/a&gt; is rolling out to some of its older phones. The update will trickle down some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21 lineup’s&lt;/a&gt; newer software features to last year’s Samsung flagships, including the Galaxy S20, Galaxy Note 20, Galaxy Z Fold 2 and Galaxy Z Flip phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZRYHR"&gt;Most of the new features are focused on bringing some of the software enhancements that Samsung debuted for the camera on the S21 lineup back down to its older devices.
