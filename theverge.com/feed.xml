    <title>How to watch the 2021 Grammys online</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mscfxT"&gt;The 63rd Grammy Awards ceremony will be held Sunday March 14th, as awards show season continues apace despite the coronavirus pandemic. The show will honor the best music of 2020 and all the performers, producers, and behind-the-scenes people who made it happen. As with most of this year’s awards shows, the Grammys look a bit different this year, broadcasting from “in and around” the Los Angeles Convention Center, but without a live audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Es6DgX"&gt;As is usually the case with awards ceremonies, there’s some controversy around this year’s Grammys. The Weeknd, whose song &lt;em&gt;Blinding Lights&lt;/em&gt; topped music charts around the world in 2020, received zero nominations — the consensus seems to be it had something to do with the anonymous expert committees...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pi Day is here and Google’s calculator will test how well you know the mathematical constant</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="pi, cc J.Gabás Esteban" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5XJ9u51IFUplRBd-P8QJ8JXote0=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68963486/8476624791_ac7a5a8357_b.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CA2ThF"&gt;It’s Pi Day, the nerdiest of holidays because it’s all about a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter (yes, sometimes writing majors do pay attention in geometry class). March 14th has become known as Pi Day because it’s written numerically as 3.14 and pi starts at 3.14 ... and goes on indefinitely. Irrational number, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOsRDR"&gt;In case you’ve forgotten the digits of pi, Google is celebrating (marking? observing? idk, choose the term that feels right to you) the day with an Easter egg game hidden in its calculator (also: TIL Google will bring up a calculator if you search for “calculator”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2b6Q73"&gt;The pi symbol in the upper left corner of the calculator should have some twinkling stars around...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games teases Fortnite appearance by Brazilian soccer star Neymar </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-LIFESTYLE-GAMES-COURT-APPLE-FORTNITE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oNLBvINFfvuuza5EDfSZmX2ypOM=/204x0:5333x3419/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68963353/1228049811.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by CHRIS DELMAS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DIyQTy"&gt;Epic Games and Brazilian soccer player Neymar are teasing a likely appearance by the star athlete in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on March 16th, with clues coming via a couple of tweets. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-03-13-it-looks-like-neymar-is-coming-to-fortnite"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt; the news, including a video tweeted from the Epic Games account showing Neymar’s No. 10 jersey. Neymar &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neymarjr/status/1370797692406874117?s=20"&gt;retweeted the video&lt;/a&gt; with the “eyes” emoji— not exactly confirmation, but another clue that something is brewing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qo6uDA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;He’s given everything to the Order... and for what? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.16.2021. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FortniteSeason6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FortniteSeason6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/vP0tZytkaU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vP0tZytkaU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1370751505733722116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i2mJXo"&gt;So details about how exactly Neymar might appear in Fortnite are still scarce, but as &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/neymar-fortnite-teaser-222544175.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, it’s coming at the same time the &lt;a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/fortnite-zero-crisis-finale-event-teaser/"&gt;Zero Crisis Finale&lt;/a&gt; single-player mission—...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oman blocks Clubhouse for not having a permit, but activists suggest it may be censorship</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9h0BVP"&gt;The middle eastern country of Oman has blocked the Clubhouse voice chat app saying it lacked the proper permit to operate, as some activists raised concerns that it was an act of censorship, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oman-clubhouse/oman-blocks-audio-app-clubhouse-citing-lack-of-permit-but-some-fear-censorship-idUSKBN2B607V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3S34sY"&gt;The Omani Telecommunications Regulatory Authority &lt;a href="https://wafoman.com/2021/03/14/oman-bans-clubhouse/?lang=en"&gt;told news site WAF&lt;/a&gt; that communications applications operating in the country must get a permit from the authority. According to WAF, Oman “prohibits the use of several encrypted VoIP applications without an official license.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rymfBs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ochroman.org/eng/category/updates/"&gt;The Omani Association for Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement that Oman’s government views “the authoritarian government of China as a role model,” and has banned the app even though it’s used by many Omanis “as a space to express their opinions freely without...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Free streaming platform Tubi reportedly getting into original programming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLe56r"&gt;Free streaming platform Tubi has plans to branch out into original programming, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-13/fox-s-tubi-made-millions-with-reruns-now-it-wants-original-programming?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources familiar with the company’s plans. The streamer will likely start with original movies, but is also exploring episodic TV shows, and is speaking with potential advertisers about partnerships, the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xpiz8q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184294/fox-tubi-acquisition-streaming-wars-news-sports-xumi-comcast-pluto-viacomcbs"&gt;Fox Corp. acquired Tubi for $440 million&lt;/a&gt; last March, in an attempt to get in on the streaming wars. Before the acquisition, Fox didn’t have its own streaming offering. Fox said at the time it planned to offer a large number of its older shows and movies to Tubi subscribers for free, as well as some sports programming. There was no talk at that time of Tubi creating original content to try to compete with the likes of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge rules Google has to face lawsuit that claims it tracks users even in Incognito mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XNNOGb"&gt;A judge in California ruled Friday that Google has to face a class action lawsuit that claims the search giant secretly collects data from  users even when they’re using its private “Incognito” mode, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-13/google-must-face-suit-over-snooping-on-incognito-browsing?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUaFgd"&gt;Three users &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-privacy-lawsuit/google-is-sued-in-u-s-for-tracking-users-private-internet-browsing-idUSKBN23933H"&gt;filed a complaint last June&lt;/a&gt; alleging Google has a “pervasive data tracking business,” and its tracking persists even if users take steps to protect their private information, such as using incognito mode in Chrome, or private browsing in Safari and other browsers. The lawsuit seeks at least $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3aH3m"&gt;Google had sought to have the case thrown out, but US District Judge Lucy Koh wrote in her ruling that the company “did not notify users that Google engages in the alleged data collection while the user is in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this drone video that will really make you miss movie theaters</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mTWZf2"&gt;Last week everyone was fixated on the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321576/fpv-drone-footage-short-film-bowling-alley-bryant-lake-bowl"&gt;Right Up Our Alley&lt;/a&gt;” drone video that made us all nostalgic for bowling alleys. On Friday night, a VP at drone company DJI &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dronelaws/status/1370550353922506754"&gt;tweeted this video&lt;/a&gt; of a drone flight through a mostly-empty movie theater in Minnesota, and I don’t know about you but I really miss going to the movies. This video makes that longing about 100 times worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GJTc9F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOLEe0"&gt;According to its YouTube page the video is by SkyCandy, and is a one-take fly-through of Mann theaters’ Plymouth Grand in Plymouth, Minnesota. It was filmed using a DJI Air Unit and Rotor Riot Cinewhoop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KBzEc"&gt;The video is just over a minute long, but the drone takes us through the lobby — after being welcomed through the front doors by a masked theater employee— where people are...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla reportedly had 450 cases of coronavirus at its California plant after reopening last May</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hHuoMYhs0BUTxVTk1zWpQvRhfnc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68960784/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RhCGB7"&gt;After it reopened in defiance of health department orders last May, Tesla’s plant in Fremont, California saw 450 cases of COVID-19 through December 2020, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlainSite/status/1370549174731608064?s=20"&gt;new data&lt;/a&gt; from legal website PlainSite shows (via &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/12/hundreds-covid-cases-reported-tesla-plant-following-musks-defiant-reopening-county-data-shows/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1LISs"&gt;Last March public health officials in Alameda County, where the Fremont plant is located, restricted all but “essential” businesses from remaining open as coronavirus cases surged across the country. Tesla fought the order but eventually shut down the plant on March 23rd. But a few days later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254871/tesla-fremont-shutdown-factory-production-model-3-y-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla restarted production&lt;/a&gt; at the Fremont plant, even though it was in violation of the public health order. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter at the time that he planned to be on the factory floor with Fremont workers and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21255149/elon-musk-tesla-fremont-factory-reopen-order-arrest-alameda"&gt;t...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge blocks US restrictions against Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Pl6iD"&gt;A federal judge has blocked the US Department of Defense from placing restrictions on Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi that were set to take effect next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqfzOu"&gt;Just before former President Trump left office in January, the DoD &lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2472464/dod-releases-list-of-additional-companies-in-accordance-with-section-1237-of-fy/"&gt;designated Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt; as a “Chinese Communist military company,” (CCMC) making it subject to Trump’s executive order banning the US from investing in such companies. But late Friday, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22367849/xiaomi_v_us_dept_of_defense.pdf"&gt;issued a preliminary injunction&lt;/a&gt; to prevent what he called “irreparable harm” to Xiaomi, saying the designation was “arbitrary and capricious.” &lt;/p&gt;
