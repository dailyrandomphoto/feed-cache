    <title>Microsoft Teams launches for friends and family with free all-day video calling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nkHMn2"&gt;Microsoft is launching the personal version of Microsoft Teams today. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298766/microsoft-teams-personal-launch-preview-accounts"&gt;previewing the service&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, Microsoft Teams is now available for free personal use amongst friends and families. The service itself is almost identical to the Microsoft Teams that businesses use, and it will allow people to chat, video call, and share calendars, locations, and files easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXixZQ"&gt;Microsoft is also continuing to offer everyone free 24-hour video calls that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21579076/microsoft-teams-free-video-calling-web-zoom-competition"&gt;introduced in the preview version&lt;/a&gt; in November. You’ll be able to meet up with up to 300 people in video calls that can last for 24 hours. Microsoft will eventually enforce limits of 60 minutes for group calls of up to 100 people after the pandemic, but keep 24 hours for 1:1 calls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Twitch is lowering subscription prices — but says streamers will earn more money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a3t2lTOVOT4HT950rHqBVP2-l64=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298026/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EfzRyU"&gt;Twitch is announcing a big change to subscription prices — but not for users in the US. Most countries outside of the US will be getting lower prices that will be localized to their specific country, starting with Turkey and Mexico on May 20th. Those lower prices will mean less money for streamers, but Twitch believes they’ll translate to more subscribers and higher earnings in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PoD0J"&gt;Right now, the most affordable Twitch subscription, which lets fans pay streamers and get perks like custom emotes, currently costs $4.99, a price that is currently translated into local currencies around the world. That translated price can be prohibitively expensive to some Twitch users, however, Mike Minton, Twitch’s VP of monetization, told &lt;em&gt;The...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another report claims Samsung will ditch Tizen for Wear OS with next smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KyyIibgvawlbLIXaCAlbeSLLhs0=/467x0:5498x3354/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297955/dseifert_200811_4139_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CVFizi"&gt;Samsung seems ready to ditch its own Tizen operating system in favor of Google’s Wear OS for its upcoming smartwatches, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-galaxy-watch-4-feature-wear-os-confirmed/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company reportedly has as many as three smartwatches on the way soon, including one with a rotating bezel, and two others with sportier designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTGNC4"&gt;Although Samsung’s smartwatches are often recommended as the best options for Android phone users, the company has opted for its own Tizen operating system over Google’s Wear OS. But rumors of the company’s upcoming switch to Wear OS have been circulating for a couple of months now. Back in February, leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1362697174694301700"&gt;IceUniverse said its new watch&lt;/a&gt; would make the switch from Tizen, and in March, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-android-wear-os/#update1:~:text=Merlot,-%E2%80%9D%20device"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on mentions of “WearOS”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ‘Charlie bit my finger’ video is being auctioned as an NFT — then deleted ‘forever’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-wH4ZMr-zXS9tRpyMcoKRLOO2pM=/52x0:457x270/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297806/hqdefault.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbpNKC"&gt;The creators of the classic “Charlie bit my finger - again !” video are now auctioning it off as an NFT, but with a twist. At the end of the auction, which will begin on May 22nd, the original video will be deleted from YouTube forever, according to a press release, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBlgSz8sSM"&gt;where it currently has over 880 million views&lt;/a&gt;. The auction will kick off on the video’s 14th anniversary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="sfahRo"&gt;Since NFTs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;exploded onto the cultural landscape&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, we’ve seen plenty of early-to-mid 2000s memes being sold on the blockchain, with many of them fetching higher prices than I would’ve ever have imagined. A non-exhaustive list includes:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="zlmLDs"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/warnermedia_discovery.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; this morning it’s spinning off its media business WarnerMedia and merging it with TV company Discovery, creating a major new player in the media world to compete with firms like Netflix and Disney that are leading the charge in streaming content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vU3vZH"&gt;The deal will bring a lot of familiar names in the TV and film world under one roof. WarnerMedia owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and the Warner Bros. movie studio, which is responsible for such huge franchises as &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt;. Discovery operates numerous cable networks, including HGTV, Animal Planet, Food Network, and TLC. Both companies also have their own streaming platforms: HBO Max and Discovery Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7ZIN8"&gt;The boards of both AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery have approved...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>That’s no moon: veteran Apple designer unveils $1,799 Cell Alpha speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S_bRJ21C7WAVca9KUhQQ3v94mbs=/159x0:2180x1347/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297677/DiningRoom_000792_desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cell Alpha.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Syng&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lFPfmf"&gt;Christopher Stringer, an ex-Apple designer who worked on everything from the HomePod to the original iPhone during his 22 year-stint at the company, has unveiled his new startup’s debut speaker. It’s called the &lt;a href="https://syngspace.com/"&gt;Cell Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, a futuristic Death Star-shaped connected speaker with an emphasis on spatial audio. It costs $1,799, or $1,969 if you want the model with a floorstanding base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6qdbJ"&gt;The Cell Alpha has woofers on its top and bottom arranged into a “force-balanced” configuration. These are paired with three mid-range drivers that are distributed around its equator, where they’re presumably joined by a small thermal exhaust port — the Cell Alpha’s only known weakness. Jokes aside, Stringer’s company Syng claims this three-driver configuration...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple teases major Music announcement as lossless streaming rumors mount</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/114Qih1BN4Gm7ubZptERHIF8OQU=/1x0:1111x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297485/msedge_ebejRVkHMS.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MjXNwG"&gt;Apple is teasing a major Apple Music announcement. “Get ready,” a post in the service’s Browse tab reads, “music is about to change forever.” Tapping the image reveals an animated video, though it just consists of the music streaming service’s logo spinning in place. The teaser, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/16/apple-music-about-to-change-forever/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;first reported by MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is believed to refer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;Apple Music’s rumored lossless and hi-res music streaming&lt;/a&gt; features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpuSpB"&gt;A launch of the new higher quality streaming is believed to be imminent after code referencing “Lossless” and “Hi Res Lossless” streaming tiers appeared in the service’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/16/lossless-audio-references-found-in-apple-music-web-app-as-company-teases-special-announcement/"&gt;web apps&lt;/a&gt;. According to code in the Android app, the lossless tier will support music streaming at 24-bit/48Hz (a small step up from regular CD-quality...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sharp’s new flagship phone has a giant 1-inch camera sensor and Leica branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tr6IWS0pnW4PQD5469hI0pVApoo=/0x0:2090x1393/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297483/sharp.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dP3AC6"&gt;It appears that Leica has found a new mobile camera partner, following Huawei’s sanctions-induced retreat from the international smartphone market. Sharp just announced the &lt;a href="https://jp.sharp/k-tai/aquos-r6/"&gt;Aquos R6&lt;/a&gt; in Japan, and its Leica-branded lens sits in front of what is now the largest camera sensor on any phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxTt8t"&gt;The 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor is similar in specs to what you’d find in Sony’s high-end RX100 compact cameras. It’s only the second 1-inch sensor ever to make its way into a smartphone, and the first to make its way into a phone from an traditional phone manufacturer — Panasonic released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6151671/panasonic-leica-cm1-android-cameraphone"&gt;Android-powered CM1 back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t exactly a mainstream device. The closest any current phone gets to a 1-inch sensor is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Xiaomi’s new Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, which...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy director’s Paralympics RPG is launching next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U9sddg"&gt;The first project from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/em&gt; director Hajime Tabata’s new studio JP Games will finally be released next month, the company has announced. &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; is a mobile RPG themed around the Paralympic Games, and it’s the first video game ever to carry the official Paralympics license. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18307399/pegasus-dream-tour-paralympics-game-hajime-tabata-2020"&gt;initially announced&lt;/a&gt; more than two years ago, but the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and there’d been radio silence on the project ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
