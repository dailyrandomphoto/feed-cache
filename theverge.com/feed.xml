  &lt;p id="8UMJyH"&gt;If you’re into gaming, you’ll want to know that Nintendo is hosting a 50-minute live stream today that it calls Nintendo Direct, and the company will focus on games coming to the Switch in 2021. This is the first time the company has hosted a full-fledged Nintendo Direct live stream &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20850031/nintendo-direct-switch-seven-biggest-announcements-news-super-smash-snes-overwatch"&gt;since September 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZlig5"&gt;Nintendo already confirmed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1361676737730519042"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that it would be announcing information on &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,&lt;/em&gt; but it did not offer any hints, though there’s a good chance we’ll be hearing about a new character for &lt;a href="https://smashbros.nintendo.com/buy/dlc/"&gt;the game’s second Fighter Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, the live stream will focus on games coming to Nintendo Switch “in the first half of 2021,” leaving fans to speculate what could be shown during the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Shorts beta will launch in the United States in March </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L7CncZ"&gt;YouTube is gearing up to launch a beta version of its TikTok competitor, Shorts, in the United States beginning in March, chief product officer Neal Mohan announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k379Nl"&gt;In a blog post announcing a number of features coming to YouTube in the coming months, Mohan said the YouTube team will be giving more creators access to Shorts in the United States. The YouTube team has seen success with Shorts in India, where the feature has existed for several months, according to Mohan. Since December, “the number of Indian channels using Shorts creation tools has more than tripled, and the YouTube Shorts player is now receiving more than 3.5 billion daily views globally,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No Man’s Sky update lets you adopt wild animals as pets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xvqh7WvfBD7HjKNfGjeSDyfyUzw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829784/No_Man_s_Sky_Companions_Screenshot_5.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zSbe9A"&gt;Hello Games is adding companion animals to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21450755/no-mans-sky-origin-expansion-hello-games-sean-murray-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the developer announced a new update that allows players to tame wild creatures, bond with them, and even breed them. “They will travel side-by-side with you as you adventure through the universe both as a friend and as a valuable aide on your voyage,” Hello Games said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W62TJU"&gt;Once tamed, you can feed, play with, and explore with your companions; a “neural harness” transmits their thoughts directly to the player’s communication channels. “Creature personalities are defined by their species and ecosystem, such that no two creatures are alike, and their personalities develop further as you deepen your bond with them,” the developer said. It’s also worth noting that running into other...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV is adding offline downloads and 4K streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DUF6Z24ux9IWeD5uXSDuh8SuNT4=/216x0:2490x1516/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829749/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_8.23.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T7n1Je"&gt;If the monthly price for all of these streaming TV services is going to keep going up, the least they can do is throw in some new features and better video quality, right? That’s what YouTube says you can soon expect from YouTube TV; today, the company announced that in the coming weeks, the service will “introduce a new add-on package with 4K streaming, offline viewing, and unlimited concurrent streams at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntVz5p"&gt;Unfortunately, a YouTube TV spokesperson didn’t have much else to share beyond the top-level news of these upcoming additions. It’s not clear whether there will be any limits on what channels or shows support offline downloads, nor is YouTube giving any examples of what content will be available in 4K. One would hope for some...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Maps will now let you pay for public transportation and parking through its app</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVU5XP"&gt;Google Maps is adding a couple of new useful features: the ability to pay for parking or buy a train ticket right from the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apqmkg"&gt;Google Maps is integrating two mobile parking payment services into its app, &lt;a href="https://www.passportparking.com/"&gt;Passport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parkmobile.io/"&gt;ParkMobile&lt;/a&gt;. Both offer the ability to find, pay for, and replenish parking meters or parking lot fees through a smartphone app. Now, those features will also be available in Google Maps. According to the company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mHL2h7"&gt;Simply tap on the “Pay for Parking” button that appears as you near your destination. Then enter your meter number, the amount of time you want to park for, and tap “Pay.” Need to add more time to your meter? Easily extend your parking session with just a few taps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VNaQuZ"&gt;The ability to pay for parking in Google Maps...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon won’t build this Alexa cuckoo clock unless it hits a preorder goal</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ZGaQq"&gt;Amazon is launching a new consumer outreach program it’s calling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/BuildIt?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Build It&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is a safer spin on a familiar crowdfunding idea: if enough people preorder something, Amazon will produce it. And if not, it won’t. The company is starting with three Alexa-powered gadgets: a cuckoo clock, a thermal sticky note printer, and a smart scale that can provide details on the food you’re weighing via a separate Echo device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgLgWB"&gt;All three “concepts” are going up for preorder today as part of Amazon’s program for creating experimental hardware. It has already made some devices it doesn’t consider mainstream yet — like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;Echo Frames&lt;/a&gt; — under the Day 1 Editions branding. Built It is a subset, designed for gadgets that won’t even be released without...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos confirms March 9th product launch, hints at smaller portable speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIgRg5nUduOR7-D_twQNzeM0g_E=/0x7:1776x1191/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829722/sonosedit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bs1l6q"&gt;Sonos will announce its next new product on March 9th, the company confirmed today. The invite for the launch shows a person out in a field — strongly hinting that the device will be portable. My guess is it’s something that would fit in that shoulder bag. A recent Federal Communications Commission filing from Sonos revealed that it’s preparing to release what looks like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22269050/sonos-fcc-filing-mini-move-portable-bluetooth-speaker"&gt;a smaller battery-powered speaker&lt;/a&gt;. Documents show the device to use Bluetooth and have a wireless charging stand much like the existing Sonos Move, which sells for $399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeTy7n"&gt;Sonos is also developing a pair of premium noise-canceling headphones, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286147/sonos-headphones-new-design-german-patent-office"&gt;made another appearance&lt;/a&gt; at the German Patent and Trademark Office. It looks like the design is almost final, and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texas’ natural gas production just froze under pressure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Winter Storm Uri Brings Ice And Snow Across Widespread Parts Of The Nation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krJXMn8bIJuCEPc9kH-WKKeA1vg=/198x0:4602x2936/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829697/1231205567.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pike Electric service trucks line up after a snowstorm on February 16th, 2021, in Fort Worth, Texas. Winter storm Uri has brought historic cold weather and power outages to Texas as storms have swept across 26 states with a mix of freezing temperatures and precipitation.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Ron Jenkins / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7RpdWU"&gt;Natural gas wells and pipes ill-equipped for cold weather are a big reason why millions of Texans lost power during frigid temperatures this week. As temperatures dropped to record lows across some parts of the state, liquid inside wells, pipes, and valves froze solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jHuVH"&gt;Ice can block gas flow, clogging pipes. It’s a phenomenon called a “freeze-off” that disrupts gas production across the US every winter. But freeze-offs can have outsized effects in Texas, as we’ve seen this week. The state is a huge natural gas producer — and it doesn’t usually have to deal with such cold weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ph2i6P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Texas relies on natural gas more than any other fuel for its electricity generation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zlnXfC"&gt;“When we think about what’s been going on in the last week and why it’s...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="OWPiaY"&gt;Twitter has rolled out support for voice direct messages on iOS and Android in India starting today, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIndia/status/1361900922465644544"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/twitter-begins-testing-voice-dms-india-brazil-japan?utm_source=ac_tw&amp;amp;utm_medium=tw_card&amp;amp;utm_content=99269&amp;amp;utm_campaign=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the audio messages are now available in three countries worldwide: India, Brazil, and Japan. Plans for voice DMs were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452932/twitter-voice-audio-direct-messages-test-brazil"&gt;first announced last year&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter says the feature, which it’s calling an “experiment,” will roll out in India in phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGMx9D"&gt;In a statement, Twitter India’s managing director, Manish Maheshwari, said voice messages are designed to “give people a new way to express themselves and help them connect through the nuances, emotion, and empathy built by hearing someone’s voice.” Similar features are already available on other services like Messenger, Instagram DMs, and...&lt;/p&gt;

Just recently, password manager LastPass announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;drastically limiting the usefulness of its free app&lt;/a&gt;, and now, Google has sent out emails reaffirming that it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;ending its free unlimited photo storage policy&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
