    <title>The best Black Friday deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting the LG C1 OLED TV won’t be cheap, but it’s among the best options out there.&lt;/em&gt; | LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmhxDE"&gt;4K TVs of all sizes and specs see price cuts several times throughout the year, but the time when we usually see the highest concentration of stellar deals is right now, as Black Friday hits and Cyber Monday is just around the bend. You’ve ended up in the right place if you’re looking for a TV deal, and yes, that includes people interested in a TV that has every bell or whistle, with the highest contrast ratio and the right features to eke all of the visual splendor from PCs and the latest gaming consoles or something that’s quite the opposite. We’ll be highlighting affordable TVs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGhjh8"&gt;Our team at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is hard at work on compiling the best Black Friday deals, running the gamut of retailers participating, as well as breaking it down...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals on true wireless earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLBEwG"&gt;One of the most sought-after gifts every holiday — at least, ever since Apple removed the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone — has been true wireless earbuds. They are often the favored listening device of many people because they offer the most convenience, and they’re a product category that frequently goes on sale. Full-size headphones offer superior sound, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796131/black-friday-headphones-2021-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;those have their fair share&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday discounts&lt;/a&gt; to be had, but most casual listeners often prefer earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2rBqw"&gt;Here, we have rounded up all the best Black Friday deals we can find on wireless earbuds from Apple, Samsung, Bose, Jabra, Beats, and even Google, as well as a couple of lesser-known brands. Each has its own unique qualities or value proposition to offer, and we...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals for iPhones this year? Read on to find out.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXFrPb"&gt;Need a new phone? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are a great time to be shopping for a phone for yourself or as a gift to your nearest and dearest this holiday season. This is the time of year when retailers and carriers are dropping their best deals, whether it’s to make room for next year’s models or to sign up new cellular customers. Android users can cash in on a number of excellent deals from the likes of Samsung, Google, OnePlus, and Motorola; however, Apple is notoriously stingy when it comes to iPhone discounts. You might get a gift card or a pair of AirPods when buying an iPhone, or a carrier might offer a higher trade-in value for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22684911/iphone-13-true-cost-of-free-phone-iphone-13-pro"&gt;“free” iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPtDSg"&gt;Here are all the best Black Friday phone deals we’ve found so far. If possible, we...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new A03 and A03 Core look like big bargains but we can’t quite tell yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EyhN7xDJsWS_BikbqX1GQu59JA=/0x27:650x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70195939/samsung_galaxy_ao03_core.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A03 Core has a 6.5-inch display. | Photo by Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v6gbQA"&gt;Samsung has quietly added two new devices to its entry-level A-series lineup: the Galaxy A03 and Galaxy A03 Core. And while both devices don’t yet have a set price, we can predict that they’ll both be pretty affordable, considering how Samsung prices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;the rest of its A-series devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A03 has a dual rear camera with a 48MP main sensor.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KhODGa"&gt;An infographic posted on &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/infographic-the-galaxy-a03-is-upgrading-core-mobile-features-to-make-your-day-to-day-more-convenient"&gt;Samsung’s site&lt;/a&gt; outlines the A03’s specs (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/26/samsung-quietly-launches-galaxy-a03-w-48mp-camera-5000mah-battery-more/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The device comes with a dual rear camera with a 48MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, which helps the camera focus on the main subject of the photo rather than giving you a different ultrawide or zoomed in perspective. Meanwhile, the front of the device comes...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In Animal Crossing, holiday shopping is ‘Nook Friday,’ not Black Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of Nook’s Cranny with sale signs on its windows." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qdh0yicyvMYw9qw3UkI9FhTxiYE=/120x0:1200x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70195765/IMG_3235.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GsOjLS"&gt;Today through November 30th (next Tuesday), some of our favorite virtual shopkeepers are having a “Nook Friday” sale in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/animal-crossing-nook-friday-dates-discount-new-horizons-8007"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you’ve been drawn back in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765536/animal-crossing-new-horizons-2-0-update"&gt;by the game’s recent update&lt;/a&gt;, it could be a chance to save 30 percent on items for your island or on in-game gifts — I’m currently trying to decide whether my wife would rather have a virtual train set, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-TOA-28-Compact-AirFryer-Toaster/dp/B07WLSQPM5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a real-life air fryer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Slw9Lh"&gt;In the spirit of the holidays, you could also pick up some virtual presents for friends, particularly if Timmy and Tommy stock items you know would fit &lt;em&gt;perfectly &lt;/em&gt;in their kitchen (a room they may actually use now thanks to the new cooking mechanic). You can check out our sister site &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/22749492/send-letters-presents-gifts-best-friends-wrapping-paper"&gt;full guide to mailing gifts...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals on cameras and lenses </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oXH12Ee5aR1W8qYLN8CQLnp-lfg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70188516/akrales_190117_3163_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CTXPBN"&gt;Cameras and lenses can be a tricky thing to shop for around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. They are no small investment, though if you’re shopping for that lucky someone — or for yourself — there are some deals to be had that can save you a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cd0NVO"&gt;We have vetted and rounded up the most notable deals from the major camera manufacturers, focusing on the latest mirrorless systems. It’s hard to justify spending big money on a new DSLR in 2021, as it may be better to look to the secondhand market for those older systems. Another hard truth is that some camera manufacturers have been plagued by the chip shortages on the latest models, and the deals on tap show that — many of the deeper discounts are on slightly older cameras, and some newer releases...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday laptop deals 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmgfRt-2sXFIcBDHMsslkFiVs1k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183676/vpavic_052011_4016_0042.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="5aO9CW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are often thought of as times to stock up on smaller investments on the cheap, like headphones, games, and other gadgets you may not have wanted to pay full price for. But it’s also a great time to save on big-ticket items, like that laptop you’ve maybe had your eye on. The shopping holidays have brought some seriously good discounts on laptops, whether you’re keen on sticking with Mac, or you want a Windows PC. Both often come in very slim designs, but for people who don’t mind a heavier laptop, we’ve included some gaming laptop picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UADRPQ"&gt;The kinds of deals you can get on laptops vary depending on the retailer, so that’s how we’ve split up the deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Iw3jHO"&gt;Razer is offering a $300 gift card to its online store &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fshop%2Fpc%2Fgaming-laptops%3Fquery%3D%3Anewest%3Acategory%3Asystem-laptops%3Asystem-display%3A15%252Binch%3Asystem-graphics%3AGeForce%252BRTX%252B3060%3Asystem-graphics%3AGeForce%252BRTX%252B3070%3Asystem-graphics%3AGeForce%252BRTX%252B3080&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeBFCMLaptopdeals11232021"&gt;when...&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5KTAD"&gt;Whether you’re overdue for a new pair or are just trying to cancel out the usual onslaught of holiday music, Black Friday season is a great time to invest in some noise-canceling headphones. You’ll find significant discounts on many of our favorite headphones featured in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;noise-canceling headphones buying guide&lt;/a&gt;. These include picks from Sony, Bose, Apple, Sennheiser, and others. In some cases, these deals will save you $100 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKhJxM"&gt;Aside from the steep discounts, another good thing about buying headphones during the holidays is the extended return period at many retailers. That gives you plenty of time to try out your new cans and make sure the sound quality, ANC, comfort, and other factors are all to your liking before you’re stuck...&lt;/p&gt;
