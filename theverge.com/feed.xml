    <title>Harley-Davidson’s custom electric chopper is up for auction, and I must have it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-RUDh6ACTV9B0alApgXQy2n7Q48=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699414/MOSH_CHOP_Left_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2A6oEm"&gt;Serial 1, the electric bike company that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536726/harley-davidson-serial-1-electric-bike-ebike-specs-price"&gt;spun out from Harley-Davidson last year&lt;/a&gt;, is making one-of-a-kind, custom-built e-bikes and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.serial1.com%2Fproduct%2Fmosh-chopper%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616558%2Fharley-davidson-seral-1-electric-chopper-auction-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;auctioning them off online&lt;/a&gt;. The first one is the Schwinn Sting-Ray-inspired Mosh/Chopper, which the company describes as a “psychedelic, hand-painted banana seater,” and oh boy do I want it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBZvq7"&gt;Unfortunately, my chances are slim to none. First of all, Serial 1 is only making, well, one of these. The Mosh/Chopper is the first product from the company’s new 1-OFF series, in which it’s custom designing, building, and releasing single-edition (i.e. runs of just one) e-bikes throughout the year and auctioning them off online. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft brings xCloud to Windows PCs with the Xbox app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GvJkA9NX53iLifyFpVGGKp-EVU=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699406/xcloudwindowsxboxapp.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SrHdvc"&gt;Microsoft is bringing xCloud to Windows PCs through its Xbox app today. Xbox Insiders will be able to access a new updated Xbox app with Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) built in. Much like how xCloud works through the web, you’ll just need a compatible controller connected via Bluetooth or USB to access Xbox games from a Windows 10 PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHA5Xy"&gt;The updated Xbox app will include a new “cloud games” section, with access to all of the same games available on xCloud on the web. “We’ve also added some new features to help you get started, including easy-to-access information on controller and network status, social features to stay connected with friends, and the ability to invite people – even those also playing on cloud without the game installed – to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung billionaire heir Jay Y. Lee gets parole, will be released from prison Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Azun60"&gt;Samsung vice chairman Lee Jae-yong —known in the West as Jay Y. Lee— will be released from prison Friday after South Korea’s justice ministry granted him parole, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3857903c-ed62-4203-8c32-eba0340b2bee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. The billionaire heir to the Samsung empire, Lee, 53, had served six months of a 30-month prison sentence for offering bribes to South Korea’s former president Park Geun-hye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN5iDH"&gt;Lee was first sent to prison in 2017 in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/9/14867124/samsung-bribery-corruption-trial-chairman-lee-jae-yong"&gt;succession scandal&lt;/a&gt; that led to Park’s removal. He was accused of offering payments and horses as bribes to a friend of the former president to try to garner support for his succession at Samsung. Lee served just one year of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/25/16201360/samsung-lee-jae-yong-guilty"&gt;five-year sentence&lt;/a&gt; before a retrial was &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-29/south-korea-orders-retrial-of-samsung-s-lee-in-bribery-scandal?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;ordered in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. He was ordered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/18/22236716/samsung-lee-jae-yong-prison-bribery-ruling"&gt;back to prison in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vodafone latest UK carrier to reintroduce roaming charges in Europe after Brexit</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZNzbEa"&gt;Vodafone has announced it will &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vodafone.co.uk%2Froamingupdate22&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616543%2Fvodafone-europe-roaming-charges-price-tariff-brexit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reintroduce roaming charges&lt;/a&gt; in Europe for UK mobile customers from January next year. It’s the latest UK carrier to reintroduce the fees after the country’s departure from the European Union, and it follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548668/ee-uk-carrier-roaming-charges-european-union"&gt;similar U-turn from EE&lt;/a&gt; in June. All major carriers in the country &lt;a href="https://www.cityam.com/major-uk-mobile-networks-vow-not-reintroduce-roaming-charges/"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; they had no plans to introduce roaming fees in Europe after the Brexit vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glGRZq"&gt;The fees will apply to any Vodafone customers who sign up to or change their contract from August 11th, 2021, with the fees applying from January 6th, 2022. Costs are dependent on the specific plan, but most customers will pay £2 ($2.77) a day to use their UK allowance of calls, texts, and data in Europe, or £1 a day if access is bought in eight-...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lAaqy9"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a sale on last year’s iPad Pro now that the new models have been released, today is perhaps your day. Best Buy is taking $200 off all configurations of the 2020 iPad Pro, including both 11- and 12.9-inch sizes and cellular-equipped models. Not all of the configurations are in stock everywhere, but popular options like the 256GB Wi-Fi versions of the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748602930599677783#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11-inch&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748602966449170221#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch&lt;/a&gt; are available as of the time of publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3yBDL"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro features Apple’s A12Z processor, a 120Hz display, quad speakers, and a dual rear camera system with lidar. It’s compatible with the second-generation Apple Pencil, Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro, and Smart Keyboard folio for iPad Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Samsung’s August Unpacked event</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WleRDN"&gt;The next Galaxy Unpacked event is fast approaching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;on August 11th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT&lt;/a&gt; — but you might’ve already seen what Samsung has lined up, thanks to a copious amount of leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNoWn8"&gt;Samsung is expected to announce new additions to its high-end line of folding Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip phones. Based on leaks, both the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 seem more like refinements to Samsung’s existing designs with the newest specs. The new Fold and Flip should come with new color options and, in the case of the Flip, a reworked outside screen and camera housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9j18tO"&gt;Now that Samsung and Google have revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;their smartwatch partnership with Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like Samsung might also launch two of the first smartwatches to run it. Leaks seem to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve is working with AMD to make the Steam Deck Windows 11-ready</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8vC3yB"&gt;Valve is aiming to make its Steam Deck handheld gaming PC ready for Windows 11. While we’ve known for weeks that the Steam Deck &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578879/valve-steam-deck-handheld-pc-windows-support"&gt;can run Windows&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t clear how well this would be supported by Valve, or whether an option for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;Trusted Platform Modules (TPM)&lt;/a&gt; would be enabled to get Windows 11 on the Steam Deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WrWAX"&gt;Now, Valve has confirmed it has been heavily focused on Windows support. “There’s work looking at TPM just now,” says Greg Coomer, a Valve Steam Deck designer, in &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/steam-deck-windows-11-tpm-compatibility/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve focused so much on Windows 10, so far, that we haven’t really gotten that far into it. Our expectation is that we can meet that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKSqvN"&gt;Valve is working with AMD to make sure that TPM is supported at a BIOS level, and that the Steam Deck...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZGzBGm"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"&gt;new FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has attempted to assuage concerns that its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;anti-child abuse measures&lt;/a&gt; could be turned into surveillance tools by authoritarian governments. “Let us be clear, this technology is limited to detecting CSAM [child sexual abuse material] stored in iCloud and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it,” the company writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeChzT"&gt;Apple’s new tools, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;announced last Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, include two features designed to protect children. One, called “communication safety,” uses on-device machine learning to identify and blur sexually explicit images received by children in the Messages app, and can notify a parent if a child age 12 and younger decides to view or send such an image. The second is designed to detect known CSAM...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="65t9Xd"&gt;As of its &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/2979680118212870441"&gt;latest beta release&lt;/a&gt;, Valve’s SteamVR software can add floating desktop windows inside VR games, letting you keep an eye on other apps without leaving VR.

&lt;p id="a2Icnn"&gt;The ability to interact with the rest of your desktop from within SteamVR’s dashboard is not a new feature, but recently Valve has been making the system more flexible. Earlier this year it added the option to view individual application windows in the dashboard, and to be virtually &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/steamvr-beta-update-virtual-desktop-window-view-controller-attach/"&gt;attached to VR controllers&lt;/a&gt; ingame. This made apps viewable at a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New report reveals how the climate crisis is supercharging extreme weather</title>

  &lt;p id="bZMAGw"&gt;We now have the clearest picture yet of how different the world is today as a result of human-driven climate change. The most comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; to date on the physical science of climate change was published today by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ4DzF"&gt;“Climate change is a problem that is here now. Nobody’s safe, and it’s getting worse faster,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said in a press conference today. “We must treat climate change as an immediate threat.”&lt;/p&gt;
