    <title>Google Messages will auto-delete OTPs and sort like Gmail, but only in India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/onctS4v3GwU4qQE6IDRPcAeu6Zg=/0x0:2100x1400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517507/messages_otp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OTPs can be set to delete automatically after 24 hours.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YeUvXY"&gt;Google is updating its Messages app in India to allow it to delete one-time passwords (OTPs) automatically, to stop the single-use codes from clogging up your inbox, &lt;a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/06/messages-makes-it-easier-to-help-you.html"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside it, Google also says the app will be able to sort messages into categories, keeping your personal correspondence away from notifications about bank transactions and special offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLi3vj"&gt;As someone that &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; exclusively uses WhatsApp for personal communication, my phone’s default texting app is typically a graveyard of six-digit codes, which by design become useless mere minutes after they’re received. Having the ability to automatically delete them after 24 hours should make Messages less cluttered and more usable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches new search tool to help combat food insecurity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TeA5Lpc6KfhyHYRykevgGBjiIoE=/226x0:1645x946/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517398/google_food_support.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google is working with non-profits to aggregate 90,000 locations with free food support across all 50 states .&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bUA5vq"&gt;Google announced a new website designed to be a “one-stop shop” for people with food insecurity. The &lt;a href="http://g.co/findfoodsupport"&gt;“Find Food Support” site&lt;/a&gt; includes a food locator tool powered by Google Maps which people can use to search for their nearest food bank, food pantry, or school lunch program pickup site in their community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rGbnt"&gt;Google is working with non-profit groups like No Kid Hungry and FoodFinder, as well as the US Department of Agriculture, to aggregate 90,000 locations with free food support across all 50 states — with more locations to come. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CIJGK1"&gt;The new site is a product of Google’s newly formed &lt;a href="https://blog.x.company/a-new-home-for-project-delta-a39f8286b6d7"&gt;Food for Good team&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known as Project Delta when it was headquartered at Alphabet’s X moonshot division.

    <title>Windows 11 includes new Dynamic Refresh Rate feature to save laptop battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xHlDGHI5iDWeXov8lB6NJgCM9g=/116x0:1370x836/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517393/Windows_11_Generic_Laptop_Device_Render.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9wRVy"&gt;Microsoft is introducing a new Dynamic Refresh Rate (DRR) feature in Windows 11 that’s designed to save laptop battery life and boost refresh rates when they’re really needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3j9An"&gt;A number of laptops now ship with 120Hz and beyond displays, which make Windows feel a lot smoother across scrolling, animations, and inking. While the added smoothness feels great, running at higher refresh rates takes its toll on battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XSRSk"&gt;In Windows 10 you have to decide between 60Hz and 120Hz on a laptop, and it’s a static choice. Microsoft is now building DRR into Windows 11, which will allow a laptop to dynamically adjust its refresh rate. “This means that Windows 11 will seamlessly switch between a lower refresh rate and a higher refresh rate based on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google beefs up Play Store developer verification in response to scams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vMy11f4h-yYq1mFelvh0OfUcesA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517335/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5MaO2a"&gt;Google is working to enhance the integrity of the Play Store by adding new restrictions and safeguards to developer accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLVzyr"&gt;Google Play Store developers will soon have to verify their email address and phone number and provide extra details like a physical address in an attempt to increase security and ensure that accounts are being created by ‘real people,’ &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/play-dev-id-requirements-2-step.html"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Developers will also be required to use two-step verification. The search giant says it’s making the changes “to keep Google Play safe and secure and to better serve our developer community,” and to “make sure that every account is created by a real person with real contact details.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrGIDd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/google-to-require-2fa-and-a-physical-address-from-android-app-devs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the announcement coincides with the emergence...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikon’s Z FC is a film camera revival in mirrorless form</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2gUF5w0d2VNqtK1-vbm6_hfPqyU=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517035/Zfc_USDD_TO_6573.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRJpV4"&gt;Nikon is going all-in on the retro aesthetic with its latest Z-series mirrorless camera. The company says the new Z FC, officially styled “Z fc,” is designed specifically to evoke its FM2 film SLR from the ‘80s, with dedicated dials for settings like shutter speed, exposure compensation, and ISO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PNUbN"&gt;The approach is similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5066118/nikon-df-full-frame-modern-camera-in-a-stunning-old-school-body"&gt;the Nikon DF&lt;/a&gt;, a retro-style full-frame DSLR that Nikon released in 2013. But the DF was much larger than the film cameras it was inspired by. The Z FC has a 20.9-megapixel APS-C sensor (and of course no SLR mirror and prism), which means the resulting camera is far more compact and looks a lot closer to something like an FM2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6e6zGf"&gt;Beyond the exterior, the Z FC is a modern camera with broadly similar specs to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s C1 and G1 OLEDs get even better at gaming with 120Hz Dolby Vision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YLK4LBuGcWwQxp8qwUre5aomD9Y=/22x0:1030x672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69516674/LG_Dolby_Vision_Gaming_02a.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Drqel1"&gt;With Dolby Vision gaming HDR technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22435864/microsoft-dolby-vision-xbox-series-x-s-test"&gt;available on Xbox Series X and Series S consoles&lt;/a&gt;, some TV owners have noticed that suddenly there’s a new setting to worry over. While some HDMI 2.1-equipped 4K displays could handle 120Hz, and some can support Dolby Vision for gaming, at first there weren’t any that could do both things at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HalHt3"&gt;Now LG has &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/06/gaming-on-lg-premium-tvs-reach-new-heights-with-latest-dolby-vision-update/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it’s the first manufacturer with Dolby Vision HDR at 4K 120Hz support on some of its TVs, just a couple of weeks after owners noticed it arriving in updates. The 03.15.27 firmware enables the feature on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224271/lg-2021-tvs-oled-qned-g1-c1-a1-announced-specs-ces"&gt;C1 and G1 2021 OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;, and today LG says support is on the way for other premium TVs in its 2021 lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ElcdBW"&gt;Additional premium models in LG’s 2021 TV lineup such as OLED Z1 series, QNED...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Parler reportedly refused to ban Trump’s critics as part of discussions to bring him onboard</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yRJCDl"&gt;The alternative social network Parler and representatives of former president Donald Trump were reportedly considering an idea to make Trump an active member of the platform after he left office, but Parler apparently pushed back on one key part of the proposed arrangement: the platform did not want to ban Trump’s detractors, according to an excerpt of Michael Wolff’s upcoming book about the last days of Trump’s presidency &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/michael-wolff-landslide-final-days-trump-presidency-excerpt.html"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YuR1w"&gt;Here’s what was going on, according to Wolff: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JZio80"&gt;One curious point of consideration for the [Trump] family [the morning of January 6th] — prescient of the events that would shortly unfold — was a follow-up to a discussion initiated some months before by aides and family. Trump...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Juul settles with North Carolina in first teen vaping lawsuit </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rSe6j"&gt;Juul has agreed to settle its first state lawsuit over deceptive business practices with North Carolina, a move that will limit the vaping company’s marketing claims and placement of products in stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgGlXC"&gt;Under the &lt;a href="https://ncdoj.gov/attorney-general-stein-reaches-agreement-with-juul-for-40-million-and-drastic-business-changes/"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt;, Juul will no longer use marketing strategies geared toward young people, including most social media marketing campaigns, advertising near schools, and sponsoring sporting events or concerts. The company also cannot use models under 35 years old for advertisements in the state, and it’s required that Juul products are sold behind the counters of stores, according to &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article252318958.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The News &amp;amp; Observer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Snapchat’s new update fixes its crashing problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wu7ItIATayqYYKLGHTtE5ta4qUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514767/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yBtjoK"&gt;If you’ve been experiencing the bug where the iOS version of Snapchat crashes at launch, it seems that there’s now an update to fix it available in the App Store. The bug that’s been fixed by the update didn’t appear to have affected the Android version of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9d2Z7F"&gt;Before updating to the latest version, 11.34.1.35, the app would give me a message that something went wrong, before crashing to Springboard on my iPhone 12 Mini. Now, I’m no longer getting the error, and have successfully been able to send a Snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kodK5Z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1409582267270270976"&gt;This is what the bug looked like&lt;/a&gt; when it was present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j1we3B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oh snap &lt;a href="https://t.co/yC2BKjhzmw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yC2BKjhzmw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1409582267270270976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="80qzZk"&gt;The Snapchat Support Twitter account hasn’t yet tweeted about the fix (despite &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1409501297737359366?s=20"&gt;having a pinned...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Obs61"&gt;&lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/64-bit-office-for-windows-on-arm"&gt;Microsoft is announcing&lt;/a&gt; that the next version of Office for Windows 11 will have a native 64-bit Arm version, for improved performance on large or picture-filled documents, and support for 64-bit add-ins. The new version of Office is currently in beta, available to &lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/"&gt;Office Insiders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwI8im"&gt;Microsoft also announced &lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/visual-refresh-of-office-apps-for-windows"&gt;a redesign of Office&lt;/a&gt;, which you can see above and below. While it uses a similar design to Windows 11, it’ll be available whether you're running the Windows 11 Preview or Windows 10. In addition to the new design, Office will also adapt to your Windows light / dark mode, so you should be able to avoid the experience of opening a document and having it blast light into your eyes at night. &lt;/p&gt;
