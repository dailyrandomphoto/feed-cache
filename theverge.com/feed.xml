    <title>The latest Kindle Paperwhite is 25 percent off ahead of Cyber Monday</title>

  &lt;p id="6fyvPu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books"&gt;all-new Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/a&gt; is already an exceptional buy at its regular price of $140. It has a great 6.8-inch display, USB-C charging, and a battery that can last for months — our reviewer calls it “the ultimate Kindle.” If you’ve been eyeing this device, now is a great time to buy it. Ahead of Cyber Monday, it’s available &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now for $105, which is $35 and 25 percent off its original price of $140. Other retailers, such as &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13048831?sid=VergeStaplesBF112521&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Famazon-kindle-paperwhite-6-8-e-reader-8gb-53-026260%2Fproduct_24508151" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staples&lt;/a&gt;, are offering the same price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRRMHX"&gt;Note that this is the ad-supported model — the ad-free version is currently $125 ($35 off its original price of $160). If you don’t want ads (or to pay the $20 premium for the ad-free model), a savvy move is to get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-kindle-paperwhite-kids/dp/B08WPB8PW9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite Kids&lt;/a&gt; for $115, which is $45...&lt;/p&gt;

Several retailers are now heavily discounting popular tech products during Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend, discounting everything from Bluetooth trackers and smart speakers to the latest gaming subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Early Cyber Monday smart home tech deals: speakers, cameras, robots, and more </title>

  &lt;p id="uNHMij"&gt;There is never a better time to dive into the smart home than Black Friday and its close cousin Cyber Monday. Traditionally, tech deals on home gadgets are huge this time of year, plus, it’s the only time you’ll find real bargains on gear from some of the smaller companies, such as Eve, Level, and Nanoleaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjy6kh"&gt;Whether you’re thinking about dipping a toe into this home automation shindig with a smart speaker or maybe a connected door lock, or want to bolster an already impressive smart home setup, it’s worth investing some cash this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRU2qz"&gt;Also, if you just want to upgrade your home cleaning routine or have a way to check in on Fido now that you’re back at work (the separation anxiety is real), this is a good time to get a great...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Cyber Monday deals on true wireless earbuds</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLBEwG"&gt;One of the most sought-after gifts every holiday — at least, ever since Apple removed the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone — has been true wireless earbuds. They are often the favored listening device of many people because they offer the most convenience, and they’re a product category that frequently goes on sale. Full-size headphones offer superior sound, and those are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796131/black-friday-headphones-2021-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;still seeing their fair share&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Cyber Monday discounts&lt;/a&gt;, but most casual listeners often prefer earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2rBqw"&gt;Here, we’ve rounded up the best Cyber Monday deals on wireless earbuds from Apple, Samsung, Bose, Jabra, Beats, and even Google, as well as a couple of lesser-known brands. Each has its own unique qualities or value proposition to offer, and we have deals...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aqtAPK"&gt;Black Friday may have come and gone, but that just means we are nearing the ending crescendo to the shopping holiday weekend with Cyber Monday. What first started as a focus on online tech deals has essentially morphed into an annual Black Friday 2.0, like some sort of sequel that you hope is even punchier than the original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cx1nG7"&gt;Lots of deals at retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784145/amazon-black-friday-2021-best-deals-tech-cyber-monday"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789835/best-buy-black-friday-2021-cyber-monday-tech-deals"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22783434/target-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday-tech-games"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; started plenty early, with many launching their holiday deal selection weeks ahead of Black Friday. Many deals are continuing through the weekend and into Cyber Monday, too, just as new and exciting ones begin to crop up. Regardless of whether they’re holdover deals or new ones, you can find all of the latest and must-know details to make your...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Cyber Monday deals on noise-canceling headphones 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Embrace the silence&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5KTAD"&gt;Whether you’re overdue for a new pair or are just trying to cancel out the usual onslaught of holiday music, Cyber Monday is a great time to invest in some noise-canceling headphones. You’ll find significant discounts on many of our favorite headphones featured in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;noise-canceling headphones buying guide&lt;/a&gt;. These include picks from Sony, Bose, Apple, Sennheiser, and others. In some cases, these deals will save you $100 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKhJxM"&gt;Aside from the steep discounts, another good thing about buying headphones during the holidays is the extended return period at many retailers. That gives you plenty of time to try out your new cans and make sure the sound quality, ANC, comfort, and other factors are all to your liking before you’re stuck with...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Cyber Monday deals on 4K TVs</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The best TVs on Sale over Black Friday weekend&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmhxDE"&gt;4K TVs of all sizes and specs see price cuts several times throughout the year, but the time when we usually see the highest concentration of stellar deals is right now, as Black Friday weekend continues and Cyber Monday is just around the bend. You’ve ended up in the right place if you’re looking for a TV deal, and yes, that includes people interested in a TV that has every bell or whistle, with the highest contrast ratio and the right features to eke all of the visual splendor from PCs and the latest gaming consoles or something that’s quite the opposite. We’ll be highlighting affordable TVs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGhjh8"&gt;Our team at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is hard at work on compiling the best Black Friday deals, running the gamut of retailers participating, as well as...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="EIiXqs"&gt;Gamers are served up all kinds of great deals throughout the year. It’s not uncommon for recently released games to drop as much as 20 percent off in the first few months of release or to snag the occasional one-off deal on a controller or headset. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are something special — a chance to get in on the year’s best offers all at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lUgdw"&gt;Like 2020, the holidays in 2021 are a bit peculiar, what with the ongoing pandemic and chip shortage. There’s no shortage of games and accessories, but fewer consoles are available for first-time buyers to gift, which means the opportunities to get one are very rare and very popular. Some retailers have even taken to charging subscription fees that offer you a boosted chance of...&lt;/p&gt;
