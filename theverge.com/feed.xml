    <title>Amazon delivery drivers have to consent to AI surveillance in their vans or lose their jobs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A driver of Amazon prime prepares for delivery in London..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rusE645bFOVQYeT-yEvx5X4fRrQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69016516/1230412848.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f4w1V2"&gt;Amazon is well-known for its technological Taylorism: using digital sensors to monitor and control the activity of its workers in the name of efficiency. But after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;installing machine learning-powered surveillance cameras&lt;/a&gt; in its delivery vans earlier this year, the company is now telling employees: agree to be surveilled by AI or lose your job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dUVlc"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8n3j/amazon-delivery-drivers-forced-to-sign-biometric-consent-form-or-lose-job"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon delivery drivers in the US now have to sign “biometric consent” forms to continue working for the retailing giant. Exactly what information is being collected seems to vary based on what surveillance equipment has been installed in any given van, but Amazon’s privacy policy (embedded below) covers a wide range of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CESTHR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Data includes vehicle location, speed,...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Lime adds features to make scooter-sharing less stressful</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GAgdnj"&gt;Scooter-sharing giant Lime is updating its app to make renting one of the company’s battery-powered two-wheelers a little easier. Customers can now take advantage of new features like app-less riding, 10-minute reservations, and vehicle configurations to take some of the bite out of scooter-sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dV2g8J"&gt;Customers who don’t have the Lime app on their phone can still ride by taking a photo of the scooter’s QR code and paying through Apple Pay or Google Pay. Lime says it will be a useful tool for first-time riders who don’t want to commit or don’t have space on their phones. The functionality works by temporarily downloading a portion of Lime’s normal app. It uses the Instant Apps feature on Android, while on iPhones it makes use of the new...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now buy a Tesla with bitcoin in the US</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bitcoin payment option appears underneath the typical “Order With Card” button.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Tesla.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4TDBLq"&gt;Tesla now accepts bitcoin as payment for its cars in the US, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374617643446063105"&gt;CEO Elon Musk announced&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. The option to pay using the cryptocurrency now appears on the company’s US website, where it’s available alongside the traditional card payment option. Musk said that the option to pay with bitcoin will be available to other countries “later this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJpkZd"&gt;As well as confirming the availability of the new payment option, Musk offered some details on how Tesla is handling the cryptocurrency. “Tesla is using only internal &amp;amp; open source software &amp;amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly,” he said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374619379929772034"&gt;followup tweet&lt;/a&gt;, “Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Card doesn’t actually discriminate against women, investigators say</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vH6eAT"&gt;Goldman Sachs’ credit card policies were called into question when Basecamp designer David Heinemeier Hansson and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak claimed that their female partners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20958953/apple-credit-card-gender-discrimination-algorithms-black-box-investigation"&gt;received lower Apple Card credit limits&lt;/a&gt; simply for being women. But a recently concluded New York State Department of Financial Services &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22392556/rpt_202103_apple_card_investigation.pdf"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; has found Apple’s banking partner did not discriminate based on sex (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/goldman-didn-t-discriminate-with-apple-card-n-y-regulator-says"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1hOe2"&gt;NYSDFS investigators conducted a statistical analysis of almost 400,000 New York applicants that showed that the models and algorithms Goldman Sachs uses to filter applicants “did not consider prohibited characteristics of applicants and would not produce disparate impacts”. The regulator also stressed that the idea that spouses...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is reportedly developing a Switch-like Android gaming device</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9h9d2E"&gt;Qualcomm is reportedly working on an Android-powered, handheld gaming console that’s similar to a Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/23/exclusive-qualcomm-is-planning-an-android-powered-nintendo-switch-knockoff/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374447139921686528?s=20"&gt;editor-in-chief Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt;. The device would be powered by Qualcomm’s silicon, and could hit store shelves by next year — if it ends up being a real product at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWFYl7"&gt;According to the article, which cites images seen by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;, the device would feature detachable, Joy-Con-like controllers, an SD card slot, Android 12, and (of course) 5G. Also noted, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374448185377058821"&gt;corroborated by Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, is a huge 6,000mAh battery. While the physical dimensions aren’t clear, Rahman tweeted that the screen could be 6.65-inches, with a resolution of at least 1080p (the Switch’s screen is 6.2-inches and runs...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA reveals flight zone for historic helicopter flight on Mars</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jae2db"&gt;NASA has locked in a location on Mars for the first demo flight of its mini helicopter named Ingenuity, engineers announced on Tuesday. The four-pound rotorcraft is gearing up to attempt the first powered flight on another planet, demonstrating a new capability that could unlock access to hard-to-reach areas of other celestial bodies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZxna8"&gt;Ingenuity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;arrived on Mars&lt;/a&gt; in February, clinging to the belly of the Perseverance rover, surviving a seven-month trek through deep space and an intense seven-minute landing sequence through Mars’ atmosphere. Within a few hours of Perseverance’s landing, engineers started analyzing orbital imagery to find a prime flight zone to drop off Ingenuity for its first flight — “an area where it is safe...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="LHsQSA"&gt;Intel has a new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and he’s not wasting any time to make some big changes. At the company’s “&lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership/"&gt;Engineering the Future&lt;/a&gt;” announcement today, Gelsinger announced plans to outsource more of Intel’s chip production to third-party foundries; a $20 billion investment into two new fabs in Arizona; and a new branch of the company called Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel’s foundries produce chips for other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjyEy6"&gt;The announcements are part of a new “IDM 2.0” strategy for Intel’s design and manufacturing, which is made up of three parts. First, there’s Intel’s in-house manufacturing, which will continue to serve as a key part of Intel’s design and production of chips. Second, there’s an expanded use of external...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ACSqlm"&gt;Amazon has named Salesforce executive Adam Selipsky as the replacement for Andy Jassy, the longtime chief of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the company’s next CEO when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;founder Jeff Bezos steps down later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Selipsky worked at AWS for more than 10 years, raising to the rank of vice president of sales and marketing, before running the startup Tableau, which is now part of Salesforce. Selipsky’s hiring was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/amazon-taps-former-executive-adam-selipsky-to-run-aws.html"&gt;first reported by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, which published a memo Jassy sent to Amazon employees on Wednesday announcing the news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ra39a"&gt;“Adam brings strong judgment, customer obsession, team building, demand generation, and CEO experience to an already very strong AWS leadership team. And, having been in such a senior role at AWS for 11 years, he knows...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom now has an SDK for putting Zoom into other things</title>

Emanating from the computer, connected with dotted lines, are a play icon, a picture of mountains, a map icon, and a weather icon." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAQSsaUFWUR8yRl_RJOaV3sX_tk=/192x0:1629x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014311/Video_SDK_Image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zoom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjiSEC"&gt;Zoom has released a new SDK (software development kit) to help developers build Zoom into their software. According to the company, you can now build your own “video-based applications and websites” on top of Zoom’s platform and can more easily incorporate Zoom’s video and audio features directly into your apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxucl1"&gt;The company envisions developers utilizing Zoom’s chat functions in a number of different settings, from social media and gaming platforms to virtual retail apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8lnbH"&gt;“Using our Video SDK, developers can drive customer engagement and provide new opportunities for revenue without being tied to the Zoom Meetings user interface,” writes Zoom product marketing manager Natalie Mullin in a &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/bring-industry-leading-video-to-your-application-with-zooms-video-sdk/"&gt;company blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ei4fT0"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-circle-and-too-hot-to-handle-return-this-spring"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will be experimenting with the release schedules of two reality TV shows, &lt;em&gt;The Circle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/circle-too-hot-to-handle-modified-release-netflix"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Instead of releasing all of the episodes at once, it will release them over the course of a month, with each show having a batch of episodes released on Wednesdays, then releasing the finale by itself at the end of the run. This means you won’t be able to binge all of the episodes in a single weekend... and that may be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mW3XY"&gt;These shows aren’t the first time Netflix has broken away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453220/netflix-arrested-development-return-television-landscape"&gt;the binge model it popularized&lt;/a&gt;, in which all of the episodes of a show are released at once. It has released episodes of cooking competition &lt;em&gt;The Great British Baking Show &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;music...&lt;/p&gt;
