    <title>Huawei’s Watch 3 is its first HarmonyOS smartwatch  </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GnKvGW"&gt;Huawei has announced its first smartwatches running its own HarmonyOS operating system, the Huawei Watch 3 and Huawei Watch 3 Pro. In theory it’s the third separate operating system Huawei has used for its smartwatches, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/25/9397931/huawei-watch-review-android-wear"&gt;originally ran Google’s Android Wear&lt;/a&gt; (now Wear OS) before introducing its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967136/huawei-watch-gt-fitness-gps-watch-specs-release-date-price-hands-on"&gt;LiteOS software&lt;/a&gt; with more recent devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXiI7C"&gt;Despite the new OS, the Watch 3 offers a similar set of features to Huawei’s previous wearables. New additions includes a redesigned home screen that now consists of a watchOS-style grid of apps rather than a list, and there’s also support for video calling through Huawei’s own MeeTime service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaTaJ9"&gt;Although it’s branded as a HarmonyOS device, the Watch 3’s long battery life suggests its operating...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s HarmonyOS arrives on tablets with the new MatePad Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s new 12.6-inch MatePad Pro with stylus and keyboard cover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3m61Jb"&gt;Huawei has announced a trio of new MatePad tablets; a new 12.6-inch MatePad Pro, a smaller 10.8-inch MatePad Pro, and a new MatePad 11. Not only are they the company’s first tablets running its own HarmonyOS operating system, but the smaller MatePad Pro and MatePad 11 use Snapdragon chips produced by Qualcomm rather than the Huawei-designed Kirin processors found in its previous devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJa5An"&gt;Between these hardware and software changes, the tablets highlight the challenges that the Chinese technology giant is going through. It’s simultaneously trying to break free of Android, which outside of China is dominated by the Google apps and services that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension"&gt;Huawei is unable to preinstall on its phones&lt;/a&gt;. But they also speak to the problems US sanctions...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge dismisses charges against Apple chief accused of bribing police officers with iPads </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q4CY76"&gt;A Californian court has dismissed bribery charges against Apple’s Chief Security Officer Thomas Moyer, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/judge-dismisses-charges-against-apple-security-chief-gun-permit-probe-2021-06-01/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, who was accused of offering iPads as bribes to obtain concealed-weapons permits for Apple employees. Judge Eric S. Geffon dismissed arguments of corrupt intent as “pure speculation” that were “not supported by the evidence presented to the grand jury.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bViO1M"&gt;Moyer was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611525/apple-ipads-bribes-concealed-gun-permits-security-head-accused-santa-clara"&gt;accused last November&lt;/a&gt; of trying to bribe Santa Clara County officials by offering to donate 200 iPads to two officers in the sheriff’s office following a meeting in 2019. Moyer had indeed made the offer, but evidence suggests he believed the permits were already approved at this time, Judge Geffon wrote. This, combined with the fact that Moyer followed Apple’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Etsy targets Gen Z shoppers with $1.6 billion Depop acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oy1IEw"&gt;E-commerce site Etsy, best known for selling handmade and vintage wares, is &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/etsy-to-acquire-global-fashion-resale-marketplace-depop-865217575.html"&gt;buying up a cooler, younger rival&lt;/a&gt;, UK-based secondhand shopping app Depop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLy3MU"&gt;The $1.6 billion acquisition lets Etsy access Depop’s young and growing userbase. Etsy says more than 90 percent of Depop’s users are under 26, meaning they mostly belong to Gen Z, while Etsy’s own users are firmly millennial, with a median age for sellers of around 39. Etsy claims that Depop is the 10th most visited shopping site for Gen Z consumer in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlVBwU"&gt;“We are simply thrilled to be adding Depop — what we believe to be the resale home for Gen Z consumers — to the Etsy family,” Etsy chief executive Josh Silverman said in a press statement. “Depop is a vibrant, two-sided marketplace...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk blames ‘supply chain price pressure’ for Tesla’s increasing prices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h-gGqmii2F1C9gGdrUykR8FVdEs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69375917/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tMg0wP"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk has blamed supply chain price pressure for incremental price increases the company has made to its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles over the past several months. “Prices increasing due to major supply chain price pressure industry-wide,” the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1399492488612691973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1399492488612691973%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Fbusiness%2Fautos-transportation%2Fteslas-vehicle-price-increases-due-supply-chain-pressure-musk-says-2021-06-01%2F"&gt;CEO tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in response to a complaint about the changes. “Raw materials especially.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuloCV"&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1399999219218501633"&gt;the CEO followed up&lt;/a&gt; to say that “microcontroller chips” are a particular challenge right now. But although Musk said that he’s “never seen anything like it,” he added that he doesn’t expect this to be a long-term issue. “Fear of running out is causing every company to overorder – like the toilet paper shortage, but at epic scale.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAZWV1"&gt;Musk had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay#:~:text=The%20global,new%20suppliers"&gt;previously indicated&lt;/a&gt; in an April earnings call that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Prime Day kicks off on June 21st</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1lnJmt"&gt;Amazon Prime Day, the company’s annual shopping holiday, will take place on Monday, June 21st through June 22nd, the company officially announced today. The forthcoming summer dates mark a return to form; the retail giant has historically held its shopping extravaganza in mid-July but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332350/amazon-prime-day-delayed-us-india-august-coronavirus"&gt;postponed last year’s event&lt;/a&gt; until October due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In its &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Amazon-Q1-2021-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;most recent earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon previously confirmed this year’s Prime Day would take place in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFaNVR"&gt;Like previous years, you can expect to find discounts on true wireless earbuds, 4K TVs of all sizes and panel types, video games, and more. Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Prime Day has become one of the best opportunities to get deals, whether they’re for gifts or...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is turning a factory into a gallery</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6GgZjm"&gt;Nintendo has announced that its Uji Ogura plant will be turned into a public gallery to “showcase the many products Nintendo has launched over its history.” The factory, located in the Ogura district of Uji, a city just outside Kyoto, was built in 1969 and was mainly used for manufacturing playing cards and hanafuda cards, which is how Nintendo got started as a business in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHDggt"&gt;“Nintendo has been discussing the possibility of building a gallery, as a way to share Nintendo’s product development history and philosophy with the public,” the company says in a &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210602.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “To this end, the Nintendo Uji Ogura Plant will be renovated to accommodate the gallery, a decision reached after taking consideration of The City of Uji’s plan...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The government’s been worried about DJI drones — the Pentagon now says they’re safe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-VIqtyzzEElicY--QTI7jQBVeY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69375023/vpavic_042029_4003_0162.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VViqYH"&gt;After months of government bans on DJI drones, with lawmakers questioning whether the company was sending information to the Chinese government, the Pentagon has now admitted that the drones being used might actually be safe (&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/556370-pentagon-report-clears-use-of-drones-made-by-top-chinese-manufacturer?rl=1"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), releasing a report saying that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-technology-government-and-politics-business-5854cf8b5eccd03f85d5eba2aef10a22"&gt;two “Government Edition” DJI drones&lt;/a&gt; are “recommended for use by government entities.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2I7cC"&gt;Last year, the Department of the Interior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113533/us-interior-department-chinese-drone-ban-grounding-security-dji"&gt;grounded all its drones&lt;/a&gt;, citing concerns of potential spying by the Chinese government, and the Department of Commerce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;put DJI on its Entity List&lt;/a&gt; after the company allegedly provided the Chinese government with surveillance tech for its Uyghur Muslim detention camps. That second claim isn’t being addressed at all today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qo7cn4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The report isn’t...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Dell has discontinued the Alienware Graphics Amplifier, its external GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0At8coQWAnATTi-CGE73BJpueFs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374949/alienware-dell-11_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZG4To8"&gt;We recently noticed that Alienware’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22440352/alienware-x15-x17-gaming-laptop-intel-h-series-nvidia-rtx-3080-price-release-date-features-specs"&gt;just-announced X15 and X17 thin and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;vaguely light  gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt; are conspicuously missing a port — and it’s not because they’re thin-and-light, it turns out. Alienware has just confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has discontinued the Alienware Graphics Amplifier external GPU, and so these laptops won’t need that proprietary port anymore. The company isn’t saying whether it’ll offer a future eGPU, but pointed us to off-the-shelf Thunderbolt ones instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPSyxA"&gt;The Alienware Graphics Amp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/27/7079879/alienware-new-graphics-amplifier-laptop"&gt;was first introduced in 2014 for $299&lt;/a&gt; and designed to be a companion to the company’s midrange Alienware 13, giving it the vast majority of the power of a desktop graphics card plus four extra full-size USB ports when docked. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/alienware-13-review-the-first-futureproof-gaming-lapto-1651514489"&gt;I...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="9AfEGC"&gt;Confirming what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370130/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-2021-lamp-wall-art-artwork-speaker"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported back in April,&lt;/a&gt; Ikea tonight listed a new Symfonisk “picture frame with Wi-Fi speaker” product on its website. The device, which is listed for $199, has not yet been announced — but it’s one of two new collaborations between Ikea and Sonos set for release in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPKkcf"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-picture-frame-with-wi-fi-speaker-white-50487329%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F1%2F22464111%2Fikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-leak" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the likely-to-be-removed website&lt;/a&gt;, the Symfonisk picture frame measures 22 inches high, 16 inches wide, and 2 inches deep. Ikea says customers will be able to choose between “various interchangeable fronts,” and the frame will be offered in either black or white finishes. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;the previous two Symfonisk products&lt;/a&gt;, the picture frame is designed to blend into your home decor and not stick out as an obvious tech gadget.&lt;/p&gt;
