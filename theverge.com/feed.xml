    <title>This smart collar wants to be an Apple Watch for your dog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A cute brown dog wearing an Invoxia Smart Dog Collar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOa6A3Fw0pFhMxwHi-8HF9XTNpQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70344311/Smart_Dog_Collar_Logo___Invoxia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invoxia’s Smart Dog Collar uses miniaturized radars to monitor resting respiratory and heart rate.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Invoxia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iU8QjI"&gt;Pet trackers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20680991/fi-smart-collar-pet-dog-fitness-tracker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;been around&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/4/14149086/whistle-3-gps-pet-tracker-price-date-ces-2017"&gt;for ages&lt;/a&gt;, but Invoxia is looking to shake things up at CES 2022 with a new smart collar that can also monitor your dog’s vital signs. And of course, the smart collar also doubles as a GPS and activity tracker for your pooch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KRraN"&gt;Canine fitness trackers generally rely on a combination of accelerometers and GPS sensors. Invoxia’s approach is a bit different. To monitor vitals like resting respiratory and heart rate, Invoxia says it worked with board-certified veterinary cardiologists to develop deep learning AI that utilizes miniaturized radar sensors — the same type as the Soli radar Google used in its Pixel 4 phones. According to Invoxia CEO Amélie Caudron, the radars are ideal as they’re capable of taking...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hands off: Moen’s new smart faucet doesn’t even need a handle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ld0ezaW_0LwtytQGhgwU3Txr-Rg=/0x768:2100x2168/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70343552/Moen_Smart_Faucet_with_Motion_Control___No_Handle___Brushed_Gold.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moen’s newest smart faucet goes handle-free.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Moen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A5USWw"&gt;Moen revealed its latest smart faucet at CES this week: the Moen Smart Faucet with Motion Control. The new feature adds completely handle-free operation, using gestures to control temperature as well as flow. But you can still have a handle if you really want one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOMoQ7"&gt;The idea is you operate the faucet using swipe and push motions in front of the sensor to get hot, warm, or cold water. The Moen Smart Water App should let you set the default temperatures, as well as customize the gestures further.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The handle-free design of the Moen Smart Faucet with Motion is a minimalist’s dream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4iNciQ"&gt;The new faucet has all the features of the existing Moen Smart Faucet — including voice activation (with Amazon Alexa and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netgear thinks you’ll pay extra for ad blocking on its Orbi routers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Game Booster service will cost $50 annually&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sAbTdE"&gt;The demands placed on our home networks are higher than ever, especially when it comes to gaming. Netgear was arguably one of the first router manufacturers to optimize the networking needed for gaming with its Nighthawk line of routers. Now, it's attempting the same thing with its new line of 6E enabled Orbi mesh routers. The Game Booster service largely resembles the Nighthawk Pro Gaming application used to configure their XR line of gaming routers, with one glaring difference: it requires a subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwENb4"&gt;The Game Booster service for Orbi devices will cost $50 annually, and while this isn’t a massive sum of money, it certainly raises some questions about why Netgear is charging for a service that was previously offered for free on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Withings’ new scale has a retractable handle that measures EKGs and segmented body composition</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gS63RC"&gt;Withings isn’t a stranger to smart scales, but for CES 2022 the company is taking a much more ambitious take on the gadget. Announced today, the Withings Body Scan will feature six-lead EKG readings, segmented body composition measurements, and the ability to assess foot nerve activity. Basically, it’s the scale for people who want to know how fat is distributed through their body and how that might in turn relate to their heart health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHfFGU"&gt;On the surface, the Body Scan looks like your typical scale — albeit with a retractable handle up top. It contains four weight sensors and 14 ITO electrodes in the scale itself, plus an additional four located in the handle. The scale also features a larger 3.2-inch LCD color screen, as well as a battery...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netgear is turning its connected picture frame into a display for NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HbLeURqJmRdP8_cUZ9buHOGRGS4=/0x2:396x266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70344209/Screenshot_2021_12_20_143606.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tNsyW5"&gt;Whether you wanted it or not, NFTs are finding ways of creeping into just about every aspect of our lives. Something that began as a curiosity has quickly expanded to include networking giant Netgear and its connected smart frame, Meural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXi7qZ"&gt;Regardless of how you feel about NFTs, companies like Netgear are capitalizing on this interest by integrating them into products like the existing Meural Frame. With a way to put these works of “art” on display, it allows these commodities to also become decorations for something besides Twitter profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ocT4xF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"},{"title":"The climate controversy swirling around NFTs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6tlt7T"&gt;While the Meural began its life as a way to display photos, Netgear recently announced that it would begin beta testing integration between the Meural and the MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet starting...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 10 Pro official teaser shows off triple rear cameras and Hasselblad branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XKEVQOezKkllKkl0c_JyWzXTT7k=/0x0:6750x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70344224/OnePlus_10_Pro.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EFgjMU"&gt;The rear camera layout of OnePlus’s next flagship, the OnePlus 10 Pro, has been shown off in a teaser image for the smartphone. The handset is due to launch in China on January 11th before coming to the rest of the world later in the year. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau previously confirmed that the phone would be revealed in January in a &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1110411735/L72FWaAtT#comment"&gt;post on Weibo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g94BHg"&gt;Although the teaser image doesn’t show much more than the rear of the phone, it confirms the 10 Pro will have three rear cameras that will once again carry the Hasselblad branding. OnePlus’s partnership with the Swedish camera manufacturer began with last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;, where the two companies worked together on the color tuning of the phone’s photos, with generally good results.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air, one of the best laptops you can get, is now available at Amazon starting at $949.99.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including ones equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult. It’s a slightly different story for the newer M1 Pro and M1 Max-equipped MacBook Pros, but any bit of savings you can get on the new Pro models is sure to be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which are compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;recently released macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; — but we strongly recommend opting for a newer model now that Apple has introduced its M1...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="oAtGFO"&gt;Sengled, the smart lighting company that’s hedged its protocol bets by making Zigbee, Wi-Fi, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Bluetooth smart bulbs, has announced a slew of new products at CES 2022. The most intriguing is the Smart Health Monitoring bulb, and the most fun is the Wi-Fi Video-Sync TV light strips. Sengled has also pledged its support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter, the new smart home standard&lt;/a&gt;, adding a fourth protocol to its package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLiGo1"&gt;For those unfamiliar with the smart lighting company, Sengled offers a variety of connected bulbs covering most smart home bases. Its Zigbee smart bulbs work with a hub, similar to Philips Hue, and are compatible with Alexa, Google, Apple HomeKit, and Samsung SmartThings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJtVnG"&gt;Its Wi-Fi bulbs don’t require a hub and work with Alexa, Google, and...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NGutlT"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes deliberately misled investors about the capabilities of the blood testing technology at Theranos and is guilty of three counts of wire fraud, a jury found today. She is also guilty of conspiracy to defraud investors with her co-defendant, Sunny Balwani. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVf26I"&gt;She faces up to 20 years in prison for each of the counts. The jury found her not guilty of two counts of defrauding patients and not guilty of conspiracy to defraud patients. The jury did not return a verdict on three more counts of defrauding investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8Hd5v"&gt;Holmes was the founder and CEO of Theranos, a company that promised to revolutionize blood testing by developing a device that could run hundreds of medical tests on just a few drops of blood. The company was an...&lt;/p&gt;
