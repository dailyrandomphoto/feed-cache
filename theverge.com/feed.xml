    <title>Instagram says its algorithm won’t promote Reels that have a TikTok watermark</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OdGOvy"&gt;Instagram’s newest guidance for creators makes one thing clear: the platform wants people to stop posting recycled TikToks to Reels. Today, Instagram says it’s making changes to its algorithm and how it recommends Reels to users. Along with that, it’s issuing new best practices on its &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/creators/"&gt;@creators account&lt;/a&gt; to give Instagram users tips on how to make content that’s likely to be seen and promoted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaH2Qc"&gt;The team now recommends that Reels users post vertical videos that use music found in Instagram’s library or sounds that they find on Reels. They also suggest “starting a trend” that others can participate in, like dance crazes, as well as “entertaining” and “fun” content. Reels that are mostly covered by text, are blurry, have a watermark or logo,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei asks court to overturn FCC ban</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RqvwRO"&gt;Huawei has &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22292499/huawei_review_request.pdf"&gt;asked a court to overturn&lt;/a&gt; the Federal Communications Commission’s designation of it as a national security threat. The Chinese telecom argues that the FCC overstepped its authority in December 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-affirms-designation-huawei-national-security-threat"&gt;finalizing a ban&lt;/a&gt; supported by former President Donald Trump. “The order on review potentially impacts the financial interests of the telecommunications industry as a whole,” Huawei’s request says, including network operators the FCC locked out of buying Huawei components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtnzdR"&gt;The Biden administration’s FCC reiterated its support for the decision, however. “Last year the FCC issued a final designation identifying Huawei as a national security threat based on a substantial body of evidence developed by the FCC and numerous US national...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota teams up with Aurora and Denso on robotaxi development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oZpUe6uxmXIj5c3D1t3_2H-RYoQ=/0x0:3937x2625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793640/Aurora_Sienna_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FeaCzA"&gt;It’s 2021 and we’re still finding unique ways to pair up to develop self-driving cars. The latest is between Toyota, AV startup Aurora, and auto part supplier Denso. The three companies will join forces to develop a fleet of robotaxis, with the first hitting the road by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcH2Md"&gt;It’s a big get for Aurora, the scrappy AV startup founded by Chris Urmson, the former head engineer of Google’s self-driving car project, among others. Toyota, which &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/toyota-unseats-vw-to-become-the-world-s-top-selling-automaker?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;outsold Volkswagen in 2020&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim its status as the biggest automaker in the world, is one of the few car companies that has yet to pair up with an autonomous vehicle startup. Denso, which spun out of Toyota in the mid-20th century, is one of the largest auto suppliers on the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stream the second Trump impeachment trial</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Senate Democratic Leadership Speaks To Media Ahead Of Impeachment Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1kBU89RDrh7UUUkhcYsxlBfpWY=/0x0:5678x3785/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793523/1231062522.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SI9Qqx"&gt;The second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump begins today. Trump was charged with incitement of insurrection by the House after the attack on the Capitol last month. House impeachment managers and Trump’s legal team will debate the constitutionality of the case today. After a Senate vote, which will likely pass, both sides will begin opening arguments on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xpF9Za"&gt;What time does the impeachment start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tzbN7R"&gt;The first day of the trial begins at 1PM ET. There will be four hours for both sides to present arguments. The House has already voted to bring an article of impeachment against Trump, so the Senate arguments will be over whether the misconduct is sufficient to justify penalties, including potentially barring Trump from...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Fi VPN is coming to iPhones this spring</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TUjLLc"&gt;Google launched a VPN for its Google Fi cell service in beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18089834/project-fi-enhanced-network-vpn-privacy-google-announcement"&gt;back in November 2018&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Fi subscribers to route their phone’s internet traffic through an encrypted connection to help protect security and privacy. Until now, though, it has only been available for Android users, but that will change soon. Google plans to roll out the Fi VPN to Fi subscribers on iPhones beginning this spring, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-fi/google-fi-vpn-updates-help-you-connect-safely/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTUrSs"&gt;Google also announced that the VPN is officially exiting beta on Android. “After listening to your feedback and making performance improvements, we’re taking the Fi VPN out of beta for Android phone users,” Google said. The VPN is included with all Google Fi plans, so you should be able to try it out now if...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Bowl 2021 was the most-streamed NFL game ever</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkSEp5"&gt;Super Bowl 2021 will go down in history for a few things, including being the most-streamed NFL game ever, but it had the lowest numbers in over a decade in terms of viewership. CBS Sports reports that this year’s NFL championship drew in a total audience of 96.5 million viewers, with streaming in particular up by 65 percent compared to last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUTrfS"&gt;Yet, despite a global pandemic and a ton of ways to stream the game, the numbers were still low. As &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/super-bowl-liii-100-7-million-viewers-ratings-down/"&gt;noted by &lt;em&gt;The Wrap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, last year’s Super Bowl drew 102 million viewers, meaning that this year’s marquee matchup was down by 5 percent compared to last year. Compared to other recent Super Bowls, viewership was the lowest since Super Bowl 2007, which had a little over 93 million people tuning in to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to swap your Xbox Series X controller’s connection between your Xbox and a phone or PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aoX8xz"&gt;Over the past couple of months, I’ve been playing a lot of games on my Xbox Series X, and following the release of the iOS 14.5 beta, which added support for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;Xbox Series X controller&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been itching to stream my games from my console to my iPhone. However, I dreaded having to pair my controller with my phone — I figured that it might be a hassle, and I wasn’t sure how easy it would be to sync my controller between the two devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Og0eBt"&gt;Turns out, it’s a smooth process to sync the controller to my iPhone. Better yet, it’s easy to swap the controller’s connection back and forth between my iPhone and my Xbox Series X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7FVnY5"&gt;Here’s how you set everything up: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CnwFpW"&gt;First, you have to pair your Xbox Series X controller with your phone or PC. Activate...&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Sony is trying to patent its Back Button Attachment for the PlayStation 4</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brennan King / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Aty8Qj"&gt;Sony has applied for a patent for its Back Button Attachment, the add-on accessory for the DualShock 4 announced back in 2019 that adds programmable buttons to the underside of the controller. The filing, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-may-be-working-on-a-back-button-attachment-for-ps5s-dualsense-controller?sf137897364=1"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t call the device by its existing name, but rather describes the product as an add-on with buttons that “may be mapped to controller buttons using customized button mapping pre-sets” and features a number of diagrams showing off how it works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eylkhh"&gt;It’s not immediately clear what the patent application means for Sony. The application, which has not yet been granted, was first filed in the US in the summer of 2019, before Sony filed it internationally in June of last year. It offers no indication this device could be...&lt;/p&gt;
