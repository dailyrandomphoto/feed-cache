    <title>Welcome to Hot Pod from The Verge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hot Pod logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xQA2CtNQ-hHdLgTdMq1Nnmrlcyw=/0x0:1600x1067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69916111/3426Sg8A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8XLUMy"&gt;The podcast world is changing. Welcome to your front-row seat on the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5UkiT"&gt;In case you haven’t heard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660584/hot-pod-newsletter-the-verge-ashley-carman"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;acquired &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; this month&lt;/a&gt;, and former writer and editor Nicholas Quah joined &lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt;, our sister publication at Vox Media, as a full-time podcast critic. He’s still publishing over there — you can subscribe to his criticism newsletter &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/promo/sign-up-for-15-speed-podcast-newsletter.html"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt; — but I’ll be writing &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; from here on out. I’m excited, and although I know Nick’s legacy and insight are unparalleled, I hope to do it justice. I appreciate you sticking with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="araHi2"&gt;I’ve been at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for nearly six years and covering podcasting and audio for the past three. In that time, podcasting has gone from something that existed on the fringe to a full-blown cultural...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is spending $50 million to ‘responsibly’ build the metaverse</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="to5NQK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/building-the-metaverse-responsibly/"&gt;Facebook has announced&lt;/a&gt; a $50 million fund that it says will help it develop the metaverse more responsibly. It’s officially called the XR Programs and Research Fund, and the company says it’ll be invested into “programs and external research” over the course of two years. Facebook &lt;a href="https://research.fb.com/programs/research-awards/proposals/2021-towards-trustworthy-products-in-ar-vr-and-smart-devices-request-for-proposals/"&gt;has previously funded&lt;/a&gt; academic research into the social impact of AR wearables and solicited VR hardware proposals. Facebook’s announcement blog calls the metaverse the “next computing platform” and says that the company will be working with policymakers, researchers, and industry partners while building it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNEO6U"&gt;The announcement also gives us Facebook’s definition of the sometimes nebulous word “metaverse.” The company describes it as “virtual spaces where you can...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Skype is getting another redesign with new themes and features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/svQeSQx9UKxCH7GBWWILI6skmDo=/0x8:2000x1341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915977/macbook_pro_mockup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skype’s new design and colorful layouts.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rx189p"&gt;Skype’s had more redesigns in the past five years than I’ve had hot dinners, but Microsoft is still ready to try and tweak things once again. The software maker is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skype.com%2Fen%2Fblogs%2F2021-08-announcement-modern-skype%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22696716%2Fskype-new-design-themes-calling-features-updates" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;teasing plans&lt;/a&gt; for an “improved, faster, reliable, and super modern-looking Skype.” Microsoft says it has been listening to feedback and, over the next few months, will start rolling out changes to modernize Skype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cn9KCE"&gt;The most important part of Skype, what Microsoft calls the call stage, is getting the most attention. The grid that’s displayed during calls will soon include everyone on a call, regardless of whether they have enabled video or not. This puts all participants side by side, including your own video in the main interface.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress isn’t satisfied with Facebook’s pause on Instagram Kids</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Ax1zQ"&gt;Facebook announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;it would be “pausing” work&lt;/a&gt; on its Instagram for kids app on Monday after weeks of growing pressure from lawmakers and advocacy groups to scrap the app. But many lawmakers aren’t satisfied with the pause, calling on Facebook to stop development entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgF3ij"&gt;In a statement issued Monday, Democrats in the House and Senate called Facebook’s decision to halt development of the Instagram product targeted to kids under 13 as “insufficient.” Four lawmakers signed onto the statement, including Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Rep. Lori Trahan (D-MA),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3LcslX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook has completely forfeited the benefit of the doubt”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Discord will now let you set a unique avatar in each of the servers where you hang out</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Discord will let you have unique avatars across different servers | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWroiH"&gt;Messaging app Discord announced today that its premium Nitro tier will now allow subscribers to use a different avatar on each of their servers. The option to “change nickname” in the app has been changed to “edit server profile.” That’s where you’ll be able to change both your nickname and server avatar, so if you use multiple servers — as a lot of Discord users do — you can keep each identity separate and unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zepfMG"&gt;Discord also announced today that they’re starting the rollout of scheduled events, which allow users to plan ahead, giving time to spread awareness and join. The company says it’s seeing more communities use stage channels to connect with members, in AMAs, open mic events, or other large-scale discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2yLkm"&gt;With scheduled...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford recalls Mustang Mach-Es over risk of glass roof flying off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FVTrD3NuyU6FkAOB3knodaGPlZY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915483/sokane_210125_4386_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l80R44"&gt;Ford is recalling the Mustang Mach-E out of concern that the windshield and panoramic roof could leak or, worse, come flying off during a crash or while driving. Nearly 18,000 of the electric SUVs sold to date are at risk of the former, though Ford says only around 13,000 of them run the risk of the roof detaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjAEyo"&gt;The company will start providing owners with recall instructions in late October, and it says it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the defect. Ford initially started recalling Mustang Mach-E SUVs last week in Canada, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/21/ford-recalls-mustang-mach-e-risk-of-glass-roof-falling-off-mocking-tesla-same-issue/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Electrek &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5svfw"&gt;Ford told the &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/FORD/MUSTANG%252520MACH-E/SUV/AWD#recalls"&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month that it had become aware that the windshield and panoramic roof of the Mustang Mach-E may...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok says it has passed 1 billion users</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;TikTok has passed 1 billion users | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wUsfUE"&gt;TikTok said Monday it has passed 1 billion monthly users. It’s a remarkable number for a platform launched in August 2018 that has been scrutinized by governments — including the US — that are worried about the data collection practices of its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srkr7J"&gt;TikTok’s popularity soared during the pandemic, becoming the most-downloaded app in the world in the first quarter of 2020, with some &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/05/20/inside-the-hunt-for-tiktoks-new-ceo-and-whats-next-for-the-worlds-hottest-app"&gt;315 million downloads&lt;/a&gt; in that quarter alone according to app analytics company SensorTower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4IqY9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/17/chinas-bytedance-tiktok-owner-saw-revenue-surge-111percent-in-2020.html"&gt;ByteDance reportedly saw its 2020 revenue&lt;/a&gt; more than double from the year prior, to $34.3 billion. From its launch to date, SensorTower says TikTok installs have reached 3.2 billion, which includes information from Douyin, the Chinese...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox is negotiating with music publishers after settling a copyright lawsuit</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4WHnD8"&gt;Virtual world-building platform Roblox has settled a lawsuit with the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) and is negotiating potential deals with individual music publishers. Roblox announced the news this morning, saying it was “committed to partnering with the music industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6B6tS"&gt;The NMPA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527713/roblox-nmpa-lawsuit-copyright-infringement-deadmau5-ariana-grande-imagine-dragons"&gt;sued Roblox in June&lt;/a&gt; for letting users upload copyrighted songs into its shared library of game-building assets. Roblox quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564922/roblox-sony-music-partnership-lil-nas-x-collaboration-licensing"&gt;signed individual deals with BMG and Sony&lt;/a&gt;, but the new agreement settles all claims involving NMPA members. According to a press release and the NMPA, Roblox and the organization have agreed to the terms of an industry-wide settlement that individual music publishers can decide whether to opt in to, and the agreement...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Death Stranding Director’s Cut makes the most of the PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qUguCENQb5zcHfnfTQ5PCU_EUo=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915169/51298386042_570941bddd_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0UuTgs"&gt;Okay, I’ll make the obvious joke: was there really anything cut from &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;? For better and worse, Hideo Kojima’s deeply indulgent post-apocalyptic delivery simulator did not feel like it had been subject to heavy editing. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/7/12/22573731/death-stranding-directors-cut-hideo-kojima-missions-name-debate"&gt;Kojima himself has said&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn’t like the name of this new PlayStation 5 version of the game, dubbed a “director’s cut,” arguing instead that it has simply had new content produced for it. So there you have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQBEUp"&gt;In any case, &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; is one of the more worthwhile PS5 upgrades out there. For $10 (if you own the PS4 release), this new edition comes with extra missions, improved visuals and performance, more tools and items, DualSense-powered haptic feedback, and 3D audio support....&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
