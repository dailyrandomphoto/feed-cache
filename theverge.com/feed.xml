    <title>Microsoft Teams is getting more hybrid work improvements and Apple CarPlay support</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RuWeCQ"&gt;Microsoft is continuing to improve the remote meeting experience in Microsoft Teams with better camera support and other improvements that will let you stay in meetings 24/7, if you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Wm34P"&gt;After rolling out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Together Mode last year&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447048/microsoft-teams-future-meetings-features"&gt;vision for the future of meetings&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Microsoft Teams will soon be updated to support intelligent cameras. These cameras will be supplied by partners like Jabra, Neat, Poly, and Yealink and will enable AI-powered active speaker tracking, multiple video streams, and people recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxrLwu"&gt;They’re the type of cameras that can actually deliver on some of Microsoft’s promises for the future of meetings, enabling cameras in meeting rooms to use audio, facial movements, and gestures to detect...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft gives up predicting when its US offices will fully reopen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft To Layoff 18,000" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7dtDBSccChTz3Z1TOLDCPXn4wp8=/75x0:5168x3395/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834671/452292668.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Stephen Brashear/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="940fVt"&gt;Microsoft is shelving its plans to fully reopen its US offices next month. The software giant had planned to reopen its headquarters on October 4th, but the ongoing uncertainty of COVID-19 and the spike in cases has forced the company to delay its back to the office push. Microsoft isn’t providing a new date to employees, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeW5jh"&gt;“Given the uncertainty of COVID-19, we’ve decided against attempting to forecast a new date for a full reopening of our US work sites in favor of opening US work sites as soon as we’re able to do so safely based on public health guidance,” explains Jared Spataro, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of modern work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTmosP"&gt;This latest delay follows a number of postponements this year to fully reopen Microsoft’s offices....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Y: The Last Man’s showrunner on adapting the comic: ‘It’s not a blueprint for television’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZOHer2RyHdWHu3iQGm-6JpSRP0=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834581/YTLM_101__8937R_copy.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0aFuTm"&gt;A decade ago, when Eliza Clark read &lt;em&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt; for the first time, she kept thinking about how she would adapt it for television. “It combined so many things that I loved,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The story takes place after a mysterious event that kills off everyone with a Y chromosome, with the exception of a man named Yorrick (and his monkey). She describes it as “such an interesting look at identity.” At the time, she was working as a writer’s assistant, so it was mostly a dream. But 10 years later — after a few stops working on shows like &lt;em&gt;The Killing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rubicon&lt;/em&gt; — Clark got the chance to lead FX’s live-action version of &lt;em&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt;. It was an opportunity not only to adapt a series she loved, but to update it for modern...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the PlayStation Showcase 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lZWbCM"&gt;While Microsoft has hosted plenty game showcases in 2021, Sony has been comparatively quiet about what’s coming to the PS5 in 2022. Well, Sony is going to break its relative silence with a 40-minute event that will offer “a look into the future of PS5.” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/02/youre-invited-playstation-showcase-2021-broadcast-next-thursday/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PlayStation Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says to expect updates from its various PlayStation Studios (the number of which seem to grow every month) on games launching this holiday and others that will release in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGpsMT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon: Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; may get some air time, since it’s a PlayStation-exclusive title that’ll be launching in the next handful of months. Of course, there’s more excitement about games we know less about. We’ve yet to see a trailer for the next &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; title, so perhaps it’ll make its...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A bunch of ape NFTs just sold for $24.4 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZHIZSy8yGszg03us9T3shJpnRyM=/0x4:1816x1215/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834413/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_9.20.13_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Six of the 101 apes sold at auction. | Image: Bored Ape Yacht Club / Sotheby’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U49uqm"&gt;If you thought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFT mania&lt;/a&gt; was about to die off, think again: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sothebys.com%2Fen%2Fbuy%2Fauction%2F2021%2Fape-in%2F101-bored-ape-yacht-club&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F9%2F22664469%2Fbored-ape-yacht-club-sothebys-auction-amount" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a bundle&lt;/a&gt; of 101 NFTs from Bored Ape Yacht Club just sold at Sotheby’s for $24.4 million. A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sothebys.com%2Fen%2Fbuy%2Fauction%2F2021%2Fape-in%2F101-bored-ape-kennel-club&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F9%2F22664469%2Fbored-ape-yacht-club-sothebys-auction-amount" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second bundle&lt;/a&gt; of 101 Bored Ape Kennel Club NFTs sold for $1.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAsJw1"&gt;That puts the ape sale among the biggest in the NFT space. A bundle of nine CryptoPunks — one of the earliest NFT projects — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430254/cryptopunks-christies-sale-larva-labs"&gt;sold for $16.9 million&lt;/a&gt; in May. And Beeple sold a collage of his works as an NFT &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; in March. While it’s hard to directly compare all of these sales (there are 101 items in today’s auctions versus one in Beeple’s), the purchases show that the appetite for NFT art isn’t dying down, and they suggest that buyers think there’ll be high resale value as the market continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s latest Dolby Atmos soundbar has a much more sensible price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fZG_hmBPYvz04Xa5o0chFyIDJk0=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834348/01.Hero_Shot_Mid.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7g5Vyd"&gt;I recently reviewed Sony’s flagship 2021 Dolby Atmos soundbar, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22623242/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-review-dolby-atmos-xbox-series-x-ps5"&gt;the HT-A7000&lt;/a&gt;, and found it to be a fantastic performer made even better by two passthrough inputs that offer support for HDMI 2.1 features like 4K gaming at 120Hz. But with a price of $1,300 (and that’s before adding rear surrounds and a sub), Sony’s latest and greatest isn’t going to be practical for everyone. So with that in mind, the company is today announcing a cheaper, smaller model called the HT-A5000 that costs $899.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="le8NMA"&gt;That price puts it somewhat closer in line with something like the Sonos Arc, but Sony’s new soundbar could win people over for its added functionality and future-proofing. The HT-A5000 retains much of what’s good about the higher-end model: it’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing emoji reactions for tweets </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fVELIi"&gt;Twitter is testing emoji reactions for tweets that go beyond a simple “Like,” the company announced today. So, over the coming days, users in Turkey will be able to respond to tweets with the “Face with tears of joy” emoji, “Thinking face,” “Clapping hands,” “Crying face,” or a simple “Heart.” The test is only scheduled to run for a limited time, but Twitter says it might expand it to users in more countries depending on the response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATsNw1"&gt;The idea behind the feature is to give people more ways to quickly show how they feel about a tweet, Twitter says, while providing authors better feedback about how their tweet has been received. The emoji are accessible via a long-press of the Like button, while a short tap will send a regular Like....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s leather AirTag loop drops to its lowest price yet at Amazon</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zhNQnQ"&gt;Apple’s AirTag accessories are, ironically, often more expensive than the Ultra Wideband-ready Bluetooth tracker itself. Today, however, you can pick up a leather AirTag loop in either brown or red at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932PNC7S/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $29&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest price Amazon has sold the accessory for since its release in the spring. That’s a great thing given the nature of AirTags, which controversially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;lack a lanyard hole&lt;/a&gt; that would make accessorizing so much easier and likely cheaper, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HqRRM"&gt;The Apple AirTags Leather Loop is made from tanned leather and normally retails for $39. The stylish case allows you to clip your AirTags to backpacks, keys, and other accessories, while securely holding your AirTag in place. There are other third-party options available that are...&lt;/p&gt;
