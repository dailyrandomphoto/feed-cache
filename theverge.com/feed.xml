    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rS8mPr"&gt;Bukayo Saka, a player on England’s national football team said in an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRWkU6mLLlJ/"&gt;Instagram post Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that social media platforms did not do enough to prevent the racist abuse he and his teammates were subjected to after the team’s loss to Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4814z4"&gt;“To the social media platforms &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/instagram/"&gt;@instagram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/twitter/"&gt;@twitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/facebook/"&gt;@facebook&lt;/a&gt; I don’t want any child or adult to have to receive the hateful and hurtful messages that me Marcus and Jadon have received this week,” Saka wrote. “I knew instantly the kind of hate that I was about to receive and that is a sad reality that your powerful platforms are not doing enough to stop these messages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vfqd8X"&gt;Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Saka, who are Black, were among England’s players to participate in a penalty shootout to decide the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How does Valve’s Steam Deck compare to the Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNfDx1Hfn0R18XRJLqtT9tC0jiE=/214x0:2305x1394/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588345/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_1.18.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRbo7Y"&gt;Valve’s surprising &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;new Steam Deck has been officially announced&lt;/a&gt;, promising to let players take their whole Steam library of games on the go. But how does the handheld compare to other major consoles on the market, like the Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X / S, and the PlayStation 5?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvE5q7"&gt;First off, let’s look at the Steam Deck’s specs. It’s powered by an AMD APU with a quad-core / eight-thread Zen 2 CPU and an AMD RDNA 2 GPU with 8 compute units, alongside 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOIFE4"&gt;There are three models available: one with 64GB of eMMC storage for $399, one with a 256GB NVMe SSD for $529, and a top-of-the-line model with 512GB of high-speed NVMe SSD storage for $649. While the base eMMC storage configuration could potentially mean slower game...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees say the company is cracking down on remote work</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="74nfy4"&gt;Apple employees say it’s harder than ever to get remote work requests approved after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;rolled out a new hybrid model&lt;/a&gt; that will require people to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Some employees say they will quit if Apple doesn’t change its stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNMKlT"&gt;While Apple historically discouraged employees from working from home, there were one-off exceptions to the rule, and some teams were more lenient than others. Now, employees say that even those exceptions are being denied. In a company Slack channel where employees advocate for remote work, roughly 10 people said they were resigning due to the hybrid work policy or knew others who’d been forced to quit. The Slack channel currently has more than...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elgato announces new Stream Deck the same day Valve announces new Steam Deck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Er4refyJyMUgG4zfZktVZjou9E=/8x0:2660x1768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587965/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_1.39.04_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elgato’s new Stream Deck, which is different from Valve’s Steam Deck.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Elgato&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4oVk4r"&gt;Elgato’s Stream Deck is a popular tool for live-streamers, letting them set shortcuts and controls they can access with the push of a button, and the company announced a new model on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-mk2"&gt;the Stream Deck MK. 2&lt;/a&gt;. This version brings a host of welcome improvements, including a detachable stand, interchangeable faceplates, and a removable USB-C cable. You can &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-mk2"&gt;order it right now on Elgato’s website for $149.99&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzKi4m"&gt;While the Stream Deck MK. 2 does seem like a nice upgrade, it was announced on perhaps the worst possible day. Just a few hours ago, Valve made a huge splash by revealing its new handheld gaming console called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Preowc"&gt;While they’re entirely different products, there’s sure to be some confusion about the names “Stream...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds option to instantly delete your last 15 minutes of search history</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YDRprS"&gt;Google is launching a new privacy feature for search that lets you instantly delete your last 15 minutes of search history on mobile, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/new-privacy-tool-search/"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The new option &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe/"&gt;was first revealed&lt;/a&gt; alongside several other search and Chrome improvements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/google-io"&gt;at I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt; and is now rolling out to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19UyiI"&gt;The option to delete your last 15 minutes of search history is currently only available in Google’s iOS app and is headed to Android later this year. On desktop, your options for deleting searches are limited to setting your history to auto-delete every three, 18, or 36 months (18 months is the default for new accounts), or deleting searches by hand. You can see what the new option looks like in the iOS app below:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="PVY1MR"&gt;Twitter said Thursday it was hearing from users who were seeing too many topic suggestions in their home timelines and was moving to remedy the situation. “We’re fixing that now, and will continue to improve Topics and find ways to show you the very best of Twitter. Things you want to see, that is,” its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1415757630836981764"&gt;Support account tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. To its credit, Twitter has seemed more responsive to users’ complaints — or their lack of interest — of late; in addition to Thursday’s topics announcement, Twitter said this week it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;kill off Fleets&lt;/a&gt;, its ephemeral disappearing tweets that apparently no one was using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZqvgt"&gt;But instead of showing us more things we want to see, I think Twitter should lean into taking away things we don’t want. I have a suggestion...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Video game handhelds didn’t die after all</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MbZPFL"&gt;When the beloved PlayStation Vita eventually died out, many blamed the rise of mobile gaming. “I think the PS Vita, while ahead of its time in many ways ... launched at exactly the wrong time in terms of market opportunity,” former Sony vice president of marketing John Koller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545198/playstation-vita-10-year-anniversary-sony-handheld"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about going up against smartphones. But despite the Vita’s demise, dedicated gaming handhelds didn’t die out — in fact, the space is arguably as vibrant as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wl0Okd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;Valve just announced the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, a chunky portable PC that looks like a Sega Game Gear from a parallel universe. It’s designed to let players take their Steam library of PC games on the go. Just a few hours later, preorders opened for the latest iteration of the Nintendo Switch, one that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Self-driving startup Aurora will raise $2 billion in SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vmJI52"&gt;Self-driving technology startup Aurora, which was founded by the former head of Google’s autonomous vehicle program, is the latest company to announce that it’s going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC). The deal will give Aurora about $2 billion in new cash when it closes, which will help the startup in its quest to become a provider of self-driving hardware and software to companies in the trucking and ride-hailing industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwgA16"&gt;Aurora is merging with a SPAC called Reinvent Technology Partners Y that’s already listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, and is run by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus, and investor Michael Thompson). That trio is also in the process of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;taking electric...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jRCmCK"&gt;Online shoppers will eventually see another option listed next to the usual payment methods, now that &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/integrate-facebook-pay-directly-into-business-website"&gt;Facebook Pay will expand beyond the company’s own platforms&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after credit card companies dropped out of its Libra cryptocurrency project, Facebook launched its payments system for use across the main site, as well as WhatsApp and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
