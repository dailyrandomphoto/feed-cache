    <title>How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days, and in iOS 14.5, which is starting to roll out to the public today, there are new privacy features that may make you feel happier but are not endearing Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;The new feature is aptly called App Tracking Transparency. Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple suppliers linked to Uyghur forced labor in new report</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XoKq-dY5VONuf34LH0rcbAS_z6k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264431/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v9l0IJ"&gt;Several Apple suppliers may have used forced labor in China, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fseven-apple-suppliers-accused-of-using-forced-labor-from-xinjiang&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428899%2Fapple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Working with two human rights groups, the publication identified seven companies that supplied products or services to Apple and supported forced labor programs, according to statements made by the Chinese government. The programs target the country’s Muslim minority population, particularly Uyghurs living in Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWjTPW"&gt;Six of the seven suppliers were said to participate in work programs operated by the Chinese government, &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports, which human rights groups describe as frequently offering cover for forced labor. Workers can be jailed for refusing to join the work programs, the report says, and those enrolled in the programs are often...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook wants to make sure you’ve read the article you’re about to share</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68e7momSmK79BvJ29oJAdkeC9SU=/136x0:1756x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264427/E1C5TYUWEAo0YiK.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FaceBook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="80hZFr"&gt;Facebook has announced on Twitter that it will start testing a pop-up that asks users if they’re sure they want to share an article that they haven’t opened. The pop-up will prompt users to read the article, but they can also choose to continue sharing it if they want. Facebook doesn’t say how wide the test will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pG3uXD"&gt;The pop-up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455635/twitter-read-before-you-tweet-article-prompt-rolling-out-globally-soon"&gt;is similar to Twitter’s&lt;/a&gt;, which it started testing in June 2020. Twitter’s implementation of the feature can be annoying to users (myself included) who have read the article elsewhere and decide to share it when they see it pop up on their feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjXWWf"&gt;Facebook says the pop-up is meant to help people be more informed about the articles they share, likely as an attempt to combat the spread of misinformation the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551906/facebook-election-results-misinformation-violence-incitement-trends"&gt;has...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The group is called DarkSide, and &lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-compromise-of-colonial-pipeline-networks"&gt;the FBI has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the group’s malware was responsible for compromising one of the US’s largest fuel pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Harley-Davidson spins out LiveWire as its own electric motorcycle brand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AeZiTC"&gt;LiveWire, the first electric motorcycle from Harley-Davidson, will now become its own standalone brand. The Milwaukee-based company announced that it would be spinning out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172421/harley-davidson-livewire-electric-motorcycle-price-ces-2019"&gt;electric motorcycle division&lt;/a&gt; as its own company with a distinct lineup and a tailored retail experience. Harley-Davidson plans to unveil the “first LiveWire branded motorcycle” on July 8th to coincide with the International Motorcycle Show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8v9piF"&gt;It’s a similar move to how Harley-Davidson approached its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536726/harley-davidson-serial-1-electric-bike-ebike-specs-price"&gt;new electric bicycle company, Serial 1&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that LiveWire continues to benefit from its relationship with its parent company while also forging its own brand identity that is distinct from Harley-Davidson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GiBVgY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Harley-Davidson is interested in letting its electrified...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>YouTube has run the numbers to see how vloggers open their videos</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2b8UnS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/articles/hey-guys/"&gt;YouTube has run the numbers&lt;/a&gt; and discovered what greeting its vloggers most use to open videos: “Hey, guys.” Those findings may not be surprising if you’ve watched a lot of YouTube, but the report actually shows a lot more, including what the runners-up are, how greetings have changed in popularity over time, and how video genre affects the most common openings. Let’s just jump into it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRxQVj"&gt;To get these findings, YouTube did quite a bit of data analysis, looking at the auto- and creator-generated captions from over a million videos. YouTube picked videos that had over 20,000 views from channels that had over 20,000 subscribers, so it is worth noting that the results are more reflective of how relatively popular videos open, rather than of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>State attorneys general pressure Facebook to abandon plans for children’s Instagram</title>

  &lt;p id="XMGgWR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20702192-naag-letter-to-facebook-on-ig-kids"&gt;In an open letter today&lt;/a&gt;, the National Association of Attorneys General called on Facebook to abandon plans for an Instagram platform focused on children under the age of 13. The letter is signed by 44 different state-level attorneys general (including non-states like Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands), representing a majority of US territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0WW96"&gt;“It appears that Facebook is not responding to a need, but instead creating one, as this platform appeals primarily to children who otherwise do not or would not have an Instagram account,” the letter reads. “The attorneys general urge Facebook to abandon its plans to launch this new platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o5bXMO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The attorneys general urge Facebook to abandon its plans”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Bird is reportedly taking its electric scooter company public via SPAC</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bs57Pj"&gt;Bird, the electric scooter company that helped launch the global micromobility boom, is planning to go public via a reverse merger with a special acquisition company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://dot.la/bird-ipo-2652932971.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;dot.LA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Bird is merging with &lt;a href="https://swbk2.com/"&gt;Switchback II Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, a Dallas-based “blank check” company focusing on companies reducing carbon emissions, according to documents reviewed by the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Y3I2h"&gt;Bird is the latest transportation company, but one of only a few e-scooter companies, to go public. A record number of companies have gone public this past year by merging with SPAC shell corporations, which avoids the scrutiny of a traditional IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s9pVxG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bird is the latest transportation company, but one of only a few e-scooter companies, to go public&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
