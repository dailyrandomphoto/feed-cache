  &lt;p id="4eTW0P"&gt;Personal data for some 1.3 million users of the social audio app Clubhouse has been leaked online, &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/security/clubhouse-data-leak-1-3-million-user-records-leaked-for-free-online/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. a SQL database with users’ IDs, names, usernames, Twitter and Instagram handles and follower counts were posted to an online hacker forum. According to &lt;em&gt;Cyber News, &lt;/em&gt;it did not appear that sensitive user information such as credit card numbers were among the leaked info. But the information could be used in phishing attempts to get users to hand over that more sensitive info. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HNpFD"&gt;Last week, &lt;em&gt;Cyber News&lt;/em&gt; reported on another data breach from a social platform: it found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374464/linkedin-data-leak-500-million-accounts-scraped-microsoft"&gt;personal data for 500 million LinkedIn users&lt;/a&gt; had been scraped and posted online.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BqngrE"&gt;South Korean electric-vehicle battery makers SK Innovation and LG Energy Solution have reached a settlment in a US trade dispute, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-10/ford-vw-battery-supplier-said-to-reach-deal-to-avoid-import-ban?utm_source=url_link&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Under the terms of the agreement, SK will pay $1.8 billion (2 trillion won) in cash and royalties to LG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOtNIP"&gt;In a joint statement the companies said they would “work to help the development of EV battery industry in South Korea and the US. through healthy competition and friendly cooperation,” adding that they would “work together to strengthen the battery network and environmentally-friendly policy that the Biden administration is pursuing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8suLsg"&gt;In February, the US International Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9481d70b-827b-476d-9e0b-21245321e289"&gt;imposed a 10-year import ban&lt;/a&gt; on SK Innovation— due to take effect Sunday— following allegations it...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly ran secret ‘Project Bernanke’ that boosted its own ad-buying system over competitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSEhvxYAFq6hozN3kqmpgE3Mr3M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69108688/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l1nPWG"&gt;Google reportedly ran a secret project called “Project Bernanke” that relied on bidding data collected from advertisers using its ad exchange to benefit the company’s own ad system, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-secret-project-bernanke-revealed-in-texas-antitrust-case-11618097760?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. First discovered by newswire &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KhushitaVasant/status/1379955848118726659?s=20"&gt;service MLex&lt;/a&gt;, the name of the project was visible in an improperly unredacted document Google had filed as part of an antitrust lawsuit in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EKR7S"&gt;A federal judge has since let Google refile the document under seal. But according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, “Bernanke” was not disclosed to outside advertisers, and proved lucrative for Google, generating hundreds of millions of dollars for the company. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Texas filed an antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Google in December, alleging that the search giant was using...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China fines Alibaba $2.8 billion after antitrust investigation</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yux4pg"&gt;China has hit Alibaba, one of the country’s biggest online retailers, with a record $2.8 billion (18.2 billion yuan) fine, after an investigation found the ecommerce giant violated China’s anti-monopoly law, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/technology/china-alibaba-monopoly-fine.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. The fine, which represents 4 percent of Alibaba’s 2019 domestic sales, is three times higher than the $975 million fine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/9/8009589/qualcomm-fined-975-million-by-chinese-anti-monopoly-regulators"&gt;China imposed on US chip company Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; back in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkY5lr"&gt;The Chinese government launched an investigation into Alibaba in December to determine whether the company was preventing merchants from selling their products on other platforms. China’s market regulator found that Alibaba’s practices had a negative effect on online retail competition and innovation. Alibaba used data and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lawsuit against Amazon alleging it failed to protect workers from COVID-19 moved back to NY state court</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TI5ZPn"&gt;A federal judge has granted the New York attorney general’s request to move a lawsuit against Amazon back to New York state court, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-new-york-lawsuits/judge-hands-amazon-a-setback-in-new-york-lawsuit-over-covid-19-shortfalls-idUSKBN2BW2TW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. AG &lt;a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=muvelgaOEvSt6Yc1gGqzAg=="&gt;Letitia James’ lawsuit alleges&lt;/a&gt; that the ecommerce giant failed to protect workers at its Brooklyn and Staten Island warehouses from COVID-19 during the early months of the pandemic, and retaliated against employees who complained about the lack of safety measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A54XYG"&gt;Amazon had sought to have the case moved to federal court, arguing that workplace safety issues were not under James’ purview. The company pre-emptively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279819/amazon-new-york-ag-state-lawsuit-covid-19-warehouse-conditions-pandemic"&gt;sued James on February 12th&lt;/a&gt;, and James sued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287204/new-york-amazon-lawsuit-worker-safety-failures"&gt;Amazon four days later&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>First flight test for NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter pushed to Wednesday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Stbpub_rH8IYvuSpE182JbrU3eA=/0x62:1578x1114/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106684/PIA24581.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GhxL8g"&gt;NASA engineers have decided to delay the Ingenuity helicopter’s debut flight on Mars to at least Wednesday, April 14th, after running into a minor computer glitch during a rotor spin test late Friday night, the agency said on Saturday. The tiny craft is healthy, but engineers need some more time to review telemetry data from the unexpected hiccup before proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="On4tsu"&gt;Ingenuity, a mini four-pound helicopter that arrived on Mars February 18th attached to NASA’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Perseverance rover&lt;/a&gt;, was initially slated to carry out its first flight test late Sunday night (or, mid-day Mars time). The first bits of data on whether the flight attempt was successful was expected to come early Monday morning, around 4AM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wHfcD"&gt;But data from a high-speed rotor test...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook spent $23 million for CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s security in 2020</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d0kgVF"&gt;A new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that Facebook spent more than $23 million last year on security for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook’s annual reviews of company security “identified specific threats to Mr. Zuckerberg,” according to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680121000022/facebook2021definitiveprox.htm"&gt;proxy statement filed Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5fk6H"&gt;“He is synonymous with Facebook, and as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” the proxy says of the Facebook CEO’s role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppohbs"&gt;The company’s annual review of security programs showed the costs of protecting Zuckerberg and his family rose in 2020 mainly due to COVID-19 travel protocols, increased security coverage during the 2020 US election season “and other periods with...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="DeQa2j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; games have always taken place against a historical backdrop, but Microsoft and Relic Entertainment want to take things even further with &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt;. The game will feature narrated documentaries throughout the campaigns, time period-accurate language and music, as well as art and game design that looks to take inspiration from both world history and the history of the &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; franchise. On release, &lt;em&gt;Age IV &lt;/em&gt;will focus on the Middle Ages, having players start with small agrarian villages and build up to castles and kings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vY425V"&gt;While players can experience hundreds of years of history in a single match, the game will also feature campaigns that let players go through real-life stories that span generations. So far,...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cYeEH4"&gt;We haven’t heard much about &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16182760/age-of-empires-iv-development-microsoft-pc-release-date"&gt;since it was announced in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ve finally been given a look at the game, which includes the Mongols and Delhi Sultanate as playable civilizations. Microsoft and developer Relic Entertainment showed off a healthy amount of gameplay footage as well as new features and civilizations coming to the series &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OJ14RVFDGQ"&gt;in a “Fan Preview” event&lt;/a&gt;. The game also has a release window: fall 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhNIzS"&gt;The last main entry in the long-running historical strategy series &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_III"&gt;was released in 2005&lt;/a&gt;, and the new game looks to build on the formula created by previous entries, while adding features made possible by 15-ish years of technological improvements. That includes the obvious things — like 4K and HDR — to more strategy...&lt;/p&gt;
