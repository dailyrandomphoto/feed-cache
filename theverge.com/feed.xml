    <title>Tesla rolls out Safety Score-based insurance product in Texas</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cYOj3h"&gt;Tesla is now selling insurance to customers in Texas, two years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20837265/tesla-car-insurance-california-autopilot-discount"&gt;first launching the offering&lt;/a&gt; in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715458/tesla-move-headquarters-to-austin-texas"&gt;now-former home state&lt;/a&gt; of California. But the version in Texas is different. The company says it will evaluate driving behavior in real-time using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;“Safety Score” feature&lt;/a&gt; that it recently launched to screen drivers who want to join the beta test of the company’s “Full Self-Driving” beta software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hsZIn"&gt;That means drivers might wind up paying less — or more — per month based on how many forward collision warnings they rack up, how hard they brake, how “aggressively” they turn, how much distance they leave to the car in front, and whether they keep their hands on the wheel when using Autopilot. Tesla used some driving behavior metrics to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China launches latest crew of three en route to nation’s Tianhe space station</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hVjZKx"&gt;China successfully launched a new crew of three taikonauts into orbit this afternoon, sending them en route to the country’s primary space station, dubbed Tianhe. The crew will &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/china-shenzhou-13-astronaut-launch-webcast"&gt;meet up with the station in roughly eight hours&lt;/a&gt;, sparking a six-month stay in orbit. It’s set to be the longest mission taikonauts have ever taken in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="firstHeading"&gt;The three taikonauts include commander Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping, and Ye Guangfu, part of China’s Shenzhou 13 mission. Zhai has been to space before and even performed the first spacewalk for China back in 2008 during the Shenzhou 7 mission. This will be Wang’s second spaceflight, and she will become the first woman to visit the Tianhe station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TOreLt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wang will become the first woman to visit the Tianhe station&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Tether will pay $41 million over ‘misleading’ claims it was fully backed by US dollars</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n04D5w"&gt;Tether will pay $41 million to settle allegations by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it made untrue or misleading statements when it claimed its stablecoins were fully backed by fiat currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIisGB"&gt;The CFTC said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21"&gt;statement Friday&lt;/a&gt; that between June 2016 and February 2019, Tether misrepresented to customers and the cryptocurrencies markets that it had “sufficient US dollar reserves” to back every token when, in fact, its reserves were not fully backed the majority of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IQAJY"&gt;In addition, the CFTC said, Tether failed to disclose that it included unsecured receivables and non-fiat assets as part of its reserves, falsely telling investors it would conduct routine audits to show it maintained 100 percent of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Batman is getting another Fortnite comic crossover with one of the game’s most mysterious characters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ioquGQUoXmBSCIuPheRwStXZYjA=/0x102:3030x2122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999934/Untitled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DWjjEo"&gt;Epic and DC Comics are teaming up again for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303107/batman-fortnite-comic-crossover-epic-games-dc-launch-date"&gt;another crossover&lt;/a&gt; with the one-shot comic &lt;em&gt;Batman/Fortnite: Foundation&lt;/em&gt; #1, which will arrive in comic book stores on Tuesday, October 26th. The physical comic will also include a bonus code for a Batman Who Laughs skin (which will also be available for purchase in the in-game store) and an exclusive loading screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GezDku"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"With Batman: Zero Point, Fortnite’s lore makes a lot more sense","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399355/batman-fortnite-zero-point-comic-book"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XclQG7"&gt;The new comic will pick up after the six-issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399355/batman-fortnite-zero-point-comic-book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman: Zero Point&lt;/em&gt; crossover comics&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year. But unlike last time, where the Caped Crusader was transported to Fortnite’s uniquely violent island, in the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Batman/Fortnite: Foundation&lt;/em&gt; one-shot, the island — or at least, one of its most mysterious denizens — is coming to face off against Batman in Gotham City:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just fired a leader of the #AppleToo movement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MsR1rRZa5V1NA66eGMooeWmxaQA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999823/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wmn5zY"&gt;Apple has fired Janneke Parrish, a leader of the #AppleToo movement, amid a broad crackdown on leaks and worker organizing. Parrish, a program manager on Apple Maps, was terminated for deleting files off of her work devices during an internal investigation — an action Apple categorized as “non-compliance,” according to people familiar with the situation. The files included apps like Robinhood, Pokémon GO, and Google Drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZWZrT"&gt;Internally, some employees expressed disbelief that Parrish’s firing could be anything other than retaliation for organizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DJxKT"&gt;It’s the second time in recent months that an employee has been terminated after speaking out about Apple’s company culture. In September, the tech giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22666049/apple-fires-senior-engineering-program-manager-ashley-gjovik-for-allegedly-leaking-information"&gt;fired Ashley Gjøvik &lt;/a&gt;for allegedly...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch says passwords weren’t exposed in massive data breach</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ebknHa"&gt;Twitch has definitively stated that passwords weren’t exposed in last week’s major data breach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeWPKD"&gt;“Twitch passwords have not been exposed,” Twitch said in an update to its webpage about &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/10/15/updates-on-the-twitch-security-incident/"&gt;the security incident&lt;/a&gt;. “We are also confident that systems that store Twitch login credentials, which are hashed with bcrypt, were not accessed, nor were full credit card numbers or ACH / bank information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tR4Vv"&gt;Last week, what appeared to be leaked source code for Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712250/twitch-hack-leak-data-streamer-revenue-steam-competitor"&gt;hit the web&lt;/a&gt;, and in Friday’s update, Twitch confirmed that was the case. “The exposed data primarily contained documents from Twitch’s source code repository, as well as a subset of creator payout data,” the company said. Twitch claims that the information exposed “only affected a small...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZmBIZI’s $550 Z2 phone pays you for your data usage</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZmBIZI Z2 is a the $550 4G phone that pays you for the personal data you share on your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HflYoT"&gt;We live so much of our lives on our smartphones these days that our mobile devices are just full of valuable data that we often unknowingly and freely give to all the major tech companies: our spending habits, our personal preferences, our locations, and much more. Since we can’t really live without our phones, and tech companies aren’t going to stop monetizing our data without a fight, we might as well get our cut of the data pie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ooKny"&gt;That’s the premise of ZmBIZI phones, the LA-based and minority-owned startup backed by the &lt;a href="https://streetcredcapital.com/portfolio-item/zmbizi/"&gt;fintech lender Street Cred Capital&lt;/a&gt; that is trying to make our phones work for us. Both its new phone, the Z2, and its proprietary software are designed to share the profit that your mobile data generate, back with you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="vsr8mg"&gt;People with high blood pressure who used a smartphone app and at-home monitor were able to drive down their blood pressure, &lt;a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.27008?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=101521"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; showed. The program, called Hello Heart, lets people track their blood pressure, weight, and physical activity and offers tips on how to manage blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbURGh"&gt;Around half of adults in the United States have high blood pressure, but only around a quarter of those people have the condition under control. It can be a tricky condition to manage, particularly if people are only getting measurements taken in the doctor’s office — where it can be higher (from the stress of a doctor’s visit) or lower (through a condition called masked hypertension) than it is at home. But it can be dangerous and puts people at...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now order the new Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis controllers for Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R56AKlVhZWOudvESqo3NBJvRqAY=/4x0:1597x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999507/switch64genesiscontrollers.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
