    <title>Amazon’s AWS logs third outage this month, affecting Slack, Epic Games Store, Asana and more</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iuvhOy"&gt;Amazon’s crucial web services business AWS is experiencing problems today, with issues affecting services like Slack, Imgur, and the Epic Games store for some users. It’s not looking good if you’re working from home, with some Slack users unable to view or upload images, and work management tool Asana also hit by the outages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMi62F"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-12/a17eae991fdc437d"&gt;incident update&lt;/a&gt;, Slack said its services are “experiencing issues with file uploads, message editing, and other services.” Asana says the problems constitute a “&lt;a href="https://status.asana.com/incidents/xm08pc5v6mlk"&gt;major outage&lt;/a&gt;,” with “many of our users unable to access Asana.” Epic Games Store &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1473644098632441860"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “Internet services outages” are “affecting logins, library, purchases, etc.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJBnzJ"&gt;It’s the third time in as many weeks that problems with AWS have had a significant...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk: metaverse isn’t ‘compelling’ and Web3 ‘more marketing than reality’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Gigafactory - Elon Musk" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B57EFAEDZn3YjaHhz9z0IcTw-gc=/0x254:3926x2871/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305222/1234657391.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ILHVa9"&gt;The metaverse and Web3 are two trends supposedly set to revolutionize the digital world. But the richest man IRL, Elon Musk, is not keen on either. In a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/BaRKd4U6Ixg"&gt;recent interview&lt;/a&gt;, the SpaceX and Tesla CEO said he couldn’t see a compelling use-case for the VR-driven metaverse, and derided Web3 — a nebulous concept in which internet services are rebuilt around blockchain and cryptocurrency — as “more marketing than reality,” adding “I don’t get it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iAyTA"&gt;Musk admitted that he might just be “too old” to understand these new technologies. “Am I like one of those people who was dismissing the internet [in] ‘95 as some fad or something that’s never going to amount to anything?” he suggested, before noting that in 1995 he was very much one of the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor teases its first foldable, the Magic V</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j2pwUinsJGQl1dhcvrq1b99SY2w=/0x0:9999x6666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304931/HONOR_Magic_V.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0burOg"&gt;Former Huawei sub-brand Honor has teased the launch of its first foldable smartphone, the Honor V. An image shared &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3206603957/L7bOzxmnz?pagetype=profilefeed&amp;amp;layerid=4717137157950853"&gt;on its Weibo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Honorglobal/status/1473563964340678658"&gt;Twitter accounts&lt;/a&gt; teases the design of the device, showing a telltale hinge between the two halves of the device. The Weibo post says the “folding flagship is about to be released,” though no exact launch date has been announced and Honor declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b12PHd"&gt;Honor has been open about its desire to release a foldable for some time. As early as 2019, the company’s CEO George Zhao &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/honor-ceo-wants-to-launch-5g-phone-in-2019-foldable-phone-in-2020/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he was interested in producing a foldable under the Honor brand, but expressed concerns that the device would be too expensive for Honor’s younger target market. In June this year, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-foldable-phone-report-dscc/"&gt;reports emerged&lt;/a&gt; that development of...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjBRnX"&gt;Another year, another gigantic tech tradeshow that looks like it may be falling apart as the COVID-19 pandemic continues — now that T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert, one of the Consumer Electronics Show’s featured speakers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065"&gt;has publicly announced&lt;/a&gt; that his company won’t be attending the world’s largest electronics show next month. Amazon has also decided not to attend the show in-person, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1473486307657539584?s=21"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL resumes selling its Google TVs after rolling out software fixes</title>

&lt;p id="gTfkgI"&gt;The Google TVs represent TCLs effort to take a platform agnostic approach with its TV hardware; the company is best known for its popular sets that come preloaded with Roku software, but it has also manufactured Android TV products.

    <title>LG’s new 16:18 monitor looks like a multitasking powerhouse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVNWPAC4X6Ycy-L8nVHxgBRCsFw=/93x0:1085x661/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304258/LG_DualUp_Lifestyle_00.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J9ivA9"&gt;Are monitors with traditional aspect ratios just not getting the job done for you? LG might have the answer. Today the company has announced what it touts as “a completely new format in the monitor market” called the DualUp. With a unique 16:18 aspect ratio, LG claims the DualUp gives you “the same screen real estate as two 21.5-inch displays and has a vertical split view function that lets users see more in one glance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnqeJY"&gt;With a resolution of 2560x2880 and measuring 27.6 inches on the diagonal, the DualUp (model 28MQ780) tops out at 300 nits of brightness and covers 98 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. It attaches to LG’s included Ergo stand, which can clamp to “most” desks and tables to save on space. Aside from the productivity and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Still on the hunt for the perfect gift? Here are some last-minute ideas</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kj64xj"&gt;So the holidays are just days away, and you’re panicking because you still haven’t found a gift yet. Perhaps the present you wanted to give simply won’t arrive in time, or maybe you’ve just been too busy — or lazy — to pick something up (no judgment there). Whatever the reason, don’t worry; thanks to the internet, procrastinators, busy bees, and even lazy folks can still buy some great digital gifts without needing to leave their house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lPllZ"&gt;The only problem? There are tons of digital gifts to choose from, ranging from streaming subscriptions to concert tickets, and finding the right one can be overwhelming. That’s why we’ve rounded up a few gift ideas across a number of popular categories, including film and travel, so you quickly choose,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel will put unvaccinated employees on unpaid leave</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RNRH6dgAYM1egyIPOrecxVraQgw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304134/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YZ8lqp"&gt;Intel has reportedly notified employees that anyone who remains unvaccinated will need to get the COVID-19 vaccine or submit an exemption by January 4th. Otherwise, they face being put on unpaid leave, according to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-religion-oregon-1366bdfdf1f72d947fddfe39694f2223"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2021/12/intel-oregons-largest-employer-tells-unvaccinated-employees-they-may-face-unpaid-leave-in-april.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oregonian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzYmrZ"&gt;In the December 7th memo obtained by both publications, Intel HR boss Christy Pambianchi said unvaccinated employees will need to seek an exemption or get weekly tests, even if they’re working from home. She also reportedly told employees that the company will review medical and religious exemptions up until March 15th of next year. The company initially put the January 4th vaccine deadline &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2021/11/intel-oregons-largest-employer-sets-vaccine-deadline-for-us-workers.html"&gt;in place last month&lt;/a&gt;, but didn’t specify what would happen to unvaccinated employees if they didn’t...&lt;/p&gt;
