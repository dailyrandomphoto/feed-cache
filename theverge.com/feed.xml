    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EMp8N7"&gt;Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holidays may have come and gone, but there are still some great discounts available on Apple’s AirPods. In fact, we’ve actually been seeing some deals that are even better than they were during the recent shopping holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SziSp1"&gt;Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in October and unveiled its new AirPods lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. Even better, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen AirPods,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s videoconferencing monitor has a 4K webcam, USB-C hub, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UHhroWBBZDKjDoLhfyV2iUH1OK8=/136x0:1765x1086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348012/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_12.26.01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ft98ee"&gt;Dell’s new 32-inch UltraSharp videoconferencing monitor supports 4K in more ways than one — the first, obvious for a display, is its 3840 x 2160 panel. But it also has a built-in 4K webcam, perfect for the age of Zoom meetings and working from home. Better still, you can connect to the monitor with a single USB-C cable, which will provide a video signal to the screen and send 90W of power back to your laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYe2pb"&gt;The monitor’s official name is the U3223QZ (Dell’s naming is catchy as ever), and its webcam uses a Sony 4K HDR STARVIS CMOS sensor. That’s similar to the imaging tech that Dell uses for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22553857/dell-ultrasharp-4k-webcam-features-price-release-date"&gt;its $200 external UltraSharp webcam&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike that device, the monitor has two built-in microphones. Dell also says that you’ll be able to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will pay top execs $1 million each after declining to boost workers’ pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit 2016" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4C4plmDrDIFTz7byk2DKL-MqdU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347985/615656976.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JrBlFq"&gt;Google is giving four of its top execs a significant pay bump, raising their salaries from $650,000 to $1 million, just weeks after the company told staffers it wouldn’t automatically adjust salaries to account for inflation. The new executive salaries were disclosed in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204422000009/goog-20211228.htm"&gt;an SEC filing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwv9Gi"&gt;The executives receiving the $1 million base salaries are chief financial officer Ruth Porat, senior vice president Prabhakar Raghavan (who is in charge of Google search); senior vice president and chief business officer Philipp Schindler; and president of global affairs and chief legal officer Kent Walker. All four executives are eligible to “participate in a maximum $2,000,000 annual bonus program, based on contributions to Google’s performance against...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon joins T-Mobile and AT&amp;T by offering a truly unlimited mobile plan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RioKII8rw-_HAUG5yHKi7ZJVcYs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347981/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon is the latest carrier to offer a mobile data plan without monthly caps on its fastest network speeds.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VkTGlc"&gt;Verizon has &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/power-verizon-5g-ultra-wideband-coming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;updated its unlimited plans&lt;/a&gt; in anticipation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;new 5G spectrum coming online &lt;s&gt;tomorrow&lt;/s&gt; soonish&lt;/a&gt;. The new plans cost the same and include the same level of access to the carrier’s Nationwide and Ultra Wideband 5G networks, but the priciest Get More plan receives a notable upgrade: unlimited monthly “premium data.” That puts it on even terms with the other major carriers’ top-tier unlimited plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llbC6h"&gt;The plans previously known as Start, Play More, Do More, and Get More Unlimited are now called 5G Start Unlimited, 5G Play More Unlimited... you get the idea. The Get More plan ($90 / month for one line with autopay) previously included 50GB of premium data each month — once customers reached that limit, they’d be subject to slowdowns...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia still has no idea how to pronounce the name of its best gaming GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E6jwFu65pwQ_HbDdOct1PuNKcQI=/112x0:1312x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347965/85lXfjr.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GpIOHA"&gt;Ti or Ti?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRCi0k"&gt;It’s a question that’s plagued Nvidia fans for years, ever since the company started appending the “Ti” designation to its most powerful GPUs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866454/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2022"&gt;like the RTX 3090 Ti&lt;/a&gt; that Nvidia just announced at CES 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JvwW8e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia announces RTX 3090 Ti with faster memory and performance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866454/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fnCbFv"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; do you pronounce “Ti”? There are two camps: those who pronounce it “tie,” like the neck garment or the first syllable of “titanium,” while others fervently insist that it’s pronounced as initials: “tee-eye.” Not even Nvidia seems to know which is right, as the company’s CES presentation showed — different presenters switched back and forth between saying “tie” and “tee-eye” from one segment to the next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ylzn2o"&gt;Should “GeForce” be called “Gee-Eee Force”? Of course not. Do you say “Ertex” instead of RTX? Preposterous. But...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is testing a Twitter-like Repost button for sharing videos </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1QJeszsZ6W4lctCI0z2_76Lu9E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347937/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ippRK5"&gt;The highly addictive clock app is testing a feature that should save you the trouble of having to DM the most share-worthy clips from your For You page with friends. TikTok has introduced a “Repost” button that works a little like Twitter’s retweet feature — but it doesn’t appear to be available to everyone yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CH5y5G"&gt;Several sites &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/tiktok-testing-repost-button-will-share-content-your-followers"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/tiktok-repost-button"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/20/tiktok-testing-new-way-to-let-users-repost-content-on-the-social-network/"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt;, and social media consultant Matt Navarra &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1472579035641397252"&gt;tweeted an image&lt;/a&gt; of the button on December 19th. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;today reported a more &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/tiktok-tests-its-own-version-of-the-retweet-with-a-new-repost-button/"&gt;detailed explanation&lt;/a&gt; of how the tool works in practice, including that it seems to be limited to the For You feed from the share menu rather than throughout the TikTok app. (Videos that are shared can similarly be un-shared from this menu as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMU7oO"&gt;Additionally,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai imagines a world in which it has turned everything into a robot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYYqGf2zRzg6nbMgtOJukM29Ohw=/390x0:4610x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347904/CES2022_KV_2._MoT_ecosystem.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IJWVdu"&gt;Hyundai has already showed off some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839417/hyundai-mobed-wheeled-robot-mobility-device-ces-2022"&gt;practical robotics concepts&lt;/a&gt; last month in the lead-up to the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show. Now the South Korean automaker is going full galaxy brain with the introduction of a new “Mobility of Things” concept that it claims will power a whole slew of objects, from household plants and book shelves, to ambulances and autonomous passenger pods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfoIKg"&gt;The spectrum of things that can be roboticized (for lack of a better term) is “unlimited,” said Dong Jin Hyun, vice president and head of Robotics Lab of Hyundai Motor Group, in a statement. “The goal is for robotics to enable all kinds of personal mobility, connected to communicate, move and perform tasks autonomously.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All the gaming laptops announced at CES 2022 with the latest Intel, AMD, and Nvidia mobile components</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware X14" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bsBFTNMfPfSmSVMXGKmyfPOXEm0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347778/cfaulkner_141231_4943_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vYefvT"&gt;As is usually the case for CES, there is an abundance of gaming laptops being announced for release in early and mid-2022 that have at least two of the following traits in common: they have Intel’s 12th Gen H-series processors, or they support AMD’s Ryzen 6000-series processors, and they have Nvidia’s new RTX 3070 Ti or RTX 3080 Ti graphics chips. What’s more, many of them will also support DDR5 RAM at 4,800MHz. It’s a great time to be shopping for a laptop, as these seem faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbXbph"&gt;There are always outliers we won’t catch, and we’ll be making more passes at this through the week, but there are currently well over a dozen laptops coming that have some combination of these components. We’ve covered the biggest CES 2022...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Latest Google Pixel update fixes bug that prevents 911 calls with Teams installed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel, Android, emergency contacts" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DVGKTVTBuaRoHSxGALtCjHFr9Fk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347707/akrales_190318_3299_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7jFTA8"&gt;Google is bringing an update to older Pixel devices to fix a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826272/911-failure-google-android-microsoft-teams-bug"&gt;dangerous bug that prevents users from calling 911&lt;/a&gt;, as noted by a post on a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143968432/google-pixel-update-january-2022?hl=en"&gt;Google support page&lt;/a&gt;. The bug stems from an unintended interaction between the Android OS and Microsoft Teams — it only affects devices with Android 10 or later and could occur if you have Teams installed but aren’t signed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZKEH1k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The update resolves the “issue preventing emergency calls in certain conditions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jw2DTf"&gt;On the support page, Google notes that the update resolves the “issue preventing emergency calls in certain conditions while some third-party apps are installed.” It’s available on devices running Android 12 (including the Pixel 3 and up), but the update hasn’t rolled out to the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro...&lt;/p&gt;
