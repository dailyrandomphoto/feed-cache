    <title>Dream of mid-air wireless charging teased with rollable Oppo X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YnofQDNtJeeqWU0JBdKfWuyPlgY=/88x0:736x432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860411/Jyr8m06UdO.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OHAS6g"&gt;Oppo has teased a new wireless charging solution that appears to work when a phone is held as much as a foot above a charging pad. The company has shown off the tech in a &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4607703588020148"&gt;30-second clip on its Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/press/oppo-to-unveil-innovations-partnerships-at-mwcs-2021/"&gt;coincide with MWC Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;. The clip shows the Oppo X 2021 rollable concept phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;announced in November&lt;/a&gt;, charging above the pad, even when held at an angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgVaeJ"&gt;The Chinese manufacturer is the latest to announce a truly wireless air charging solution, following Xiaomi and Motorola’s teases from earlier this year. Back in January, Xiaomi announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;Mi Air Charge Technology&lt;/a&gt;, which it says can charge multiple devices at 5W “within a radius of several meters.” The next day, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-no-contact-wireless-charging/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on a demonstration from Motorola which showed...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s an interactive 4K view of Perseverance’s Mars landing site</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x7S8PCm-Qp1z7kKm0nSW1nFk_vg=/86x0:2465x1586/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860299/mars_rover_360.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uqzMmt"&gt;NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has posted an interactive 360-degree view of the Perseverance landing site on Mars in 4K resolution. It’s the latest jaw-dropping imagery to return from the mission, including that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295739/nasa-perseverance-rover-landing-mars-video-footage"&gt;incredible video&lt;/a&gt; of the rover plunging through the Martian atmosphere before being “skycraned” down to the surface of the red planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wmdpi"&gt;The 60-second video was captured by Perseverance’s color Navcams perched atop a sensing mast above the rover. The 360-degree scene can be navigated in a browser or in the YouTube app on your phone. The images were captured on February 20th, two days after the Perseverance landed in the Jezero Crater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lq2RVo"&gt;Perseverance has a total of 23 cameras, the most of any Mars rover to date: 16 for engineering...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook brings back news after Australian government amends upcoming law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xub-iudHy2nODLjOZTmQ3XP_H4Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860276/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EvhhJ5"&gt;Facebook will restore news content to its platform in Australia after the government agreed to amend its proposed News Media Bargaining Code. In an &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/"&gt;update posted today&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s William Easton, managing director of Australia and New Zealand, said that the company is “satisfied that the Australian government has agreed to a number of changes and guarantees that address our core concerns.” News content will return to the platform “in the coming days,” Easton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSYHRd"&gt;Facebook and Google have been at loggerheads with the Australian government about an upcoming law that will require them to pay publishers for content shared on their platforms. In response to the proposed bargaining code, Facebook took the extreme measure last week of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;blocking...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk co-authored a COVID-19 antibody study of SpaceX workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KGzjQm"&gt;More that 4,300 SpaceX employees volunteered to be part of a COVID-19 antibody study co-authored by CEO Elon Musk in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ocuyw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-021-21336-8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22295821%2Fspacex-employees-covid-study-paper-antibody-research-elon-musk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, which was recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, shows evidence that infected people who exhibited milder symptoms developed less of an immunity to COVID-19 than those who got sicker from the disease. The group behind the study found some evidence that suggests there’s a particular threshold of antibodies that could provide immunity, though they wrote that “the precise levels [...] associated with protection from re-infection remain unclear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nmst0R"&gt;Vaccines also produce a much stronger immune response than cases with little to no symptoms, the authors note. They hope that this research, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/health/covid-vaccine-single-dose.html"&gt;o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG denies the Rollable phone has been put on hold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TqQeaVOklqPzLrYnZIpT9moH_yE=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68859280/LGRollable.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71AgBO"&gt;LG Electronics has told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company’s phone with a resizable screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;the LG Rollable&lt;/a&gt;, has not been put on hold. “I can firmly deny that any such decision on future mobile products has been finalized,” says an LG spokesperson. The denial comes in response to &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210222005600320"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Yonhap News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that LG had reportedly told parts suppliers that the Rollable had been put on hold and that they could request a refund for their development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WO1AeI"&gt;Denying that a final decision has been made is not quite the same thing as reassuring everyone that the Rollable is still coming in 2021, but it could reflect the general uncertainty that comes with designing, manufacturing, and shipping complicated electronics during a global pandemic. And it...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google has finally added iOS’s privacy labels to Gmail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lDiTaGgRPH8tpV59gVwCp7BsgcU=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68859215/IMG_0879.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Pn0zK"&gt;Google has finally added Apple App Store privacy labels to its Gmail app, almost a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250648/google-apple-app-store-privacy-label"&gt;we ran an article wondering what was taking so long&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/google-gmail-app-privacy-labels/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The app is the second major Google app to get the labels, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/13/22282000/google-bug-fix-ios-youtube-app-privacy-apple-gmail-docs-search-update"&gt;they were added to YouTube&lt;/a&gt; when it was updated earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohaNAl"&gt;So how does it look? Well, that’s up for you to decide. The app apparently shares your coarse location and user ID with advertisers, as well as information about your interaction with advertisements. According to the privacy label, though, it doesn’t collect your name, physical address, or phone number (though as an email client, Gmail obviously collects your email address). Location data is also used for analytics and there are some features of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Starlink internet speeds will double to 300Mbps this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4g4FjE"&gt;Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite-based internet provider, will double in speed “later this year”, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363763858121256963?s=20"&gt;a tweet by Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, posted as a reply to someone who had just received their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536073/spacex-starlink-public-beta-testing-email-user-terminal"&gt;Starlink beta kit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/elon-musk-spacex-will-double-starlinks-satellite-internet-speeds-in-2021/?ServiceType=facebook_page&amp;amp;UniqueID=D7D4F968-7539-11EB-B2F4-9E263A982C1E&amp;amp;PostType=link&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0a&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-02-22T18:14:45"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company &lt;a href="https://www.starlink.com"&gt;currently promises speeds between 50 to 150Mbps&lt;/a&gt;, and Musk specifically calls out a 300Mbps goal in his tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Z4EGl"&gt;While 300Mbps isn’t unheard-of speed, it’s faster than many people currently have access to, especially in the low-to-medium population density areas that Musk talks about targeting in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363774017606348802?s=20"&gt;a second tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lucid Motors is going public in a major SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LX5SBy"&gt;Lucid Motors is going to become a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in a deal that will leave the electric vehicle startup with $4.4 billion in cash. The California startup, which is majority-owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, plans to start shipping its first luxury electric vehicle — the 500-mile range Air sedan — later this year. An electric SUV is slated to follow in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxUhx6"&gt;Much like many other startups in the automotive space have done over the past year, Lucid Motors is skipping the traditional path to becoming a publicly-traded company and is instead merging with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, Lucid Motors is merging with Churchill Capital Corp IV, which is already...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="dXeJYE"&gt;Sony is bringing back its &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal &lt;/em&gt;franchise, but this time it’s going to be a TV show, not a video game. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/twisted-metal-tv-series-deadpool-writers-1234911825/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the show is moving ahead in its production, with the writers of &lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt; and actor Will Arnett signed on as executive producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5i8WA"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/em&gt; games center mainly around getting in a heavily armored car and blowing other drivers up. The series, which the head of PlayStation Productions calls “one of the most beloved franchises from PlayStation,” started on the original PS1 and got releases on the PS2 and PS3 as well (though my personal favorite was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Metal:_Head-On"&gt;the PSP version&lt;/a&gt;, which I sunk hours upon hours into).

  &lt;p id="QclUa4"&gt;Dish Network co-founder and chairman Charlie Ergen underscored the company’s commitment to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8931827/dish-carrier-plans-5g-network-tmobile-sprint-us-confirms"&gt;building a 5G wireless network&lt;/a&gt; on today’s Q4 2020 earnings call. He restated the intention to bring 5G online in its first major cities by the end of Q3 2021 — that’s the period running from July through September — and was bullish on Dish’s ability to boost the US’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;somewhat dismal global position&lt;/a&gt; in terms of wireless network offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px7YNP"&gt;Ergen spent several minutes on &lt;a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/yi3fxcbb"&gt;today’s call&lt;/a&gt; recapping what the company has done so far in its network-building effort. With its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquisition of Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; last year, it’s currently offering prepaid service as an MVNO on T-Mobile’s network, but it has also been accumulating its own spectrum to make the move to a...&lt;/p&gt;
