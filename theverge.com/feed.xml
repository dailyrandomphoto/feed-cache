    <title>Twitter says it will fix disappearing tweets issue</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KoYj7l"&gt;Twitter is planning to make some changes that could prevent tweets from disappearing while you are reading them, the company said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1440766157884039170"&gt;on its support account Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sB3MIx"&gt;Here’s what you might have run into. If you were looking at a tweet on your timeline, and at the same time someone else you follow replied to it, or the original tweeter threaded it, the app would suddenly refresh, while the tweet disappeared from view. That’s obviously not ideal, so Twitter plans to make changes over the next two months to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b0rUwN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The background: a Tweet would move up the timeline as replies were added to the ongoing convo. Since some convos can evolve quickly, this made it so you didn't see the same Tweet repeated in the TL. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our changes will keep...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Nokia’s new G50 is a $300 5G phone with a big battery and two years of OS upgrades</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-KxYIa3RB9oWPphcH1iu4V4w3Ic=/0x125:3000x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895204/Nokia_G50___Beauty_1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G50 has a triple rear camera system.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nokia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sK3V8q"&gt;Nokia has a new midrange phone coming to the US and a number of global markets. The new G50 costs $299 and has all the ingredients to be competitive as a midrange phone, with a 6.82-inch HD+ display, big battery, audio jack and 18W fast charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOnRac"&gt;This G-series phone is similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;Nokia X20&lt;/a&gt; that was announced back in April 2021, but the G50 has a bigger screen and battery and comes in a version specifically designed for the North American market (AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile). Unsurprisingly, it supports the slower 5G Sub 6, which means this phone will work on T-Mobile’s 5G network, but not on Verizon’s mmWave network, and will only get 4G reception on AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9lJF9"&gt;Like other 5G phones in the $300 range, the Nokia G50 is powered by the modest Snapdragon...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon collaborates with Billie Eilish on an Echo Studio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Jy2s61mlmnaq0ia2idExoWds0o=/0x240:5760x4080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895066/Billie_Eilish_Limited_Edition_Echo_Studio_Lifestyle_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon has revealed its new collaboration with singer Billie Eilish: a limited-edition Echo Studio speaker.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cN4AmS"&gt;If you were in a tizzy about what to get the devoted Billie Eilish fan in your family for the holidays, Amazon might have just solved your problem — assuming you’re prepared to drop $230 on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3ANSZ"&gt;Announced today, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Billie-Eilish-Limited-High-fidelity-speaker/dp/B0939S1B5R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Billie Eilish Limited Edition Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is available for pre-order and features the melancholy-voiced singer pasted on the side of Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;highest-end Echo speaker, the Studio&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, the album cover art from Eilish’s new album “Happier Than Ever” has been printed onto a new beige-hued fabric and wrapped around the Echo Studio. It creates a slightly eerie-looking product that supposedly someone, somewhere, will want to put in their home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxSHR1"&gt;This is Amazon’s first foray into celebrity skins; previous attempts to dress up...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook names a new CTO with a major focus on hardware</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqkdYE"&gt;Facebook is serious about being a long-term player in hardware. On Wednesday, the company promoted Andrew Bosworth, the current head of its hardware division that makes Oculus and other consumer devices, to the role of chief technology officer, replacing outgoing CTO Mike Schroepfer when he becomes a senior fellow next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O10AU3"&gt;In his new role, Bosworth, who goes by Boz, will continue to lead the hardware group, called Facebook Reality Labs, while also assuming responsibility for Facebook’s broader software engineering organization and artificial intelligence efforts. He’ll report directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has taken a keen interest in developing AR glasses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;and the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 builds in better customer support for in-app purchases</title>

  &lt;p id="TqNtaO"&gt;As part of this week’s launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15, iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667046/apple-watchos-8-feature-release-date"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;, Apple &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1mmydqta&amp;amp;1632329842"&gt;also introduced StoreKit 2&lt;/a&gt;, a set of APIs for in-app purchases and subscriptions. The new Swift-based tools could help developers better track and support the purchases their users make instead of relying on third-party solutions like RevenueCat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlDZfh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/storekit/"&gt;The kit introduces new APIs&lt;/a&gt; to “determine product entitlements and eligibility for offers, quickly get a user’s history of in-app purchases, find out the latest status of a subscription with one simple check,” and most importantly, offer a way for users to manage subscriptions and request refunds in-app. Apple is also updating the App Store server API and App Store server notifications so developers can know when a user’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC resurrects a decade-old rule as a guardrail on the health app explosion  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ah7DKZLGQnkx4vNYbS3j7QRqBLQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895010/acastro_200512_1777_socialDistance_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9XNotX"&gt;Health apps have to tell their users about any data breaches or risk a hefty fine, the Federal Trade Commission clarified in a &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1596364/statement_of_the_commission_on_breaches_by_health_apps_and_other_connected_devices.pdf"&gt;policy statement last week&lt;/a&gt;. The rule that requires that transparency is a decade old, but it hasn’t been enforced before. The new guidance serves as a warning to the many companies elbowing into the health app space: the FTC is taking issues around health data privacy seriously — even if it won’t be able to tackle all the privacy gaps on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxyBqy"&gt;The FTC’s Health Breach Notification Rule covers all organizations that aren’t subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which covers things like doctors and insurance companies. HIPAA requires those groups to disclose any time they have...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X will be available in store at Best Buy tomorrow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/abKiM9j2UTrDrncw0JACGLW-WDs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69894944/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vZNp0N"&gt;For the most part, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have been sold exclusively online since their launch in late 2020, but that’s changing, at least a little bit, starting tomorrow. Best Buy will stock the next-gen consoles — specifically, the disc-based PS5, PS5 Digital Edition, and Xbox Series X — in several of its US stores, and getting one will be similar to the process the retailer uses for selling graphics cards in person. You’ll need to show up early and form a queue, then, at 7:30AM local time, Best Buy employees will hand out one ticket per customer for as many consoles as each store has in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aCLt3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fclp-video-games%2Fnext-gen-consoles-event%2Fpcmcat1632156747229.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1632156747229&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Check Best Buy’s list of participating retailers to see if you should consider lining up early&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Texas sued over terrible social media law</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wxsz2P"&gt;NetChoice and the Computer &amp;amp; Communications Industry Association (CCIA) have sued to stop Texas from enforcing HB 20, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22661626/texas-social-media-law-hb-20-signed-greg-abbott"&gt;a new law barring large social media companies&lt;/a&gt; from banning users or removing content based on the “viewpoint” of the user. The tech industry groups’ suit comes two weeks after Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the bill, and it follows a lawsuit that successfully &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457200/ccia-netchoice-lawsuit-florida-social-media-law-unconstitutional"&gt;blocked a similar rule&lt;/a&gt; in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeViTa"&gt;HB 20 is one of multiple state-level efforts to make companies like Facebook and Twitter leery of moderating the accounts of conservative users. Texas lawmakers have positioned the bill as an anti-censorship provision, but NetChoice and the CCIA argue that it — like the Florida law before it — violates companies’ First Amendment...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord starts testing YouTube integration weeks after Google shuts down music bots</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9XiKy"&gt;Discord is starting to test YouTube integration, just weeks after Google-owned YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22669502/youtube-discord-rythm-music-bot-closure"&gt;forced two popular Discord music bots offline&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube integration has started appearing in a small number of Discord servers today as part of what appears to be a new test of a collaboration between Discord and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EhvSS"&gt;The feature is called Watch Together, and as the name implies, it allows Discord members to watch YouTube videos together. A test of a similar Discord feature &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/jtnso2/social_party_games_on_discord/"&gt;started 10 months ago&lt;/a&gt; before disappearing and resurfacing as Watch Together today, and we understand the company has re-prioritized this particular feature due to the recent music bot shutdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord’s new Watch Together feature in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;p id="lsg7EP"&gt;YouTube is testing an official way to download videos on your desktop web browser (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/22/youtube-gets-official-video-downloads-on-the-web-saving-you-from-using-some-very-sketchy-sites/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you want to see if you’re eligible for the test, which runs through October 19th, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/new"&gt;check out YouTube’s experimental features page&lt;/a&gt;, which lists tests available for Premium subscribers. I was able to opt in to the test, but a colleague of mine wasn’t, which seems to indicate that not everyone is able to try the feature just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy3wOj"&gt;If you’re opted-in and on a supported browser (“the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, or Opera,” according to Google), when you’re watching a video, you should see an option to download the video under the player. When you click it, YouTube will download the video, which you can then watch from the Downloads...&lt;/p&gt;
