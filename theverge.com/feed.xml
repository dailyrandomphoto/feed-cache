    <title>OnePlus’ latest true wireless earbuds offer noise cancellation for $99</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uVNUnN"&gt;OnePlus’ latest pair of true wireless earbuds are the $99 OnePlus Buds Z2. They’re double the price of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515636/oneplus-buds-z-earbuds-announced-features-price"&gt;$49.99 OnePlus Buds Z&lt;/a&gt; from last year but now benefit from active noise cancellation, a shorter stem, and a more lightweight construction. They’re available now in the US and will release in the UK and EU on December 20th for £99 and €99, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdarED"&gt;Although the Buds Z2’s price sits halfway between the Buds Z and OnePlus’ more premium $150 Buds Pro, it actually has better battery life than both of them. Battery life from the earbuds themselves is around five hours with ANC turned on, rising to seven hours when you turn it off, and combined with the case you get up to 38 hours total (dropping to 27 hours with ANC on). In...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo says test vehicle was in manual mode when it struck a pedestrian in San Francisco</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Waymo vehicle apparently struck a pedestrian in Lower Haight in San Francisco | KWillets on &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/rhlcg8/our_neighbor_was_hit_by_a_selfdriving_car/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IJ7ZkG"&gt;A Waymo autonomous vehicle struck a pedestrian in San Francisco Wednesday night, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/rhlcg8/our_neighbor_was_hit_by_a_selfdriving_car/"&gt;according to a post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesperson for the Alphabet-owned company confirmed the incident on Twitter but clarified that the vehicle was in manual mode at the time of the collision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hl1Y4Z"&gt;The incident took place in the Lower Haight neighborhood of San Francisco, where Waymo has been testing its vehicles since last summer. The Reddit user KWillets, who claims to have witnessed the collision, posted a photo of a Waymo vehicle stopped in the middle of the road with the driver-side door open. A firetruck is parked to the side, while a number of firefighters and bystanders are gathered in front of the vehicle. According to KWillets:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The House is a creepy stop-motion anthology coming to Netflix in January</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmvDbkc8h1i3wcmxreGFNMxyAzk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281494/The_House_Chapter2_00_45_54_23.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="58dteY"&gt;Once the holidays are over, and the &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt; marathons are done, you might be looking for something a little gloomier to watch — and it looks like Netflix has just the thing. The company just revealed the first trailer for its upcoming stop-motion anthology &lt;em&gt;The House&lt;/em&gt;, which debuts next month. It’s described as an “eccentric dark comedy about a house and the three surreal tales of the individuals who made it their home” that also has talking cats and mice for some reason. Each episode of the anthology is helmed by a different director — that includes Emma de Swaef and Marc Roels, Niki Lindroth von Bahr, and Paloma Baeza — and it’s produced by Nexus Studios. It also looks like it has quite the cast, with voice talent including Helena...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple delays full office reopening and is giving every employee a $1,000 bonus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WsOlSF"&gt;Apple has indefinitely delayed the date on which corporate employees will have to return to the office, according to a letter that CEO Tim Cook sent to staff on Wednesday. The letter, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, said the company’s date for returning to work, was “yet to be determined,” and he encouraged all employees to get the coronavirus vaccine and booster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HLBgb"&gt;“Our offices remain open and many of our colleagues are coming in regularly, including our teams in Greater China and elsewhere,” Cook wrote. “As we look forward to more of our teams being together again, we will continue to make decisions based on local conditions and will be sure to notify you at least four weeks before beginning the pilot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awDSvn"&gt;The news was first...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast adds a Ring-style video doorbell to its Xfinity Home package</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xfinity Video Doorbell" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hUUPDRudzs8-yns2uNLCnJZJrpk=/200x0:1280x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281307/xfinity_video_doorbell.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xfinity Video Doorbell&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Comcast&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uVvPSw"&gt;For customers who’ve chosen to trust Comcast with their home security, it’s &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-launches-new-video-doorbell-for-xfinity-home-customers"&gt;adding a new Xfinity Video Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; that pops up a notification both in your Xfinity app and on your TV through a Flex or X1 box when someone is at the door. There are many options for video doorbells these days, but Comcast’s includes HD video quality, two-way audio so you can speak to visitors even if you’re not at home (or don’t want to get off of the couch), motion alerts, and 24/7 video recording.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xfinity Video Doorbell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l8KSDO"&gt;If you want a video doorbell but have already gone the Ring, Nest, or Wyze smart home route, it’s unlikely to sway you, but it’s an option that slots in with the rest of the company’s security...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok says it’s varying For You recommendations to avoid harmful content holes  </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kJ16Lk"&gt;TikTok is changing its For You Page algorithm to prevent users from seeing too many similar videos that could be harmful when viewed in clusters, the company &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to steer users away from clusters of videos that might “reinforce a negative personal experience,” listing extreme dieting, sadness, and breakup content as examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2L9kK"&gt;“At TikTok, we recognize that too much of anything, whether it’s animals, fitness tips, or personal well-being journeys, doesn’t fit with the diverse discovery experience we aim to create,” the company says in its release. The For You feed uses metrics like how long a viewer &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/inside-tiktoks-highly-secretive-algorithm/investigation-how-tiktok-algorithm-figures-out-your-deepest-desires/6C0C2040-FF25-4827-8528-2BD6612E3796"&gt;lingers over content&lt;/a&gt; to recommend videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NISK3R"&gt;TikTok’s personalized recommendations algorithm has been the subject of scrutiny....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can soon rate your favorite podcast on Spotify</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rlaumz"&gt;Spotify is coming for Apple Podcasts’ star rating system with one of its own. The company &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/show-your-favorite-podcasters-you-love-them-with-spotifys-new-star-ratings-for-podcasts/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s launching a five-star rating system for podcasts. Listeners will be able to leave a rating after they listen to a show for at least 30 seconds, and the average rating will be displayed on a show’s landing page once at least 10 have been submitted. Spotify says the feature is meant to make it “easier for listeners to decide when to try out a new podcast” and that these ratings will “serve as the first chance to draw new listeners in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvkqpB"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/updates/spotify-podcast-ratings"&gt;explicitly encourages&lt;/a&gt; podcasters to shout out Spotify and tell listeners to rate them there. This is likely the primary motivator for Spotify. The trope of “rate and review” on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai’s new four-wheeled robot is designed to carry anything you want it to</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3wQuQFroXGARLt4U53K_-TGKP_o=/58x0:793x490/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281166/hyundai_robot.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tz7K8f"&gt;South Korean automaker Hyundai is used to making machines that move, but the company is now tackling the problem of mobility on a much smaller scale than usual. Instead of new cars, it’s announced at CES this year &lt;a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3467"&gt;a four-wheeled robot named MobED&lt;/a&gt; that’s designed to carry, well, anything you like — from parcels to people; TV screens to trays of drinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZuP3X"&gt;MobED is about the size and shape of a dolly you might find in a workshop or garage. It’s 67cm long and 60cm wide, with four 12-inch pneumatic tires that can be controlled independently via a trio of motors at the end of each axel. A complex suspension system means its central platform can be tilted in any direction, letting MobED keep goods level when driving up or down a ramp and adjust...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest AirPods are currently cheaper than they were on Black Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-II7Ukqd8GJx6lHJo0VIACbTo5I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281083/akrales_190327_3315_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s second-gen AirPods are just $89.99 right now at Amazon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EQuJMI"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are always a popular gift, but they can be expensive, regardless of which model you opt for. Thankfully, you can currently nab the entry-level model for less than $100, making them a great present for friends and family if you don’t mind waiting until &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcMZA1"&gt;Right now, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling Apple’s second-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; with delayed shipping for $89.99, matching their lowest price to date. It’s also less than what we saw them for on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when they were selling for around $110. The last-gen earbuds may be older and lack the wireless charging case found on the more expensive configuration, but they still offer great wireless performance, reliable battery life, and excellent ease of use,...&lt;/p&gt;
