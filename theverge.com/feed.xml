    <title>The Apple Watch Series 6 is $279 at Best Buy and Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eUDfNC"&gt;The best deal available today is on the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 with Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity. Usually $399, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747116002201048292" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $279 at Best Buy through Saturday, July 24th&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is honoring this deal, too, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5RBMRN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;even going a bit lower with a $265 price&lt;/a&gt; (though, act fast as Amazon’s stock tends to sell out faster than Best Buy’s). The thing is, this price cut is limited to the Product Red colorway that has a red aluminum case and a red sport band. This is great news for people who can’t get enough of the color red in their lives, but it’s probably not most people’s first choice in terms of how they’d like their Apple Watch to look. It’s hard to argue with the price, though. We’ve seen it sell for $20 less than this, but not since late in April. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LeOAFFIkXYozdeIB8E_xA9aqhlg=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/joy_con_01.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch was, like most consoles during the pandemic, once in short supply. Thankfully, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart now routinely stock the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite in multiple color configurations and models, giving those who struck out ample opportunity to purchase Nintendo’s versatile console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DW6Flb"&gt;We’re keeping an eye across the web to find where you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; (the portable-only version of the console), and the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;, as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — new, preowned, or otherwise — may still occasionally sell out as a result of the pandemic. However, we’ll do our best to keep this article...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus’ Passthrough API will enable experiences that mix VR and the real world</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="399LsB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/mixed-reality-with-passthrough/"&gt;Facebook announced&lt;/a&gt; a new API that will let developers incorporate video from the Quest 2’s sensors into their games and applications, creating a mixed reality experience. With the Passthrough API, developers will not only be able to mix the black-and-white images from the headset’s sensors into their experiences, but they’ll also be able to customize how it ends up looking to the player, apply effects, and even have the real world show up on specific surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NSqs5"&gt;Facebook’s announcement includes examples of how the API could improve productivity software by allowing integration of real-life keyboards and desks, and how games could include your real-life furniture for enemies to hide behind. It’s also easy to imagine other fun experiences...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NSO’s Pegasus spyware: here’s what we know</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9CVHZQ"&gt;Throughout the past week, we’ve seen story after story about a company called NSO Group, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582532/pegasus-nso-spyware-target-phones-journalists-activists-investigation"&gt;a piece of spyware called Pegasus&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the stories have been shocking, with allegations that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/"&gt;fully updated smartphones can be hacked with a single text message&lt;/a&gt;, and reports that two women close to murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/jamal-khashoggi-wife-fiancee-cellphone-hack/"&gt;were among those targeted&lt;/a&gt; by a government agency using the spy tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zewapH"&gt;A coalition of news outlets, including &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; is behind the reporting, and they’re calling it the Pegasus Project. The project was led by Forbidden Stories, an organization of journalists that works on stories after the original reporters have been silenced in some way. Amnesty International &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/"&gt;ran detailed...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Europa Clipper will fly on SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y82nJ5"&gt;NASA’s &lt;a href="https://europa.nasa.gov/"&gt;Europa Clipper&lt;/a&gt; will start its journey to Jupiter’s icy moon aboard a Falcon Heavy rocket built by SpaceX. &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-launch-services-contract-for-the-europa-clipper-mission"&gt;NASA will pay SpaceX $178 million&lt;/a&gt; to launch the vehicle in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXHqTs"&gt;The Europa Clipper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/18/8803679/NASA-Europa-clipper-mission-development-phase"&gt;got the green light from NASA in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. It will fly by the moon 45 times, providing researchers with a tantalizing look at the icy world, believed to have an ocean lurking under its icy crust. The Clipper is equipped with instruments that will help scientists figure out if the moon could support life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jx9QMy"&gt;For years, the Clipper was legally obligated to launch on NASA’s long-delayed Space Launch System (SLS). But with the SLS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173176/nasa-space-launch-system-inspector-general-audit-over-budget-schedule"&gt;perpetually delayed and over budget&lt;/a&gt;, NASA has urged Congress to consider allowing the Europa Clipper to fly...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian raises another $2.5 billion as it looks to build a second factory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rkOa1w"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Rivian has raised another massive round of funding, this time to the tune of $2.5 billion, bringing its total raised to date over the $10 billion mark. The funding round comes as Rivian recently confirmed it’s looking for a location to build a second factory — one that will also produce batteries for its vehicles — in the United States. The company is currently aiming to roll its first electric pickup trucks off the line at its existing factory in Illinois this September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsnBtD"&gt;The new round was led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Ford, D1 Capital Partners, and funds advised by T. Rowe Price, each of which are already investors in Rivian. Amazon and Ford each own &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1388538580881002501"&gt;more than 10 percent of the buzzy EV startup&lt;/a&gt;, and are...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workers for Google Pittsburgh contractor HCL reach tentative union contract</title>

  &lt;p id="tC3WNl"&gt;The United Steelworkers Union (USW) &lt;a href="https://www.usw.org/news/media-center/releases/2021/usws-tentative-first-contract-with-tech-firm-hcl-improves-wages-job-security"&gt;said Friday&lt;/a&gt; it has reached a tentative contract deal with a sub-contractor for Google Pittsburgh. The announcement comes almost two years after employees of engineering and IT contractor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882206/google-tech-contractors-union-vote-pittsburgh-united-steelworkers"&gt;HCL Technologies voted to unionize&lt;/a&gt;, saying that even though they worked alongside Google employees, they didn’t receive the same benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLtTx5"&gt;Amanda Parks, a member of the USW bargaining committee who works at HCL, said in a statement that the proposed three-year contract includes “meaningful wage increases” and addresses pay parity concerns. It includes language that offers job security and additional time off, according to the statement. “We work hard, and we deserve what all workers deserve, an agreement that reflects...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max will release 10 Warner Bros. films straight-to-streaming in 2022 </title>

  &lt;p id="vUuoTO"&gt;After deciding to release its full slate of 2021 Warner Bros. films on HBO Max under a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;hybrid streaming and theatrical model&lt;/a&gt;, it appears WarnerMedia is prepared to continue using its Warner Bros. assets to lure subscribers to the service in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOVswX"&gt;During AT&amp;amp;T’s second-quarter earnings call this week, the company’s executives were asked about how the pandemic release model would shape a more permanent release strategy going forward, particularly as it relates to theaters. Citing the theatrical success of &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt; to the tune of $463 million in revenue, WarnerMedia chief Jason Kilar responded that while “the motion picture format absolutely matters,” the company also feels “very good about the response that consumers have given it...&lt;/p&gt;
