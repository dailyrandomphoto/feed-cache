    <title>The Mortal Kombat movie is at its best when it mimics the games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yEqSRe"&gt;For a series about people getting their spines ripped out, &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; has a surprising amount of story. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512337/mortal-kombat-11-ps4-xbox-switch-ed-boon-interview"&gt;Over three decades&lt;/a&gt; the fighting franchise has amassed a large mythos, filled with histories, lore, and motivations for its many combatants, which are mostly used to answer the question of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; somebody is having their spine and / or arms removed. You wouldn’t really know that from watching the new movie, though. The film features plenty of callouts to the games — gruesome fatalities, goofy one-liners, and lots of familiar faces — but it never stops long enough to tell you why you should care about anything. It’s also not particularly fun, despite all of the aforementioned ripped-off arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l85XAv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat &lt;/em&gt;largely follows the same basic...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty: Warzone pulls a Fortnite with the launch of its new map</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1vV57SPrM9w8C8qSw95r54o2-cw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69172111/cod_warzone.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZhFLey"&gt;After launching a little over a year ago, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most popular free-to-play titles right now, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396481/call-of-duty-warzone-100-million-players-apex-legends"&gt;100 million people&lt;/a&gt; playing the battle royale shooter. Following a &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/call-of-duty/22396153/call-of-duty-warzone-destruction-of-verdansk-part-1-nuke-servers-event-playlist-bug-crash"&gt;nuclear missile that destroyed the game’s map&lt;/a&gt;, the in-game city of Verdansk is back with a new map set in the year 1984, as seen in the announcement trailer above. This mirrors a similar move made by its competitor &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole"&gt;destroyed its original map&lt;/a&gt; and replaced it with a new one in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5m1762"&gt;Despite the shape and layout remaining the same as its predecessor, players will notice changes to most locations along with a 1980s vibe that fits the game’s new time period. Verdansk ’84, the name of the new map, has some alterations to make it a new...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook pivots from politics to ‘inspiration’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O-izgVZPVUuVj_JebfaqMsm62EI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69172064/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uHz4r3"&gt;Facebook wants to inspire, apparently. The company announced changes to its News Feed today that are supposed to fill feeds with things users like, rather than the content that annoys them. At the end of March, Facebook began introducing filters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359782/facebook-news-feed-turn-off-algorithmic-ranking-favorites-most-recent-filter-bar"&gt;to allow users to customize their feed&lt;/a&gt;, and now, the company is hoping to learn more about what users like and dislike, with what seems like a special focus on &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/incorporating-more-feedback-into-news-feed-ranking/"&gt;moving away from political content and toward “inspirational posts.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vi9f5"&gt;The company has been under intense scrutiny for helping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/11/16449976/facebook-political-ads-trump-russia-election-news-feed"&gt;fan the flames of political division&lt;/a&gt; in the US and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055348/facebook-trump-election-2020-leaked-memo-bosworth"&gt;playing an outsized role in elections&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook’s influence on both issues has largely stemmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183341/facebook-misinformation-report-nathalie-marechal"&gt;from the misinformation&lt;/a&gt; that’s been spread on the platform. It’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton treadmill accidents spark push to change product safety law</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MfJJru"&gt;Congressional Democrats have introduced a bill that would make it easier for the Consumer Product Safety Commission to warn people about unsafe products, by repealing part of a 49-year-old law that limits what information the agency can release publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4hbZZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Sunshine%20in%20Product%20Safety%20Act%20-%20Bill%20Text.pdf"&gt;The Sunshine in Product Safety Act (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; comes after reports that exercise machine company Peloton “obstructed CPSC’s investigation” into its Peloton Tread Plus treadmill, according to the members of Congress. The Tread Plus has been involved in some 39 accidents where children were injured, including one death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dd5C6N"&gt;The CPSC “was unable to alert the public of the reported incidents related to children, pets, and objects getting pulled under the treadmill until a month later,” according to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>University of Minnesota banned from contributing to Linux kernel</title>

  &lt;p id="LpXTUS"&gt;The University of Minnesota &lt;a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210421130105.1226686-1-gregkh@linuxfoundation.org/"&gt;has been banned&lt;/a&gt; from contributing to the Linux kernel by one of its maintainers after researchers from the school apparently knowingly submitted code with security flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1g4Or"&gt;Earlier this year, two researchers from the university &lt;a href="https://github.com/QiushiWu/QiushiWu.github.io/blob/main/papers/OpenSourceInsecurity.pdf"&gt;released a paper&lt;/a&gt; detailing how they had submitted known security vulnerabilities to the Linux kernel in order to show how potentially malicious code could get through the approval process. Now, after another student from the university submitted code that reportedly does nothing, kernel maintainer and Linux Foundation fellow Greg Kroah-Hartman has &lt;a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210421130105.1226686-1-gregkh@linuxfoundation.org/"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; calling for all kernel maintainers to reject any code submissions from anyone using a umn.edu email address.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat now has more users on Android than iOS</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iibYMU"&gt;Snap has finally reaped the benefits of building a fully functional Android app. The company &lt;a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1'21-Earnings-Slides-Final-4.22.21.pdf"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in its earnings report today that its user base mostly uses Android instead of iOS. That overall user base continues to grow, too. During the first quarter of 2021, Snapchat reached 280 million daily active users, an increase of 22 percent year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uqCPD"&gt;CEO Evan Spiegel called the moment Android users overtook iOS users a “critical milestone that reflects the long-term value of the investment we made to rebuild our Android application,” in his prepared remarks today. As a reminder, Snapchat originally launched only on iOS and released its first Android app in 2012. The team later spent over a year rebuilding the app to bring it up to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch chat is getting threaded replies</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kojdoV"&gt;Twitch users will be able to make threaded replies in Twitch chat starting today, the popular streaming platform announced. Threaded replies could make it a lot easier to have side conversations within Twitch chats, which are sometimes chaotic waterfalls of text with no easy way to tell who might be talking to another. Twitch is calling the new feature Chat Replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDqw9F"&gt;To start a threaded reply, just hover over a message, click the arrow that will appear, and then type your message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tV4iPy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Chat Replies help you keep the conversation going, even when chat is going off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try out new message threads, keyboard shortcuts and more, now available to all communities on Twitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more: &lt;a href="https://t.co/jwrAkCYUU6"&gt;https://t.co/jwrAkCYUU6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/DTPr2EFnCB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DTPr2EFnCB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>College student sues Proctorio after source code copyright claim</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QEg3w5"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has filed a &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/document/johnson-v-proctorio-complaint"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the remote testing company Proctorio on behalf of Miami University student Erik Johnson. The lawsuit is intended to “quash a campaign of harassment designed to undermine important concerns” about the company’s remote test-proctoring software, according to the EFF. It’s the latest legal battle for the software company, which has publicly sparred with online critics throughout the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzQ9k6"&gt;The lawsuit intends to address the company’s behavior toward Johnson in September of last year. After Johnson found out that he’d need to use the software for two of his classes, Johnson dug into the source code of Proctorio’s Chrome extension and made a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ejohnson99/status/1303121786637373443"&gt;lengthy Twitter thread...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch SpaceX’s third crewed mission to the ISS</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;(NASA/Joel Kowsky)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HXRZ6P"&gt;SpaceX is slated to launch its third crew to the International Space Station early Friday morning, ferrying two astronauts from NASA, one from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and the first European Space Agency astronaut to fly a private US spacecraft to orbit. The four-person crew will launch atop SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket at 5:49AM ET on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuHIpk"&gt;The mission, dubbed Crew-2, marks the second operational mission under the Commercial Crew Program, NASA’s public-private initiative to revive its human spaceflight capabilities after a 10-year dependence on Russian rockets. It will mark the first time NASA astronauts fly a reused crew capsule — Crew-2’s ride first flew in May 2020 as SpaceX’s first astronaut mission, carrying Bob...&lt;/p&gt;
