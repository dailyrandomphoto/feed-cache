    <title>The Supreme Court pared down a controversial anti-hacking law</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="76uI31"&gt;The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), a controversial anti-hacking law which bans “exceeding authorized access” on a computer system, was narrowed by the Supreme Court on Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-783_k53l.pdf"&gt;in a 6-3 ruling&lt;/a&gt;. The court said the law shouldn’t cover people misusing systems they’re allowed to access — and that claiming otherwise would criminalize a “breathtaking amount” of everyday computer use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08PEaS"&gt;The court case, &lt;em&gt;Van Buren v. United States&lt;/em&gt;, concerns a former Georgia police officer named Nathan Van Buren. Van Buren accepted $5,000 in exchange for looking up a woman’s license plate in a police database. (The deal was actually an FBI sting operation, and the plate number was fictitious.) Because the exchange violated department rules, prosecutors said...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says Bing’s ‘Tank Man’ censorship was a human error</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5bDTkb"&gt;On Microsoft’s search engine Bing, searching for “Tank Man,” the iconic figure from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, turned up no image results in the United States for part of Friday. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8v9m/bing-censors-tank-man"&gt;Vice was able to produce the same results&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and heard from multiple users from other countries who ran into the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLTXln"&gt;Stranger still, searching “Tank Man” or “Tiananmen Square Tank Man” turned up normal search results in Bing, it’s just images that were mysteriously missing. When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted Microsoft for an explanation, it said “&lt;em&gt;This is due to an accidental human error and we are actively working to resolve this.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NoL7SF"&gt;It’s an unfortunately timed accident...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees push back against returning to the office in internal letter</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rit5s"&gt;Apple employees are pushing back against a new policy that would require them to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Staff members say they want a flexible approach where those who want to work remote can do so, according to an internal letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FS3kub"&gt;“We would like to take the opportunity to communicate a growing concern among our colleagues,” the letter says. “That Apple’s remote/location-flexible work policy, and the communication around it, have already forced some of our colleagues to quit. Without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; being a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok says the repeat removal of the intersex hashtag was a mistake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yp5JK2SsRPG3dGrnOGaImYPkUEo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69408728/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvqKBf"&gt;Pidgeon Pagonis, an intersex activist, noticed last week that the #intersex hashtag wasn’t working on TikTok. They couldn’t click the tag on one of their own posts and trying to search for intersex pulled up a “null” page. This was the second time Pagonis noticed the tag disappearing, and they worried that TikTok had banned it just as they were about to start a series of celebratory videos called Intersex Joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDvsUT"&gt;Pagonis usually feels safe on TikTok because people on the platform are generally receptive to intersex topics. After growing up with secrecy, lies, and shame around being intersex, Pagonis sees TikTok and other platforms as spaces where intersex people “can connect with each other and also advocate for ourselves and each other,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia and Valve are bringing DLSS to Linux</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xIcCCe"&gt;Linux gamers using Valve’s Proton compatibility tool to run Windows games will be getting a performance upgrade in the future: Nvidia has announced that it’s working with Valve to bring FPS boosts using its DLSS technology featured on its RTX cards. It’s almost enough to make me want to revisit Linux gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMlmCl"&gt;DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, is a technology that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;lets gamers get more performance&lt;/a&gt; without having to give up too much image quality. It does this by running the game at lower-than-native resolution (say, rendering the game at 1080p when your monitor is 4K), but then upscaling the image to native resolution using some mightily impressive algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lF3KWd"&gt;The tech will, of course, be exciting for people with Linux gaming...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s why you can’t use the Siri Remote’s best feature on Disney Plus and other apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rae05jsZeZ7Xy96tJWJe7bcRUQ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69408279/DSCF3939.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The redesigned Siri Remote for Apple TV.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LEFtbk"&gt;Apple’s new Siri Remote introduced a gesture that makes it easy to scrub through content by turning the control pad into a scroll wheel. But a number of Apple TV users noticed that the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22518296/apple-new-siri-remote-hbo-max-disney-plus"&gt;doesn’t work properly&lt;/a&gt; on some services, like HBO Max, or at all on others, like Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQyWtu"&gt;A spokesperson for Disney Plus confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the feature — one of the best on the redesigned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; — isn’t supported on its service. It’s not a service issue, though, but instead related to custom video players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2k9Pz"&gt;Some streaming apps available on Apple TV use their own players, while others use the tvOS media player. The jogging gesture works with streaming apps that use Apple’s native media player, but it is not yet supported for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey would rather give you a bitcoin wallet than Twitter features worth paying for</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VEEp0E"&gt;Twitter Blue — the social network’s first subscription product that adds an undo button to tweets among other minor additions like changing the color of icons and adding folders for bookmarks — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;launched on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. It’s limited to Canada and Australia for now but has already garnered attention for lacking the features people would be willing to pay Twitter for, like no ads, or better tools to handle harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klVH51"&gt;Which makes Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s thread today, the day after the product launched, somewhat humorous and frustrating. What can we say: the guy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22230028/jack-dorsey-donald-trump-twitter-ban-moderation-bitcoin-thread"&gt;loves to talk about bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, even when other more pressing matters are at hand! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tzZlQm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Square is considering making a hardware wallet for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;. If we do it, we would build it entirely...&lt;/p&gt;
