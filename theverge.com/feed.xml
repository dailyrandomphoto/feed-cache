    <title>Chrome 88 update includes important security fix for zero-day vulnerability  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bJeGaw"&gt;It’s more important than usual to update to the latest version of Chrome. &lt;a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/02/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_4.html"&gt;Version 88.0.4324.150&lt;/a&gt; of Google’s browser released on Thursday fixes a vulnerability which the search giant says is actively being exploited in the wild. The update is rolling out now across Windows, Mac, and Linux. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a98BeO"&gt;Google isn’t providing specific details about the CVE-2021-21148 vulnerability “until a majority of users are updated with a fix.” But &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-patches-an-actively-exploited-chrome-zero-day/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that the date Google says the bug was reported on (January 24th) is just one day before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250060/google-threat-analysis-group-north-korean-hackers-cybersecurity-researchers-social-engineering"&gt;Google’s Threat Analysis Group publicly disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a hacking campaign that appeared to be relying, in part, on an unpatched vulnerability in Chrome. It said government-backed hackers based in North Korea had set up a blog...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s new concept phone has a waterfall display on all four edges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jK59Er"&gt;Xiaomi has &lt;a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/02/05/xiaomi-debuts-its-first-quad-curved-waterfall-display-concept-smartphone/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its latest phone concept: a “quad-curved waterfall display.” This means that the unnamed phone’s screen not only has deep 88-degree “waterfall” curves on the left and right sides, but on the top and bottom as well, leaving no room for ports or buttons. Xiaomi says this is intended to “extend the limits of the display to infinity” and enable “a true, port-free unibody design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8of3rK"&gt;The obvious question is how that could possibly work at the screen’s corners, and based on the promotional imagery it looks like Xiaomi is simply leaving them blank with small, rounded cutouts. Not quite infinity, then, but still a neat trick — although for people who already don’t like the comparatively modest curved displays on phones like the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Baltimore’s spy planes will fly no more</title>

  &lt;p id="ufzLWv"&gt;Baltimore, Maryland city officials have unanimously voted to end the city police department’s spy plane surveillance program, &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-plane-canceled-20210203-ha3ixtgiyfg4rpgmfftrsd6uwu-story.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Baltimore Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88ab8b/baltimore-has-officially-ended-its-creepy-spy-plane-program"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Sorry, wait, the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) had a spy plane program?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jg7x59"&gt;Yes, and it was called AIR, which stands for Aerial Investigation Research. The program was run by a company called Persistent Surveillance Systems (super friendly name), and it used airplanes and high-resolution cameras &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/baltimore-police-aerial-surveillance-cameras#maincontent"&gt;to capture what was happening in a 32-mile square mile area of the city&lt;/a&gt;. It also started out as a secret, with the police department paying for it not with city funds, which would be subject to public scrutiny, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9a3nyp/baltimore-police-cant-explain-why-their-all-seeing-spy-planes-were-kept-secret"&gt;but with funding from two Texas billionaires&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer built a Thunderbolt 4 dock stuffed with ports and Chroma RGB lights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Thunderbolt 4 Dock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XCSmFVsFB6oxrj0i86eIMPmEEis=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68772644/razertb4dockhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Thunderbolt 4 dock is littered with useful ports&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3lG6Qy"&gt;If you’ve been hunting for a Thunderbolt 4 dock for your new laptop, Razer has a new option for you to consider, simply called the Razer Thunderbolt 4 Dock. It’s loaded with ports, and of course, Chroma RGB lighting, too. Razer says it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18246182/usb-4-thunderbolt-3-specs-features-release-date"&gt;USB4&lt;/a&gt; compliant, so it’ll be compatible with the next wave of fast peripherals and devices. It’s available for preorder through Razer for $329.99, which seems competitive for what it offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz0FXI"&gt;Taking a trip around this understated, matte black aluminum dock, its front hosts a fast UHS-II SD card slot, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a single Thunderbolt 4 port to plug straight into your computer. On the back is where you’ll find most of the ports, including a barrel jack for its 135W power source, three...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Huntsman V2 Analog is the latest keyboard built to mimic a controller’s joysticks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Huntsman V2 Analog" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMSfVGHNLrq43a7f7f0rbLIBzpM=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68772647/huntsmanv2analoghero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4zGsLV"&gt;Razer’s latest mechanical keyboard, the $250 Huntsman V2 Analog, looks similar to the company’s previous models, but the biggest differences lie in the switches. This model’s optical switches support adjustable actuation (the amount of movement required to register a press), allowing for near-endless customization through Razer’s Synapse software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LdSJW"&gt;Perhaps the most appealing feature of these keys is that, instead of being limited to the usual on / off nature of key actuation, they can be programmed with analog inputs to emulate a controller’s joysticks for smoother, variable levels of movement and control. You’ll be able to program the keyboard so that pressing a key down slightly will make you walk slowly in game, while pressing it...&lt;/p&gt;

But if you want to try the feature now, you can, as Apple has released public betas for both iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luZbYl"&gt;Before these releases, people using iPhones with Face ID while wearing a mask could only unlock their phone by entering in their passcode manually, which can quickly become a hassle. But with the new updates installed, if your Apple Watch is unlocked (which it most likely is if it’s sitting on your wrist) and as long as it’s nearby, when you try to unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask, you’ll feel a little buzz from your Apple Watch and your iPhone should...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford is more than doubling its investment in electric and autonomous vehicles to $29 billion </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkFBfj"&gt;Ford is increasing its investment in electric and autonomous vehicles to $29 billion, the company’s top executives said in an earnings call Thursday. The automaker had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/15/16892386/ford-electric-car-11-billion-2022-detroit-auto-show-2018"&gt;previously committed to spend $11.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; on electrifying its vehicle lineup through 2022. Now, Ford says it will spend double that amount, while extending the timeline to 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCUVZg"&gt;The automaker will spend $7 billion on autonomous vehicles and $22 billion on electric ones. That $22 billion includes $7 billion that the company has already spent since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OkBldR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The automaker will spend $7 billion on autonomous vehicles and $22 billion on electric ones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Pinterest had a giant fourth quarter thanks to a strong holiday season</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JI8rg3"&gt;Like other online platforms, Pinterest reaped the benefits of an uptick in e-commerce advertising during the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LCvWI"&gt;The image-sharing platform saw a 76 percent year-over-year jump in fourth quarter revenue, to $706 million, the &lt;a href="https://investor.pinterestinc.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2021/Pinterest-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx"&gt;company said Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Pinterest had 459 global million monthly active users (MAUs) in the fourth quarter, up from 442 million in &lt;a href="https://investor.pinterestinc.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2020/Pinterest-Announces-Third-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx"&gt;its third quarter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6kOE5"&gt;Pinterest said in its &lt;a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/958601754/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Pinterest-Q4-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;letter to investors&lt;/a&gt; that its revenue growth was mostly driven by a robust holiday season and product improvements in advertising. It saw a six-fold increase in the number of businesses that used its shopping ads format during the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even you can afford Serena Williams’ gamer chair</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r0uqc3ozgb637VyVpPDOY8jU6IU=/320x0:2354x1356/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771476/Screen_Shot_2021_02_04_at_4.56.20_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qq8XB6"&gt;There’s a great deal to gawk at in Serena Williams’ house, from the perfectly shined wood floors to furniture made of Elmo dolls. But there’s one item that feels out of place in house full of luxury: a cutesy pastel gamer chair. You can spot the oddly pedestrian item in a &lt;a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/step-inside-serena-williams-striking-florida-home"&gt;recent feature from &lt;em&gt;Architectural Digest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqScUJ"&gt;There’s no rule that a legendary athlete like Williams needs a bougie, high-end chair that costs more than most people’s rent. But given the other features of her house (see: hidden room and big clear piano), it’s surprising, and a little endearing, to spot something so... average. As &lt;a href="https://jezebel.com/serena-williamss-interior-decor-is-a-nerds-delight-1846199282"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jezebel &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, Williams’ chair — dubiously named “Zeanus Pink Ergonomic Gaming Chair for Girl” because it’s pink, I guess — is shockingly...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo IV and Overwatch 2 aren’t launching this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overwatch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ADtgvvlfqbwyH-XwB8ol4gZy6Hs=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771439/OVR_Ashe_000.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YDBJRn"&gt;Blizzard has two huge sequels in the works, but it looks like neither will launch this year. During its most recent earnings call, Activision Blizzard revealed that it doesn’t expect &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; to be part of its 2021 financials, suggesting both will launch in 2022 or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ph5R0F"&gt;Technically, this doesn’t represent a delay since neither game had a specific release date in place. Both&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943766/blizzard-overwatch-2-sequel-announcement-blizzcon-2019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942565/diablo-4-announced-release-date-blizzcon-2019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were first announced at BlizzCon 2019, and the developer has been relatively quiet since then, particularly about the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V98E9t"&gt;That said, while the games may be further off than many fans expected, we’ll still likely hear more about them soon. Blizzard will kick off a remote version of BlizzCon on February 19th, and...&lt;/p&gt;
