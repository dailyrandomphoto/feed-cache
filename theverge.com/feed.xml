    <title>AMC boss says company is exploring how to accept Shiba Inu along with other crypto </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rQPlvk"&gt;AMC boss Adam Aron said today that the theater chain is exploring how it can accept Shiba Inu in addition to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. In addition, AMC is evidently exploring its own cryptocurrency, which would truly cement the company as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465198/amc-meme-stock-popcorn-wsb"&gt;king of the memestocks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sa2tc"&gt;That AMC appears to be flirting with the idea of accepting (another) meme currency in exchange for actual goods and services isn’t entirely surprising. AMC was effectively rescued midway through the pandemic by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;meme stock Reddit traders&lt;/a&gt;, and Aron has been leaning heavily into the company’s relationship with these shareholders ever since. Hearing about AMC’s crypto ambitions has not only come to be expected during the company’s meetings with shareholders,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An alleged member of the REvil ransomware gang has been arrested in Poland</title>

  &lt;p id="QyXig3"&gt;The Justice Department &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ukrainian-arrested-and-charged-ransomware-attack-kaseya"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; the arrest and indictment of an alleged member of the REvil hacking group, linked to ransomware attacks on IT firm Kaseya, an Apple supplier, and more. According to the department, Ukrainian national Yaroslav Vasinskyi is facing extradition to the US after Polish authorities detained him in October and after the US indicted him for cybercrimes in August, as revealed by a now-unsealed court document. The arrest, along with the government seizing assets it says are linked to REvil’s operations, is another step in the fight against ransomware, which has been a growing issue for US-based companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lzng9I"&gt;The DOJ also says it has seized $6.1 million in assets from the FTX crypto trading exchange, allegedly...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A pair of PS5 hacks could be the first steps towards jailbreaking Sony’s latest console</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/giV4ELoaT9ddCSi0aUt9AuMqieA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70114154/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5UI4Hd"&gt;Hackers may have just made some big strides towards possibly jailbreaking the PlayStation 5 over the weekend, with the hacking group &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fail0verflow/status/1457499576676634625"&gt;Fail0verflow claiming&lt;/a&gt; to have managed to obtain PS5 root keys allowing them to decrypt the console’s firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSjSC4"&gt;Additionally, Andy Nguyen (a security engineer at Google who’s better known under his handle, theflow0) &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/theflow0/status/1457362920501829636"&gt;managed to access&lt;/a&gt; the PS5’s debug settings menu on a retail PS5 over the weekend, too. Both exploits were spotted by &lt;a href="http://Wololo.net"&gt;Wololo.net&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H6hPfa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Another one bites the dust   &lt;a href="https://t.co/Y1ty93AvaE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Y1ty93AvaE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— fail0verflow (@fail0verflow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fail0verflow/status/1457499576676634625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4V3Mlj"&gt;The two exploits are particularly notable due to the level of access they theoretically give to the PS5’s software. Decrypted firmware — which is possible...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll be able to pay for Amazon purchases with Venmo starting in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m4Wk7H"&gt;If you want to buy anything on Amazon.com, you’ll generally need a credit or debit card — but in 2022, the online retailer will begin accepting Venmo as well. Venmo parent company PayPal &lt;a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-11-08-PayPal-and-Amazon-to-Enable-Customers-to-Pay-with-Venmo-at-Checkout"&gt;announced the news&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-customers-will-able-pay-venmo-next-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) during its Q3 earnings call on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkUVAB"&gt;We’re pretty sure that’s the first third-party payments platform Amazon has embraced in recent memory. You can’t use PayPal itself to buy things on Amazon! (Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GFBWMNXEPYVJAY9A"&gt;a list of the payment methods Amazon does accept&lt;/a&gt; as of today). You might cite Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/amazon-partners-with-affirm"&gt;recent buy-now, pay-later partnership with Affirm&lt;/a&gt;, but that still requires credit. Venmo, by comparison, acts more like a bank account for some mobile users, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213387/venmo-check-cashing-paypal-customers-banking"&gt;complete with a (sometimes expensive) check-cashing feature.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Galactic sells 100 tickets to space at higher price after reopening sales</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZBzVKV"&gt;Space tourism venture Virgin Galactic says that 100 people purchased more expensive tickets to fly on the company’s suborbital spaceplane after it reopened ticket sales this August. That means that the company has roughly 700 ticket holders now for quick tourist trips to space, about 300 less than the 1,000 tickets Virgin Galactic is hoping to sell ahead of starting commercial flights of its vehicles. The company announced the news &lt;a href="https://investors.virgingalactic.com/news/news-details/2021/Virgin-Galactic-Announces-Third-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx"&gt;during its third-quarter earnings release out on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxFx3a"&gt;Though Virgin Galactic still has more tickets it aims to sell, the company says the additional sales from this quarter were better than expected. “We’re selling tickets ahead of the pace we planned,” Michael Colglazier, Virgin Galactic’s CEO, said during...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood says a hacker who tried to extort the company got access to data for 7 million customers </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aXtNfP"&gt;Trading platform Robinhood said Monday that personal information for more than 7 million customers was accessed during a data breach on November 3rd. The company &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt; that it does not appear that Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed, and no customers have had “financial loss” due to the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tr5Fze"&gt;An unauthorized third party “socially engineered a customer support employee by phone,” Robinhood said, and was able to access its customer support systems. The attacker was able to get a list of email addresses for approximately 5 million people and full names for a separate group of 2 million people. For a smaller group of about 310 people, additional personal information,...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lIzM0L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; has been delayed for two weeks, arriving December 7th instead of November 23rd. &lt;a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/543305a31fe801d5df3a29ef2cea581e00b46761"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, game director Naoki Yoshida says the delay was to ensure adequate quality assurance testing in the final days of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXfOcI"&gt;Yoshida says the decision to delay the game arose from a desire to ensure &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s story was something that befit 11 years of&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;’s epic storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRwcK6"&gt;“We remained firmly resolved to adjust down to the smallest nuances and ensure our writing covers even the finest points of the vast and intricate story that has spanned these past 11 years since the original &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; to ensure that everyone can fully enjoy their adventure in &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;,” Yoshida writes. However, the time it took...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="donwQi"&gt;Alphabet, Google’s parent company, briefly hit a market cap of $2 trillion. The tech behemoth’s market cap is currently at a comfortable &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/"&gt;$1.98 trillion&lt;/a&gt;, but crept over the $2 trillion mark midday Monday, later closing out at $2,987.03 per share. Alphabet’s market cap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069458/google-alphabet-trillion-dollar-market-cap-apple-microsoft"&gt;has just about doubled from $1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; since January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYD6gc"&gt;In the third quarter of 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747193/google-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-profit"&gt;Alphabet had a record quarter&lt;/a&gt;, earning a hefty $65.1 billion. The company reported that its revenue soared by 41 percent, while its profits jumped by almost 69 percent. Google Search saw a slight increase in profit, climbing to $37.9 billion from $35.8 billion in the previous quarter. YouTube, another Alphabet company, earned $7.2 billion in the most recent quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will accept app updates during the holidays in a break from tradition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Wv2PC"&gt;Apple will continue to accept App Store app submissions through the holidays, marking a shift from the company’s approach in the past. Typically, Apple doesn’t let developers make submissions through the App Store Connect portal for a few days around Christmas, meaning that they would have to rush to release apps or updates ahead of when many people receive new Apple devices or gift cards as holiday presents. With this change, it seems as if the App Store will hum along largely like you’re used to this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6TMFv"&gt;However, Apple is already suggesting that developers try to stay ahead of things during one of the busiest times of the year. “Due to anticipated high volume, plan to send time-sensitive submissions early,” Apple said in a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=y4fgrhhe&amp;amp;1636388143"&gt;s...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
