    <title>All Your Base Are Belong To Us has turned 20 </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5HPFC5"&gt;As of yesterday, it’s been 20 years since “All Your Base Are Belong To Us” was uploaded to Newgrounds. Let that sink in. And while you’re doing that, &lt;a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/11940"&gt;feel free to watch the video in its entirety there&lt;/a&gt;, too. It’s been kept safe in a Flash-emulating container, so even now, it’s safe from the inconvenient fact that Flash has been discontinued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oF1XyS"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/get-ready-to-feel-old-the-all-your-base-music-video-turns-20-today/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, the history of the “All Your Base” video is longer than just a single upload. Much of it is taken from a tiny GIF of the Mega Drive game &lt;em&gt;Zero Wing&lt;/em&gt;, which had been circulating widely online because of its disastrous English translation (and the GIF itself existed because of early emulation culture). “Early Internet communities poked fun at the sequence by creating and sharing...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York State is suing Amazon for alleged worker safety failures during COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JiIBG7"&gt;New York Attorney General Letitia James &lt;a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=muvelgaOEvSt6Yc1gGqzAg=="&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Amazon in the state’s supreme court on Tuesday, claiming the company failed to protect its workers early on in the COVID-19 pandemic and also retaliated against employees who voiced concerns over what they felt were inadequate safety measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5kD9o"&gt;The news, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/technology/amazon-new-york-lawsuit-covid.html"&gt;reported yesterday by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, follows Amazon’s decision earlier this month to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279819/amazon-new-york-ag-state-lawsuit-covid-19-warehouse-conditions-pandemic"&gt;preemptively sue the New York AG’s office&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to prevent James from bringing charges, doing so by trying to have jurisdiction over its workplace safety measures in New York be deemed a federal issue not within the purview of the state AG. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First trailer for Disney’s live-action Cruella movie feels more Joker than 101 Dalmatians</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lM5qY275OBC-aIHh_O1SOWK0NiM=/97x0:1207x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830012/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_8.59.58_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o7tWpw"&gt;There’s a moment in the first trailer for Disney’s live-action &lt;em&gt;Cruella &lt;/em&gt;movie when Emma Stone utters in a terrible faux British accent, “I am woman, hear me roar.” It feels less like something Disney fans will remember from the iconic &lt;em&gt;101 Dalmatians &lt;/em&gt;villain, Cruella de Vil, and more like Jared Leto’s Joker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22278944/zack-snyder-justice-league-official-premiere-trailer-hbo-max"&gt;telling Batman, “We live in a society.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0MSzZ"&gt;All of which is to say that Disney may have found its own Joker-type character in Stone’s Cruella de Vil... but not necessarily in a good way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNrujM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella &lt;/em&gt;is set in 1970s London. Stone plays the soon-to-be-villain in an origin story of sorts. She’s an aspiring punk designer — and a grifter — who is trying to get society’s wealthiest people to take notice of her and her designs. Throughout the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ecobee adds baby monitoring features to its SmartCamera</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YzE2tQ"&gt;Ecobee has updated its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221291/ecobee-smartcamera-haven-security-platorm-smart-home-price-specs-features"&gt;SmartCamera home security camera&lt;/a&gt; with a few new features that make it easier to use as a baby monitor. The new Baby Monitor mode, which is enabled during setup of the camera, adjusts the camera’s settings to dim the LED lights on the front, makes it harder to accidentally enable the camera’s Siren alarm, and, perhaps most importantly, adds an audio-only streaming option that lets you continue to listen for disruptions even if you switch to a different app or lock your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHzDF9"&gt;Using a home security camera as a baby monitor is hardly a new idea, but this is the first one to my knowledge that actually makes it easier to do so. While traditional video monitors provide an always-on feed to a dedicated screen, home...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch today’s Nintendo Direct live stream</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8UMJyH"&gt;If you’re into gaming, you’ll want to know that Nintendo is hosting a 50-minute live stream today that it calls Nintendo Direct, and the company will focus on games coming to the Switch in 2021. This is the first time the company has hosted a full-fledged Nintendo Direct live stream &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20850031/nintendo-direct-switch-seven-biggest-announcements-news-super-smash-snes-overwatch"&gt;since September 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZlig5"&gt;Nintendo already confirmed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1361676737730519042"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that it would be announcing information on &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,&lt;/em&gt; but it did not offer any hints, though there’s a good chance we’ll be hearing about a new character for &lt;a href="https://smashbros.nintendo.com/buy/dlc/"&gt;the game’s second Fighter Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, the live stream will focus on games coming to Nintendo Switch “in the first half of 2021,” leaving fans to speculate what could be shown during the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Maps will now let you pay for public transportation and parking through its app</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVU5XP"&gt;Google Maps is adding a couple of new useful features: the ability to pay for parking or buy a train ticket right from the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apqmkg"&gt;Google Maps is integrating two mobile parking payment services into its app, &lt;a href="https://www.passportparking.com/"&gt;Passport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parkmobile.io/"&gt;ParkMobile&lt;/a&gt;. Both offer the ability to find, pay for, and replenish parking meters or parking lot fees through a smartphone app. Now, those features will also be available in Google Maps. According to the company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mHL2h7"&gt;Simply tap on the “Pay for Parking” button that appears as you near your destination. Then enter your meter number, the amount of time you want to park for, and tap “Pay.” Need to add more time to your meter? Easily extend your parking session with just a few taps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VNaQuZ"&gt;The ability to pay for parking in Google Maps...&lt;/p&gt;

Today, the developer announced a new update that allows players to tame wild creatures, bond with them, and even breed them. “They will travel side-by-side with you as you adventure through the universe both as a friend and as a valuable aide on your voyage,” Hello Games said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W62TJU"&gt;Once tamed, you can feed, play with, and explore with your companions; a “neural harness” transmits their thoughts directly to the player’s communication channels. “Creature personalities are defined by their species and ecosystem, such that no two creatures are alike, and their personalities develop further as you deepen your bond with them,” the developer said. It’s also worth noting that running into other...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Shorts beta will launch in the United States in March </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L7CncZ"&gt;YouTube is gearing up to launch a beta version of its TikTok competitor, Shorts, in the United States beginning in March, chief product officer Neal Mohan announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k379Nl"&gt;In a blog post announcing a number of features coming to YouTube in the coming months, Mohan said the YouTube team will be giving more creators access to Shorts in the United States. The YouTube team has seen success with Shorts in India, where the feature has existed for several months, according to Mohan. Since December, “the number of Indian channels using Shorts creation tools has more than tripled, and the YouTube Shorts player is now receiving more than 3.5 billion daily views globally,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon won’t build this Alexa cuckoo clock unless it hits a preorder goal</title>

  &lt;p id="3ZGaQq"&gt;Amazon is launching a new consumer outreach program it’s calling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/BuildIt?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Build It&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is a safer spin on a familiar crowdfunding idea: if enough people preorder something, Amazon will produce it. And if not, it won’t. The company is starting with three Alexa-powered gadgets: a cuckoo clock, a thermal sticky note printer, and a smart scale that can provide details on the food you’re weighing via a separate Echo device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgLgWB"&gt;All three “concepts” are going up for preorder today as part of Amazon’s program for creating experimental hardware. It has already made some devices it doesn’t consider mainstream yet — like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;Echo Frames&lt;/a&gt; — under the Day 1 Editions branding. Built It is a subset, designed for gadgets that won’t even be released without...&lt;/p&gt;
