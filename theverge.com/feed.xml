    <title>Apple just gave Russia a spot on the iPhone to advertise its favorite apps to its citizens</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NkHvcU"&gt;Starting April 1st, users setting up a new iPhone in Russia will see a screen that allows them to automatically install apps that are officially sanctioned by the Russian government, in compliance with Russian law (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-ipad-mac-russia-apps-preinstall-144255015.html"&gt;via Engadget&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptFlOo"&gt;The law in question &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20977459/russian-law-pre-installed-domestic-software-tvs-smartphones-laptops"&gt;was passed back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and requires smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and smart TVs sold in Russia to come pre-installed with specific apps made by Russian companies by April 1st, &lt;a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2021/03/15/861564-iphone-soft"&gt;according to Russian news site &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (The law was originally set to go into effect in July 2020, but was pushed back to April 2021). &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti&lt;/em&gt; also says that apps won’t be installed if users don’t want them. Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will comply with the law by giving the users the option...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cricut promises unlimited lifetime uploads for existing crafting machines after user backlash</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z12izD"&gt;Cricut is changing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332212/cricut-crafting-machine-design-space-upload-limit"&gt;recently announced plan to require a subscription&lt;/a&gt; to get the full use of its crafting machines for precisely cutting paper and other materials. Following backlash from crafters and fans who rely on its machines, &lt;a href="https://inspiration.cricut.com/a-letter-to-the-cricut-community-from-ashish-arora-cricut-ceo/?fbclid=IwAR2nc73QTwCyEhdw0ihhsPdDrAMIlGlq0gMJk2SvuOeVefA6IFvQXts7a6M"&gt;Cricut CEO Ashish Arora apologized for the decision&lt;/a&gt;, and announced that the company will postpone the requirement for a subscription and give unlimited uploads to all users with a registered Cricut device purchased before December 31st, 2021 — for the lifetime of their machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwzw2c"&gt;Without an upload limit, crafters will be able to use Cricut and its required Design Space app as usual. They can create designs in the app or third-party software like Procreate, and then format it to be cut out of materials like...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber drivers in the UK will now get minimum wage and paid vacation after a big court win</title>

Drivers will still not be considered full-time employees, but they will receive a minimum wage, holiday time, and will be enrolled in a pension plan starting on March 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPziZH"&gt;The decision in February was one of the biggest wins yet for drivers, and for gig workers writ large, in the UK. But that victory came just a few months after voters in California approved Prop 22, a ballot measure that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;reversed a previous decision to classify drivers as employees&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Huawei has a plan to get a bigger cut of 5G, even with its phone sales limited</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cglpkfAQTGNKIcIEEPlMzMCaB7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977880/acastro_190520_1777_huawei_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="o1pAUQ"&gt;Huawei has a plan to compete in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;5G&lt;/a&gt; without being able to sell its 5G phones everywhere. Today, the technology company announced that &lt;a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/news/2021/3/huawei-releases-whitepaper-innovation-intellectual-property-2020"&gt;it intends to seek royalties&lt;/a&gt; from companies like Apple and Samsung in exchange for the use of its patents, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/huawei-to-start-demanding-5g-royalties-from-smartphone-giants"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Huawei believes it can strike licensing deals despite sanctions in the US, and it plans to use its earnings to invest even further into research and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVoDTZ"&gt;Huawei obtained patents on new technology during the development of the larger 5G standard — alongside companies like Qualcomm and Ericsson — that are needed for interoperability between different 5G networks, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/huawei-to-charge-royalties-to-smartphone-makers-using-its-5g-tech-.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. “Huawei has been the largest technical contributor to 5G standards,” Huawei’s head of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reiterates ‘VR for console is not a focus for us’ following localization bug</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s6ER77"&gt;Microsoft has once again reiterated that VR support for Xbox was not a focus for the company, following reports earlier today that hinted it was working on a VR headset compatible with the Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VbMYr"&gt;The rumor first surfaced after &lt;a href="https://it.ign.com/xbox-series-x/179732/news/microsoft-al-lavoro-su-un-headset-vr-per-xbox-gli-indizi-arrivano-dalle-nuove-cuffie-wireless"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN Italy&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that some Italian Xbox users received messages, which translated to “[a]n update for the VR headset is available” and “[u]pdate VR headset,” when connecting the recently released Xbox Wireless Headset to their Xbox Series X or Series S consoles. My colleague, Cameron Faulkner, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;reviewed the Xbox Wireless headset&lt;/a&gt; and did not encounter this pop-up message while using the headset on an Xbox Series X console in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AK4lU4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“VR for console is not a focus for us at this time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard lays off about 50 employees, citing COVID-19’s effects on its esports leagues</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YXDglQ"&gt;Activision Blizzard on Tuesday said it was laying off about 50 people across various divisions dealing predominantly with live events and esports as part of a restructuring. The company cites the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on both the viability of live productions for its esports leagues and the changing viewership habits of its core audience over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNOwwL"&gt;“Players are increasingly choosing to connect with our games digitally and the e-sports team, much like traditional sports, entertainment, and broadcasting industries, has had to adapt its business due to the impact the pandemic has had on live events,” an Activision Blizzard spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/blizzard-fires-50-people-amid-shift-away-from-live-events?srnd=technology-vp&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="n18doO"&gt;Riot Games is closing an investigation into whether CEO Nicolo Laurent harassed or discriminated against former employee Sharon O’Donnell, saying it found “no evidence” of the claim. “After review of the results of the investigation,” Riot said in a statement, “there is no evidence that Nicolo harassed, discriminated, or retaliated against Ms. O’Donnell. The Special Committee has also expressed its full confidence in Nicolo’s leadership, that no action against him is warranted, and that he will continue to operate as CEO.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="TYfT1j"&gt;Teenage Twitter hacker Graham Ivan Clark has pleaded guilty to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised"&gt;last summer’s unprecedented bitcoin scam attack&lt;/a&gt; that involved the takeover of dozens of high-profile accounts on the social network, according to paperwork filed in Florida court on Tuesday.

As part of the deal, Clark is also being sentenced as a “youthful offender,” which lessened his prison time and also opens up the possibility that he can serve some of his sentence at a boot camp, according to the &lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times&lt;/em&gt;.
