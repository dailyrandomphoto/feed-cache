    <title>Instagram tests letting anyone share a link in stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kBa_TpHHPy8XKdh8rzDPXAtrkXw=/84x0:996x608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518247/199306424_1004326343706419_871286131944844992_n.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AIwu2A"&gt;Instagram has always limited who can post swipe-up links to their stories, but today, the company is starting a new test that could widen that ability. In this case, however, it isn’t a swipe up that people will be able to offer, but instead a linking sticker. These stickers will operate the same way a swipe-up link does, except with a tap instead of a swipe. People will also be able to respond to stories that include a sticker, which they can’t currently do with stories that have a swipe up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJLQVA"&gt;For now, the test is small, and Vishal Shah, Instagram’s head of product, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it’s mostly to learn how people might take advantage of links. They’ll be watching for the types of links people post while keeping a particular eye on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s latest Alexa trick is helping kids read</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MndFny"&gt;Amazon has announced a new feature for its Kids Plus service on Fire tablets and Echo smart speakers called Reading Sidekick. Designed to help kids improve their reading skills and ability, the Reading Sidekick allows kids to read either physical or digital books along with Alexa by taking turns at reading the books aloud with the digital assistant. The Reading Assistant is included in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home"&gt;Kids Plus service&lt;/a&gt; that comes with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-Kids-tablet/dp/B08F5Z2MC2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kids edition Fire tablets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-Kids/dp/B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo speakers&lt;/a&gt; or as a $2.99 per month ($4.99 without Amazon Prime) or $69 per year ($99 without Prime) subscription plan and is available starting June 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLeKnM"&gt;The Reading Assistant works with most Alexa-enabled devices, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21452312/amazon-echo-dot-led-redesign-sphere-features-alexa-price-release-date"&gt;Echo Dot Kids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16631956/amazon-echo-plus-alexa-smart-home-review"&gt;Echo Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"&gt;Echo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Basilisk Ultimate includes a $50 Steam gift card at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlLUq_e7DnVgillg93-lOtiGw-A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518106/akrales_191104_3773_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PT8LeW"&gt;Best Buy is offering an attractive deal on Razer’s Basilisk Ultimate wireless gaming mouse that includes a charging dock. The current price is $40 off, and you’ll get a $50 gift card to Steam for no extra cost. Amazon is selling this mouse for a similar price, but the Steam gift card bundle is exclusive to Best Buy. Perhaps it’s no coincidence that Steam is looped into this deal since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549213/valve-steam-summer-sale-halo-sekiro-hades-horizon-zero-dawn"&gt;its big Summer Sale is happening&lt;/a&gt;, bringing discounts to many digital PC games through July 8th. This $50 could get you several games or pay for all of &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;, as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfPMXK"&gt;Compared to other mice in Razer’s lineup, this one has perhaps the most features. The scrollwheel can tilt for extra inputs, the DPI clutch for your thumb is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Palm Pre home button was the first to be the last</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3zOV8whYGjc86JbBpmaliPhGlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518062/dbohn_210622_4651_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The original Palm Pre.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naZwsh"&gt;Physical home buttons are all but extinct on modern smartphones, and the Palm Pre ended them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwC9oK"&gt;It’s not hard to notice that smartphones have steadily shed their buttons throughout the years: keyboards, numpads, call and hang up buttons, directional navigation keys, and more have all fallen to the wayside in favor of more versatile touchscreens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vucRL"&gt;In 2007, the iPhone — with its then-revolutionary 3.5-inch multitouch display — helped to push that trend along by reducing navigation down to a single home button. But even as touchscreen sizes grew and buttons fell away, the humble home button stubbornly stuck around. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/28/18244645/apple-home-button-user-interface-iphone-7-fake"&gt;Apple wouldn’t ditch the button&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade, when the iPhone X arrived in 2017.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSuMvH"&gt;But it was the Palm Pre, and its largely...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pavilion Aero 13 is HP’s lightest consumer laptop ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HP Pavilion Aero 13 open on a desk. The screen displays a large wave. To the right is a cup of pencils, pens, and scissors. Above is a shelf with notebooks and a protractor." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQTqa8274Grly41vMQOz5RWJAeE=/0x298:1000x965/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517882/HP_Pavilion_Aero_13_Laptop_PC_NaturalSilver.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the HP Pavilion Aero 13.&lt;/em&gt; | HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xk5yit"&gt;HP has announced the Pavilion Aero 13, the lightest consumer laptop yet. It has a maximum weight of 2.18 pounds (0.987 kg), making it one of the most portable laptops you can buy of any type or size. It’s also powered by AMD’s Ryzen 5000 mobile processors, up to a Ryzen 7 5800U. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pl8jF0"&gt;On the outside, the Aero is available in four colors: pale rose gold, warm gold, ceramic white, and natural silver. Weight isn’t the only thing getting slimmed down, as this is the first Pavilion with a 90 percent screen-to-body ratio. The Pavilion has traditionally been HP’s budget line, with a bigger and clunkier design than the company’s pricier lines, but HP has been shrinking the bezels and chassis footprints on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276459/hps-pavilion-x360-convertible-laptops-streaming"&gt;a number of its models&lt;/a&gt; this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Sony acquires Returnal developer Housemarque, hints Bluepoint is next</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4SQN47"&gt;Sony has acquired Housemarque, the Finnish studio behind recent PS5 exclusive &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/29/welcoming-housemarque-to-the-playstation-studios-family/"&gt;the company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. It was announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nibellion/status/1409822833631502338?s=21"&gt;with a tweet&lt;/a&gt; which suggests Sony might also be about to acquire Bluepoint Games, the studio behind the recent &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; remaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o40aks"&gt;In a blog post announcing the acquisition, PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst said that the studio “is one with incredible vision, capable of creating memorable new games that resonate with our community.” Although Housemarque has produced games across multiple platforms including PC, iOS, and the Xbox 360, the majority of its recent titles have been exclusive to Sony’s platforms. Prior to &lt;em&gt;Returnal &lt;/em&gt;it was best known for the &lt;em&gt;Super Stardust &lt;/em&gt;games, which have appeared on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s versatile UltraSharp 4K webcam uses AI to keep you in the frame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQG3mCMs6JjEWjaENsSJ3h-o_IM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517763/dellultrasharphero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UltraSharp shown on its two included mounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qsr9Lw"&gt;Dell has launched the high-end UltraSharp webcam that costs $199.99 and is available now worldwide. Its cylindrical design is reminiscent of Apple’s old but iconic iSight external webcam, but its features are aimed to compete with Logitech’s Brio and other modern 4K-ready webcams. In addition, it aims to serve as a more affordable and easier-to-set up alternative to mounting a DSLR camera behind your monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzfRRQ"&gt;The UltraSharp is a USB-C webcam that houses a Sony STARVIS CMOS 8.3-megapixel sensor. It’s capable of recording or streaming in 4K at 30 or 24 frames per second and in 1080p or 720p at 24, 30, or 60 frames per second. You can tweak the field of view (FOV) between 65 degrees for a close crop, 78 degrees, or 90 degrees for the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing’s debut wireless earbuds will be announced on July 27</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4IDnYd"&gt;Tech startup Nothing will announce its debut pair of true wireless earbuds, the Nothing Ear (1), at 9AM ET on July 27th, the company’s founder &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1409829386308624388"&gt;Carl Pei announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The launch comes around a month later than the June launch window &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22428397/nothing-ear-1-true-wireless-earbuds-launch-carl-pei"&gt;Nothing previously announced&lt;/a&gt;, after Pei &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1405911656929054730"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the company was delaying the launch because it had “a few things left to finalize.” Carl Pei is best known as one of the co-founders of OnePlus, a company he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519785/oneplus-carl-pei-departure"&gt;parted ways with last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KhkhK"&gt;Details about the Nothing Ear (1) are thin, but the company has teased several details about them over the past few months. We know they’ll have a “stripped-down aesthetic” featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320915/nothing-true-wireless-earbuds-teenage-engineering-concept-1"&gt;transparent materials&lt;/a&gt; in their construction, and that they’ve been designed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298802/nothing-teenage-engineering-swedish-design-founding-partner-audio-headphones"&gt;in...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YeUvXY"&gt;Google is updating its Messages app in India to allow it to delete one-time passwords (OTPs) automatically, to stop the single-use codes from clogging up your inbox, &lt;a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/06/messages-makes-it-easier-to-help-you.html"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside it, Google also says the app will be able to sort messages into categories, keeping your personal correspondence away from notifications about bank transactions and special offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLi3vj"&gt;As someone that &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; exclusively uses WhatsApp for personal communication, my phone’s default texting app is typically a graveyard of six-digit codes, which by design become useless mere minutes after they’re received. Having the ability to automatically delete them after 24 hours should make Messages less cluttered and more usable.&lt;/p&gt;
