    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uC7IsM"&gt;If you’re currently shopping for a PlayStation 5 console, you have another chance right now at Best Buy. The electronics retailer just opened up a fresh batch of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcljGhDR4o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 consoles for $499.99&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4DCfC"&gt;Be sure to log in and queue up on Best Buy’s site, with your billing and shipping info saved. Click the “Add to Cart” button on the right to jump into the waiting line, and stay calm. You don’t need to refresh the automated system, though, you may be prompted to verify your account when it’s your turn. Best Buy’s recently-updated queue system may not work well if you try to open multiple tabs, but keep your phone handy — if you have trouble verifying your account you may be able to do it in the mobile app and check out once the PlayStation 5...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil activates gamer mode with a Razer smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The Razer X Fossil Gen 6 on top of a lit-up mechanical keyboard." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4RdcUwgt5kctGKlQsJuCkGCq6Ro=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350375/vsong_211229_4952_0015_Recovered.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7U4Wn0"&gt;Fossil usually shows up to CES with a hoard of smartwatches, but last year was a weird one for Wear OS. Google and Samsung announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;a new unified version of Wear OS&lt;/a&gt;, but the catch was that non-Samsung watches — including Fossil’s — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;won’t be eligible for an upgrade&lt;/a&gt; until mid to late 2022. Given the circumstances, this year, Fossil is keeping it relatively simple with a limited-edition Razer smartwatch and an updated version of the Skagen Falster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R23Q7I"&gt;Before you ask, no, the Razer X Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch does not come with RGB lighting. It does, however, come with three Razer-branded watch faces — including a “Chroma” face that you can customize to match Razer’s other Chroma products. It’s technically not RGB, but you can enable “breathe”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tile is working with Lenovo to help you find your lost laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Lenovo ThinkPad with the Tile app on the screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZIpW4P_4dvUzMz6ndgEJQfcMISA=/390x0:4611x2814/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350412/Lenovo_FWT_laptop_PR2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Tile’s second embedded PC partnership.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tile, Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DiToR0"&gt;No one likes misplacing expensive gadgets, but especially not a laptop. If you were thinking about copping one of Lenovo’s newly announced ThinkPad X1s, good news. Tile and Lenovo are teaming up to make the computers findable via the Tile app, even when the laptops are offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIKbS5"&gt;This is Tile’s second embedded PC collaboration — the first was with HP. As for which Lenovo laptops are compatible, the list includes the X1 Carbon 10th gen, X1 Yoga 7th gen, and the X1 Nano 2nd gen. To enable the feature, download and install the Tile Windows app from the Microsoft Store. From there, activate the ThinkPad as if it were a Tile tracker. Once that’s done, should you misplace your shiny new laptop, you can find it using the Tile app for iOS or...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new Yoga 9i embraces hardware shortcut buttons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKj8HcdcEYeFCC6b7jsKs8oG5Es=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350386/mchin_200331_4955_0026.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="txda5t"&gt;Lenovo’s newest Yoga 9i convertible laptop is embracing one of the more fun trends of ‘90s and early ‘00s computer design: shortcut keys. While plenty of laptops have added handy shortcuts to the Function row on the keyboard, few are making keys that have one express purpose. Now Lenovo is planning to release a laptop in 2022 with five of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYoWRb"&gt;The 1-Click Function keys all sit to the right of the keyboard. There’s a key for switching between performance mode and a battery-sipping Smart Power mode that sacrifices a little power to boost battery life. Another key lets you toggle between light and dark mode in Windows 10 &lt;em&gt;(or 11? does this laptop ship with 10 on it?&lt;/em&gt;), and the Vibe Check (lol) key toggles between the various built-in audio...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon and X1 Nano get better webcams and OLED displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 Nano 2nd-Gen open on white table. The screen displays a blue swirl on a white background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6N6ERTibKZwyngqNgs_voH2U9AI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350372/mchin_200331_4955_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the new ThinkPad X1 Nano, which looks a lot like the old ThinkPad X1 Nano.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3CBwf3"&gt;At CES 2022, Lenovo announced updates to three of its most premium laptops on the market: the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 10th-gen (that’s right, this is the tenth one), the ThinkPad X1 Yoga seventh-gen, and the ThinkPad X1 Nano second-gen. The Carbon and the Yoga will be available in March (starting at $1,639 and $1,749, respectively), and the Nano is coming in April (starting at $1,659). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5OBYC"&gt;These are some heavy hitters. The X1 Carbon and the X1 Yoga are two of the most established and beloved laptops in the business sphere. The X1 Nano is newer to the scene but was one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;favorite laptops that we reviewed last year&lt;/a&gt; — it’s the lightest ThinkPad ever made, and it packs impressive power into that chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0wn2fz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The X1 Nano was one of our favorite...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 has an eight-inch secondary screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkBook plus Gen 3 keyboard seen from above. The primary screen displays a blue swirl on a white background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/onp0WFvvkOHJJwsKuFXRSxuyzjI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350369/mchin_200331_4955_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the ThinkBook Plus Gen 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LeHnFU"&gt;Lenovo has announced the new ThinkBook Plus Gen 3, which has two (two!) screens. There’s one 17.3-inch primary screen (like, the regular one), and there’s another eight-inch screen on the keyboard deck. Various other models that have tried this form factor (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431381/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-review"&gt;namely, Asus’&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285164/asus-zenbook-duo-review-screenpad-plus-dual-screen-laptop-specs-freatures-price"&gt;gaggle of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20908627/asus-zenbook-pro-duo-review-screenpad-plus-dual-screen-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Duo products&lt;/a&gt;) have put the secondary screen in the back of the deck and pushed the keyboard to the front. But Lenovo has instead put the keyboard on the right side of the chassis, smushing the keyboard to the left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSuaq2"&gt;While the ThinkBook Plus Gen 3’s look takes a bit of getting used to, I definitely prefer this layout to those of the Duos. You don’t have to buy a separate palm rest, and you don’t look and feel like a &lt;em&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt; when you’re typing. (I know that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s 16-inch Legion 5 Pro is about to get even better</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aLXGdR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features"&gt;Lenovo impressed us in 2021 with its Legion 5 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a 16-inch QHD+ laptop that delivered excellent gaming performance at a price that undercut many of its key competitors, like Razer and Asus. It also got bonus points for being powerful without being too thick or heavy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knRT6B"&gt;Like many companies during CES 2022, Lenovo is upgrading the specs of its Legion 5 Pro for this year, and despite my never-dying thirst for new chassis design, it seems like Lenovo may have another hit on its hands without having to change all that much (here’s to hoping Lenovo stocks it at more retailers than just Walmart). Though, according to the company, the chassis is thinner than the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2obWvC"&gt;The new Legion 5 Pro will be available in the standard storm...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fQCuC8"&gt;California utility company PG&amp;amp;E was found at fault for sparking another massive inferno. This time it was the Dixie wildfire, the second &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/4jandlhh/top20_acres.pdf"&gt;largest&lt;/a&gt; in state history. Electrical distribution lines sparked the blaze after coming in contact with a tree, according to the results of an &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/edwez51p/dixie_fire_release.pdf"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; completed by state firefighting agency Cal Fire yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glUDXM"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7690/"&gt;Dixie Fire&lt;/a&gt; raged for more than three months last year, burning over 1,300 structures and killing one person. In perhaps its most traumatic episode, the blaze tore through the town of Greenville one August evening — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22612874/wildfires-worse-night-hot-dry-california-us-west"&gt;growing explosively overnight&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Meta reportedly canceled a 300-person VR / AR operating system project</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vweGmr"&gt;Meta reportedly pulled the plug on a custom operating system that was supposed to power upcoming virtual and augmented reality headsets, although its full reasoning and future plans still aren’t clear. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-platforms-halts-vr-and-ar-operating-system-project"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported the news today&lt;/a&gt;, saying the company formerly named Facebook suspended development of a project called XROS — named after XR, an umbrella term for AR / VR — in November. That leaves Meta with the Android-based operating system used in Quest (previously Oculus) VR devices, something that offers convenience but also makes Meta dependent on another company’s OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKFblo"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Information&lt;/em&gt; article reports that XROS development began in 2017 and had more than 300 people working on it. It’s apparently synonymous with the “reality...&lt;/p&gt;
