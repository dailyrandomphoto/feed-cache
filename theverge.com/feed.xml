    <title>Elizabeth Holmes’ lawyers want to know how often jurors blog</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5V2Q1v"&gt;The lawyers of Elizabeth Holmes, ex-CEO of disgraced blood testing startup Theranos, have 112 questions for prospective jurors at Holmes’ fraud trial — including how often they check social media and whether they subscribe to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GP9YdM"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-has-over-100-questions-for-jurors-11622217048"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, Holmes’ attorneys have just filed a proposed jury questionnaire for her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/30/20532321/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-blood-testing-startup-trial-date-set-august-2020"&gt;upcoming fraud trial&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; detailed &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.327949/gov.uscourts.cand.327949.808.0.pdf"&gt;45-page document&lt;/a&gt; outlines every possible way Holmes fears a jury could be biased, and part of that apparently involves gauging &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how online each juror is. Among other questions, jurors are asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BSHsSI"&gt;“Do you have an account on any social media platforms? If yes, please identify the platform(s).”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xPBBEr"&gt;“How frequently do you use the platform(s) listed above?”...&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Social media companies, here are some free theme park ideas to comply with Florida’s deplatforming law</title>

  &lt;p id="EWpPS8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is deeply invested in doing service journalism; we report on companies’ misdeeds, we review expensive products to tell you whether they’re worth your hard-earned money, and speak to industry leaders to get their insights on the issues affecting their companies and their customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeY1a9"&gt;It is in that vein that we brainstormed some ideas for social media theme parks in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why on Earth did Amazon spend $8 billion on a zombie studio? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MGM Studios" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zvdshbq6IYPUDooiiscDkaeUfLY=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69358186/1231823071.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jFgIrJ"&gt;Amazon just dumped an $8 billion-plus chunk of change on MGM, a studio best known for James Bond and its logo of a roaring lion. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt; offers an opportunity for Amazon to spin the spy films into a big perk for its streaming services. But it’s hard to believe that dropping billions for the studio’s content library is actually going to prop up Amazon’s streaming services — at least on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BQVX4"&gt;Amazon already has a fully functioning &lt;a href="https://studios.amazon.com/"&gt;studio arm&lt;/a&gt; that produces content for its Prime Video service. While it’s got a few hits here and there — &lt;em&gt;Jack Ryan&lt;/em&gt; immediately comes to mind — Amazon has, for the most part, struggled to reach the &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;-level of viewer enthusiasm that its rivals often enjoy. The company also owns IMDb TV, a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch warns streamers another wave of copyright strikes is coming</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FMLK4H"&gt;Twitch has received a “batch” of new takedown notices from music publishers over copyrighted songs in recorded streams (known as VODs), the company said in an email to streamers today. The notice may be worrying for some streamers who were affected by the waves of takedowns that hit last year, because if a user gets three copyright strikes on their channel, they will be permanently banned from the platform, according to Twitch’s policies. With this advance warning, it seems Twitch is trying to get ahead of a sudden flurry of takedowns and give streamers some time to remove potentially offending VODs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49EQjd"&gt;“We recently received a batch of DMCA takedown notifications with about 1,000 individual claims from music publishers,” Twitch said in an...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Memorial Day sales happening now</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Our favorite smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 6, is $70 off at multiple retailers this weekend. | Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCrwEW"&gt;Memorial Day weekend has officially arrived. Numerous retailers, including GameStop and Walmart, have already kicked off their Memorial Day sales online, offering customers a chance to save on a variety of electronics ahead of the three-day weekend. The holiday remains a great way to save on mattresses and camping equipment — it’s the unofficial start to summer, after all — but if you’re a gamer or prefer electronics over home goods, there are plenty of bargains to be had on headphones, TVs, and games throughout the long weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4MxBJ"&gt;We’ve seen discounts on many of these items before, sure, but if you’re still looking for a good deal, it’s hard to go wrong with the highlights below. Also, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt; now reportedly set for June...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cybertruck patent applications show off UI, solar bed cover, ‘armor glass’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6T8gkP"&gt;New patent applications submitted by Tesla in 2020 but published Thursday have revealed a bit more information about the Cybertruck, which is currently slated to start shipping at the very end of this year or in early 2022. One includes (in rather grainy detail) a bunch of screenshots of the new UI Tesla has been working on. Another details how the company plans to integrate solar panel tech onto the retracting tonneau cover for the truck bed — &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-solar-roof-option-add-range/"&gt;something CEO Elon Musk said might be an option&lt;/a&gt;. And there even appears to be an application for what could be Tesla’s so-called “armor glass,” which memorably failed during an onstage demo in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui8Xpc"&gt;We’ve seen glimpses of Tesla’s new user interface before, at the Cybertruck reveal event and &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/04/28/tesla-head-ui-leaves-leaks-unreleased-cybertruck-fsd-images/"&gt;when...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="whLQfu"&gt;When you are a parent, you quickly learn that your kids will inevitably get into shows or videos or learn songs that slowly chip away at your sanity because you will hear them over and over and over. Anyone who knows what “Baby Shark” is will know exactly the kind of hellscape I’m talking about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMKOoe"&gt;But once in a while, a kids’ show comes into your family’s life and you miss it when your kid ages out of it — like &lt;em&gt;Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;. For our family, that show was &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt;; my now-teenager voraciously watched episodes of the show that ran on Nickelodeon from 2004 to 2013 (we watched the DVDs), and would actually get up and dance when the music started. We looked forward to new episodes about the hijinks of...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tr7jo4"&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter ended its sixth flight test on Mars earlier than planned last week after bugging out mid-flight, the rotorcraft’s chief pilot wrote in a blog post on Thursday. The four-pound mini helicopter was aiming to fly farther than any of its previous excursions to test out its scientific reconnaissance capabilities, as the latest trial in an extended test campaign to demonstrate a new mode of transportation on another world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkHMm0"&gt;Last Saturday, Ingenuity powered up and rose 33 feet from the Martian surface to travel a distance of roughly two football fields along a preprogramed flight path, all the while snapping photos of a “region of interest” on Mars during flight. As it buzzed along at about nine miles per hour toward...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="sKi4jL"&gt;Officially referred to as the “force sensor” (a title that makes the button sound far more interesting than it actually is), it’s technically nothing more than an indented portion of the AirPods Pro’s stems, with some fancy hardware that measures not just capacitive touch but also pressure.
