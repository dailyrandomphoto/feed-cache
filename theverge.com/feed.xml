    <title>Adobe just released the last Flash update ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Adobe Flash Logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bHLBA_dPBaAcuHeGoZ0f7QnExOw=/0x23:600x423/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487031/adobe-flash-logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rEA041"&gt;Adobe has released the final scheduled update to its Flash Player plugin, weeks before Flash’s official retirement. As noted &lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/release-note/fp_32_air_32_release_notes.html"&gt;on Adobe’s site&lt;/a&gt;, yesterday marked the last update for Flash outside mainland China, which has a separate version of the software. Adobe will stop supporting Flash on December 31st, 2020, and it will block Flash content from running on January 12th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ietqEh"&gt;Adobe offered a brief farewell in its release notes. “We want to take a moment to thank all of our customers and developers who have used and created amazing Flash Player content over the last two decades,” the note says. “We are proud that Flash had a crucial role in evolving web content across animation, interactivity, audio, and video. We are excited to help...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Privacy group files complaint against five online test-proctoring services</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XNOamV"&gt;The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) has &lt;a href="https://epic.org/privacy/dccppa/online-test-proctoring/EPIC-complaint-in-re-online-test-proctoring-companies-12-09-20.pdf"&gt;filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the DC Attorney General’s office against five online test-proctoring services: Respondus, ProctorU, Proctorio, Examity, and Honorlock. EPIC claims that the firms violate the privacy rights of students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5waCJ0"&gt;The five companies sell software designed to prevent cheating in online tests and exams. Some are designed to track applications that are running on test-takers’ computers or restrict access to certain programs during the testing period. Others track students’ activity during the test via their webcams and microphones and flag potentially suspicious behavior to their instructor, using either algorithms or live monitoring. In some cases, test-takers need to show a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Redbox’s free ad-supported streaming service adds on-demand movies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uP5sOn"&gt;Redbox has added on-demand movies to its free ad-supported streaming service in a section called Free On Demand (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/redbox-streaming-free-movies-tv-shows-video-on-demand-205208288.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Last February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138485/redbox-free-live-tv-ad-supported-streaming-platform-launch-rollout"&gt;the company launched Free Live TV&lt;/a&gt;, with ad-supported live TV channels from specific publishers like Tastemade and curated channels based on genres. Free movies now make that offering a bit more enticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USHNjc"&gt;Redbox is still best known for its red kiosks for renting DVDs and Blu-rays, but free streaming and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16775778/redbox-on-demand-streaming-service"&gt;digital rental service&lt;/a&gt; now allow the company to reach customers who might not have a kiosk in their area or don’t own a DVD or Blu-ray player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTYqRh"&gt;The selection in Free On Demand lacks some of the big blockbusters and classics that you might expect from a streaming service, but there are a few...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch SpaceX fly a prototype of its Starship rocket to its highest altitude yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qIK1iO"&gt;Sometime today, SpaceX hopes to conduct a pivotal test flight of its next-generation Starship rocket, flying a prototype of the vehicle to its highest altitude yet. The company plans to launch the massive rocket to a height of nearly 8 miles, or 12.5 kilometers, up above SpaceX’s facility in Boca Chica, Texas, before landing the vehicle back down on the ground again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YISOcP"&gt;The test is meant to prove out Starship’s capability of launching and landing upright, something the spacecraft will be expected to do both on Earth and on other worlds. SpaceX aims to use Starship to send cargo and people to deep-space destinations like the Moon and Mars. A test like this will help demonstrate Starship’s ability to perform a controlled flight and see if...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google CEO Sundar Pichai apologizes for Timnit Gebru controversy but not her firing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Hosts Its Annual I/O Developers Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e8y0PpKnweLynxwQaS-Ykurap2k=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68486474/1147600084.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rkD4rh"&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai addressed the controversial departure of AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru in an email to staff on Wednesday. “We need to accept responsibility for the fact that a prominent Black, female leader with immense talent left Google unhappily,” he wrote. News of the email was &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/sundar-pichai-memo-timnit-gebru-exit-18b0efb0-5bc3-41e6-ac28-2956732ed78b.html"&gt;first published by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZAAar"&gt;While Pichai did not say Gebru was fired as she and many others have claimed, he promised to review the steps that led to her leaving the company. “We need to assess the circumstances that led up to Dr. Gebru’s departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jzOSM"&gt;He also apologized for how Gebru’s departure had “led some in our community to question their place at Google” and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s privacy labels are coming to all apps, including its own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9NOW6I"&gt;Apple has clarified that its &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/"&gt;mandatory app privacy “nutrition labels”&lt;/a&gt; program will apply to all apps, whether they’re from third-party developers or Apple’s own. It’s an apparent response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165152/whatsapp-privacy-apple-first-third-party-app-store-nutrition-labels"&gt;criticism from WhatsApp earlier today&lt;/a&gt; that the program unfairly favored Apple’s services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxSXLx"&gt;That means Apple’s apps on the App Store will receive similar privacy labels when the program rolls out later this year as third-party apps. And for the few iOS apps that aren’t available in the App Store — like Messages, a particular point of contention for WhatsApp — they will have the same privacy information available on Apple’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHNjJM"&gt;The statement follows a complaint from WhatsApp from earlier today in which the messaging service claimed that Apple’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moto G Stylus 2021 leak suggests a larger screen and higher price tag</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Moto G Stylus 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rfwQ4m86UhQqckE51vhPki_TCsw=/250x0:1750x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68486040/Moto_G_Stylus_2021_leaked.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The upcoming Moto G Stylus 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Image via Phone Arena&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OtVRDQ"&gt;Detailed specs and images of the 2021 Moto G Stylus have leaked by way of an early Amazon listing, as &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-renders-leak_id128790"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This iteration on the stylus-having, budget-friendly device looks to borrow features from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432283/motorola-moto-g9-plus-phone-available-now-brazil"&gt;this year’s Moto G9 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, including a 6.8-inch FHD+ display that’s slightly larger than its predecessor’s 6.4-inch screen. Amazon’s (now removed) page lists a price of $341, which is unlikely to be the final MSRP, but it’s a bit higher than the original G Stylus’ $299 introductory price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WuRkwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new Moto G Stylus and G Power are surprisingly adept cameraphones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OFwmp1"&gt;One of the things we liked best about the prior G Stylus was the image quality from its camera, and Motorola appears to have tweaked the hardware setup in the 2021 version.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U5VbIT"&gt;On Wednesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced a massive antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, claiming the social media giant has harmed competition by buying up smaller companies like Instagram and WhatsApp to squash the threat they posed to its business. Forty-seven other state and regional attorneys general are joining the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s9HRV"&gt;The lawsuit centers on Facebook’s acquisitions, particularly its $1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2011. In addition to its acquisition strategy, the attorneys general allege that Facebook used the power and reach of its platform to stifle user growth for competing services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dl6FFO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook has broken the law. It must be broken up.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Cruise is now testing fully driverless cars in San Francisco</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fpv4cx"&gt;Cruise, the self-driving car company affiliated with General Motors and Honda, is testing fully driverless cars, without a human safety driver behind the steering wheel, in San Francisco. The company is among the first to test its driverless vehicles in a dense, complex urban environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ro4Wgn"&gt;“Getting to driverless in SF took more than five years of rigorous testing, over 2 million miles of driving in one of the craziest driving environments, together with hard work from a huge team of dedicated engineers and others across Cruise, as well as at GM,” Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said in a call with reporters. “And not to mention several billion dollars of investment along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9OLEBR"&gt;To be sure, the vehicles are not completely alone...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hfn4yn"&gt;The software that runs on Amazon’s Fire TV streaming devices is set to undergo a significant overhaul in the coming weeks, and the rollout of the “new Fire TV experience” begins today on some devices. After the update is installed, you’ll have access to new features like multiuser support (with personalized recommendations and watch lists for each profile) and a streamlined interface that makes it faster to reach your favorite entertainment apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk6xjY"&gt;When you’re in the mood to watch something but you’re not sure what, there’s also a new “Find” tab that brings together movies, TV shows, free ad-supported content, and sports from various services. &lt;/p&gt;
