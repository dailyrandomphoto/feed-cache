    <title>As lawsuits pile up, Activision Blizzard loses its chief legal officer</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uo75mT"&gt;Another high-level Activision Blizzard employee has left the company. Claire Hart, Blizzard’s chief legal officer, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/claireelisehart_after-more-than-three-years-at-blizzard-entertainment-activity-6845779647314169856-Nnrf/?src=aff-lilpar&amp;amp;veh=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.10078_plc.Skimbit%20Ltd._pcrid.449670_learning&amp;amp;trk=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.10078_plc.Skimbit%20Ltd._pcrid.449670_learning&amp;amp;clickid=waH1njULNxyORZnwUx0Mo38VUkBQ6MyXVRgd2Q0&amp;amp;irgwc=1"&gt;announced in a LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt; that her last day was Friday, September 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFm0Tt"&gt;“The past three years have been full of unexpected twists and turns, but I feel honored to have worked with and met so many great people at Blizzard and across the Activision Blizzard businesses,” Hunt said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDzQpG"&gt;Those “unexpected twists and turns” might be an allusion to the series of legal troubles Activision Blizzard faces due to allegations of harassment, abuse, and discrimination. To date, Activision Blizzard is facing suits from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Nx3jXE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;California Department of Fair Employment and Housing&lt;/a&gt; for enabling a “culture of harassment.”&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Roblox will start verifying the age of teenage players</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NI6NMNtfcvBuM8dmxl3puNiN1X0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69889125/Roblox_Age_Verification.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Roblox’s age verification process involves scanning government-issued ID. | Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A1clox"&gt;Roblox is rolling out an age verification feature that will allow players to confirm their age and gain access to features reserved for older players. Age verification will be optional, and Roblox tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it will “not retain any data” from the verification process, which requires showing a form of ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgXArS"&gt;For now, only one feature requires age verification: Roblox’s new voice chat feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654884/roblox-voice-chat-spatial-moderation-discord"&gt;Spacial Voice&lt;/a&gt;. During its initial beta test, it will only be available to players who verify they are at least 13 years old. (Roblox didn’t say whether it would later be available to users regardless of verification status.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rPcvpp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Roblox, explained: Everything you wanted to know about one of the biggest apps on the planet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22457264/roblox-explainer-game-app-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KFdBlu"&gt;But the implication seems to be that other features — perhaps specific Roblox games or community tools — could be age-gated...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook releases two new Portal video calling devices with focus on remote work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s Portal Go and Portal Plus&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8epFkM"&gt;Facebook on Tuesday announced two new Portal video calling devices, the first major refresh of the hardware lineup since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNzLfm"&gt;The new devices, the Portal Go and updated Portal Plus, retail for $199 and $349, respectively. The 10-inch Portal Go is an all-new, portable form factor wrapped in fabric with a standalone battery, while the latest Portal Plus introduces a sleeker design of the most expensive, 14-inch Portal that first debuted three years ago. Both devices are available now for preorder and start shipping on October 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sH7bsy"&gt;Like the rest of the lineup, the Portal Go features a wide-angle camera that automatically follows whoever is in focus, zooming and panning as they move in and out of the center of the frame. It’s the first...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 worked fine with the slowest compatible SSD we could find</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5YwHqYsnb0TPi6LXwXx2bvXuK8o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69676444/vpavic_4278_20201030_0206.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eGpAhB"&gt;If your PS5 is already running out of speedy solid state storage, there’s a fix. Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22664808/ps5-playstation-5-update-m2-ssd-sony-software"&gt;new update for the PS5&lt;/a&gt;, released in full on September 14th, allows you to expand your paltry 667GB of usable space by popping in the same sort of M.2 SSD stick you might slip into your laptop or desktop PC. My colleague Mitchell has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22366087"&gt;a PS5 SSD buying guide right here&lt;/a&gt; that meets all of Sony’s recommendations, such as speeds of at least 5,500MB/s. That might leave you wondering, though: what about slower SSDs? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJUnow"&gt;That’s why we tracked down an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/XPG-S50-Lite-Internal-AGAMMIXS50L-1T-C/dp/B08HVZWGPP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ADATA XPG Gammix S50 Lite&lt;/a&gt;, one of the slowest compatible PCIe Gen4 drives we could find at 3,900MB/s reads and 3,200MB/s writes, and stuck it into a PS5 in August. And this week, &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry &lt;/em&gt;corroborated our...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to put the Windows 11 Start menu back where it belongs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ClCbBuO0Gjyguk3pBcR7RYmAtQE=/8x0:2552x1696/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69889116/twarren__windows11main_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T5Thwy"&gt;When you upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11, one of the first things you may do is wonder: where the heck is my Start menu? Traditionally, the Windows Start menu has been in the lower left corner of the screen, but when your new version of Windows appears, you’ll find the Start icon among a group of icons in the center of your taskbar at the bottom of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 11 Start menu is now a small icon in the center of the taskbar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SDCe0H"&gt;Click on the Start menu icon, and things will look very different as well. Instead of the large square Live Tiles that used to pop up, you have a much more modest set of app icons, mostly showing Microsoft-related apps, pinned to the main page. Click on “All apps” on the top...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now preorder the new Kindle Paperwhite</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JcOVZW"&gt;Amazon has officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date"&gt;taken the wraps off&lt;/a&gt; of the 11th-gen Kindle Paperwhite ahead of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684357/amazon-fall-event-devices-services-features-september-28th-echo-alexa"&gt;fall event on September 28th&lt;/a&gt;, and preorders are now open directly from the retail giant. The new Kindle comes in three flavors: a standard model (with or without ads), a Signature Edition, and one designed for kids. All versions of the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite will launch on October 27th. Preorders are only open at Amazon as of right now, but we’ll update this post with more retailers as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNpl7P"&gt;The new baseline Kindle Paperwhite is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11th-gen ad-supported model, which starts at $140&lt;/a&gt;. The price represents a $10 increase over its predecessor, though, the last-gen model has seen some larger discounts in recent months. We will...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Demi Adejuyigbe reminds us that, once again, it’s September 21st </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WhAGjL"&gt;The 21st of September? Buddy, that’s today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dNXMu"&gt;Lest you forget, comedian Demi Adejuyigbe has returned to memorialize Earth, Wind &amp;amp; Fire Day — more specifically September 21st, subject of the band’s evocative summer anthem “September.” For years, Adejuyigbe has jumped on the opportunity to mark the occasion with elaborate, often outrageous videos that have included everything from aerial banners to a mariachi band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nauq0I"&gt;The videos have become such a reliable marker of the end of summer that Adejuyigbe was able to hit a goal of $50,000 for charity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449277/september-21st-date-demi-adejuyigbe-earth-wind-fire"&gt;in just three hours&lt;/a&gt; last year, with the campaign ultimately generating more than $330,000 over the period of several days (more than $50,000 per charity listed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBlv5V"&gt;Adejuyigbe’s video for 2021 hit the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new cybersecurity center wants to protect medical devices against hacks</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KxAomE"&gt;It’s been around 10 years since security researcher Jay Radcliffe got up onstage at a conference and demonstrated that he was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/medtronic-security/medtronic-insulin-pumps-vulnerable-to-hackers-idUSN1E77O1VJ20110826"&gt;able to hack&lt;/a&gt; into his own insulin pump. If he’d wanted, he could have used the pump to deliver a lethal dose of the drug into his system. Instead, he demanded that medical companies take the security threat seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFtjwb"&gt;That presentation and &lt;a href="https://medcitynews.com/2012/03/hacker-shows-off-vulnerabilities-of-wireless-insulin-pumps/"&gt;others like it&lt;/a&gt; were wake-up calls about the potential danger of connecting vulnerable medical devices to the internet, says Mike Johnson, a securities technologies expert at the University of Minnesota’s Technological Leadership Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqFHkt"&gt;In the decade since, there’s been an explosion in the number of connected medical devices — drug infusion pumps, pacemakers, monitors — that...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jMEL6o"&gt;Facebook says it’s spent over $13 billion on “safety and security” since 2016 and has 40,000 people dedicated to the area, offering a glimpse at its operations after a week of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?mod=bigtop-breadcrumb"&gt;leaks published by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company used the numbers as an example of how it’s addressed problems on Facebook and Instagram, saying the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s stories lacked “important context” about complex issues.&lt;/p&gt;
