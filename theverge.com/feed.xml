    <title>Apple employees push back against returning to the office in internal letter</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rit5s"&gt;Apple employees are pushing back against a new policy that would require them to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Staff members say they want a flexible approach where those who want to work remote can do so, according to an internal letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FS3kub"&gt;“We would like to take the opportunity to communicate a growing concern among our colleagues,” the letter says. “That Apple’s remote/location-flexible work policy, and the communication around it, have already forced some of our colleagues to quit. Without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; being a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok says the repeat removal of the intersex hashtag was a mistake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yp5JK2SsRPG3dGrnOGaImYPkUEo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69408728/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvqKBf"&gt;Pidgeon Pagonis, an intersex activist, noticed last week that the #intersex hashtag wasn’t working on TikTok. They couldn’t click the tag on one of their own posts and trying to search for intersex pulled up a “null” page. This was the second time Pagonis noticed the tag disappearing, and they worried that TikTok had banned it just as they were about to start a series of celebratory videos called Intersex Joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDvsUT"&gt;Pagonis usually feels safe on TikTok because people on the platform are generally receptive to intersex topics. After growing up with secrecy, lies, and shame around being intersex, Pagonis sees TikTok and other platforms as spaces where intersex people “can connect with each other and also advocate for ourselves and each other,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia and Valve are bringing DLSS to Linux</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xIcCCe"&gt;Linux gamers using Valve’s Proton compatibility tool to run Windows games will be getting a performance upgrade in the future: Nvidia has announced that it’s working with Valve to bring FPS boosts using its DLSS technology featured on its RTX cards. It’s almost enough to make me want to revisit Linux gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMlmCl"&gt;DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, is a technology that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;lets gamers get more performance&lt;/a&gt; without having to give up too much image quality. It does this by running the game at lower-than-native resolution (say, rendering the game at 1080p when your monitor is 4K), but then upscaling the image to native resolution using some mightily impressive algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lF3KWd"&gt;The tech will, of course, be exciting for people with Linux gaming...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s why you can’t use the Siri Remote’s best feature on Disney Plus and other apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rae05jsZeZ7Xy96tJWJe7bcRUQ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69408279/DSCF3939.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LEFtbk"&gt;Apple’s new Siri Remote introduced a gesture that makes it easy to scrub through content by turning the control pad into a scroll wheel. But a number of Apple TV users noticed that the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22518296/apple-new-siri-remote-hbo-max-disney-plus"&gt;doesn’t work properly&lt;/a&gt; on some services, like HBO Max, or at all on others, like Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQyWtu"&gt;A spokesperson for Disney Plus confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the feature — one of the best on the redesigned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; — isn’t supported on its service. It’s not a service issue, though, but instead related to custom video players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2k9Pz"&gt;Some streaming apps available on Apple TV use their own players, while others use the tvOS media player. The jogging gesture works with streaming apps that use Apple’s native media player, but it is not yet supported for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey would rather give you a bitcoin wallet than Twitter features worth paying for</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="VEEp0E"&gt;Twitter Blue — the social network’s first subscription product that adds an undo button to tweets among other minor additions like changing the color of icons and adding folders for bookmarks — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;launched on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. It’s limited to Canada and Australia for now but has already garnered attention for lacking the features people would be willing to pay Twitter for, like no ads, or better tools to handle harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klVH51"&gt;Which makes Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s thread today, the day after the product launched, somewhat humorous and frustrating. What can we say: the guy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22230028/jack-dorsey-donald-trump-twitter-ban-moderation-bitcoin-thread"&gt;loves to talk about bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, even when other more pressing matters are at hand! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Square is considering making a hardware wallet for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;. If we do it, we would build it entirely...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile employee files suit after HR asked invasive questions about her OnlyFans account</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hvfLAr"&gt;A sales rep at a T-Mobile store in Fort Worth, Texas has filed a gender discrimination suit against the company after a member of the HR team inappropriately questioned her about having an OnlyFans account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GycML4"&gt;Caitlyn Stevens had been working at T-Mobile for nearly seven years when a male colleague became angry with her about how she was handling a customer interaction, the complaint says. He approached her “in a physically aggressive manager,” forcing a coworker to step in and stop the man from hitting her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcr5mF"&gt;Stevens reported the incident to the store manager. Rather than disciplining the male colleague who’d allegedly tried to hurt her, the manager relocated Stevens to a different location, according to the complaint. The location got less...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic was the bloodiest year for driving in over a decade</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZiGX0t"&gt;Road deaths jumped 7.2 percent in 2020 from the year before, hitting a 13-year high, even though people weren’t driving as much, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). But while &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/2020-fatality-data-show-increased-traffic-fatalities-during-pandemic"&gt;NHTSA’s numbers&lt;/a&gt; paint a grim picture, they offer only a glimpse at what’s shaping up to be a historically bloody year of driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJZNFu"&gt;Overall, 38,680 people died in car crashes in 2020, the highest number since 2007. But it’s worse than it sounds, since the number of miles driven in the US dropped by 13 percent. That means every mile someone drove last year was more dangerous than it was the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27ql0J"&gt;Heeding the call to “stay home,” Americans drove less during this pandemic year. But those who did get behind the wheel engaged in...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="bYFUhi"&gt;Some 150 birds named for people tied to slavery and white supremacy could eventually&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;get new monikers as part of an ongoing reckoning with racism within the world of birding. That includes Jameson’s firefinch, named for a British naturalist who bought a young girl while in Africa “as a joke” and then drew pictures of her being brutally killed. In a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2021/bird-names-racism-audubon"&gt;new story&lt;/a&gt; this week, &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reporter Darryl Fears breaks down the horrific history of ornithology that has managed to be scrubbed clean in many history books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z7F6HZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Indigenous peoples understood the animals long before white settlers supposedly “discovered” them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Facebook gives Trump a 2-year suspension, changes rules for politicians</title>

  &lt;p id="s3XtjS"&gt;Facebook has extended &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/facebook-response-to-oversight-board-recommendations-trump/"&gt;former President Donald Trump’s indefinite ban&lt;/a&gt; into a two-year suspension that will end January 7th, 2023. It will then reevaluate Trump’s ban to “assess whether the risk to public safety has receded,” Facebook’s vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, announced Friday. If Trump is reinstated and violates Facebook’s rules again, the company will implement a “strict set of rapidly escalating sanctions” that could lead to a permanent ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhqgTJ"&gt;The suspension accompanies a broader change in how Facebook treats “newsworthy” posts that break its rules and speech by politicians. The social network will still allow some violating content that is “newsworthy or important to the public interest” to remain online. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22474738/facebook-ending-political-figure-exemption-moderation-policy"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;The...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
