    <title>China fines Alibaba $2.8 billion after antitrust investigation</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yux4pg"&gt;China has hit Alibaba, one of the country’s biggest online retailers, with a record $2.8 billion (18.2 billion yuan) fine, after an investigation found the ecommerce giant violated China’s anti-monopoly law, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/technology/china-alibaba-monopoly-fine.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. The fine, which represents 4 percent of Alibaba’s 2019 domestic sales, is three times higher than the $975 billion fine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/9/8009589/qualcomm-fined-975-million-by-chinese-anti-monopoly-regulators"&gt;China imposed on US chip company Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; back in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkY5lr"&gt;The Chinese government launched an investigation into Alibaba in December to determine whether the company was preventing merchants from selling their products on other platforms. China’s market regulator found that Alibaba’s practices had a negative effect on online retail competition and innovation. Alibaba used data and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lawsuit against Amazon alleging it failed to protect workers from COVID-19 moved back to NY state court</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TI5ZPn"&gt;A federal judge has granted the New York attorney general’s request to move a lawsuit against Amazon back to New York state court, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-new-york-lawsuits/judge-hands-amazon-a-setback-in-new-york-lawsuit-over-covid-19-shortfalls-idUSKBN2BW2TW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. AG &lt;a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=muvelgaOEvSt6Yc1gGqzAg=="&gt;Letitia James’ lawsuit alleges&lt;/a&gt; that the ecommerce giant failed to protect workers at its Brooklyn and Staten Island warehouses from COVID-19 during the early months of the pandemic, and retaliated against employees who complained about the lack of safety measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A54XYG"&gt;Amazon had sought to have the case moved to federal court, arguing that workplace safety issues were not under James’ purview. The company pre-emptively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279819/amazon-new-york-ag-state-lawsuit-covid-19-warehouse-conditions-pandemic"&gt;sued James on February 12th&lt;/a&gt;, and James sued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287204/new-york-amazon-lawsuit-worker-safety-failures"&gt;Amazon four days later&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon then moved the lawsuit to federal court.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First flight test for NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter pushed to Wednesday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Stbpub_rH8IYvuSpE182JbrU3eA=/0x62:1578x1114/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106684/PIA24581.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GhxL8g"&gt;NASA engineers have decided to delay the Ingenuity helicopter’s debut flight on Mars to at least Wednesday, April 14th, after running into a minor computer glitch during a rotor spin test late Friday night, the agency said on Saturday. The tiny craft is healthy, but engineers need some more time to review telemetry data from the unexpected hiccup before proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="On4tsu"&gt;Ingenuity, a mini four-pound helicopter that arrived on Mars February 18th attached to NASA’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Perseverance rover&lt;/a&gt;, was initially slated to carry out its first flight test late Sunday night (or, mid-day Mars time). The first bits of data on whether the flight attempt was successful was expected to come early Monday morning, around 4AM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wHfcD"&gt;But data from a high-speed rotor test...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook spent $23 million for CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s security in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d0kgVF"&gt;A new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that Facebook spent more than $23 million last year on security for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook’s annual reviews of company security “identified specific threats to Mr. Zuckerberg,” according to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680121000022/facebook2021definitiveprox.htm"&gt;proxy statement filed Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5fk6H"&gt;“He is synonymous with Facebook, and as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” the proxy says of the Facebook CEO’s role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppohbs"&gt;The company’s annual review of security programs showed the costs of protecting Zuckerberg and his family rose in 2020 mainly due to COVID-19 travel protocols, increased security coverage during the 2020 US election season “and other periods with...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The team behind Age of Empires IV wants you to learn history while playing the game</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DeQa2j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; games have always taken place against a historical backdrop, but Microsoft and Relic Entertainment want to take things even further with &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt;. The game will feature narrated documentaries throughout the campaigns, time period-accurate language and music, as well as art and game design that looks to take inspiration from both world history and the history of the &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; franchise. On release, &lt;em&gt;Age IV &lt;/em&gt;will focus on the Middle Ages, having players start with small agrarian villages and build up to castles and kings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vY425V"&gt;While players can experience hundreds of years of history in a single match, the game will also feature campaigns that let players go through real-life stories that span generations. So far,...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cYeEH4"&gt;We haven’t heard much about &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16182760/age-of-empires-iv-development-microsoft-pc-release-date"&gt;since it was announced in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ve finally been given a look at the game, which includes the Mongols and Delhi Sultanate as playable civilizations. Microsoft and developer Relic Entertainment showed off a healthy amount of gameplay footage as well as new features and civilizations coming to the series &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OJ14RVFDGQ"&gt;in a “Fan Preview” event&lt;/a&gt;. The game also has a release window: fall 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhNIzS"&gt;The last main entry in the long-running historical strategy series &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_III"&gt;was released in 2005&lt;/a&gt;, and the new game looks to build on the formula created by previous entries, while adding features made possible by 15-ish years of technological improvements. That includes the obvious things — like 4K and HDR — to more strategy...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unionizing Amazon warehouses was never going to be easy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-POLITICS-LABOR-AMAZON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cI1WKLlXBijcvQGE_NuEAtrxoeA=/0x0:5381x3587/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106275/1232001914.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RverNg"&gt;For more than a year, a group of workers in Bessemer, Alabama have campaigned to unionize their warehouse under the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), hoping to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;force the retail giant to collectively bargain with its warehouse workers&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. On Friday, those hopes came to an abrupt end. In a unit-wide election, workers at the warehouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;voted against unionization by a more than 2-1 margin&lt;/a&gt;, with 738 votes in favor to 1,798 against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvVDHs"&gt;It’s a devastating loss for the RWDSU and the labor movement broadly. The union is still fighting the result — filing objections and arguing that Amazon’s campaign violated labor law — but those challenges are unlikely to change the result. After dreaming of a domino effect that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The week in NFTs, ranked</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NdFXNU"&gt;It’s another day in 2021, and so of course it’s another day where someone, somewhere is launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;an NFT&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of making a ton of easy money. This week’s NFT launches were headlined by some big names — M.I.A., Tfue, Spike Jonze — and collectively posed the question: can you still, nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;Beeple’s blockbuster NFT sale&lt;/a&gt; at Christie’s, make a stupid amount of cash off these things in part by being in the right place at the right time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngUUdo"&gt;The answer, it seems, is mostly yes. And several of this week’s NFT creators were clearly here for just that possibility. Not that this NFT thing was always the exclusive realm of fine art — I present to you &lt;a href="https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:322068:0x63f69c262122fac7fa4a1bf4eb599f63d7cb6506"&gt;this golden Pringles can&lt;/a&gt; that raises its eyebrows at you as if to say &lt;em&gt;come and try me &lt;/em&gt;—...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>For many, COVID-19 vaccines come with a side of side effects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="4 million vaccinations to under served communities" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/81B4nbr901lyfb4DMtzvcReQgdg=/0x1:3900x2601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106179/1232163164.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dania Maxwell / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtkY1f"&gt;Getting a COVID-19 vaccine comes with a lot of benefits. There’s the protection against a world-altering virus, the ability to travel more safely, and hanging out in people’s houses again. There are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/business/covid-19-vaccine-krispy-kreme-donuts.html"&gt;also doughnuts&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s also &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778441"&gt;a pretty good chance&lt;/a&gt; that a vaccine will be accompanied by a few unwelcome side effects. Most of these are pretty benign — like a sore arm or fatigue. Some are more serious, but those are also extremely rare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfkShI"&gt;Here’s a cheat sheet&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to help you figure out what to expect after your COVID-19 shot.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMmkKj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some common side effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tw5nkv"&gt;Your arm might feel sore after you get the shot, and there might be some redness or swelling near the injection site. There’s also a chance that you could develop a headache, fever,...&lt;/p&gt;
