    <title>Tinder will now quiz you on your vibes</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sr0SRf"&gt;Tinder wants to give you more info on what you and a match have in common, so it’s launching a new quiz feature to help out. The quizzes, called Vibes, will pop up once a week and ask an assortment of goofy questions, from “_____ is not picnic food” to “Are you always 20 minutes early or 10 minutes late?” If another person gave the same answers as you, those answers will appear on their profile or, if you match, in your chat together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIquEK"&gt;Vibes isn’t turning Tinder into a full-on OkCupid rival for endless, silly personality quiz questions. The answers are temporary, vanishing after a few days. So you’ll have to return to the app and answer new questions the following week if you want to participate again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

    <title>Tim Sweeney emailed Tim Cook personally to call for open app sales after WWDC in 2015</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jdmmXn"&gt;Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney was asking Apple to open its phones to other app stores as early as 2015, according to new emails made public as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the companies’ antitrust trial&lt;/a&gt;. Under the subject line “iOS as an open platform,” Sweeney &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20697668-tim-sweeney-tim-cook-email-open-ios"&gt;emailed Apple CEO Tim Cook directly&lt;/a&gt; to make the case for allowing other app stores to distribute software on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biLoWU"&gt;“The App Store has done much good for the industry,” Sweeney wrote to Cook, “but it doesn’t seem tenable for Apple to be the sole arbiter of expression and commerce over an app platform approaching a billion users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtfE9M"&gt;In particular, Sweeney asked to “separate iOS App Store curation from compliance review and app distribution,” essentially suggesting that Apple could maintain its security...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti keeps leaking ahead of rumored launch later this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZynro3bRHH8UPFo40KBNptYzJQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69236642/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WJsr7g"&gt;Nvidia appears to be getting ready to launch its RTX 3080 Ti graphics card later this month. Over the past few weeks, RTX 3080 Ti cards have reportedly been spotted on &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-ventus-3x-12gb-spotted-during-transit"&gt;shipping pallets&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-suprim-x-pictured"&gt;retail boxes&lt;/a&gt;, and now in the hands of someone. &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt; has been at the center of tracking down Nvidia’s rumored RTX 3080 Ti card, and it &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-and-rtx-3070-ti-to-be-announced-on-may-31st-launching-in-june"&gt;reports the GPU will be launched on May 31st&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the RTX 3070 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="co66Wj"&gt;The RTX 3080 Ti will reportedly include 12GB of GDDR6X memory, a 2GB increase over what’s found on the RTX 3080. A wider 384-bit bus is rumored, matching the RTX 3090 — and an increase to the memory bandwidth over the RTX 3080. What this all means in terms of performance isn’t exactly clear yet, but it certainly looks like the RTX 3080 Ti will...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit seems to be back after an almost hour-long outage</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DigTHL"&gt;Reddit had a bit of a blip on Tuesday afternoon, going down for almost an hour. According to &lt;a href="https://reddit.statuspage.io/"&gt;Reddit’s status page&lt;/a&gt;, the issues started around 1:56PM ET. At 2:17PM ET, &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/reddit/"&gt;Downdetector&lt;/a&gt; reports spiked, with around 45,000 users reporting problems connecting to its homepage and subreddits. Staff here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; were also unable to load the site, with some getting a blank homepage and others experiencing slow loading times and getting kicked off of pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpb31n"&gt;The status page now indicates that Reddit has implemented a fix and is monitoring the results. While the status page still shows that there’s a partial outage, we were all able to successfully load and browse the site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>What to expect from the EPA’s new rules affecting air conditioners and refrigerators </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Near-Record Heat Wave Grips U.S. East Coast, Midwest" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IZatqgdhAfB4-2N3wvmk-OCZxXI=/0x472:3000x2472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235998/71570187.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IrCuUt"&gt;“Super” greenhouse gases will soon be phased down in air conditioners and refrigerators in the US. The Environmental Protection Agency yesterday proposed new rules to cut the use of the “super” pollutants used as refrigerants, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), by 85 percent over 15 years. Consumers likely won’t notice much of a difference with their appliances, but lawmakers are anticipating big benefits for the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fR3CeV"&gt;The EPA plans to determine a baseline for HFC production and consumption, and then set limits on companies making and importing HFCs. Those caps would become stricter over time. This is the agency’s first major new regulation taking on climate change under the Biden administration, and it makes good on a bipartisan commitment...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber’s grocery delivery is getting a boost from new partnership with Gopuff</title>

Gopuff, which acquired liquor store chain BevMo last year, will make its inventory of convenience and grocery store items available to Uber as part of this new deal. The companies plan to roll out their new offerings to customers in 95 cities starting this June and nationwide later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIFyjA"&gt;Gopuff will handle the logistics and delivery of the items, with Uber taking a cut of the transaction through its app. Gopuff, which was founded in 2013, operates in 650 cities in the US, with over 250 “micro-fulfillment centers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Royal Navy is testing using jet suits to fight high-seas piracy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdYlg0"&gt;The British Royal Navy has apparently been testing using jet suits to board ships like a scene out of some scrapped Christopher Nolan film, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suHOLFhbwsM"&gt;according to a new video&lt;/a&gt; released by UK-based Gravity Industries. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/video-royal-marines-board-ship-at-sea-with-jet-packs-2021-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt; that the tests were conducted over three days on the HMS Tamar, a Royal Navy Batch 2 River-class offshore patrol ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEA3KD"&gt;Royal Marines used Gravity Industries’ Jet Suit to conduct a “visit, board, search, and seizure” operation or VBSS. Basically a marine launched from a fast boat tailing the HMS Tamar, flew through the air like a slightly askew Iron Man, and landed on the larger ship, dropping a rope below so their fast boat buddies could climb up and “visit” the simulated enemy vessel. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="g2736R"&gt;Epic pushed Microsoft to open up its Xbox network for free multiplayer gaming just weeks before the Apple and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; battle. In the weeks leading up to Epic Games’ decision to circumvent Apple’s 30 percent cut on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in-app purchases, CEO Tim Sweeney sent an email to Xbox chief Phil Spencer teasing something big and asking whether Microsoft could time free multiplayer with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; season 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ78ST"&gt;“Epic has certain plans for August that will provide an extraordinary opportunity to highlight the value proposition of consoles and PCs, in contrast to mobile platforms, and to onboard new console users,” said Sweeney. “While I can’t share details with any third party at this point, I give you Epic’s assurance that our efforts will be...&lt;/p&gt;

The Galaxy S8 was a well-timed success story for Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15092590/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-screen-size-aspect-ratio-edge"&gt;launching in the spring of 2017&lt;/a&gt; with a bold design that drew attention away from the well-documented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12767670/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-fire-risk"&gt;Galaxy Note 7 battery problems&lt;/a&gt; of the previous six months.&lt;/p&gt;

Best of all, the batteries did not catch fire.&lt;/p&gt;
