    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LmSQEa"&gt;A crew of four astronauts successfully returned to Earth this evening, splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Pensacola inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. Their arrival back on the planet brings an end to a more than six-month-long stay aboard the International Space Station, and it paves the way for another crew of four to launch to the ISS in the coming week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMKPJE"&gt;The crew includes two NASA astronauts, Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, and French astronaut Thomas Pesquet from the European Space Agency. The group launched to the space station on April 23rd atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, part of a mission called Crew-2.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve says supporting the Steam Deck with BattlEye anti-cheat is as easy as an email</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="woTbCC"&gt;We knew from the beginning that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Valve’s upcoming $400 Steam Deck handheld&lt;/a&gt; wouldn’t play every Steam game perfectly out of the box. It runs Windows games on Linux using the Proton compatibility layer, and some of the biggest games on Steam use anti-cheat software that, historically, hasn’t worked with Proton. But on Friday, Valve revealed that this should no longer be a problem for BattlEye, one of the biggest anti-cheat vendors out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tF4sPS"&gt;“BattlEye on Proton integration has reached a point where all a developer needs to do is reach out BattlEye to enable it for their title. No additional work is required by the developer besides that communication,” &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3104663180636096966"&gt;writes Valve&lt;/a&gt;, adding that &lt;em&gt;Mount &amp;amp; Blade II Bannerlord&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ark: Survival Evolved &lt;/em&gt;are...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pet Portraits lets you find art look-alikes for your furry friend</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="igtXNz"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/arts-culture/paws-meet-machine-learning-pet-portraits/"&gt;has announced an exciting new feature&lt;/a&gt; for its Arts and Culture app: the ability to search through thousands of paintings to find a look-alike for your pet. The company says its “Pet Portraits” feature will let you take a picture of a dog, cat, fish, bird, reptile, horse, or rabbit, and have a machine learning algorithm find pieces of art that feature a similar-looking animal. The process only takes a few seconds, and as a bonus you’ll be able to tap on the pieces of artwork to learn more about them. You can even save a video slideshow of your results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzHgUi"&gt;I tried out Pet Portraits on my cat, Aslan, and the results were mixed — while the app was able to generate a beautiful (okay, mostly tan) color palette based on his fur, most of the...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMC boss says company is exploring how to accept Shiba Inu along with other crypto </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q_j6x7JQlLn7uwqf6tT9jg75yeg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70114547/acastro_210813_1777_amc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rQPlvk"&gt;AMC boss Adam Aron said today that the theater chain is exploring how it can accept Shiba Inu in addition to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. In addition, AMC is evidently exploring its own cryptocurrency, which would truly cement the company as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465198/amc-meme-stock-popcorn-wsb"&gt;king of the memestocks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sa2tc"&gt;That AMC appears to be flirting with the idea of accepting (another) meme currency in exchange for actual goods and services isn’t entirely surprising. AMC was effectively rescued midway through the pandemic by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;meme stock Reddit traders&lt;/a&gt;, and Aron has been leaning heavily into the company’s relationship with these shareholders ever since. Hearing about AMC’s crypto ambitions has not only come to be expected during the company’s meetings with shareholders,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An alleged member of the REvil ransomware gang has been arrested in Poland</title>

  &lt;p id="QyXig3"&gt;The Justice Department &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ukrainian-arrested-and-charged-ransomware-attack-kaseya"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; the arrest and indictment of an alleged member of the REvil hacking group, linked to ransomware attacks on IT firm Kaseya, an Apple supplier, and more. According to the department, Ukrainian national Yaroslav Vasinskyi is facing extradition to the US after Polish authorities detained him in October and after the US indicted him for cybercrimes in August, as revealed by a now-unsealed court document. The arrest, along with the government seizing assets it says are linked to REvil’s operations, is another step in the fight against ransomware, which has been a growing issue for US-based companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lzng9I"&gt;The DOJ also says it has seized $6.1 million in assets from the FTX crypto trading exchange, allegedly...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A pair of PS5 hacks could be the first steps towards jailbreaking Sony’s latest console</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/giV4ELoaT9ddCSi0aUt9AuMqieA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70114154/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5UI4Hd"&gt;Hackers may have just made some big strides towards possibly jailbreaking the PlayStation 5 over the weekend, with the hacking group &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fail0verflow/status/1457499576676634625"&gt;Fail0verflow claiming&lt;/a&gt; to have managed to obtain PS5 root keys allowing them to decrypt the console’s firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSjSC4"&gt;Additionally, Andy Nguyen (a security engineer at Google who’s better known under his handle, theflow0) &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/theflow0/status/1457362920501829636"&gt;managed to access&lt;/a&gt; the PS5’s debug settings menu on a retail PS5 over the weekend, too. Both exploits were spotted by &lt;a href="http://Wololo.net"&gt;Wololo.net&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H6hPfa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Another one bites the dust   &lt;a href="https://t.co/Y1ty93AvaE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Y1ty93AvaE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— fail0verflow (@fail0verflow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fail0verflow/status/1457499576676634625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4V3Mlj"&gt;The two exploits are particularly notable due to the level of access they theoretically give to the PS5’s software. Decrypted firmware — which is possible...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll be able to pay for Amazon purchases with Venmo starting in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m4Wk7H"&gt;If you want to buy anything on Amazon.com, you’ll generally need a credit or debit card — but in 2022, the online retailer will begin accepting Venmo as well. Venmo parent company PayPal &lt;a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-11-08-PayPal-and-Amazon-to-Enable-Customers-to-Pay-with-Venmo-at-Checkout"&gt;announced the news&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-customers-will-able-pay-venmo-next-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) during its Q3 earnings call on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkUVAB"&gt;We’re pretty sure that’s the first third-party payments platform Amazon has embraced in recent memory. You can’t use PayPal itself to buy things on Amazon! (Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GFBWMNXEPYVJAY9A"&gt;a list of the payment methods Amazon does accept&lt;/a&gt; as of today). You might cite Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/amazon-partners-with-affirm"&gt;recent buy-now, pay-later partnership with Affirm&lt;/a&gt;, but that still requires credit. Venmo, by comparison, acts more like a bank account for some mobile users, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213387/venmo-check-cashing-paypal-customers-banking"&gt;complete with a (sometimes expensive) check-cashing feature.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Galactic sells 100 tickets to space at higher price after reopening sales</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZBzVKV"&gt;Space tourism venture Virgin Galactic says that 100 people purchased more expensive tickets to fly on the company’s suborbital spaceplane after it reopened ticket sales this August. That means that the company has roughly 700 ticket holders now for quick tourist trips to space, about 300 less than the 1,000 tickets Virgin Galactic is hoping to sell ahead of starting commercial flights of its vehicles. The company announced the news &lt;a href="https://investors.virgingalactic.com/news/news-details/2021/Virgin-Galactic-Announces-Third-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx"&gt;during its third-quarter earnings release out on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxFx3a"&gt;Though Virgin Galactic still has more tickets it aims to sell, the company says the additional sales from this quarter were better than expected. “We’re selling tickets ahead of the pace we planned,” Michael Colglazier, Virgin Galactic’s CEO, said during...&lt;/p&gt;
