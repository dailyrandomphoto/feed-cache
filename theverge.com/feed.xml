    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jjupRR"&gt;After several senators criticized the company, Apple said on Sunday it would send its chief compliance officer to an April 21st hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the office of Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78tDaB"&gt;Leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday demanding that the company send a representative to the hearing, saying Apple was refusing to participate. &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6/e/6e3e8f7c-adf3-4f0a-ae4d-429ebdee5e7b/EBBA9ECB053293C7011FBA308652C607.2021.04.09-ltr-to-tcook-apple.pdf"&gt;In the letter&lt;/a&gt;, Klobuchar and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) say Apple “abruptly” decided not to provide a witness for the hearing on digital markets focused on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3jmNZ"&gt;“Apple’s sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee on app store competition issues...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>French lawmakers vote to ban some domestic flights to reduce carbon emissions</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PA5C54"&gt;French lawmakers have voted to ban domestic flights on routes that could be taken in a train ride in less than two-and-a-half hours, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-france-flights-idUSKBN2BY0AO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The vote late Saturday comes as part of France’s larger climate bill, which seeks to reduce its 1990-level carbon emissions by 40 percent over the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGgZgs"&gt;Last week, France’s government said it would contribute 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) to recapitalize airline Air France-KLM. The airline warned it is expecting an operating loss of 1.3 billion euros when it reports its first-quarter earnings next month. The airline industry is reeling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to a sharp reduction in global travel over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse CEO says user data was not leaked, contrary to reports</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4eTW0P"&gt;Clubhouse CEO Paul Davison said Sunday that a report claiming personal user data had been leaked was “false.”  &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/security/clubhouse-data-leak-1-3-million-user-records-leaked-for-free-online/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; a SQL database with users’ IDs, names, usernames, Twitter and Instagram handles and follower counts were posted to an online hacker forum. According to &lt;em&gt;Cyber News, &lt;/em&gt;it did not appear that sensitive user information such as credit card numbers were among the leaked info. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzRTqg"&gt;Clubhouse did not immediately reply to a request for more information from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday. But Davison said in response to a question during a town hall that the platform had not suffered a data breach. “No, This is misleading and false, it is a clickbait article, we were not hacked. The data referred to was all public profile information...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="HxSVpZ"&gt;A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;9to5 Google&lt;/em&gt; that the apps will continue to function through June. &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Within the next few weeks, we’ll no longer be supporting the Shopping app. All of the functionality the app offered users is available on the Shopping tab,” the spokesperson said.

&lt;p id="YOtNIP"&gt;In a joint statement the companies said they would “work to help the development of EV battery industry in South Korea and the US. through healthy competition and friendly cooperation,” adding that they would “work together to strengthen the battery network and environmentally-friendly policy that the Biden administration is pursuing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8suLsg"&gt;In February, the US International Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9481d70b-827b-476d-9e0b-21245321e289"&gt;imposed a 10-year import ban&lt;/a&gt; on SK Innovation— due to take effect Sunday— following allegations it...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly ran secret ‘Project Bernanke’ that boosted its own ad-buying system over competitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSEhvxYAFq6hozN3kqmpgE3Mr3M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69108688/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l1nPWG"&gt;Google reportedly ran a secret project called “Project Bernanke” that relied on bidding data collected from advertisers using its ad exchange to benefit the company’s own ad system, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-secret-project-bernanke-revealed-in-texas-antitrust-case-11618097760?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. First discovered by newswire &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KhushitaVasant/status/1379955848118726659?s=20"&gt;service MLex&lt;/a&gt;, the name of the project was visible in an inadvertently unredacted document Google had filed as part of an antitrust lawsuit in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EKR7S"&gt;A federal judge has since let Google refile the document under seal. But according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, “Bernanke” was not disclosed to outside advertisers, and proved lucrative for Google, generating hundreds of millions of dollars for the company. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Texas filed an antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Google in December, alleging that the search giant was using...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yux4pg"&gt;China has hit Alibaba, one of the country’s biggest online retailers, with a record $2.8 billion (18.2 billion yuan) fine, after an investigation found the ecommerce giant violated China’s anti-monopoly law, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/technology/china-alibaba-monopoly-fine.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. The fine, which represents 4 percent of Alibaba’s 2019 domestic sales, is three times higher than the $975 million fine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/9/8009589/qualcomm-fined-975-million-by-chinese-anti-monopoly-regulators"&gt;China imposed on US chip company Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; back in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkY5lr"&gt;The Chinese government launched an investigation into Alibaba in December to determine whether the company was preventing merchants from selling their products on other platforms. China’s market regulator found that Alibaba’s practices had a negative effect on online retail competition and innovation. Alibaba used data and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lawsuit against Amazon alleging it failed to protect workers from COVID-19 moved back to NY state court</title>

  &lt;p id="TI5ZPn"&gt;A federal judge has granted the New York attorney general’s request to move a lawsuit against Amazon back to New York state court, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-new-york-lawsuits/judge-hands-amazon-a-setback-in-new-york-lawsuit-over-covid-19-shortfalls-idUSKBN2BW2TW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. AG &lt;a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=muvelgaOEvSt6Yc1gGqzAg=="&gt;Letitia James’ lawsuit alleges&lt;/a&gt; that the ecommerce giant failed to protect workers at its Brooklyn and Staten Island warehouses from COVID-19 during the early months of the pandemic, and retaliated against employees who complained about the lack of safety measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A54XYG"&gt;Amazon had sought to have the case moved to federal court, arguing that workplace safety issues were not under James’ purview. The company pre-emptively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279819/amazon-new-york-ag-state-lawsuit-covid-19-warehouse-conditions-pandemic"&gt;sued James on February 12th&lt;/a&gt;, and James sued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287204/new-york-amazon-lawsuit-worker-safety-failures"&gt;Amazon four days later&lt;/a&gt;.
