    <title>AT&amp;T’s new 5-gig and 2-gig fiber internet is here, starting at $110 a month</title>

  &lt;p id="K66hn1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.att.com/aboutus/pressrelease/2022/fastest-major-internet-provider.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is rolling out 2Gbps and 5Gbps&lt;/a&gt; speed tiers for its &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/internet/fiber/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fiber-optic internet option&lt;/a&gt;. The company made the announcement to kick off its Life Gigified event, where it said new and existing AT&amp;amp;T Fiber customers will soon be able to take advantage of these multi-gig connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUOSaz"&gt;If you don’t know what multi-gig is, it means a single connection that offers speeds higher than 1Gbps. And because it’s a fiber-optic connection, this speed goes both ways. “It’s symmetrical; your upload and download speeds are the same.” Chris Sambar, AT&amp;amp;T’s executive vice president of technology operations said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQf68L"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s new multi-gig speeds need Wi-Fi 6 technology for “optimal” performance, which means you’ll probably want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21283756/arris-surfboard-max-pro-wi-fi-6-mesh-router-review-price-specs-features"&gt;upgrade...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the auto repair professor pivoting to EVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lEEf008xJcbOxJYOlezl0gX2C6U=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426327/Ruth_Morrison1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xsKaVg"&gt;With the number of electric vehicles on the roads poised to skyrocket this decade, millions of drivers are going to need auto mechanics who can fix their new batteries-on-wheels. But today, the &lt;a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2018/12/10/97-of-auto-mechanics-cant-work-on-electric-cars-new-report-concludes/?utm_source=Triggermail&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Post%20Blast%20bii-transportation-and-logistics:%20Tesla%20owners%20dissatisfied%20with%20wait%20for%20services%20%7C%20Ford%20will%20use%20over-the-air%20updates%20in%202020%20%7C%20US%20govt%20grounds%20Chinese%20drones&amp;amp;utm_term=BII%20List%20T%26L%20ALL"&gt;vast majority of auto repair professionals&lt;/a&gt; do not have the training or equipment to repair EVs, which are anatomically very different from their gas-powered predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EI8JQ"&gt;As a result, many early EV adopters have been forced to rely on vehicle manufacturers and dealerships to service their cars — a situation that can &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/26/your-money/26shortcuts.html"&gt;drive up repair costs&lt;/a&gt; and lead to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-owners-dissatisfied-with-wait-for-services-2019-11"&gt;frustratingly long wait times&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1HEqQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smccme.edu/faculty-profiles/#morrison"&gt;Ruth Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, who chairs the &lt;a href="https://www.smccme.edu/academics/degree-programs/automotive-technology/#cert"&gt;Automotive Technology Department&lt;/a&gt; at Southern Maine Community College (SMCC), wants to change that. Morrison, who was an auto mechanic...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase makes it easier to report cryptocurrency taxes</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIGjhJ"&gt;Coinbase, one of the largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, is adding a new tax center to its app and website to help US customers work out how much they might owe to the IRS as a result of their crypto transactions, the company has announced. The section is designed to gather every taxable transaction into one place to simplify matters come tax day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hqKtd"&gt;Although cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin often appear similar to the fiat money we’re accustomed to, in the eyes of the IRS, the digital assets are actually property, according to &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions"&gt;this FAQ&lt;/a&gt; from the federal agency. That means cryptocurrency transactions may need to be reported as capital gains or losses, and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; means keeping track of a cryptocurrency’s value as it’s bought and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An OpenSea bug let attackers snatch Apes from owners at six-figure discounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of NFTs falling into a sack." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PYOMgyz3lwxP5YYu6bOBMYrILk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426146/acastro_210914_4753_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fsD8Vh"&gt;A bug in OpenSea, the popular NFT marketplace, has let hackers buy rare NFTs for well below market value, in some cases leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses for the original owners — and hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits for the apparent thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPY739"&gt;The bug appears to have been present for weeks and seems to be referenced in at least one &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carsonturner/status/1477414895834513413"&gt;tweet from January 1st, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. But exploitation of the bug has picked up significantly in the past day: blockchain analytics company Elliptic reported that in a 12-hour stretch before the morning of January 24th, it was exploited at least eight times to &lt;a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/bug-allows-nfts-worth-over-1-million-to-be-stolen"&gt;“steal” NFTs with a market value of over $1 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zg3zd7"&gt;One of the NFTs, &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/9991"&gt;Bored Ape Yacht Club #9991&lt;/a&gt;, was purchased using the exploit...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta has built an AI supercomputer it says will be world’s fastest by end of 2022</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zjq47W"&gt;Social media conglomerate Meta is the latest tech company to build an “AI supercomputer” — a high-speed computer designed specifically to train machine learning systems. The company says its new AI Research SuperCluster, or RSC, is already among the fastest machines of its type and, when complete in mid-2022, will be the world’s fastest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBIDfC"&gt;“Meta has developed what we believe is the world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. “We’re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it’ll be complete later this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuL4ri"&gt;The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-uks-most-powerful-supercomputer-for-research-in-ai-and-healthcare"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; have already announced their own “AI supercomputers,” which are slightly...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford reportedly suspends reservations of its Maverick hybrid pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TVqMIb"&gt;Ford’s hot-in-demand 2022 Maverick pickup truck appears to be sold out, with &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-shuts-off-orders-for-new-20-000-maverick-pickup-11643033093?mod=Searchresults_pos1&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the automaker has taken the unusual step of suspending reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnGSlX"&gt;Ford reached out to its dealers to tell them it was suspending customer orders, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports. The company will resume taking orders for the plug-in hybrid truck this summer. A Ford executive confirmed the unusual move in an interview with the paper as well, stating: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sgw4Rs"&gt;“We didn’t want to take more orders than we could build,” said Dean Stoneley, general manager of Ford trucks, in an interview. “We’re getting customers who would have perhaps bought a used car and are now buying the Maverick because it is so affordable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio is finally a real wooden boy in first teaser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Director Guillermo del Toro and a model of his new take on Pinocchio." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y5xdDLHW_WVsDoSRJeow1hCDdxU=/671x361:2930x1867/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70425824/GDTPinocchioPortrait.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CwDwlH"&gt;After years of being trapped in different circles of development hell, co-director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677646/nightmare-alley-guillermo-del-toro-teaser-noir"&gt;Guillermo del Toro’&lt;/a&gt;s long-awaited take on &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;is finally happening, and the stop-motion feature’s first teaser trailer is here to introduce the world to the story’s minuscule moral center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChzW0v"&gt;Set during Benito Mussolini’s fascist reign over Italy in the 1930s, del Toro’s &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;once again tells the tale of a wooden puppet who suddenly comes to life, much to his woodcarver “father’s” surprise. Unlike some of the other &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;tellings you may be familiar with, though, this film’s Pinocchio (Gregory Mann) quickly gets into the sorts of cruel mischief that put him at odds with Geppetto (David Bradley), who loves his son but can’t help but see that he...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google sued by DC and three states for ‘deceptive’ Android location tracking</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dVZNdX"&gt;The attorneys general of three states and the District of Columbia are &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23191075/DCv.Google_1_24_22_.pdf"&gt;suing Google&lt;/a&gt; for the allegedly deceptive collection of location data on Android. The complaints, which build on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272625/arizona-ag-sues-google-location-tracking-android-allegations"&gt;a 2020 lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed by the Arizona Attorney General, allege that Google’s “complex web” of settings obfuscated whether users were sharing their location at a given moment. Furthermore, they allege Google pushed Android users with “repeated nudging, misleading pressure tactics, and evasive and deceptive descriptions” to share more information either “inadvertently or out of frustration.”&lt;/p&gt;
