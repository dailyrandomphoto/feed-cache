    <title>There’s enough Steam Deck demand to take Steam’s store down</title>

  &lt;p id="bTvlDO"&gt;Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;officially revealed&lt;/a&gt; its handheld PC gaming machine only a day ago, but that was apparently enough to spread the word — when the Steam Deck went up for preorder today at 1PM ET, the demand from gamers knocked Steam for a loop as the store produced error after error. Seemingly every step produced another pitfall: two-factor authentication if you weren’t signed in, some signed-in accounts had to sign in once again, credit card checks, even a wonky response from a system that pegged long-established Steam accounts as being “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xenolon/status/1416085213407551491"&gt;too new&lt;/a&gt;” to participate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zahv1t"&gt;Other parts of Steam got flaky during the crush of preorder interest, too. The entire Steam store, Steam’s community pages, and the age gate that lets you view mature-rated titles didn’t...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google redesigns its emoji to be more universal and authentic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCGoyN67c4oJDZrlIhku8-1UmvA=/158x0:1891x1155/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69591877/Untitled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;992 of Google’s emoji designs are receiving tweaks.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hchssT"&gt;Google is tweaking 992 of its emoji designs to make them more “universal, accessible, and authentic,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/emoji-day-redesign-easier-sharing/"&gt;the company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The new designs will arrive this fall alongside Android 12, but Google says they’ll also be available on older versions with apps that use its Appcompat compatibility layer. They’re also coming to other Google platforms like Gmail, Chrome OS, Google Chat, and YouTube Live Chat this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li379f"&gt;None of the changes are particularly drastic. Instead, they’re mostly the kinds of tweaks that make the meaning of each emoji easier to understand at a glance by a wider range of people. The pie emoji, for example, currently looks like a classic American pumpkin pie. That’s fine for Americans, but it means that, in the UK,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use SharePlay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDiblckRVLHgrtbBPSEcr9coKKI=/248x0:1652x936/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69591839/Screen_Shot_2021_07_16_at_11.24.18_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aFX6H0"&gt;The headline feature for Apple’s fall updates (including iOS 15, iPadOS 15, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey) is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a new software feature on top of FaceTime that allows you to watch and listen to movies, TV shows, music, podcasts, and more with friends and family while video chatting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVhoWh"&gt;Right now, the number of SharePlay-compatible apps is a pretty small list: the Apple TV app for movies and TV shows, the Apple Music app for music, and Apple’s Podcasts app for podcasts. The company is promising some bigger third-party partners when iOS 15 launches this fall, including HBO Max, Disney Plus, Paramount Plus, TikTok, and Twitch. Some big names seem to be skipping out for now, though: most notably, Netflix and YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxxapQ"&gt;For now, if...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian delays first electric pickup deliveries to September</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KqNdNUR3oq1L82c4DaveWQXldFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69591771/rivian_electric_truck_3736.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RliHc0"&gt;Rivian has delayed the first deliveries of its long-awaited electric pickup truck again, this time until September. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe broke the news to buyers in &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/rivian-ceo-tells-customers-first-deliveries-delayed-until-september?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/rivian-delays-deliveries-of-r1t-r1s-electric-vehicles-again/"&gt;Friday morning&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWUAX6"&gt;The Amazon and Ford-backed EV startup originally planned to start delivering its electric pickup, the R1T, and its SUV, the R1S, in 2020. But it scuttled those plans at the beginning of the pandemic and said at the time that it would start deliveries in 2021 instead. Rivian eventually settled on starting deliveries of the R1T in June of this year, only to push that back to July, and now to September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2zdB6"&gt;“We know you can’t wait to get behind the wheel of your vehicle,” Scaringe wrote in the email. “Earlier this summer, we announced that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google executive steps down after offensive manifesto about antisemitic past</title>

  &lt;p id="33h6SW"&gt;Google parted ways with a cloud services executive after he published a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210614065822/https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-one-amr-awadallah/"&gt;LinkedIn manifesto&lt;/a&gt; about Israeli-Palestinian relations and his vehemently antisemitic past. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/google-separates-with-cloud-vp-after-employees-complain-about-manifesto.html"&gt;CNBC reports&lt;/a&gt; that Google faced internal criticism over Amr Awadallah, VP of developer relations at Google Cloud. While Awadallah said he published the piece to promote tolerance and understanding, employees objected to how Awadallah described Jews and expressed concerns about his past beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tez4yX"&gt;Awadallah began the June 13th post — titled “We are one!” — with a declaration that “‘I hated the Jewish people, all the Jewish people’! and emphasis here is on the past tense.” The 10,000-word manifesto discussed his upbringing in Egypt, saying he’d been “very cautious” working with...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Counterfeit wireless earbuds are being seized in record numbers at US border</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kMwSLT"&gt;The number of counterfeit wireless earbuds seized by US border customs in 2021 has already surpassed last year’s total, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/airpods-are-a-huge-hit-with-consumers-and-counterfeiters"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a sign of how eager the makers of these knockoffs are to keep riding the sustained popularity of earbuds like Apple’s AirPods and those from Samsung, Jabra, Bose, Sony, and other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftpC8P"&gt;According to the report, “roughly 360,000 counterfeit wireless headphones” — valued at $62.2 million — were nabbed in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. That’s well above the 295,000 pairs that were confiscated during the whole of fiscal 2020. Just yesterday, US Customs and Border Protection &lt;a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/thousands-fake-apple-airpods-worth-13-million-seized-cincinnati-cbp"&gt;announced a major confiscation&lt;/a&gt; in Cincinnati. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Emergency department visits spiked during June heatwave in US Northwest</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E6ROSc"&gt;The heatwave that scorched the Pacific Northwest in late June resulted in an enormous surge in emergency department (ED) visits in the region, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7029e1.htm#:~:text=Record%20high%20temperatures%20are%20occurring,States%20each%20year%20(2)."&gt;new analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. There were 1,038 heat-related visits to the emergency department during the peak of the heatwave on June 28th in “region 10” — which includes Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska. In shocking comparison, there were just nine similar ED visits in the region on the same day in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bqKjln"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Northwest was home to a disproportionate number of emergency department visits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mVOQLl"&gt;While much of the West was suffering through sweltering heat in June, the Northwest was home to a disproportionate number of emergency department visits....&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="nLpAf0"&gt;In order to keep her roles straight, &lt;em&gt;Fear Street &lt;/em&gt;star Kiana Madeira kept a big Five Star binder with her on set at most times. As part of the experimental slasher trilogy from Netflix, Madeira played two different roles across three movies, each set in a different time period. To make matters even more challenging, the schedule was incredibly compact: all three films were shot together over just a few months. So her binder served a crucial role. Inside were all three scripts, and she would write in it constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnCRy0"&gt;“Every time we finished a scene, I would make notes about how it went, how my character was feeling, how I was feeling, what I think we ended with in terms of the tone and the trajectory of the story,” she says. “My binder...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="EB49rt"&gt;Uber has agreed to pay $9 million to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) after refusing to hand over data about riders and drivers who were sexually assaulted, and pay a separate $150,000 fine, according to a settlement agreement reached Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruvrMN"&gt;The CPUC will give $5 million of that money to the California Victim Compensation Fund, and the remaining $4 million will “go to address physical and sexual violence in the passenger carrier industry,” according to &lt;em&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;, which reported on the agreement Thursday. Uber will also now provide data about the assaults to the CPUC, though it will remove any potentially identifying information.&lt;/p&gt;
