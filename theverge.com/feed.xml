    <title>EV startup Canoo loses chief technology officer and two co-founders</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I8vfHd"&gt;EV startup Canoo is losing three top executives, including its chief technology officer Peter Savagian, as part of an apparent shakeup of its leadership team. Savagian, the former chief engineer of General Motors EV1 electric car, will leave Canoo by the end of the year, according to the &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/76/canoo-expands-executive-team-to-execute-business-and"&gt;last line of a press release published Monday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tuv8Sl"&gt;The two others are some of Canoo’s remaining co-founders, two current employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on the condition of anonymity, though they weren’t named in the press release: Bill Strickland, the head of Canoo’s vehicle programs and a longtime Ford executive, and Alexi Charbonneau, who worked at both SpaceX and Tesla and oversaw Canoo’s powertrain division. Strickland and Charbonneau did not...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The QuietOn 3 earbuds use ANC to help you sleep</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vQ8yw8eZ8gbhopA4ToGLLgNz3gc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70298318/bkrasnoff_211202_4936_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q871O3"&gt;I’ve always been a light sleeper, and that has not improved over the last few years. So I thought I was the perfect person to try out the latest version of the QuietOn active noise-canceling earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rULbA7"&gt;The QuietOn 3 earbuds, which cost $239, are the third iteration of these devices. They are smaller than the previous version, the QuietOn 2, but the basic functionality is the same. Unlike other “help to sleep” earbuds such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review"&gt;Bose Sleepbuds II&lt;/a&gt;, they don’t generate white noise, or play quiet music, or let you hear rain or other soothing sounds. The idea is simply to eliminate low-frequency noises, such as the hum of a nearby appliance, that may keep you from sleeping while allowing you to still hear an alarm clock going off. &lt;a href="https://quieton.com/technology/"&gt;According to...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brian Eno is not a fan of NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="brian eno-shamil tanna-01" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FM-EZi2GPcZyJu9GmcJFxOWFVOs=/0x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297916/shamil_tanna_2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u4B6v3"&gt;If you were saving up Ethereum for a set of &lt;em&gt;Discreet Music&lt;/em&gt; NFTs, we’ve got bad news. In &lt;a href="https://the-crypto-syllabus.com/brian-eno-on-nfts-and-automatism/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Crypto Syllabus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (conducted by longtime tech critic &lt;a href="https://www.evgenymorozov.com/"&gt;Evgeny Morozov&lt;/a&gt;, of all people), Eno outed himself as a skeptic of cryptocurrency — and NFTs in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSan1x"&gt;“NFTs seem to me just a way for artists to get a little piece of the action from global capitalism, our own cute little version of financialization,” Eno told Morozov. “How sweet — now artists can become little capitalist assholes as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="yMARuX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yFY9xX"&gt;Best known for his pioneering ambient work and prolific producer credits, Eno seems like the perfect artist for the NFT era. He’s spent decades making art with an eye towards technology and its social implications, often made available as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/8/3475456/brian-eno-scape-ipad-app-ambient-music-creation"&gt;s...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans management firm accused of having employees talk to fans as influencers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JsyJ0jNY653dhhl5Gi2dnRAeDyY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297914/acastro_200227_1777_onlyfans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jOsj1k"&gt;A prominent agency that manages accounts for OnlyFans creators has been accused of having its employees catfish fans by reading and replying to messages meant for creators. According to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-onlyfans-star-managers-say-they-catfished-fans-unruly-agency-2021-12?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, fans who thought they were talking to models managed by Unruly Agency would confess fetishes, fantasies, and other private matters, but the person on the other end may have actually been an employee of the agency, not the intended recipient — one person who worked as an account manager said they were “basically a professional scammer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eexsX8"&gt;According to the report, Unruly Agency handles accounts for several popular OnlyFans’ influencers. But, according to employees, in addition to helping them schedule photo shoots and manage posts, they...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first trailer for The Witcher: Blood Origin on Netflix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06aCYr7uZD846m1bINz2TKbywr8=/0x1:4096x2732/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297899/FG0JNfQWQAkXjfV.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UrHvvu"&gt;There’s more to &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe than just Geralt, and Netflix gave the first glimpse at that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mawzQRu1Kc4"&gt;with an early look at &lt;em&gt;Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The trailer was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22692726/witcher-blood-origin-trailer-cast-netflix"&gt;initially revealed as a post-credits scene&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; season 2, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22826460/witcher-season-2-review-netflix"&gt;which debuted on December 17th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2xH3H"&gt;The upcoming live-action prequel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565149/michelle-yeoh-netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-sword-elves"&gt;stars Michelle Yeoh as a sword elf&lt;/a&gt;, and it takes place well before the main series, covering the events that led to the creation of witchers in the first place. Netflix describes the series as an “epic prequel series depicting the creation of the prototype witcher and the events leading to the pivotal ‘Conjunction of the Spheres.’” (For more on the conjunction, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22839928/witcher-multiverse-physicist-explains"&gt;check out this interview&lt;/a&gt; on the scientific possibilities of the multiverse.)

    <title>Here’s why streaming services are always duking it out over channels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Store In London" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OP7lPoF9NjIHj15Xk3XaYcX_0Y=/0x0:5123x3415/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297871/1230436485.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mh8joz"&gt;There’s something extraordinarily frustrating about subscribing to a TV service only for that service to lose the programming you signed up for. But that threat of lost channels — or worse, the actual loss of major networks — is a recurring problem for internet TV services, and it comes up &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cFpe8"&gt;The latest incident hit just this weekend: late Friday night, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;more than a dozen&lt;/a&gt; Disney-owned channels, including ESPN and FX, disappeared from YouTube TV when the two companies failed to reach a deal to keep them on the streaming service. The dispute didn’t last long. Just 36-or-so hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/19/22845373/youtube-tv-disney-espn-channel-fx-abc-restored"&gt;the companies came to an agreement&lt;/a&gt; — soon enough to avoid anyone missing ESPN’s Monday Night Football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y250tf"&gt;It was an outcome Disney could pretty much bank...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EPA issues new rule to curb tailpipe pollution, fight climate change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="California Sues EPA Over Ruling Blocking State Emissions Law" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYh0O7HUUFbBD-9UGomhlTEBxHk=/0x1:3501x2335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297558/78713689.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rOcLny"&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency issued a new rule today aimed at reducing tailpipe pollution from cars and light-duty trucks — an effort by President Joe Biden to return to the fuel economy standards put in place by Barack Obama nearly a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ciEaP"&gt;Under the rule, passenger vehicles would be required to achieve an average of 55 miles of travel per gallon of gasoline (mpg) by 2026 — slightly over Obama’s goal of 54 mpg, but a major increase over the 38-mpg rule put in place by President Donald Trump. The EPA estimates the new standard would prevent the release of 3.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide through 2050 and will save car owners $420 billion in fuel costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBUutA"&gt;EPA Administrator Michael Regan called it “the most ambitious vehicle...&lt;/p&gt;
