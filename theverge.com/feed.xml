    <title>Apple’s AR headset coming next year with ‘Mac-level’ power: report</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t6OEZ2"&gt;Apple’s first AR headset will be released in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to a research note from analyst Ming-chi Kuo seen by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/25/kuo-apple-ar-headset-mac-level-computing/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/25/kuo-apples-ar-headset-to-launch-in-2022-with-mac-level-computing-power-will-operate-without-the-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo predicted back in March that the headset would be released sometime next year, and is now also providing more technical information on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6hy6W"&gt;The headset will have two processors, according to Kuo, one with “the same level of computing power as M1” and one lower-end chip to handle input from the various sensors. For example, Kuo says that the headset has “at least 6-8 optical modules to simultaneously provide continuous video see-through AR services.” The headset is also said to have two 4K OLED microdisplays from Sony.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on Apple devices</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvAANe"&gt;Ironically, if you’re looking for a great Apple deal this Black Friday season, you shouldn’t shop at Apple. That’s because Apple doesn’t typically offer discounts on its new products in-store or on its website, at least outside of the occasional educational discount. Don’t fear, however, as there are plenty of reliable third-party retailers like Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Best Buy that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwzsMr"&gt;Even better, these retailers have already started discounting some of the most popular Apple products ahead of Black Friday, dropping prices on everything from the latest MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch Series 7.  Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals we’ve found by category, and we’ll continue to update this piece as more deals are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nunE44"&gt;Also, if...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Make your Oculus Quest 2 fit — and sound— better with these discounted mods</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oculus Quest 2 with the HTC Deluxe Audio Strap" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Wyjv0GJso1cwNPiYoKGzq0eaJc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70192755/oculusfrankenstein.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is what your headset will look like with these discounted modifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QA2F5G"&gt;The Oculus Quest 2 is an all-around solid piece of hardware, and it’s a very popular holiday gift &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/11/21/22789487/oculus-quest-2-vr-headset-50-gift-card-black-friday-promo"&gt;since there are some great deals&lt;/a&gt; happening now. But anyone who already owns one can tell you that the company’s straps leave a lot to be desired. The cloth strap included in the box isn’t supportive, and while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 Elite Strap&lt;/a&gt; addresses that, it’s quite fragile. Mine broke within a year of normal use, and surfing &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/"&gt;Oculus’ Reddit page&lt;/a&gt; will show you that some people’s straps meet a similar fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QBY9TH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rTSIAO"&gt;A popular and crafty modification that you can make to your headset is to attach HTC’s Deluxe Audio strap (originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/27/14748876/htc-vive-deluxe-audio-strap-tracker-price-availability"&gt;made for the Vive&lt;/a&gt;) with a set of third-party adapters to make it fit perfectly with your Oculus headset. Once it’s all set up, you...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting the LG C1 OLED TV won’t be cheap, but it’s among the best options out there.&lt;/em&gt; | LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmhxDE"&gt;4K TVs of all sizes and specs see price cuts several times throughout the year, but the time when we usually see the highest concentration of stellar deals is right now, as Black Friday hits and Cyber Monday is just around the bend. You’ve ended up in the right place if you’re looking for a TV deal, and yes, that includes people interested in a TV that has every bell or whistle, with the highest contrast ratio and the right features to eke all of the visual splendor from PCs and the latest gaming consoles or something that’s quite the opposite. We’ll be highlighting affordable TVs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGhjh8"&gt;Our team at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is hard at work on compiling the best Black Friday deals, running the gamut of retailers participating, as well as breaking it down...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday tech deals under $50</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6UI9c9"&gt;What can $50 get you these days? Turns out, quite a lot; you just need to know where to look. We’ve already rounded up all the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22523255"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; for getting your shopping done early at retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22548186"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22547475"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22548167"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. But if you’re on a tight budget or looking for some gifts that won’t break the bank, you’ve come to the right place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZmiWS"&gt;Have a Nintendo Switch, a Go Pro, or phone/tablet/laptop that features a microSD slot? Treat it to a massive boost in storage capacity with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-400GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SanDisk’s 400GB microSD card&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon for just $39. This card usually costs around $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ubHLrb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327706"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1xD2Wp"&gt;Amazon’s latest streaming stick is a solid alternative to both Roku and Chromecast devices.

  &lt;p id="6fyvPu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books"&gt;all-new Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/a&gt; is already a great buy at its regular price of $139.99. It has a great 6.8-inch display, USB-C charging, and a battery that can last for months — our reviewer calls it “the ultimate Kindle.” If you’ve been eyeing this device, now is a great time to buy it. It’s available &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now for $104.99, $35 and 25 percent off its original price of $139.99. Other retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf4JtR8DpHr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13048831?sid=VergeStaplesBF112521&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Famazon-kindle-paperwhite-6-8-e-reader-8gb-53-026260%2Fproduct_24508151" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staples&lt;/a&gt;, are offering the same price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRRMHX"&gt;Note that this is the ad-supported model — the ad-free version is currently $124.99 ($35 off its original price of $159.99). If you don’t want ads (or to pay the $20 premium for the ad-free model), a savvy move is to get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-kindle-paperwhite-kids/dp/B08WPB8PW9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite Kids&lt;/a&gt; for $114.99, which is $45 off...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why a toaster from 1949 is still smarter than any sold today</title>

  &lt;p id="6J4LFJ"&gt;My colleague Tom once &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419630/toaster-human-design-breville-tech-products"&gt;introduced you&lt;/a&gt; to a modern toaster with two seemingly ingenious buttons: one to briefly lift your bread to check its progress, and another to toast it “a bit more.” I respectfully submit you shouldn’t need a button at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HltLQX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2667828A/en"&gt;That’s because in 1948&lt;/a&gt;, Sunbeam engineer Ludvik J. Koci invented the perfect toaster, one where the simple act of placing a slice into one of its two slots would result in a delicious piece of toasted bread. No button, no lever, no other input required. Drop bread, get toast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrNdYE"&gt;Some of you are no doubt already connoisseurs who know what I’m referring to: the Sunbeam Radiant Control Toaster, sold from 1949 all the way through the late ‘80s. (It goes by many names, including the T-20A, T-20-B,...&lt;/p&gt;
