    <title>You’ll be able to pay for Amazon purchases with Venmo starting in 2022</title>

  &lt;p id="m4Wk7H"&gt;If you want to buy anything on Amazon.com, you’ll generally need a credit or debit card — but in 2022, the online retailer will begin accepting Venmo as well. Venmo parent company PayPal &lt;a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-11-08-PayPal-and-Amazon-to-Enable-Customers-to-Pay-with-Venmo-at-Checkout"&gt;announced the news&lt;/a&gt; during its Q3 earnings call on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkUVAB"&gt;We’re pretty sure that’s the first third-party payments platform Amazon has embraced in recent memory. You can’t use PayPal itself to buy things on Amazon! (Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GFBWMNXEPYVJAY9A"&gt;a list of the payment methods Amazon does accept&lt;/a&gt; as of today). You might cite Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/amazon-partners-with-affirm"&gt;recent buy-now, pay-later partnership with Affirm&lt;/a&gt;, but that still requires credit. Venmo, by comparison, acts more like a bank account for some mobile users, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213387/venmo-check-cashing-paypal-customers-banking"&gt;complete with a (sometimes expensive) check-cashing feature.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Galactic sells 100 tickets to space at higher price after reopening sales</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZBzVKV"&gt;Space tourism venture Virgin Galactic says that 100 people purchased more expensive tickets to fly on the company’s suborbital spaceplane after it reopened ticket sales this August. That means that the company has roughly 700 ticket holders now for quick tourist trips to space, about 300 less than the 1,000 tickets Virgin Galactic hoped to sell ahead of starting commercial flights of its vehicles. The company announced the news &lt;a href="https://investors.virgingalactic.com/news/news-details/2021/Virgin-Galactic-Announces-Third-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx"&gt;during its third-quarter earnings release out on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwhnjZ"&gt;Virgin Galactic reopened ticket sales just a month after the company successfully flew its founder, billionaire Richard Branson, to the edge of space and back on the company’s primary spaceplane, called &lt;em&gt;VSS Unity&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in July. Taking off from Spaceport America...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood says a hacker who tried to extort the company got access to data for 7 million customers </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aXtNfP"&gt;Trading platform Robinhood said Monday that personal information for more than 7 million customers was accessed during a data breach on November 3rd. The company &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt; that it does not appear that Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed, and no customers have had “financial loss” due to the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tr5Fze"&gt;An unauthorized third party “socially engineered a customer support employee by phone,” Robinhood said, and was able to access its customer support systems. The attacker was able to get a list of email addresses for approximately 5 million people and full names for a separate group of 2 million people. For a smaller group of about 310 people, additional personal information,...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lIzM0L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; has been delayed for two weeks, arriving December 7th instead of November 23rd. &lt;a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/543305a31fe801d5df3a29ef2cea581e00b46761"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, game director Naoki Yoshida says the delay was to ensure adequate quality assurance testing in the final days of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXfOcI"&gt;Yoshida says the decision to delay the game arose from a desire to ensure &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s story was something that befit 11 years of&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;’s epic storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRwcK6"&gt;“We remained firmly resolved to adjust down to the smallest nuances and ensure our writing covers even the finest points of the vast and intricate story that has spanned these past 11 years since the original &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; to ensure that everyone can fully enjoy their adventure in &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;,” Yoshida writes. However, the time it took...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s parent company briefly hits $2 trillion valuation</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="donwQi"&gt;Alphabet, Google’s parent company, briefly hit a market cap of $2 trillion. The tech behemoth’s market cap is currently at a comfortable &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/"&gt;$1.98 trillion&lt;/a&gt;, but crept over the $2 trillion mark midday Monday, later closing out at $2,987.03 per share. Alphabet’s market cap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069458/google-alphabet-trillion-dollar-market-cap-apple-microsoft"&gt;has just about doubled from $1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; since January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYD6gc"&gt;In the third quarter of 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747193/google-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-profit"&gt;Alphabet had a record quarter&lt;/a&gt;, earning a hefty $65.1 billion. The company reported that its revenue soared by 41 percent, while its profits jumped by almost 69 percent. Google Search saw a slight increase in profit, climbing to $37.9 billion from $35.8 billion in the previous quarter. YouTube, another Alphabet company, earned $7.2 billion in the most recent quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will accept app updates during the holidays in a break from tradition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CU1xBkVKfIedRlJVIq9t5ajRmxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113689/acastro_210831_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Wv2PC"&gt;Apple will continue to accept App Store app submissions through the holidays, marking a shift from the company’s approach in the past. Typically, Apple doesn’t let developers make submissions through the App Store Connect portal for a few days around Christmas, meaning that they would have to rush to release apps or updates ahead of when many people receive new Apple devices or gift cards as holiday presents. With this change, it seems as if the App Store will hum along largely like you’re used to this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6TMFv"&gt;However, Apple is already suggesting that developers try to stay ahead of things during one of the busiest times of the year. “Due to anticipated high volume, plan to send time-sensitive submissions early,” Apple said in a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=y4fgrhhe&amp;amp;1636388143"&gt;s...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Controversial Bitcoin tax provision passes Congress with infrastructure bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hBfPD6gJ2r7V2wGpR8sGHc61FQE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113609/acastro_181126_1777_bitcoin_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S8EPb5"&gt;On Friday, Congress passed the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package, sending the legislation to President Joe Biden for his signature. But while the measure makes historic investments in roads and bridges, it also maintains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631096/cryptocurrency-tax-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-advocacy-jack-dorsey-ashton-kutcher"&gt;a controversial new cryptocurrency tax reporting requirement&lt;/a&gt; that the Treasury Department could apply to miners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Sxotp"&gt;Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires brokers to report trader information on transactions of more than $10,000 to the IRS. The provision was added to the Senate version of the bill in late July after the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it would offset $28 billion of infrastructure costs over the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jIET6t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it would offset $28...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How Bezos’ latest plan to protect forests could backfire</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com Inc., speaks during the Action on Forests and Land Use session at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, U.K., on Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Robert Perry/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qcS7dk"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ $2 billion plan, announced last week, to plant trees and restore landscapes across Africa and the US has already raised red flags for some conservation experts and activists. Last year, after he pledged &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141132/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-ten-billion-climate-change"&gt;$10 billion&lt;/a&gt; to fight climate change, activists in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;called him out&lt;/a&gt; for not doing enough to cut down Amazon’s pollution or work with local communities while crafting his environmental plans. This time, he’s facing similar criticisms on a global scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4WmjR"&gt;The Bezos Earth Fund &lt;a href="https://www.bezosearthfund.org/announcements"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its latest round of funding on November 1 during a high-profile United Nations climate summit taking place in Glasgow. There aren’t many details out yet, but the fund says it will funnel $1 billion towards planting trees and “revitalizing”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton finally adds a pause button for its on-demand classes on its bikes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buLtCNcVJt0ignuuJSkWFvnK850=/128x0:2306x1452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113322/Screen_Shot_2021_11_08_at_2.46.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kcyOtR"&gt;Peloton has announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/pause-button/"&gt;finally added a pause button&lt;/a&gt; for its on-demand classes for its Bike and Bike Plus devices, allowing users to temporarily pause workouts in the middle of a class and then resume them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kbsBC"&gt;It’s a feature that bewilderingly hasn’t been available until today — and, technically, still isn’t even available on all of Peloton’s products, as the pause button is only rolling out to its cycling bikes for now. The Tread treadmill is set to get a similar update sometime “in the future” — but for now, you’ll have to do your runs all at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IHfuG"&gt;While it’s easy to joke at Peloton’s expense for the outsized deal the company is making over adding so small a feature, it is worth noting that adding a pause button to Peloton...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="zBm5Jo"&gt;Rivian says it will start taking orders for its electric delivery vans in 2022 and will deliver them to fleet customers in “early 2023,” calling into question the status of Amazon’s exclusive rights to the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8PI33"&gt;The buzzy EV startup — which is slated to go public this week at a valuation of $50 billion or higher — quietly announced the details about its fleet sales plans in a &lt;a href="https://rivian.com/fleet"&gt;new section of its website that went live Friday afternoon&lt;/a&gt;. It also said it will sell fleet versions of its R1T electric pickup truck and R1S electric SUV, meaning it will compete with Ford’s commercial version of the F-150 Lightning, as well as a fleet management platform called FleetOS and a charging infrastructure solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DPySLD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Electric vans, plus fleet versions...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
