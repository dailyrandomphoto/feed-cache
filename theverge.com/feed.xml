    <title>A hedge fund billionaire outbid crypto investors for a rare copy of the US Constitution</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SPRi4"&gt;It turns out the way to beat the collective will of the internet’s cryptocurrency fans is to have way, way more money than them. Ken Griffin, the CEO and founder of Citadel, has revealed himself as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790452/constitutiondao-loses-auction-for-rare-us-constitution-copy-sothebys"&gt;the winner of last night’s $43.2 million auction&lt;/a&gt; for a rare copy of the US Constitution. A collective of crypto enthusiasts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787993/constitutiondao-crypto-buy-us-constitution-copy-sothebys-ethereum"&gt;calling themselves ConstitutionDAO&lt;/a&gt;, managed to raise $47 million in about a week’s time in a quixotic attempt to win the document themselves and put it on display to the public for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DajNmR"&gt;While the DAO didn’t win, they did manage to push the price up on Griffin, with the two parties slowly going back and forth million by million during the auction last night, each seemingly uncertain if they would be able to go a million...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Next-gen hardware, last-gen games: where the PS5 and Xbox Series X have fallen short</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vgwgAn"&gt;A year ago, the next generation of console gaming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430284/microsoft-sony-xbox-series-ps5-nvidia-rtx-3080-next-gen-gaming"&gt;was supposed to have arrived&lt;/a&gt;. The Xbox Series X (and Series S) and PlayStation 5 strode boldly onto the scene, with massive chassis and even bigger promises of games with better graphics, shorter loading times, and revolutionary new breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUu7MJ"&gt;But a year in, and that next generation of gaming has yet to arrive. There are still too few consoles, and more importantly, too few games that truly take advantage of them, leaving the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X more of a beta test for the lucky few who have been able to get ahold of one, rather than the proper start of a new era of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3O616f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10875632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vwAMMJ"&gt;A complicated mess of factors have led to the next-gen bottleneck. The physical consoles...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford drops plan for Rivian-powered EV</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSCBc2"&gt;Ford no longer plans to make an electric vehicle with EV startup Rivian, CEO Jim Farley tells &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/ford-rivian-cancel-plans-jointly-develop-ev"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Detroit automaker originally announced it wanted to make a Rivian-powered EV in 2019 when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514031/ford-electric-pickup-truck-ev-startup-rivian-tech"&gt;made its first investment of $500 million into the startup&lt;/a&gt;. Ford and Rivian already canceled a vehicle they planned to make for the Lincoln luxury brand in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kyLYT"&gt;One reason Farley gave for canceling the EV collaboration was the complexity of combining Rivian’s electric architecture with Ford’s own software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FtnUT"&gt;“When you compare today with when we originally made that investment, so much has changed: about our ability, about the brand’s direction in both cases, and now it’s more certain to us what we have to do,” Farley said. “We want to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new Self Service Repair program is an opportunity to repair relationships</title>

Although this program has limitations, and there are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F55370%2Fapple-diy-repair-program-parts-tools-guides-software&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22787245%2Fapple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many lingering questions&lt;/a&gt; about how it will be implemented, it is an opportunity for Apple to improve relationships with its customers by making repairs easier. If Apple prices the parts right, the program could also be a way for motivated customers to save money on repairs by going DIY while allowing independent repair shops to remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aIMmFU"&gt;Rockstar has published a blog post apologizing for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783286/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-pc-hot-coffee-rockstar-games-launcher"&gt;rocky launch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;, which packages together remastered versions &lt;em&gt;GTA III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;GTA: Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;GTA: San Andreas. &lt;/em&gt;The company is promising a “Title Update” in the coming days that will “address a number of issues” and plans to make the original PC versions of the three games available as a bundle “shortly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xHL3d"&gt;“Firstly, we want to sincerely apologize to everyone who has encountered issues playing these games,” the company wrote &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/393o373751k48k/a-note-from-the-rockstar-games-team-re-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-th?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=gta-trilogy_announcement_update-20211119"&gt;in a post&lt;/a&gt; attributed only to Rockstar Games. “The &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; series — and the games that make up this iconic trilogy — are as special to us as we know they are to fans around the world.

    <title>Halo Infinite’s campaign co-op isn’t coming until May 2022 at the earliest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z4z65p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; co-op campaign and Forge mode, which won’t be in the game when it officially releases on December 8th, are going to launch even later than previously expected. In &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-11-19-dont-expect-halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-until-may-at-the-earliest"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; head of creative Joseph Staten reiterated that campaign co-op would launch with season 2, but since season 1 was extended by three months to May 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/welcome-to-the-halo-infinite-mp-beta"&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt;, that means the second season is at least half a year away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTeIOE"&gt;Forge is still set to launch with season 3, according to Staten, but we don’t know when that might arrive. And those timelines are still only goals; things may change if other priorities come up, Staten says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJV4pf"&gt;Here’s Staten own words on the matter, from &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;’s interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZLb1AR"&gt;So our goal still remains...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Tesla accused of ‘rampant sexual harassment’ in new worker lawsuit</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mDbqpD"&gt;A worker at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California, is accusing the automaker of creating a hostile work environment where sexual harassment was “rampant.” As first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Jessica Barraza, who was hired as a production associate in 2018, said in a lawsuit filed this week that she was subjected to constant harassment at the factory, including catcalling and inappropriate physical touching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYTehz"&gt;“Nearly every day for three years, my female coworkers and I were objectified, threatened, touched, and propositioned on the factory floor,” Barraza said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I wanted to come to work, do my job, and support my family without having to endure constant sexual harassment. I felt degraded,...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="R6UhvW"&gt;On November 19th, 2019, Google launched its Stadia cloud gaming service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;as a work in progress&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s arguably still one today. But one thing that’s consistently improved is the price of entry, and Google’s bringing it down even further to celebrate Stadia’s second birthday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRftKk"&gt;You should now be able to purchase &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US"&gt;a Stadia Premiere Edition hardware kit&lt;/a&gt; with the Chromecast Ultra and Stadia Controller for just $22.22 or €22.22 in fourteen countries including the US and UK “while supplies last.” In the US, you’ll also be able to get one for free when you purchase any $30 or higher game in the Stadia store until November 29th, though it now appears you’ll get that via a redemption code after your purchase and you may also need to pay shipping...&lt;/p&gt;
