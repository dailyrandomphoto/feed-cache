    <title>Another Amazon-first gadget brand has suspiciously vanished: Choetech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JdYSdZloacI-EBnDj-JyS7sH6Bk=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69553722/choetech.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MtCLY9"&gt;If you’re in the market for a new charger or cable, you might find fewer brands on Amazon than you’d expect — because at least six of them have mysteriously disappeared. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"&gt;giant retailer confirmed last month&lt;/a&gt; that it had removed Aukey, Mpow, RavPower, Vava and TaoTronics, but now a sixth gadget maker has similarly vanished in a puff of smoke: Choetech, a company perhaps best known for inexpensive wireless charging pads. (A few &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers have them sitting around right now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RopcYq"&gt;Amazon isn’t talking this time, but the modus operandi is the same: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Choetech/Choetech/page/AAB8B7E6-B653-46D8-8CC7-702A6FCA805D"&gt;if you visit Choetech’s seller page on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see the same telltale empty boxes where the company’s products used to be. Searches for Choetech only surface products from other sellers...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sDl0RB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;’s prestigious The International tournament will now be taking place in Bucharest, Romania in October, &lt;a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/2968417243145568913"&gt;Valve announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The event had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432042/dota-2-international-esports-tournament-stockholm-date"&gt;originally set&lt;/a&gt; to take place in Stockholm, Sweden in August, but Valve had announced in June it had started looking for other locations because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545319/dota-2-the-international-valve-sweden-europe"&gt;restrictions on esports events in Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbYqYY"&gt;The rescheduled event, which will be hosted in Bucharest’s Areana Nationala, will kick off on October 7th, with the Group Stage running through October 10th. Main Stage events start on October 12th, and the final match taking place on October 17th. Players will be competing for an eye-poppingly large prize pool of more than $40 million. Tickets aren’t on sale yet, but information about that “will...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google faces new antitrust lawsuit over Google Play Store fees</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q2jOLc"&gt;On Wednesday, a coalition of state attorneys general launched a new antitrust lawsuit against Google, accusing the search giant of abusing its control of the Android app store, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/google-play-store-goog-antitrust-suit-to-be-files-by-states"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kotdS9"&gt;The lawsuit, filed by 36 states and Washington, DC, in California federal court, challenges Google’s policy forcing Google Play app developers to pay a 30 percent commission fee on sales made through the app. Google &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/09/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html"&gt;recently expanded&lt;/a&gt; the fees to cover more digital goods purchased on the Play Store, taking particular aim at a number of prominent apps that had previously been able to sidestep the tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzK286"&gt;As of press time, the lawsuit was visible on the court’s website, confirming Bloomberg’s reporting. The central complaint has yet to be...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Calendar adds RSVP options for attending events virtually</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TCX3zD"&gt;As companies large and small settle on how they’ll return to working in-person, a hybrid work future, where working from home is common and expected, is beginning to seem like more of a reality. To accommodate hybrid workplaces, &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/join-meeting-virtually-or-in-person-google-calendar.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GoogleAppsUpdates+%28Google+Workspace+Updates+Blog%29"&gt;Google plans to expand RSVP options&lt;/a&gt; over the next few weeks to let users say whether they’ll attend an event virtually in Google Calendar invites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oORWVo"&gt;Virtual attendees will specify their status through a new drop-down menu that is viewable by the host and other guests in the event details. The company hopes that listing how people plan to attend an event will help organizers know what to expect, and presumably accommodate attendees who won’t physically be in the room. While the new options are currently limited to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now apply for a job through TikTok</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z6N92L"&gt;TikTok is testing a job application tool that allows its users to directly apply with video resumes to companies like Chipotle, Target, and Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvpCXw"&gt;The short-term pilot program, called &lt;a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/"&gt;TikTok Resumes&lt;/a&gt;, stems from content that has organically popped up on the platform, like #CareerTok, and the company’s deliberate initiatives to influence college students and younger users. There are more than 30 companies signed up to accept resumes for &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/find-a-job-with-tiktok-resumes"&gt;the pilot&lt;/a&gt;, which will last until July 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPVxgK"&gt;Users will have to create a video resume, post it to TikTok, and then send that video to recruiters through the app. An instructional video for the pilot program recommends applicants don’t include personal contact information like their email address in the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android app tests your phone’s waterproof seals without a drop of water</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Water Resistance Tester is designed to check waterproofing, which can degrade over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rxsGxm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ray.waterresistancetester"&gt;Water Resistance Tester&lt;/a&gt;, available on the Google Play store and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/07/app-claims-to-test-your-phones-water-resistance-without-a-plunge/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, falls firmly into the category of “neat stuff we didn’t know you could do with an app.” It tests the integrity of your Android phone’s IP67/IP68 rating by accessing the device’s barometer. Just download the free app, follow the prompts to press down firmly on the screen, and you’ll get a swift pass/fail grade. It’s simple, geeky, and practical, which is a combination we love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgsEMX"&gt;Developer Ray Wang says he created the app to help people check the state of their devices’ waterproof sealing after a repair or as it degrades over time. Obviously, don’t take a passing grade as a free pass to chuck your phone into a lake. That said, it appears to work...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="tbxYNj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is one of the biggest apps in the world, and you’ve probably been hearing its name: the company &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/roblox-rblx-starts-trading-at-64point50-after-direct-listing.html"&gt;recently went public&lt;/a&gt;, and its stock price climbed so high it was temporarily worth more than gaming giants EA and Take-Two combined. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has come up as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;contentious topic&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkMIc3"&gt;But it’s also just an astonishingly popular app: 42.1 million people play &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;daily&lt;/em&gt;. And its popularity is surging during the pandemic. Daily active users were up 85 percent in 2020, compared to the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUKT9a"&gt;Until recently, though, I didn’t really understand what &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; actually was, despite the app having been around since 2006. (Just to give you an idea of how long that is in tech years, the App Store for iOS...&lt;/p&gt;

Now, &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2021/07/bill-melinda-gates-foundation-mark-suzman-plans-evolve-governance"&gt;a new statement from the foundation&lt;/a&gt; has offered some clarity: they might not (via &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/business/gates-foundation-divorce.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The foundation says Melinda French Gates will resign from her position as co-chair and trustee if either she or Bill Gates decides they are unable to work together after two years. It’s not clear how the organization settled on that timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
