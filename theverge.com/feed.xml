    <title>FuboTV’s fantastic live TV streaming service finally arrives on LG TVs</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fNbulC"&gt;FuboTV, one of the best over-the-top services for sports enthusiasts, is finally arriving on newer LG Smart TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhQuXE"&gt;While the app was already available on many set-top boxes like the Apple TV or Chromecast, it’s now available on LG’s native webOS platform on 2018–2021 Smart TV models (including LG’s fantastic OLEDs). That’ll give any consumers with newer LG models the ability to access the service’s 100-plus sports and entertainment channels directly from their sets, rather than having to rely on a third-party device for access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iePwM"&gt;“Over 90 percent of FuboTV’s viewership is on the big screen and today’s launch on LG Smart TVs expands FuboTV to even more smart and connected TV platforms,” Mike Berkley, FuboTV’s chief product officer, told &lt;em&gt;The...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the devices that can run iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Monterey, and watchOS 8</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll get some fancy, new features, if you have the right devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YGREFX"&gt;Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; software at WWDC 2021. The public beta period will begin in July, and whether you’re curious to download them then, or just waiting for the final release, you’ll need to have the right hardware to do it. Apple usually eliminates support for a few devices each year as it leaps ahead with major software releases, so you’ll want to check below to see if your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or computer makes the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oph3LR"&gt;For iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, Apple is extending support for all iPhone models that currently have iOS 14, along with the seventh-generation iPod Touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rIzjYR"&gt;iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>MoviePass settles with FTC over fraud and data security failures</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MoviePass App As Company Makes It Harder To See Movies" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkVFQQsoGvAfoQyXJUdr5SfSbgo=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418846/1018277694.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpSucC"&gt;On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission charged the executives of the long-defunct MoviePass app over allegations that they fraudulently blocked customers from using the service as advertised while failing to protect their data privacy. The FTC also announced that it had reached a settlement with MoviePass and its executives as a result of the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyql0H"&gt;Under the proposed settlement, MoviePass, its parent company Helios and Matheson Analytics, its CEO Mitch Lowe, and chairman Ted Farnsworth are forbidden from falsely representing their business and data security practices to customers. Any businesses controlled by these entities are also required to roll out comprehensive information security programs to protect consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple introduces Siri for third-party devices</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfREqO"&gt;Siri is finally coming to third-party devices. Apple announced at its WWDC keynote that HomeKit accessory makers will be able to integrate Siri voice control into their products starting later this year. The voice assistant will be routed through a HomePod if the devices are connected to your network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EfaW1"&gt;Apple hasn’t released a comprehensive list of devices and brands that will support Siri. The company demoed it on an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%2Fecobee-smart-thermostat-apple-siri%2F%3Futm_source%3Dorganic_twitter%26utm_medium%3Dorganicsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartthermostat_siri_announcement&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22523045%2Fapple-wwdc-siri-third-party-devices-ecobee-watch-tvos-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ecobee&lt;/a&gt; thermostat during its WWDC keynote presentation.

    <title>Apple lets users see family members’ Health data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e5CY5t2zUbaXFVslJ_h3STUGkC0=/5x256:806x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418399/image__3_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PvtRRE"&gt;Apple will let people share the data from their Health app with family members or others, the company announced. It’s one of a new slate of health features for iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPLlL9"&gt;With permission, someone can share access to their overall heart rate and movement data. They’ll also be able to share access to alerts, which will ping authorized users when the feature notices things like a high heart rate or change in mobility. The person they’re sharing the data with can message them directly about any changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMdbCC"&gt;“Many people around the world are caring for someone, and we want to provide a secure and private way for users to have a trusted partner on their health journey,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-personal-health-by-introducing-secure-sharing-and-new-insights%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22522872%2Fhealth-app-family-mobility-fall-risk-wwdc-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS Monterey lets you run Shortcuts and share files between Macs and iPads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lbbg3kwo6UfUluS7bo1ST7-BCvM=/5x0:1564x1039/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418342/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cSXpW2"&gt;Apple has announced the next version of macOS at its WWDC keynote, after showing off iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS. It’s calling it Monterey, in keeping the California location-based theme it’s had since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8Ih2W"&gt;The company is promising even more interoperability with iOS, including the ability to share a keyboard and mouse between a Mac and an iPad. The feature is similar to the one found on Logitech keyboards and mice, letting you seamlessly move your cursor and files between a Mac and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KytFw4"&gt;
&lt;!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --&gt;&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple_WWDC21_Drag_And_Drop_Demo|102462" data-volume-uuid="d15336f46" data-volume-id="102462" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-33" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The jaw-dropping drag-and-drop demo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vjz1Oc"&gt;Macs are also getting the ability to act as an AirPlay target, allowing you to use your Mac’s screen and speakers to play content from your iPhone and iPad. (Apple hasn’t made it clear if you’ll be able to AirPlay...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lnGUo5"&gt;Apple has just announced watchOS 8, the latest version of the company’s smartwatch platform for the Apple Watch. The new software succeeds last year’s watchOS 7 and is going to be first available for developers to test their apps with starting today, with a public beta coming in July. A final public release is expected later this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBSX64"&gt;Apple is debuting a new Mindfulness app, an extension of the Breathe app that nags you to breathe throughout the day. It’s adding new animations and other features to help you relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLsMth"&gt;The Fitness app is getting more workout types for tai chi and pilates. The Apple Watch’s Health app will explicitly track your respiratory rate while sleeping and notify you if it’s outside of your normal patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6NgMr4"&gt;Apple has always stressed user privacy as part of its core mission. At its WWDC 2021 event, it announced it would be adding a spate of powerful new functions to Mail and Safari, as well as giving users broader insight into what their installed apps are doing with their information. &lt;/p&gt;

According to Apple’s manager of user privacy software Katie Skinner, Mail will also now hide user IP addresses by default. Safari, likewise, will hide IPs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjyDso"&gt;More surprisingly, Apple announced it’s adding an App...&lt;/p&gt;
