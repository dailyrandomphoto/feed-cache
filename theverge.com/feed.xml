  &lt;p id="VnEjgo"&gt;DuckDuckGo is launching a new email privacy service meant to stop ad companies from spying on your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaO3vp"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/"&gt;The company’s new Email Protection feature&lt;/a&gt; gives users a free “@duck.com” email address, which will forward emails to your regular inbox after analyzing their contents for trackers and stripping any away. DuckDuckGo is also extending this feature with unique, disposable forwarding addresses, which can be generated easily in DuckDuckGo’s mobile browser or through desktop browser extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvQqdT"&gt;The personal DuckDuckGo email is meant to be given out to friends and contacts you know, while the disposable addresses are better served when signing up for free trials, newsletters, or anywhere you suspect might sell your email address. If the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new RadRover is Rad Power Bikes’ first e-bike with an integrated battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQkdyHc5MZUTRuyTGpGoh5W5eWI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69605187/RoverFarmer_754.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L7KBb3"&gt;The RadRover, Rad Power Bikes’ flagship electric bike, is getting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21049638/rad-power-bikes-radrover-step-thru-new-design-price-range"&gt;another major upgrade&lt;/a&gt;. The bike will be the first from the Seattle-based company to feature a semi-integrated battery. And when it’s released later this year, it will be the most expensive model in Rad Power Bikes’ lineup to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFR9nw"&gt;The RadRover 6 Plus (it’s a mouthful of an official name) comes with a bevy of new parts, including hydraulic disc brakes, a custom geared-hub motor, a new ergonomic frame, and an improved LED display that’s easier to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nDfBdp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the most eye-catching new detail is certainly the semi-integrated battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ik8byN"&gt;But the most eye-catching new detail is certainly the semi-integrated battery, a first for the company. Rad Power Bikes’ batteries tend to be larger...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google TV update adds option to manually clear out ‘Continue watching’ row</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oUOl7v"&gt;Google TV, the new smart TV interface that debuted on Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;most recent Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, appears to be getting a small but important tweak for its “Continue watching” row. Over &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/onmmeg/hide_from_continue_watching_on_google_tv_had_been/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/19/google-tv-continue-watching-hide/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) user u/Alfatango97 has spotted a new option to manually hide entries from the row, which is designed to let viewers quickly jump back into unfinished TV shows or films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCvbeg"&gt;When it works, the Continue watching row is a convenient way pick up from where viewing was interrupted. But occasionally it can get cluttered with content you started watching and have no intention of finishing, or content that’s finished but whose credits are so long that it still shows up as in-progress. Being able to manually clear out the row should make it easier to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple pushes back return to offices due to rising COVID cases: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Aerial Views Of Silicon Valley Housing And Tech Campuses" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3z7EP1rVRfy_lkvq4hpAfgGIR10=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69604565/1178079031.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3fqDyv"&gt;Apple is delaying its plan to return to mandatory in-person work because of the increase of COVID cases driven by the Delta variant, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-20/apple-will-postpone-return-to-office-after-covid-19-persists"&gt;according to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. The company had laid out a roadmap for returning to its offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;in early September&lt;/a&gt;, with employees expected to come in at least three days a week, but now that deadline has reportedly been extended “by at least a month to October at the earliest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ilw7M8"&gt;Apple’s return to offices was controversial among some of its employees. A group of workers in an internal Slack channel for thousands of “remote work advocates” collaborated on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to CEO Tim Cook and the rest of Apple’s leadership, making the case that the company should embrace a more flexible work-from-home policy. Deirdre O’Brien,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart, Ikea, and Amazon have a dirty shipping problem</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;SAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 01: A container ship enters the Port of Los Angeles on February 1, 2021 in San Pedro, California. As of January 28, a record 38 container ships were on standby to offload cargo to the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles amid a wave of online consumer goods purchases in the U.S. amid the pandemic. | Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AnJwKi"&gt;Giant retailers, including Amazon and Ikea, have pledged to go green, but their shipping is still pretty dirty. Now shoppers can now see how much pollution some of the biggest retail companies in the US each generate while bringing goods into the country, thanks to a new report. In 2019, the 15 companies in the report generated almost as much climate pollution as 1.5 million American homes do in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaAXft"&gt;The report looks at greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution caused by shipping piles of cargo around the world and ranks the top 15 biggest polluters by company. Walmart tops&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the list, generating more greenhouse gas emissions than a coal-fired power plant would in a year. Ashley Furniture, Target, Dole, and Home Depot round out the top...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HalloApp is a private ad-free social network from two early WhatsApp employees</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot of HalloApp. | HalloApp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GDOZAL"&gt;Two of the earliest employees behind WhatsApp have emerged with a new private social network called HalloApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5W2EMY"&gt;Starting Monday, anyone can download and sign up for HalloApp in &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halloapp/id1501583052"&gt;Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halloapp"&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt; on Android devices. There are many parallels between HalloApp and WhatsApp: the app is designed for group or individual chats with close friends and family, the only way you can find people is by knowing their phone number, the messages are encrypted, and there are no ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M65akw"&gt;While other startups have over the years tried and failed to build successful social networks for close friends (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8683885/daum-kakao-buys-path"&gt;RIP Path&lt;/a&gt;), the pedigree of HalloApp’s two cofounders, Neeraj Arora and Michael Donohue, makes this particular effort notable.

    <title>Amazon will end onsite COVID-19 testing at its US warehouses</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nuyzTQ"&gt;Amazon has informed workers that it will end on-site COVID-19 testing at its US warehouses, as first &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-to-stop-covid-testing-in-u-s-warehouses"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will begin ramping down its testing operations in the US by July 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkJBIi"&gt;Although many in the US are vaccinated — 48 percent of the country is fully vaccinated, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; data as of Monday&lt;/a&gt; — the change comes as case rates around the country &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/us/covid-cases-rise.html"&gt;are going up&lt;/a&gt;. The significant majority of new cases have been found &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-covid-19-cases-united-states-almost-all-among-people-unvaccinated/"&gt;among unvaccinated people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYrxjm"&gt;Amazon informed staff Monday about its plan to end COVID-19 testing, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. “Free COVID-19 testing is now widely available and our employees have many options available to them, including...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Louis Vuitton’s $2,890 light-up speaker looks like something Thanos would steal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tZgyG3"&gt;Louis Vuitton has revealed its next foray into tech products: the $2,890 Horizon Light Up Speaker, which looks less like either a gadget or a piece of high fashion, and more like an artifact of untold cosmic power from the next Marvel movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E5qkW"&gt;According to Louis Vuitton, the idea is that the Horizon speaker will serve as an artistic centerpiece of your living room or outfit, a unique blend of fashion and technology that aims to challenge what a portable speaker should look like, a goal in which it undoubtably has succeeded. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PJLrrI"&gt;But between the glass, stainless steel, and leather construction, 35 LEDs, and the brand’s traditional symbols and logos plastered on virtually every surface of the speaker, the overall effect is less...&lt;/p&gt;
