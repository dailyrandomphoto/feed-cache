    <title>5 widescreen videos to watch instead of the 4:3 Snyder Cut of Justice League</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TbJ2CM"&gt;Zack Snyder’s cut of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; is finally available to stream on HBO Max, and while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22334362/zack-snyder-justice-league-fandom-release-cut-star-wars-twitter"&gt;rabid fans who helped make it happen&lt;/a&gt; may have been prepared for its 4:3 format, many people were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337756/snyder-cut-aspect-ratio-justice-league-hbo-max-warning"&gt;a little stunned when they pressed play today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GnF0V"&gt;Listen, I was a fan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/28/7457291/the-wire-hd-screenshot-comparisons"&gt;of &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I get it. Artistic vision and all that. But a 4:3 aspect ratio simply clashes with most modern devices. So I’ve rounded up five videos that take full advantage of most widescreen-optimized phones, tablets, and TVs. Use them as a palate cleanser when you finish the Snyder Cut or as a visual release valve when you inevitably pause the four-hour-long version of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;. The world is your banana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="vB6F2j"&gt;1. This video of the Banana orbiting the Earth at the same distance as the...&lt;/h4&gt;

    <title>Biden to tap former Senator Bill Nelson as NASA chief</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Bill Nelson" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FhPFCBVLEV2MGImCe3ghkwp_GMo=/0x0:4607x3071/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68987479/507326628.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yvRV9i"&gt;President Biden has tapped former Democratic Senator Bill Nelson for NASA administrator, according to three people familiar with the decision. Nelson, a politically experienced ally of the administration, would steer the space agency as it races to return humans to the Moon, bolsters its climate research and expands its reliance on a flourishing commercial space industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBJ57w"&gt;A former congressman and three-term US senator from Florida, Nelson would succeed former president Trump’s NASA chief Jim Bridenstine, whose past experience in Congress proved key in rallying support for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22323621/trump-moon-program-artemis-biden-nasa-timeline"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; program, an ambitious campaign to use the Moon as a stepping stone for future astronaut missions to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFkNiE"&gt;Biden’s decision comes nearly two months after he...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is expanding support for 2FA security keys on mobile devices</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5qN19r"&gt;Facebook is expanding its support of physical security keys for two-factor authentication (2FA) on mobile devices, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/expanding-support-for-security-keys-on-mobile-devices/"&gt;blog post Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The social platform has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/26/14397276/facebook-two-factor-nfc-security-key-account-hack"&gt;supported security keys for its desktop&lt;/a&gt; version since 2017, but starting today, it will let users on its iOS and Android apps use them to secure their accounts as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYP6xg"&gt;Two-factor authentication provides another layer of support for online accounts, requiring users to log in with their password and an additional piece of information, usually a numeric code generated by a third-party system. Without both pieces of information, it’s much harder for someone to access your account even if they have your password. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgvjCt"&gt;“We strongly recommend that everyone considers...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s co-founder is teaming up with Specialized to solve the problem of e-bike batteries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_F8xjgBEXs_OzAshyw6tNE4nwuw=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68987364/Specialized_VadoSL.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ydsas2"&gt;The growing popularity of electric bikes has raised a lot of exciting possibilities about the future of transportation, but it also presents a number of unique challenges. Chief among them is what to do with all those e-bike batteries when they eventually run out of juice. Rather than send them to a landfill, one major bike manufacturer is teaming up with a co-founder of Tesla to ensure those batteries have a second life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNWVvZ"&gt;Specialized, the third largest bike maker in the US based on market share, is partnering with a firm called Redwood Materials, which is run by Jeffrey “JB” Straubel, a co-founder and former chief technology officer of Tesla, to figure out a process for recycling the company’s e-bike batteries. Those batteries, which...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Fire TV is adding local news in many more cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RC2Xu"&gt;Back in December, Amazon launched an ad-sponsored news app on its Fire TV platform.  At that time, the app offered local news coverage in 12 cities, including New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Miami, and more. But today, Amazon says it’s expanding local news to “88 major cities” across the US, “including popular local stations from news distributors such as ABC Owned Television Stations, CBSN, TEGNA, Cox, The E.W. Scripps Company, and Altice USA.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGh3FV"&gt;The news app now comes built into the Fire TV software, and local news gets its own tab in the app. “Amazon’s thoughtful expansion of local news content on its Fire TV devices is a strong testament to the power of local news to keep communities safe and informed through everything 2020 has...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Echo Show 8 smart display is over 40 percent off at several retailers</title>

  &lt;p id="7CRfvv"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724867471427496922#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VegeDailyDeals03182021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $75 right now. While this is not its lowest price ever (the previous best price was only $5 less), it is still an incredible deal on the normally $130 smart display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;The Echo Show 8 includes a slightly larger display than the Echo Show 5 and also includes support for videoconferencing apps, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="nDC3T7"&gt;If you’re looking for a good virtual reality headset but are intimidated by the $300 price tag for the relatively affordable Oculus Quest 2, you’re in luck. Over on Oculus’ official website, the company is selling &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a refurbished first-generation Quest for $199&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>You will watch the Snyder Cut in 4:3 aspect ratio because HBO Max respects cinema</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nnbEPeTGQFT9_zzccR8pcA6E0_s=/228x0:2943x1810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986833/snyderwarning.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7MYsyZ"&gt;Lest anyone worry that &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=SnyderCut031821"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; would tarnish Zack Snyder’s auteur work &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;, for which the company &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/02/the-true-story-of-justice-league-snyder-cut"&gt;spent $70 million&lt;/a&gt; on reshoots and new digital effects in order to meet the director’s requirements and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22334362/zack-snyder-justice-league-fandom-release-cut-star-wars-twitter"&gt;satisfy years of fan demand&lt;/a&gt; for a better cut of the widely panned movie, the service is prefacing all streams of the film with a short disclosure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="815KjL"&gt;“This film is presented in a 4:3 format to preserve the integrity of Zack Snyder’s creative vision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9DaXXJ"&gt;That’s right. HBO will not artificially crop the image just to satisfy your natural demand for widescreen viewing. Nor would it tell Snyder that, hey, &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/03/zack-snyder-explains-justice-leagues-first-cow-connection.html"&gt;maybe &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;isn’t &lt;em&gt;First Cow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and doesn’t need to be presented in a tight boxy format in which it’s unclear if the entire film...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to file and pay your 2020 taxes online </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="irs (ray tsang flickr)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP0xxiL-v-HhVA274y3XwS_qa2o=/0x3:1100x736/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68687934/irs.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSUmXj"&gt;In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic took everyone, including the IRS, by surprise. Because of the issues people were dealing with last spring, the filing deadline for federal tax payments was moved from the usual mid-April date to July 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NH5z8m"&gt;This year, it looked look like we weren’t going to get the same tax vacation — until &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-day-for-individuals-extended-to-may-17-treasury-irs-extend-filing-and-payment-deadline"&gt;the IRS announced on March 17th&lt;/a&gt; that tax day has been pushed back a month. As a result, the new due date for your 2020 taxes is May 17th, 2021.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1IHJ6"&gt;Meanwhile, the IRS has also made it known that the &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-operations-during-covid-19-mission-critical-functions-continue"&gt;pandemic is slowing down some operations&lt;/a&gt;, such as processing returns filed on paper. As a result, it might not be a bad idea to start working on those taxes as soon as possible — and to submit them online. In fact, whether...&lt;/p&gt;
