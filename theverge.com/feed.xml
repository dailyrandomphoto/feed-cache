    <title>Reddit seems to be back after an almost hour-long outage</title>

  &lt;p id="DigTHL"&gt;Reddit had a bit of a blip on Tuesday afternoon, going down for almost an hour. According to &lt;a href="https://reddit.statuspage.io/"&gt;Reddit’s status page&lt;/a&gt;, the issues started around 1:56PM ET. At 2:17PM ET, &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/reddit/"&gt;Downdetector&lt;/a&gt; reports spiked, with around 45,000 users reporting problems connecting to its homepage and subreddits. Staff here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; were also unable to load the site, with some getting a blank homepage and others experiencing slow loading times and getting kicked off of pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpb31n"&gt;The status page now indicates that Reddit has implemented a fix and is monitoring the results. While the status page still shows that there’s a partial outage, we were all able to successfully load and browse the site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="Uw8umB"&gt;Downdetector reports are also dropping, indicating that more...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from the EPA’s new rules affecting air conditioners and refrigerators </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Near-Record Heat Wave Grips U.S. East Coast, Midwest" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IZatqgdhAfB4-2N3wvmk-OCZxXI=/0x472:3000x2472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235998/71570187.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IrCuUt"&gt;“Super” greenhouse gases will soon be phased down in air conditioners and refrigerators in the US. The Environmental Protection Agency yesterday proposed new rules to cut the use of the “super” pollutants used as refrigerants, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), by 85 percent over 15 years. Consumers likely won’t notice much of a difference with their appliances, but lawmakers are anticipating big benefits for the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fR3CeV"&gt;The EPA plans to determine a baseline for HFC production and consumption, and then set limits on companies making and importing HFCs. Those caps would become stricter over time. This is the agency’s first major new regulation taking on climate change under the Biden administration, and it makes good on a bipartisan commitment...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber’s grocery delivery is getting a boost from new partnership with Gopuff</title>

  &lt;p id="tjchZd"&gt;Uber &lt;a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-and-Gopuff-Partner-to-Bring-Everyday-Essentials-to-Uber-Eats/default.aspx"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was teaming up with delivery startup Gopuff to expand its delivery business. Gopuff, which acquired liquor store chain BevMo last year, will make its inventory of convenience and grocery store items available to Uber as part of this new deal. The companies plan to roll out their new offerings to customers in 95 cities starting this June and nationwide later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIFyjA"&gt;Gopuff will handle the logistics and delivery of the items, with Uber taking a cut of the transaction through its app. Gopuff, which was founded in 2013, operates in 650 cities in the US, with over 250 “micro-fulfillment centers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HjeWUT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber is slowly transforming into a delivery company &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Royal Navy is testing using jet suits to fight high-seas piracy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdYlg0"&gt;The British Royal Navy has apparently been testing using jet suits to board ships like a scene out of some scrapped Christopher Nolan film, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suHOLFhbwsM"&gt;according to a new video&lt;/a&gt; released by UK-based Gravity Industries. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/video-royal-marines-board-ship-at-sea-with-jet-packs-2021-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt; that the tests were conducted over three days on the HMS Tamar, a Royal Navy Batch 2 River-class offshore patrol ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEA3KD"&gt;Royal Marines used Gravity Industries’ Jet Suit to conduct a “visit, board, search, and seizure” operation or VBSS. Basically a marine launched from a fast boat tailing the HMS Tamar, flew through the air like a slightly askew Iron Man, and landed on the larger ship, dropping a rope below so their fast boat buddies could climb up and “visit” the simulated enemy vessel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PnotiW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Epic pushed Xbox chief to open free multiplayer just ahead of Apple Fortnite battle</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g2736R"&gt;Epic pushed Microsoft to open up its Xbox network for free multiplayer gaming just weeks before the Apple and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; battle. In the weeks leading up to Epic Games’ decision to circumvent Apple’s 30 percent cut on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in-app purchases, CEO Tim Sweeney sent an email to Xbox chief Phil Spencer teasing something big and asking whether Microsoft could time free multiplayer with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; season 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ78ST"&gt;“Epic has certain plans for August that will provide an extraordinary opportunity to highlight the value proposition of consoles and PCs, in contrast to mobile platforms, and to onboard new console users,” said Sweeney. “While I can’t share details with any third party at this point, I give you Epic’s assurance that our efforts will be...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One of Samsung’s best phones ever is now officially retired</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After four years of support, the S8 and S8 Plus will no longer receive security updates.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7CVLJg"&gt;Four years after its launch, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has received its last security update. The Galaxy S8 was a well-timed success story for Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15092590/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-screen-size-aspect-ratio-edge"&gt;launching in the spring of 2017&lt;/a&gt; with a bold design that drew attention away from the well-documented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12767670/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-fire-risk"&gt;Galaxy Note 7 battery problems&lt;/a&gt; of the previous six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjJvyk"&gt;The S8 marked a design shift for Galaxy devices, with a wider-aspect edge-to-edge screen with minimal bezels that made it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15087530/samsung-galaxy-s8-announced-features-release-date-video-specifications"&gt;one of the best-looking phones&lt;/a&gt; we’d seen at that point. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus"&gt;wasn’t just a good-looking device, either&lt;/a&gt;; it offered excellent hardware and a great camera, combined with a remarkably restrained software implementation. Best of all, the batteries did not catch fire.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sa3dSK"&gt;In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, as people avoided doctors’ offices and hospitals canceled nonessential appointments, routine cancer screenings plummeted. Now, we’re starting to see the consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDnlfN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-crisis-of-undiagnosed-cancers-is-emerging-in-the-pandemics-second-year"&gt;tells the story&lt;/a&gt; of Teresa Ruvalcaba, a factory worker in Chicago who ignored searing pain in her chest for six months. She was busy with work and afraid of catching COVID-19 at the doctor’s office, and when she finally went to the emergency room, she was diagnosed with advanced inflammatory breast cancer. It was one of the most severe cases oncologist Pam Khosla had seen in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
