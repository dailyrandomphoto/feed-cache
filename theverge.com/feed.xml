    <title>iOS 15 may give the iPhone’s camera an upgrade: fewer green flares</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D1EEmaRhJrnLZ3NJ4cvReKzmsJg=/0x199:2388x1791/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680500/IMG_2220.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtVSH9"&gt;The latest version of Apple’s iOS 15 beta seems to be making subtle improvements to photos by processing out the green lens flares that can show up in outdoor pictures (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/04/ios-15-can-auto-remove-lens-flares-in-photos/#disqus_thread"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). News of the feature was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;posted to the iOSBeta subreddit&lt;/a&gt; by Reddit user Doubleluckstur, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to see it in action by testing with an iPhone 12 Mini running the public beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xNJPR"&gt;Many iPhone users will be familiar with the green blobs, and while taking a picture it seems like nothing’s changed — the flare still shows up in the viewfinder. But when you go to view the final picture, the flare is nowhere to be seen (in some cases; we’ll get to that in a bit). It does seem to be the result of all the post-processing that’s done to the picture, as the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook streamlines the settings page on mobile</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5pmmN"&gt;Facebook is streamlining the settings page on mobile in &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/"&gt;a new redesign&lt;/a&gt; that’s rolling out starting Wednesday. Visually, the new layout looks much less cluttered, and individual settings don’t have descriptions, meaning you’ll see more on the page at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0ROKf"&gt;Facebook has also changed up the organization of the settings themselves. The company has reduced the number of categories for settings and renamed them, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, so now, you’ll see six categories of settings: Account, Preferences, Audience and Visibility, Permissions, Your Information, and Community Standards and Legal Policies. Some settings have also been relocated so that they’re by related ones, Facebook says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMPyON"&gt;You’ll be able to see the new look on Android, iOS,...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TKrWkf"&gt;Elon Musk’s SpaceX is seeking a “Spaceport Mixologist” who can whip up space-themed drinks next to the company’s sprawling rocket factory in south Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdZiaL"&gt;While space itself likely won’t be in their future, an experienced bartender — who will have one of the coolest job titles — will be tapped to join the hundreds of employees working on SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket system in rural Boca Chica, Texas. The mixologist will probably work out of the small house next to SpaceX’s budding spaceport that Musk calls the Starbase Tiki Bar and sling tiki drinks like the Test Pilot or Jet Pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoHyQA"&gt;“Experience pairing drinks with a themed menu” is on the list of preferred skills. “SpaceX has a number of food service outlets and formats serving our...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple places female engineering program manager on administrative leave after tweeting about sexism in the office</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ONzepy"&gt;Apple has placed senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik on indefinite administrative leave after she tweeted about sexism in the office. The company is currently investigating claims Gjøvik made about a hostile work environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcaR7F"&gt;“For months, I have been raising concerns with Apple employee relations about years of experiences with sexism, a hostile work environment, sexual harassment, unsafe working conditions, and retaliation,” Gjøvik says in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I asked them to mitigate the hostile work environment while they investigate, and they initially offered me EAP therapy and medical leave. I told them that made no sense, and said they should talk to my leadership and set up oversight and boundaries. I added...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Playdate’s first season of games won’t hit every handheld at the same time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Panic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7ktTm2"&gt;One of the most intriguing aspects of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;Panic’s Playdate&lt;/a&gt; — besides its lovely crank — is the unique game delivery method that will bring 24 free games to the device. Panic plans to release a season of games (Season One), two games at a time each week. &lt;a href="https://help.play.date/games/season/"&gt;In a new FAQ released on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Panic explains a bit more about how that’ll work and reveals that, due to limited manufacturing capacity, not everyone will be playing new games at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYcxYQ"&gt;All Playdates will download new games weekly on “New Game Day” as long they’re connected to Wi-Fi, starting with the first two games when you connect your device. The catch is that not everyone will connect their Playdate to the internet on day one due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587193/playdate-preorder-how-to-panic-teenage-engineering-handheld-console"&gt;limited preorders&lt;/a&gt;. That means rather than...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Flo Rida Roblox Amazon TikTok ad is fake but amazing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3q3Hl7JynqSdBbPkOcltMEnt-0s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679707/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f35lYL"&gt;On Wednesday, a surreal TikTok ad from an advertiser posing as Amazon confused users into thinking the e-commerce giant was taking a stab at including absurdist internet humor into its online marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9EsHu"&gt;The ad featured gaming footage from the lego-like title &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;interspersed with strange clips of a man dancing to Flo Rida and T-Pain’s 2008 hit “Low,” but only the part where T-Pain says “Apple Bottom jeans.” There are also robot voices bullying each other about grandmas and girlfriends overlaid on the ad. The bizarre video was highlighted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eddyburback/status/1422972566629543941?s=20"&gt;Eddy Burback&lt;/a&gt;, a popular YouTuber and streamer, on his Twitter feed Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TCsgIo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;this was an amazon ad I got on tik tok???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this is 100% real I just recorded it &lt;a href="https://t.co/cST0JoKb33"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cST0JoKb33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;—...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p id="lA0MmX"&gt;People will no longer be able to play the digital version of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; daily crossword puzzle in third-party apps, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/crosswords/nyt-games-no-longer-available-on-across-lite-as-of-aug-9.html"&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt; made by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; on Monday. Starting August 10th, the crossword will be available digitally only via the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; site or on its own crossword app. Downloadable PDFs, in addition to the physical newspaper, will still be available for people who want to print and play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpWDze"&gt;Until now, crosswords were available in the &lt;a href="http://www.word-buff.com/across-lite.html"&gt;Across Lite .puz file format&lt;/a&gt;, so anyone with a &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; games subscription could download a puzzle and open it in the desktop or mobile app of their choice. The change applies not just to future puzzles but to the archive of puzzles that are currently in the .puz format. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton is updating its treadmills to again be useful without a subscription</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3wIGPL"&gt;Peloton owners will again be able to use their treadmills without a subscription to the Peloton All-Access Membership, according to the company. In June, Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545663/peloton-tread-plus-treadmill-subscription-plan-recall"&gt;released a software update&lt;/a&gt; that required its treadmills to be secured with a passcode, a feature the company said was only available to paying subscribers due to “technical limitations.” At the time, Peloton promised that another software update was coming that would enable the feature for everyone, and it provided three free months of the subscription that usually costs $40 per month. On Wednesday, the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “all Tread owners can now access Tread Lock” along with the “Just Run” feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vh9rhV"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060884531-Tread-Lock"&gt;Peloton’s support page&lt;/a&gt;, the Tread Lock feature locks the...&lt;/p&gt;
