  &lt;p id="vvskRD"&gt;We’ve reached the weekend, and the start of another month. Sayonara, April, and hello to May. The past few days at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have been some of the best tech deals so far this year, like the now-expired deal that knocked $150 off the Apple Watch Series 6, putting it lower in price than even the Apple Watch SE. That one sold out in just a few hours, though I wouldn’t be surprised to see it come again soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkJFs3"&gt;Not all of the best sales of the week have ended. You can save on PC games in celebration of Golden Week in Japan, and get $80 off a Google Nest Wifi bundle, to name a couple of examples. Find even more below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VFw4lY"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qEG4do"&gt;Save up to $147 on a preorder of a new M1 iPad Pro or iMac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QP5Tpi"&gt;Apple announced that the new iPad Pro and the colorful iMacs will...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s new prime lenses are the small saviors I’ve been looking for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H7xAVBtFM6C9CuNhytSsU7lze4s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69217934/BFARSACE_042221_4548_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sony’s newest lenses are three new compact primes lenses that each cost $600.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ItS4cR"&gt;The new Sony 24mm f/2.8, 40mm f/2.5, and 50mm f/2.5 are three new compact prime lenses that each cost $599.99 and will be shipping in mid-May. While they uphold the reputation of quality Sony has established with the G Master lineup, it’s their uniformity and small size that come as a welcomed surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExaDUW"&gt;Uniformity and size are so rarely a topic of discussion in regards to lenses. As a video-first creator, 67mm, 77mm, and 82mm are common thread sizes in my gear bag. But it feels like with every new lens I buy I have to factor in the cost of a new ND filter or a step-up or down ring. These three new lenses all conveniently share the same 49mm filter thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFPPDj"&gt;Then there is weight and size. It’s no secret that bags with full-frame camera gear...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s app store changes crank up the Apple pressure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UltTp-k1aCq4k4mOzZ3XxyzyMM8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69217712/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8jumvR"&gt;Microsoft shook up the PC gaming industry this week with the announcement that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;cutting the fee it takes from game sales on the Windows store&lt;/a&gt;. On the surface, it’s a welcome move, with Microsoft matching the 12 percent cut that Epic Games takes, and putting more pressure on Valve, which still takes a 30 percent cut on most Steam purchases. But the cut is also a tactical move: Microsoft wants to help pressure Apple, and this week’s changes could play a role in the bigger app store battles kicking off next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKtdxU"&gt;Microsoft’s announcement comes just days before a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;huge court trial between Epic Games and Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and just as the EU has found issues with Apple’s rules — claiming the company has a “dominant position in the market for the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned that card grading companies are drowning in Pokémon cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="703a8P"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv9a9/pokemon-cards-psa-cgc-bgs-turnaround-times"&gt;A report from Vice&lt;/a&gt; has opened my eyes to just how big the Pokémon trading card collecting market is getting — apparently to the point where card rating companies have waitlists that range from six to ten months, with one company claiming it’s receiving over 500,000 cards to grade per week. The card graders, who rate trading cards’ conditions to determine how collectable (and therefore valuable) they are, are so swamped that people who want to get their Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, or sports cards graded are also having to wait in line (or &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22360269/pokemon-card-psa-rating-services-halted"&gt;pay out the nose&lt;/a&gt; to skip it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xn1u75"&gt;One card rating company apparently needed employees so bad it offered $1,000 starting bonuses — and then &lt;em&gt;bumped them up to $2,500&lt;/em&gt;. Another company had to buy &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; warehouses to store...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This world-ending asteroid is the perfect vehicle for Pink Floyd</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFJuIO"&gt;If you’d like a visual of one way that doom could overtake Earth almost immediately, then YouTube user Anselo La Manna has just the video for you: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bU1QPtOZQZU"&gt;a large asteroid impact simulation scored to nothing other than Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opzGUC"&gt;Specifically, that’s “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVBCE3gaNxc"&gt;Great Gig in the Sky&lt;/a&gt;,” off what might be the band’s most beloved and over-analyzed album, &lt;em&gt;Dark Side of the Moon&lt;/em&gt;. It’s got everything total annihilation needs: contemplative piano, pedal steel guitar, and of course, a plaintive wail, capturing the whole range of emotions that people might feel if they were burned to a crisp because one big rock hit another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrgVIK"&gt;Anselo La Manna also hosts &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENT_hnyO-o"&gt;the original clip&lt;/a&gt; the mashup video uses on their YouTube page, a simulation of a large asteroid impact. It appears...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook acquires the developers of VR military simulator Onward</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OiAynm"&gt;Facebook’s Oculus division has snatched up yet another popular virtual reality game developer. On Friday, the company announced &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwelcoming-downpour-interactive-to-facebook%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it has acquired Downpour Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, the studio behind the hit multiplayer military simulator &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbdHpD"&gt;“We’ve seen great success with &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt; on the Oculus platform for several years — first on Rift and more recently on Quest,” Mike Verdu, Facebook’s VP of AR / VR content, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwelcoming-downpour-interactive-to-facebook%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Becoming part of the Oculus Studios family will give Downpour Interactive the opportunity to cultivate both the &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt; community with the full support of Oculus Studios resources, and, in the future, pursue other projects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Il5KQb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Everyone from Downpour will move to Oculus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>NASA suspends SpaceX’s $2.9 billion moon lander contract after rivals protest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yubuqrvBWN08D_C6Xb-GjnmbNwk=/154x0:985x554/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69215254/for_press_release.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A digital illustration of SpaceX’s Starship lunar lander sitting on the Moon’s surface, as proposed to NASA under its Artemis program.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="67JSBP"&gt;NASA has suspended work on SpaceX’s new $2.9 billion lunar lander contract while a federal watchdog agency adjudicates two protests over the award, the agency said Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28bTex"&gt;Putting the Human Landing System (or HLS) work on hold until the GAO makes a decision on the two protests means SpaceX won’t immediately receive its first chunk of the $2.9 billion award, nor will it commence the initial talks with NASA that would normally take place at the onset of a major contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40B7Zs"&gt;Elon Musk’s SpaceX was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;picked&lt;/a&gt; by NASA on April 16th to build the agency’s first human lunar lander since the Apollo program, as the agency opted to rely on just one company for a high-profile contract that many in the space industry expected to go to two companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HhY2M"&gt;As a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal COVID-19 vaccine website launches with Spanish-language version </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EFi9VB"&gt;The Biden administration’s version of a COVID-19 vaccine-finding website launched today, along with a Spanish-language version, text messaging tool, and phone hotline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TaBS0"&gt;The new website, &lt;a href="http://vaccines.gov"&gt;vaccines.gov&lt;/a&gt;, is a new version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337754/covid-vaccine-availability-website-vaccinefinder-biden"&gt;VaccineFinder&lt;/a&gt;, a site run through a partnership between Boston Children’s Hospital and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. VaccineFinder was originally created during the 2009 swine flu outbreaks and has hosted COVID-19 vaccine information for the past few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qx4g6w"&gt;The new version has the same features as the old site. It lets people locate sites offering COVID-19 vaccines nearby, shows which vaccines are on offer at each location, and says if the vaccines are in stock or not. “In stock” does not necessarily...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Want a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro? You may have to wait until July</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g58tOJ"&gt;If you’re hoping to get one of the new 12.9-inch iPad Pros with a Mini LED display, you may be waiting a while — the delivery times for even &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro%2F12.9-inch-display-128gb-space-gray-wifi"&gt;the base model&lt;/a&gt; have slipped to late June or early July (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-30/apple-s-new-high-end-ipad-pros-see-delivery-times-slip-to-july"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).
