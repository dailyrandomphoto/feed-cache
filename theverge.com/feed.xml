    <title>Uber asks governors to give drivers early access to COVID-19 vaccines</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LC6xMC"&gt;Uber sent letters today to every US governor asking that their drivers and delivery people be classified as essential workers and given prioritized access to COVID-19 vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended the first batch of vaccines go to health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities, with essential workers — including those in transportation — following in a second phase. But it’s up to each state to decide the specifics of their vaccine distribution plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuRDkp"&gt;“After nine months on the frontlines keeping their communities running, we are asking governors in all 50 states to prioritize drivers and delivery people for early vaccine access,” said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gmail will now let you edit Office documents directly from email attachments</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="29ZSGA"&gt;Google is making it even easier to work with Microsoft Office files, with the company now allowing users to directly edit attached Office files in Gmail, much like it already allows with Google Docs or Sheets files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeNgZD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21503649/google-workspace-g-suite-gmail-chat-meet-docs"&gt;Google Workplace&lt;/a&gt; (the recently rebranded G Suite, which encompasses Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet, and Calendar) has offered compatibility with &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/9276408"&gt;Office files from Word, PowerPoint, and Excel&lt;/a&gt; for some time. But previously, documents had to be imported into Google Drive in order to edit or modify them — while emailed attachments were only able to be viewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q89HS6"&gt;The new workflow, however, streamlines that process considerably. Now, you can directly open and edit an Office file using the Google Docs editor just by clicking on it...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google, Dell, and Intel form new computing group for transforming cloud and IT tools</title>

  &lt;p id="xq284Z"&gt;Google, Dell, Intel and a handful of other major tech companies in the IT and cloud computing industries have banded together to tackle joint problems around security, remote work, and other enterprise issues that have only become more important during the coronavirus pandemic. The consortium these companies have formed is called the Modern Computing Alliance, and its founding members also include Box, Cirtrix, Imprivata, Okta, RingCentral, Slack, VMWare, and Zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gN5Q3G"&gt;The Modern Computing Alliance will initially be focused on four areas: performance; security and identity; remote work, productivity, and collaboration; and health care. The goal is to pool knowledge and resources toward solving shared problems around how companies perform...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Geoff Keighley, gaming’s inescapable hypeman, on ‘the most expensive’ Game Awards yet</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InrPkO"&gt;Geoff Keighley doesn’t get enough sleep. It’s December, which means he’s averaging four or five hours on a good night. “One of the toughest things about [the Game Awards] is that I’m hosting it, and I’m also producing it,” he says. Sure, he’d probably be a better host with more rest, but there’s an added benefit to knowing the whole thing front to back. He could do this in his — ah, never mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xIikw"&gt;This year, the 20-hour days leading up to the annual Game Awards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22163974/2020-game-awards-how-to-watch-time-date-premieres"&gt;on December 10th&lt;/a&gt; look a little different. Seating charts for an event of hundreds used to keep him up late, but now, group gatherings are a quaint concept. COVID-19 safety precautions have made the whole process a little stranger. “It’s obviously an evolving situation so we’re kind...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>German regulators are investigating Facebook for its controversial Oculus account rules</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4hT4QA"&gt;Germany’s competition watchdog is investigating Facebook for tying its social app to its Oculus virtual reality headsets. Today, the Bundeskartellamt or Federal Cartel Office (FCO) &lt;a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2020/10_12_2020_Facebook_Oculus.html"&gt;announced a probe&lt;/a&gt; of the increasingly close link between Facebook and Oculus, arguing that it could hurt competition in both VR and social networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQZ735"&gt;The new Oculus Quest 2 headset requires signing in with a Facebook account rather than a separate Oculus ID, and that’s raised antitrust concerns. “Linking virtual reality products and the group’s social network in this way could constitute a prohibited abuse of dominance by Facebook,” said FCO president Andreas Mundt. Mundt noted that Facebook is a dominant social network in Germany and plays a large role in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next-gen sports games get subtle, solid improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jYWC6h4nLQnqX1Mk-xro6P3Bi0s=/74x0:887x542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490946/960x0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="57IEtp"&gt;One of my favorite things to do whenever new consoles come out is see how sports games run on them. It’s not that I necessarily expect them to be all that different on more powerful hardware — quite the opposite, in fact. Since sports games tend to depict enclosed, fixed environments and need to have perfectly smooth performance every year, they’re normally stable and reliable whatever system you play them on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zu8x2I"&gt;If you look at &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Madden&lt;/em&gt;, for example, they already run at native 4K and 60 frames per second on the PS4 Pro and the Xbox One X — a pretty rare achievement for most games on those machines. But that means when it comes to the PS5 and the Xbox Series X, 2K and EA have had to figure out new ways to make the next-gen...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Target is hosting a buy one, get one half off deal on some Nintendo Switch games</title>

  &lt;p id="nUuN1z"&gt;As the holidays get closer (and with some arriving now — Happy Hanukkah!), we’re searching for tech deals that make for easy, relatively affordable gifts. It’s always nice when the selection fits a particular theme, but sometimes you’ve got to take what you can get. Like today, wherein we have a great buy one, get one half off deal on some Nintendo Switch games at Target, a solid deal on lightly used Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless, noise-canceling headphones, and a few other odds and ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="HaTcPE"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4L7VuA"&gt;Nintendo Switch game deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zUQuDr"&gt;Some of Nintendo’s own titles for the Switch are looped into a buy one, get one half off deal at Target, including must-have games like &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion 3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mario Tennis Aces&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Splatoon 2&lt;/em&gt;, and...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E7KrIV"&gt;For years, critics have argued that Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram was a missed opportunity to rein in the company. But now, they’ll have the chance to actually undo it. On Wednesday afternoon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission joined with 48 state attorneys general&lt;/a&gt; to call for a court-ordered divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp — essentially, forcing Facebook to undo both acquisitions and spin them back into independent companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AzhMg"&gt;Regulators are still a long way from making that happen, but for the first time, it’s a possibility that Facebook can’t ignore. And for Instagram users, it raises a question that’s both alarming and tantalizing: what would Instagram look like without Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1xcNj"&gt;In the years since the 2012 acquisition,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The good and the bad in the government’s case against Facebook</title>

  &lt;h2 id="D74t6l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xUclNM"&gt;After writing about the potential breakup of Facebook for years, it’s somewhat surreal for me to see the prospect actually arrive. But it’s here: &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission voted 3-2 to sue Facebook for illegally maintaining a monopoly in social networking&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it has used acquisitions and harsh restrictions on third-party developers to prevent competitors from ever gaining a foothold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFMSzW"&gt;If successful, the FTC’s case — which was joined by 46 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam — could force the company to divest itself of Instagram and WhatsApp, radically reshaping the digital economy. The move comes less than six weeks after the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/justice-comes-for-google"&gt;filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Google of also maintaining an illegal...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
