    <title>Hisense’s 55-inch 4K QLED TV is cheaper than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uk-rhHqpNHmcxZk1MOqFmCVhlcQ=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69936666/hisenseu6g.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hisense&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PrxWBY"&gt;Hisense’s U6G QLED TV in the 55-inch size is discounted at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091Y2KLZZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfHiMbtsRwa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; today. Normally $649.99, you can pick it up from either Best Buy or Amazon for just $520. Its quantum dot LED-backlit display should offer better contrast and color accuracy than the many low-end models available around the $400-$500 price range. It has Google Assistant built in, too, along with support for a bevy of streaming apps, including YouTube, Disney Plus, HBO Max, and more. It has four HDMI ports and a native refresh rate of 60Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qJyVs"&gt;It might be of importance to you that Hisense includes this model in its “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22675894/hisense-100-day-no-regrets-guarantee-promotion-tv-8k-laser" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;100 Day No Regrets Guarantee&lt;/a&gt;.” You can try out the TV for 100 days, and if you don’t like it, Hisense will refund you after you send it back. Both...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We bought gadgets from Amazon’s banned brands and it was a piece of cake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eAQ1wRHVsCK08BtFS2znoTVbRfQ=/0x126:3024x2142/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69936294/verge_sean_hollister_20210930_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QjwQ5K"&gt;If you’re a reputable Chinese gadget manufacturer with millions of dollars at stake &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680269/amazon-ban-chinese-brands-review-abuse-fraud-policy"&gt;because Amazon banned your ass&lt;/a&gt; for inflating user reviews... do you roll over? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701144/amazon-chinese-companies-lawsuit-paid-reviews"&gt;File a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;? Or change a single letter in your name and try to sneak back onto Amazon anyhow? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k73nLj"&gt;It sure seems like Sunvalley, parent company of the popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538779/amazon-sunvalley-tek-ravpower-vava-taotronics-pulled-store"&gt;RavPower, Vava and TaoTronics brands&lt;/a&gt;, chose door number three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fndfdK"&gt;We recently spotted all three banned brands back on the Amazon storefront under the flimsiest of disguises: Vava had changed its name to “Vav,” TaoTronics became “Taotronic,” and RavPower was simply “Rav.” We took screenshots for posterity: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ouWZhn"&gt;They’re not the only ones, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"&gt;Banned brand Choetech&lt;/a&gt; didn’t even need...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Humble Bundle has raised $200 million for charity thanks to generous gamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iayd-U955kGZSTgA4FnYdWaVxsU=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69935830/humblebundle_200_million.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EP8ZUv"&gt;If you play video games on the PC then there’s a good chance at some point in your life you’ve purchased something from Humble Bundle: a digital storefront that regularly announces time-limited, pay-what-you-want game bundles, each of which sets aside a slice of the proceeds for charity. This week, the company announced that it’s now &lt;a href="https://blog.humblebundle.com/2021/09/30/200-million-raised-for-charity-thank-you-humble-community/"&gt;raised more than $200 million&lt;/a&gt; for good causes around the world — so: well done, gamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2fz2D"&gt;The Humble Bundle concept first appeared in 2010, pioneered by indie game studio Wolfire Games, but was soon spun off into its own entity, with a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F1%2F22703917%2Fhumble-bundle-200-million-charity-milestone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated store&lt;/a&gt; and publishing subsidiary, Humble Games. Now the company offers bundles for books, comics, and software, as well as a monthly subscription service, Humble...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Neopets are being turned into NFTs because of course they are</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FlSFEOzAUde6IbL7GKE0JLmye3Q=/1x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69935788/neopets.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neopets was a hugely popular virtual pet adoption site launched in 1999. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sqw2oS"&gt;Virtual pet franchise Neopets is getting into NFTs — a seemingly inevitable move for a site with a long and varied history that has spawned a dizzying array of merchandise and offshoots, from magazines and cards to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18068518/neopets-legends-letters-new-mobile-game-puzzles-dragons"&gt;mobile games&lt;/a&gt; and a (promised) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21293330/neopets-animated-series-launch-fall-2021-merch-plush-mobile-site"&gt;animated series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxvtY9"&gt;You may not be familiar with Neopets, but it was a staple for many who grew up online in the early to mid-2000s. The basic concept is that users adopt virtual pets, and then spend hours farming games and events to attain items and customize their little darlings. It sounds simple, but the site was hugely popular in its day (thanks in no small part to a &lt;a href="https://www.themarysue.com/neopets-economy/"&gt;thriving and addictive&lt;/a&gt; internal economy), boasting more than 30 million active users around 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7JDANL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neopets had more than 30...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Google says Bing users search for Google more than anything else</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5z8x5CBaVjPKA_RFq44BAlTgck4=/0x0:1284x856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69935667/Screen_Shot_2021_09_30_at_3.56.31_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DUkEcn"&gt;“Google” is the most searched term on Bing “by far,” according to a lawyer working for Google’s parent company, Alphabet. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-28/google-tells-judges-it-s-so-popular-it-s-bing-s-top-search-term?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Google made the argument while trying to get its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust"&gt;$5 billion antitrust fine from the EU&lt;/a&gt; overturned, using the statistic as evidence that people use Google by choice, not force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7oJXT"&gt;The fine Google faces is from the European Commission, which says that Google has abused its position as the maker of Android. The regulator says that Google will have to stop forcing handset makers to pre-install Chrome and Google search if they want to have Android. Google’s argument? That most people would just use its search engine anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcX5eB"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/top-bing-searches/"&gt;statistics compiled by SEO company Ahrefs&lt;/a&gt;, “google” is indeed the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV and NBCUniversal agree to ‘short’ extension to avoid channels disappearing</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5IhHkm"&gt;Following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22695937/nbcuniversal-youtube-tv-carriage-dispute"&gt;public standoff&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, YouTube TV and NBCUniversal have agreed to a “short” extension over the streaming service carrying several of the broadcaster’s channels. That means that at least for now, YouTube TV will continue to carry more than a dozen major NBCUniversal-owned channels, including NBC regional sports networks. But it also means YouTube TV’s monthly subscription cost won’t be getting $10 cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCSHvl"&gt;Had talks broken down, NBCUniversal programming would have been removed from YouTube TV at midnight ET. “NBCUniversal and YouTube TV have agreed to a short extension while parties continue talks,” an NBCUniversal spokesperson tells &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jank0/status/1443773993119469570"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/09/youtube-tv-nbcu-deal-explained.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “NBCUniversal will not go dark on YouTube TV at midnight...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA promotes Laura Miele to COO, making her one of the most powerful women in gaming</title>

  &lt;p id="awuqT7"&gt;Electronic Arts is promoting chief studios officer Laura Miele to chief operating officer, &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/news/driving-transformation-for-players-and-growth-for-our-company"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The change is a big promotion for Miele, who already had significant leadership at the company overseeing 25 different studios. The new role will give Miele greater oversight over the company and arguably makes her the most powerful woman in gaming, an industry where there are few female executives, fewer in the C-suite, and where those C-suite execs are often in charge of HR or finance rather than the company’s products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kciWhb"&gt;Ubisoft did make Virginie Hass its chief studios operating officer last August, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332534/ubisoft-serge-hascoet-harassment-sexism-racism-metoo"&gt;scandals over a toxic culture including sexual harassment and misconduct&lt;/a&gt; that went as high as the C-suite...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn is buying Lordstown Motors’ Ohio EV factory for $230 million</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="63Shtf"&gt;iPhone assembler Foxconn is buying an automotive factory from struggling EV startup Lordstown Motors for around $230 million, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/30/2306712/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-and-Hon-Hai-Technology-Group-Announce-Agreement-in-Principle.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday. Foxconn says it has agreed to build Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck at the plant, which is where General Motors used to make the Chevrolet Cruze, and that the startup will remain a tenant there. Lordstown Motors will also “agree to provide Foxconn with certain rights with respect to future vehicle programs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmMNZn"&gt;The deal gives the Taiwanese conglomerate its first automotive factory, and a significant new presence in the United States — one that the company will use as it tries to establish itself as a global electric vehicle automaker. Foxconn previously announced a...&lt;/p&gt;
