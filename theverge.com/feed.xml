    <title>Microsoft removes GitHub’s annoying cookie banners</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XX5SZn"&gt;Cookie banners are one of the most annoying parts of browsing the web, forcing you to click accept or deny on multiple sites. Microsoft is starting to address this aggravation by removing cookie banners from GitHub this week. “At GitHub, we want to protect developer privacy, and we find cookie banners quite irritating, so we decided to look for a solution,” &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you/"&gt;explains GitHub CEO Nat Friedman&lt;/a&gt;. “After a brief search, we found one: just don’t use any non-essential cookies. Pretty simple, really.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCqDY6"&gt;Microsoft has removed all nonessential cookies from GitHub, meaning the site doesn’t send any information to third-party analytics services. This is a change that’s turned into a commitment, so GitHub will only ever use cookies that are required and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Space Force member reportedly skipped class to get a PS5 but got demoted instead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k11kHZ_J9n_Z4vn-vIOlpcY2SYs=/0x89:4200x2889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68543066/200722_F_GO452_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LR0yKl"&gt;The Space Force, it seems, is not sympathetic to the mission that seems to have captured many across the US: getting a PS5. One of its members has reportedly been reprimanded and demoted for being 30 minutes late to physical training because he was trying to get one of the consoles, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/AirForceForum/photos/a.201001016740213/1767983043375328"&gt;post on the Air Force amn/nco/snco Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/mandatory-fun/space-force-letter-of-reprimand-playstation/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Task and Purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YRqxs3"&gt;According to the letter, the unnamed airman texted his superior officer that he was going to be 30 minutes late to his fitness improvement program as he had been driving around to multiple Targets (the store, not the military terminology) trying to buy a PS5. The airman then added “Yolo, PS5 &amp;gt; letters of discipline,” according to the letter of discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Google and Qualcomm are working together for faster Android updates</title>

&lt;p id="687tF6"&gt;The goal is to make it even easier for users to get the latest version of Android on their phones (something that isn’t always guaranteed) and to ensure that new Qualcomm chips will support four Android OS updates and four years of security updates — a huge leap forward from what most Android phones usually offer. Such a feat, if actually accomplished, would put Android smartphones closer to Apple’s iPhones in terms of long-term software...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from. With so many Echo devices currently available, there is a device for every occasion. Maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;

But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google accused of search manipulation in third major antitrust lawsuit</title>

  &lt;p id="BXtVBm"&gt;A coalition of 38 states &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20431671-colorado-v-google"&gt;filed an antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Google Thursday focusing on the design of the tech giant’s search engine. It’s the third major antitrust lawsuit filed against the search giant this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCziXS"&gt;Colorado’s Democratic Attorney General Phil Weiser and Nebraska’s Republican Attorney General Doug Peterson led the bipartisan group of states’ suit accusing Google of anticompetitive behavior like designing its search engine in a way that leverages the company’s own products over those of its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keIUFh"&gt;“Google sits at the crossroads of so many areas of our digital economy and has used its dominance to illegally squash competitors, monitor nearly every aspect of our digital lives, and profit to the tune of billions,” New...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. There are currently three models to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4vnkg"&gt;The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop at least another $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. The three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E67sPx"&gt;Regardless of which model you choose, all three models support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Epic Games Store now offers Spotify, signaling app store ambitions beyond just games</title>

  &lt;p id="7YV18j"&gt;Spotify is &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/spotify/home"&gt;now available on the Epic Games Store&lt;/a&gt;, signaling developer Epic’s ambitions to turn what has so far been strictly a games store into a more general app distribution platform. The Spotify app is free to download on the Epic Games Store, just like it is on the App Store, Google Play, or as a direct download for your PC or Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaKjdG"&gt;Spotify’s availability on the Epic Games Store arrives as Epic is in prolonged legal battles with Apple and Google over the business models of each company’s respective app store. Epic has sued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; over the removal of the mobile version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;alleging antitrust violations and arguing that developers can and should be able to process their own payments and circumvent giving 30 percent of...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5b53xh"&gt;I always enjoy this time of the year. Usually, I take some time off of work and use it as a golden opportunity to tackle my ever-growing backlog of games. With the year wrapping up and a ton of great games already available (and even more coming over the next few years), it’s truly a great time to be a gamer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYuaN0"&gt;Today’s deals spotlight an incredible deal for PS4 and PS5 owners, a sale on Dell’s 27-inch 1440p gaming monitor, plus a few deals on some great headphones and wireless earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHdAxM"&gt;Get two years of PlayStation Plus for less than $60&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1npEWm"&gt;If you were one of the lucky ones to grab a PS5, I recommend taking advantage of this &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus subscription deal, which is $32&lt;/a&gt; at Eneba.com.
