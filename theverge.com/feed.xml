  &lt;p id="5aO9CW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are often thought of as times to stock up on smaller investments on the cheap, like headphones, games, and other gadgets you may not have wanted to pay full price for. But it’s also a great time to save on big-ticket items, like that laptop you’ve maybe had your eye on. The shopping holidays have brought some seriously good discounts on laptops, whether you’re keen on sticking with Mac, or you want a Windows PC. Both often come in very slim designs, but for people who don’t mind a heavier laptop, we’ve included some gaming laptop picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UADRPQ"&gt;The kinds of deals you can get on laptops vary depending on the retailer, so that’s how we’ve split up the deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Iw3jHO"&gt;Razer is offering a $200 gift card to its online...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday weekend deals on cameras and lenses </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AejUlTBdnzMNTngZJQUzI-7kh1Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70188516/akrales_190117_3163_0010.10.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CTXPBN"&gt;Cameras and lenses can be a tricky thing to shop for around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. They are no small investment, though if you’re shopping for that lucky someone — or for yourself — there are some deals to be had that can save you a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cd0NVO"&gt;We have vetted and rounded up the most notable deals from the major camera manufacturers, focusing on the latest mirrorless systems. It’s hard to justify spending big money on a new DSLR in 2021, as it may be better to look to the secondhand market for those older systems. Another hard truth is that some camera manufacturers have been plagued by the chip shortages on the latest models, and the deals on tap show that — many of the deeper discounts are on slightly older cameras, and some newer releases...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday weekend deals on noise-canceling headphones 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CXi2TP8qUlAHiVFP0_WedsUgWMc=/5x0:803x532/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177196/Screenshot_2021_11_27_114547.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Embrace the silence&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5KTAD"&gt;Whether you’re overdue for a new pair or are just trying to cancel out the usual onslaught of holiday music, Black Friday season is a great time to invest in some noise-canceling headphones. You’ll find significant discounts on many of our favorite headphones featured in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;noise-canceling headphones buying guide&lt;/a&gt;. These include picks from Sony, Bose, Apple, Sennheiser, and others. In some cases, these deals will save you $100 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKhJxM"&gt;Aside from the steep discounts, another good thing about buying headphones during the holidays is the extended return period at many retailers. That gives you plenty of time to try out your new cans and make sure the sound quality, ANC, comfort, and other factors are all to your liking before you’re stuck...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EIiXqs"&gt;Gamers are served up all kinds of great deals throughout the year. It’s not uncommon for recently released games to drop as much as 20 percent off in the first few months of release or to snag the occasional one-off deal on a controller or headset. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are something special — a chance to get in on the year’s best offers all at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lUgdw"&gt;Like 2020, the holidays in 2021 are a bit peculiar, what with the ongoing pandemic and chip shortage. There’s no shortage of games and accessories, but fewer consoles are available for first-time buyers to gift, which means the opportunities to get one are very rare and very popular. Some retailers have even taken to charging subscription fees that offer you a boosted chance of...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXFrPb"&gt;Need a new phone? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are a great time to be shopping for a phone for yourself or as a gift to your nearest and dearest this holiday season. This is the time of year when retailers and carriers are dropping their best deals, whether it’s to make room for next year’s models or to sign up new cellular customers. Android users can cash in on a number of excellent deals from the likes of Samsung, Google, OnePlus, and Motorola; however, Apple is notoriously stingy when it comes to iPhone discounts. You might get a gift card or a pair of AirPods when buying an iPhone, or a carrier might offer a higher trade-in value for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22684911/iphone-13-true-cost-of-free-phone-iphone-13-pro"&gt;“free” iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Still plenty of deals to be had at Walmart&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;p id="AtjyQ3"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; itself is over, several retailers are still offering significant discounts over the entire weekend — and Walmart is no exception. Right now, the retail giant is still dropping deals on everything from the AirPods Pro to the most popular TVs and streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uTIwf"&gt;We’ve featured a few of these items in our guide to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday deals you can still get&lt;/a&gt;, however, the list below highlights all of the best sales Walmart is offering across several categories rather than just a few. It’s perfect, then, for anybody who plans on shopping primarily at Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OVcC4"&gt;If you subscribe to Walmart Plus, the retailer’s equivalent to Amazon Prime, you’ll also gain access to the deals four hours in advance. Regardless of when you plan on...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="K6KslT"&gt;If you’ve been tracking Amazon’s lead-up to Black Friday like we have, you’ve likely seen the online retail giant rebrand its “Deal of the Day” page to “Epic Daily Deals” and finally full on “Black Friday Deals.” We’re now past Black Friday, and that landing page has transformed once again — this time to Cyber Monday. Amazon has a slew of deals worth jumping on now if time is of the essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dh61Pd"&gt;Below are a variety of deals worth your time and attention, especially if you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber.

  &lt;p id="nbBDQ6"&gt;Microsoft-owned GitHub is down, affecting thousands or potentially millions of developers that rely on its many services. GitHub started experiencing issues at around 3:45PM ET, with Git operations, API requests, GitHub actions, packages, pages, and pull requests all affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hOwOy"&gt;“We’re investigating errors affecting most GitHub services,” says an incident update on the &lt;a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/"&gt;GitHub status page&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re actively investigating and will provide an update as soon as possible.” The status page lists problems with Git operations, API requests, webhooks, pull requests, GitHub actions, GitHub packages, and GitHub pages. Codespaces still seems to be operational, though.&lt;/p&gt;
