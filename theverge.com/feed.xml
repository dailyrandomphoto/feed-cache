    <title>Amazon goes quiet on its Twitch-based Pac-Man game, but Bandai Namco says it’s still in development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IsQDdUukfDpRPGQkmJ_MmWTm8Lc=/79x0:922x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69301024/pic_03.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon Games and Bandai Namco&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rnmAeI"&gt;In May 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266881/pac-man-live-studio-playable-on-twitch-june"&gt;Amazon announced &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an interesting new version of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man &lt;/em&gt;that you’d be able to play right inside Twitch. The game was set to release that June — but recently the company removed all traces of it from the Amazon Games website. Nearly a year after &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; was supposed to debut, its status remains a mystery — though developer Bandai Namco says the game is still in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SePP7C"&gt;Right now, &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;’s page on the Amazon Games website &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;shows a 404 error&lt;/a&gt;, but the Wayback Machine has an archived version of the filled-out webpage &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210407014742/https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;from April 7th&lt;/a&gt;. This archived version lists a release date of “coming soon” — many months after the original June launch date. And Wario64, who you might know as one of the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/microsoft-new-gaming-console-545e87c5-0a6f-4384-8b69-dbded2737e01.html#:~:text=Wario64,worse"&gt;best video...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halide’s iPad camera app is here to recklessly promote tablet photography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hr8zNsDjKz3uoZwcqNgNXOWSvCE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69305591/iPad_Pro___Pro_View_and_Regular_View.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ylwtz0"&gt;One of the best third-party camera apps for iOS, Halide, is coming to the iPad, its &lt;a href="https://lux.camera/halide-pro-camera-for-ipad/"&gt;developer Lux announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The iPhone app has a reputation for the amount of control it gives you over your photographs, and this functionality has been carried over to the iPad along with a redesigned interface that’s optimized for larger displays. The app is free to existing Halide owners, while new users can either pay a one-off purchase fee ($40) or go with monthly ($1.99) or yearly ($11.99) subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgCtK4"&gt;Using iPads to take photographs has a bit of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/16/6990649/apples-ipad-air-2-shows-that-tablet-photography-is-here-to-stay"&gt;reputation problem&lt;/a&gt;. Not only do Apple’s tablets tend to have fewer and lower-specced rear cameras than its phones, but the act of taking a photograph using a large tablet often looks just plain...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hurricane Sandy was much worse because of climate change, study finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rockaways Recovery From Hurricane Sandy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X8M4_TERd9KXSsGdyRz7u6V2BxM=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69305151/159697930.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S62loA"&gt;Just a few inches of human-driven sea level rise contributed to Hurricane Sandy’s devastation of the Northeastern US in 2012. Tens of thousands more people were affected, and more than $8 billion in damages incurred during the storm were a result of climate-induced sea level rise, according to a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNzqS8"&gt;That’s about 13 percent of the more than $62.5 billion total in damage that the superstorm created in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Because climate change pushed sea levels higher, floodwaters were able to creep further inland — bringing more destruction with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G4TZQs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Sea level rise raises the launchpad for every single coastal storm.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jL0rHg"&gt;This is the first study to put a dollar sign...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this difficult time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grand Theft Auto V is coming to the PS5 and Xbox Series X in November</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s9lggj"&gt;One of the bestselling games of all time is coming to next-gen consoles at the end of the year. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3981k373a7a9ok/details-on-new-updates-to-g-t-a-online-and-red-dead-online"&gt;Rockstar announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; and its online spinoff will both be launching on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on November 11th; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288378/grand-theft-auto-v-5-gta-ps5-2021-release"&gt;the new version was previously announced at the PS5’s reveal event last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgnvJA"&gt;We don’t yet know what exactly will be changed for the next-gen iterations, but Rockstar says they will be “expanded and enhanced.” It’s also not clear what the upgrade path will look like for current owners of the game. &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, will be available as a standalone title, and Sony previously said that it would be free for all PS5 owners during its first three months of availability.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deepfake dubs could help translate film and TV without losing an actor’s original performance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1MqwYRLLmJ8lPyasIyKhzumyTE=/59x0:791x488/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304782/flawless_deepfake_dub.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tz78tk"&gt;What exactly is lost in translation when TV shows and films are subbed or dubbed into a new language? It’s a hard question to answer, but for the team at AI startup Flawless, it may be one we don’t have to think about in the future. The company claims it has the solution to this particular language barrier; a technical innovation that could help TV shows and films effortlessly reach new markets around the world: deepfake dubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsUOmP"&gt;We often think of deepfakes as manipulating the entire image of a person or scene, but Flawless’ technology focuses on just a single element: the mouth. Customers feed the company’s software with video from a film or TV show along with dubbed dialogue recorded by humans. Flawless’ machine learning models then...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify will auto-transcribe podcasts over the coming weeks</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify says it plans to generate transcripts for all podcasts on its app.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AhQUZ7"&gt;Spotify announced multiple updates to make its app more accessible across iOS and Android today, including a beta version of a podcast transcription feature. The company says it’ll start auto-transcribing certain exclusive and original shows over the coming weeks as part of a beta rollout. People will be able to read the transcript with or without audio and can tap on text to jump to that point in the audio. The company says the goal is to eventually “enable transcripts across all podcasts on Spotify.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bF71a"&gt;This is an especially helpful feature for people who want to scan and move around a podcast, possibly to hear a specific segment, and for people who would rather read than listen to a show. Spotify is one of the first major podcast apps to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford F-150 Lightning: what to expect from the automaker’s first electric pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pblSoU25aA7G0v03m0kNJujsI4A=/248x0:1193x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304637/2021_f_150_reveal.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OFvMqP"&gt;Ford is set to unveil its next major electric vehicle, the F-150 Lightning, at 9:30PM ET on Wednesday, May 19th. But this isn’t just another EV event. An electric version of the automaker’s iconic F-series pickup truck is a very big deal for Ford, for the auto world, for car buyers, and even for the US economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yKrzT"&gt;Ford is very proud of its F-series trucks, and for good reason. It’s the bestselling truck in the US for 44 years. It’s also the bestselling vehicle in the country, period. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fmost-popular-cars%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F18%2F22441793%2Fford-f150-lightning-announcement-rumors-specs-details" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to Edmunds&lt;/a&gt;, F-series trucks are the most popular vehicle in 30 out of 50 states in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5cNKL"&gt;That means the F-Series trucks create a huge windfall for Ford. The Detroit automaker netted around $42 billion in revenue in 2019 from nearly 900,000...&lt;/p&gt;
