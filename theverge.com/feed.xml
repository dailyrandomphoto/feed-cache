    <title>Waymo is disclosing more autonomous vehicle data for research purposes</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3aZpp"&gt;Waymo is publicizing more data from its autonomous vehicles, which it says is for the benefit of the research community. Building on the trove of data it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20822755/waymo-self-driving-car-data-set-free-research"&gt;released in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the Alphabet company is calling this latest batch “the largest interactive dataset yet released for research into behavior prediction and motion forecasting for autonomous driving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHCpuD"&gt;This “motion dataset” includes over 100,000 segments, each around 20 seconds long, of objects like cars and people and their trajectories, as captured by Waymo’s sensor-laden vehicles. The company has included corresponding 3D maps and geographic details in each segment to provide researchers with context for their prediction modeling. In total, Waymo says it is releasing 570 hours of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A former pro is helping figure skating look more authentic than ever</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;On Ice Perspectives&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vW2DkD"&gt;On TV, ice skating often looks like a sport stuck in time. Cameras aren’t hanging from wires above the action or placed close to the ice for a dynamic look at skaters zipping by. Instead, a few stationary cameras planted around a rink flip from one view to the next when a better angle is available. It can be dull to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5uadz"&gt;But far more exciting and intimate ways to shoot ice skating have been emerging on social media, and one person in particular has made a name synonymous with turning the sport into something spectacular to watch: Jordan Cowan, under the name On Ice Perspectives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fN0d7"&gt;Plenty of others try to make videos similar to those Cowan uploads to his channels. What gives his content the edge is that he was a professional skater who...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Photoshop now runs natively on Apple’s M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vyAtcJ"&gt;Lightroom was the first Adobe creative app to make the leap to Apple Silicon, and now the much-anticipated release of Photoshop is here. According to the company, Photoshop for M1 Macs completes most tasks 1.5 times faster than when running on Intel. But the speed improvements extend beyond actual editing; Adobe says &lt;em&gt;a lot &lt;/em&gt;about Photoshop should now feel faster — including how quickly the app opens up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbp1T3"&gt;Photoshop for Apple Silicon was previously in beta, but now it’s being widely rolled out to Creative Cloud customers with an M1 Mac: those include the MacBook Air, entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini“These great performance improvements are just the beginning, and we will continue to work together with Apple to further optimize...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The plus-size knitters who are solving an inclusivity problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A graphic of white knitted sweaters on a blue yarn background, connected by threads." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U-YYcwwMxewUEQACWoKd9fx-5Rk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941018/VRG_ILLO_4422_DIY_KnittingCommunity.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7b6JDh"&gt;Fifteen years since first learning to knit, Petrina Hicks has only ever made sweaters for other people. There was one cardigan attempt back in 2015, but they had to make so many modifications that the end product was frumpy and ill-fitting. Hicks didn’t have the luxury to be picky: the cardigan was the only sweater pattern they could find above an XL or XXL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfCCaj"&gt;“I want to be a sweater maker,” Hicks said. “I couldn’t find things that were cute. I couldn’t find things that were in my style.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXtbHf"&gt;Hopeful crafters pick up knitting for a variety of reasons: to adopt a slow-fashion wardrobe, to keep &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-04-11/knitting-stress-relief-pandemic"&gt;stress at bay&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, or to make the clothes they wish existed, controlling the color and fit to their liking. Ravelry, the largest knitting...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok will warn users before posting ‘inappropriate or unkind’ comments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pop-up gives users the option of editing their comment, or posting it anyway.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TIkTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmfRGE"&gt;TikTok is rolling out a pop-up today that’s designed to warn users before they post a comment that might be “&lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-tools-to-promote-kindness"&gt;inappropriate or unkind.&lt;/a&gt;” The new feature is one of two being announced that are designed to “promote kindness” on the service. The other is Filter All Comments, so that they only appear once individually approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fucAHp"&gt;The new unkind warning appears if TikTok believes a comment might violate its community guidelines. “Would you like to reconsider posting this?” the pop-up box reads, before encouraging users to “Edit” it, or “Post anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxzNWP"&gt;Prompts like these have been explored by other social networks to cut down on bullying and harassment. Instagram rolled out similar prompts &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagrams-commitment-to-lead-fight-against-online-bullying"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248201/twitter-reply-warning-harmful-language-revise-tweet-moderation"&gt;testing them last...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU aims to double chip manufacturing amid growing fears about ‘digital sovereignty’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Semiconductor Production at Globalfoundries Europe Plant" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gbvKxvpYp7b5vj9mGUpQWfjKsZQ=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940681/1231203170.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Semiconductor production, as shown above in GlobalFoundries’ European factory, is an extremely capital-intensive business.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Box6j2"&gt;The European Union wants to double its chip manufacturing output to 20 percent of the global market by 2030. The goal is part of its new &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_983"&gt;Digital Compass plan&lt;/a&gt;, announced yesterday, which aims to boost “digital sovereignty” by funding various high-tech initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfGJv0"&gt;As well as doubling chip output, the EU also wants all households to have 5G access and gigabit internet connectivity by 2030; for “all key public services” to be available online in every member state; and for the bloc to have its first quantum computer. Funding for these and other projects will come from the EU’s €672.5 billion ($800 billion) &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/recovery-coronavirus/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en"&gt;coronavirus response fund&lt;/a&gt;, with 20 percent of this money ($160 billion) earmarked for tech investment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly overestimated iPhone 12 mini demand, by a lot</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GwFmuf"&gt;Apple is cutting production of the iPhone 12 mini in the first half of this year, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-slashes-planned-iPhone-12-mini-production-for-1H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Planned production of the smallest iPhone 12 model has reportedly been reduced by 70 percent or more in the first half of this year, making up the majority of a 20 percent cut in total iPhone 12 production. Some suppliers have been asked to temporarily stop producing iPhone 12 mini-specific components, while other parts are being reallocated to the Pro and Pro Max, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCFt4B"&gt;Alongside the iPhone production news, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Apple has pushed back production for two new Apple Silicon MacBooks. Originally due to enter mass production in May or June, the laptops will now be manufactured in the second half of the year. &lt;em&gt;N...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos partners with Audi to bring its audio tech to cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OxkMGoZbFdGiJLpdDP8mMXHXwMY=/757x378:2097x1271/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940449/A211114_overfull.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Sonos-branded speaker inside Audi’s new TV, the Q4 E-Tron.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Audi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JOuxWq"&gt;Sonos has partnered with Audi to equip the automaker’s Q4 E-Tron with sound, a first for the California-based audio company best known for home speakers. The news was confirmed Tuesday by Sonos CEO Patrick Spence after Audi published images of the Q4 E-Tron’s interior showing the Sonos logo. &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/sonos-audi-partnership"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; was first to report&lt;/a&gt; the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYh0Qf"&gt;On Tuesday, Audi published a trove of shots showing off the interior of its next EV, the Q4 E-Tron. While the German carmaker emphasized its new augmented reality heads-up display, others took note of the Sonos logo, despite no mention of the collaboration in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7WIM8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10383842"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0FgAIc"&gt;“We want to be in all the different categories of audio, and a big chunk of that is in auto,” said Spence during the Q&amp;amp;A of a &lt;a href="https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2021/Sonos-Investor-Event/"&gt;scheduled...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ new ROG Phone 5 Ultimate has 18GB of RAM and a rear-facing OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xU7BKq-g8xVhFCvkMdSg7K2Fa6Q=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940445/cfaulkner_210228_4452_00010.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7O1TxR"&gt;Asus is going big with its latest gaming phones. The ROG Phone 5 lineup will start shipping this month across the globe, costing 799 euros (around $950) for the base configuration with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of fast UFS 3.1 storage. Every configuration has a 6.78-inch FHD+ OLED screen with a 144Hz refresh rate and a 300Hz touch sampling rate. Also, the headphone jack has made a comeback after being absent from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21332716/asus-rog-phone-3-gaming-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-airtriggers-oled-ram"&gt;ROG Phone 3&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a quad DAC in tow for hi-res audio. (In case you’re wondering where the ROG Phone 4 went, Asus skipped over the number four, like OnePlus did, due to its similarities with the word “death” in some Asian languages.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hemsoR"&gt;The most notable changes from the last generation are exclusive to some even more...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
