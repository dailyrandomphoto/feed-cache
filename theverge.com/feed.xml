    <title>Instagram Reels now has ads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MVXV5V4TJam7gPLkRUCD8BbeyVY=/0x0:1812x1208/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466809/reels_ads.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZwjPTD"&gt;Get ready to start seeing ads in Instagram Reels. The app’s video feed / TikTok clone will start including ads today across the globe. They’ll look just like any other Reel — full-screen, looping, up to 30 seconds long — and will appear in between other clips. Ads will be identified by a small “sponsored” tag below the name of the advertiser’s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ou1F9l"&gt;Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396841/instagram-reels-ads-stickers-video-facebook"&gt;started testing ads&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, Brazil, Germany, and India in April. There’s nothing particularly surprising about more ads making their way into the app, other than the pace with which Instagram has moved to turn this new format into a revenue generator. Facebook also said this week that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22535511/facebook-ads-oculus-quest-vr-apps"&gt;it would bring ads to Oculus Quest apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QRgJ8"&gt;Reels only launched in August 2020, and the...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xqs1js"&gt;Tempo, the company behind the piece of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154185/tempo-smart-home-gym-kinect-computer-vision-ai-form-correction"&gt;exercise equipment that uses Microsoft Kinect&lt;/a&gt; to check your form, is announcing that it’ll have Olympians teach classes on its connected device. The classes are being made as part of an event that’s called the Tempo Games challenge, which will involve participating in workouts led by seven Olympic athletes that will be headed to Tokyo this year — you can see Tempo’s list below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Unite will launch first on Nintendo Switch in July</title>

It’s coming first to Nintendo Switch in July 2021, followed by a release on mobile devices in September. Presumably, it’ll be released on both iOS and Android, but specific platforms weren’t confirmed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B10MAj"&gt;In case you can’t decide which platform you want to play the game on, don’t fret too much, as &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; will support cross-play between Nintendo’s console and mobile devices. &lt;a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/NEW-INFORMATION-REVEALED-FOR-Pokemon-UNITE"&gt;The Pokémon Company announced&lt;/a&gt; that the game will also support cross-progression, which can be enabled by signing in with either your Pokémon Trainer Club account or Nintendo Account on the devices that you want...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Performing Hamlet in GTA Online is simply the best theater experience lockdown can offer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ed_00CdnQ4lsDpX84zQS6zEP2PI=/168x0:1517x899/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466635/Screen_Shot_2021_06_17_at_3.10.56_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uV15rc"&gt;Plenty of actors can, I’m sure, cite plays they were in where the audience was bored, listless, or simply nonexistent. But few have had to contend with the challenges presented by performing in a public lobby in &lt;em&gt;GTA Online. &lt;/em&gt;That’s a shame, frankly, because it’s hilarious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyjHxg"&gt;A YouTuber by the name of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUCmwCCmU6D0tSYijfIpg8A"&gt;Rustic Mascara&lt;/a&gt; has been testing the limits of this bold new performance space, and, though I can’t explain exactly why, I find it amazing to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWRT1T"&gt;In one video (above), he performs a speech from Act II Scene ii, in which Hamlet explains to his friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern why exactly he is so very, very sad. In Rustic’s performance, this is prefaced by requests to nearby players that they please not kill him.  He gets as far as...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring reportedly used LA cops as influencers to market its cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7UdHYb9JqE6X2SwDOk5gmjn2H6g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466516/dseifert170808_1901_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TK6EXl"&gt;Amazon-owned Ring used Los Angeles police officers as brand ambassadors for its security cameras, providing free products and discount codes in exchange for recommendations, the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-06-17/ring-influencer-marketing-los-angeles-police-department"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Ring gave at least 100 LAPD officers free devices, which helped the department create a network of surveillance cameras, making it easier to obtain video footage, according to the &lt;em&gt;LA Times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hZIGc"&gt;Ring ended Pillar, its police officer ambassador program in 2019, and a spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday that “the practices and programs in question do not reflect Ring today. We stopped donating to law enforcement and encouraging police to promote our products years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rG8Sx"&gt;The LAPD did not immediately reply to a request for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo thinks the Switch is well-placed for post-pandemic life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1bJuQ9C7T8mqeK5RKH1daRPQBc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466478/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CdScAf"&gt;The Switch is nearly five years old and facing increased competition from new and powerful consoles from Sony and Microsoft. But despite all of this, Nintendo’s E3 2021 presentation this week was arguably the highlight of this year’s event — even if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456160/new-nintendo-switch-release-date-september-e3-announcement"&gt;the long-rumored Switch Pro&lt;/a&gt; failed to make an appearance. Nintendo showed off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533513/nintendo-switch-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-trailer-e3-2021-release-date-trailer"&gt;the much-anticipated sequel to &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22466240/nintendo-metroid-dread-side-scroller-e3-2021-switch"&gt;revealed that the mythical &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; is launching later this year&lt;/a&gt;, and peppered in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535127/advance-wars-1-and-2-re-boot-camp-nintendo-direct-e3-2021"&gt;a handful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535212/nintendo-the-legend-of-zelda-ii-links-awakening-game-watch-handheld-release-date"&gt;of other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535183/mario-party-superstars-warioware-nintendo-direct-e3"&gt;announcements&lt;/a&gt; to excite fans. As always, the company continued to exist in its own world, divorced from the technological rat race that typically defines these debates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrzPt0"&gt;In fact, the launch of the PS5 and Xbox Series X appears to have had very little impact on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony opens PS5 beta program ahead of next major system update</title>

  &lt;p id="gtoASn"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; has received a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383288/sony-ps5-update-hdr-options-120hz-pc-monitor-support-features"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; feature updates since it launched in late 2020, but &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/17/sign-up-for-the-first-ps5-system-software-beta-program/"&gt;Sony shared today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s prepping to roll out a major system update later this year — and it wants you to test it first. You can register for it’s “first-ever” beta to try the new console software if you’re over 18 and live in the US, Canada, Japan, UK, Germany, or France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTYljR"&gt;Sony isn’t yet sharing what new features are coming in the beta, but it’ll divulge details in the coming weeks, it says. Could it be that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;PS5’s long-awaited M.2 SSD slot will get switched on&lt;/a&gt; for additional speedy storage, or will the console finally get variable refresh rate and 1440p support? You can already tell that I’m expecting a lot out of this incoming update.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkoXe0"&gt;Just ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has begun its annual back-to-school promotion, including &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538235%2Fapple-sale-airpods-macbook-ipad-anker-microsoft-surface-duo-android-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free AirPods when you purchase an eligible Mac or iPad&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a similar deal to last year’s offer, where the standard AirPods are offered by default, but at checkout you can upgrade to the model that includes the wireless charging case for $40, or the AirPods Pro for an extra $90. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmcEdD"&gt;As for what devices are eligible for the free AirPods on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538235%2Fapple-sale-airpods-macbook-ipad-anker-microsoft-surface-duo-android-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s education site&lt;/a&gt;, it starts with the $499 iPad Air (latest gen with USB-C), moving up to the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;M1-touting iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Snapchat will let developers put their apps inside its TikTok copycat Spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D7VtyQ"&gt;Snapchat is making it easier for developers to use viral content to directly promote their apps. Today, it’s launching Creative Kit for Spotlight, which will allow app developers to give users the power to publish directly to Snapchat’s TikTok rival, Spotlight. At the same time, Snapchat users can browse content made on those apps and then easily navigate to download them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJjdxo"&gt;It’s a win-win for both parties: Snapchat gains more content on its platform while developers are rewarded with additional downloads if an effect or tool they launch goes viral. Developers can also set up hashtag topics that’ll tag this content, so they can track how well it’s doing, and viewers can see everything made with that effect. Snap says it won’t take any sort...&lt;/p&gt;
