    <title>Crime-tracking app Citizen now includes a premium-priced safety help line</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Citizen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="efp5YR"&gt;The crime-tracking app Citizen is now launching its own emergency response service, promising access to agents who can call 911 or keep tabs on a potentially dangerous situation. Protect, which costs $19.99 per month, builds on a beta program that launched earlier this year. It’s part of a larger — and sometimes controversial — expansion effort at the startup, which has built a crime-mapping system into a live broadcasting platform while experimenting with private security services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgPWOm"&gt;Citizen Protect is essentially a private safety help line that draws on smartphone features like location tracking. When subscribers open the Citizen app, they can hit a button to call a “Protect Agent” via video, audio, or text. Agents are supposed to talk...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Boeing launch its astronaut capsule to space</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Boeing’s Starliner capsule sits atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket | NASA/Kim Shiflett&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3MNIyb"&gt;Boeing is set to launch its Starliner astronaut capsule to the International Space Station (ISS) on Tuesday, more than a year and a half after its first orbital Starliner test failed to reach the station and returned home earlier than planned. The mission is a test, and there won’t be any humans on board. If all goes well, it’ll mark a crucial step toward Boeing and NASA’s goal to use Starliner for routine astronaut missions, and a key chance to salvage the aerospace giant’s reputation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;after years of setbacks and controversies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVlemU"&gt;The test mission, called Orbital Flight Test 2, will launch from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station using an Atlas-V rocket built by United Launch Alliance. Starliner, sitting on top of the rocket, will...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon and Best Buy’s latest Fire TVs have a sleeker design and better HDR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ddycRY"&gt;Amazon and Best Buy are continuing on with their TV partnership that started three years ago. Today, the companies announced new Insignia and Toshiba TVs that run Amazon’s Fire TV software. The latest F50 series improves on previous “Fire TV Edition” sets — Amazon is just calling them “Fire TVs” now — with expanded quantum dot HDR color for a more vivid picture. The new models also feature slimmer bezels, DTS Virtual-X audio from the built-in speakers, and continue to support Dolby Vision HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Boc3m"&gt;Pricing will start at $599.99 for a 50-inch model, and the F50 series tops out at 70 inches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5yK0L"&gt;Between different models and screen sizes (ranging from 24 inches to 75 inches) sold in the US and Canada, there are now over 80 Insignia and Toshiba Fire...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard president J. Allen Brack is out after sexual harassment suit, employee walkout</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fWb4t6"&gt;In the last week or so, we’ve learned about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;the state of California filing a lawsuit against Blizzard citing numerous stories of sexual harassment and discrimination at the company&lt;/a&gt;. The revelations have been followed by even more stories of unacceptable behavior by leaders of the company, and now the president of Blizzard (who was named in the lawsuit) is leaving the company “to pursue new opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FJKdF"&gt;Employees were informed of J. Allen Brack’s departure this morning, and &lt;a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23706475/new-leadership-at-blizzard"&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt; from Activision Blizzard says that former Vicarious Visions leader Jen Oneal and former Xbox executive Mike Ybarra will take over as co-leaders of the company. Brack &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/3/17934432/mike-morhaime-blizzard-president-resigns"&gt;took over Blizzard in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and prior to that, he led the development of &lt;em&gt;World of...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme launches MagDart magnetic wireless charging devices</title>

  &lt;p id="5RDuFl"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595550/realme-flash-magdart-wireless-charging-magnetic-android-specs"&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt;, Realme is working on a magnetic wireless charging system for its Android phones, and today it’s revealed a full range of products that’ll use the new technology. Realme is calling the system MagDart, and it’s basically a high-powered take on Apple’s MagSafe system for the iPhone 12 range of phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8jHox"&gt;The key product in the lineup is the 50W MagDart charger, which Realme says is the world’s fastest magnetic wireless charger. It has an inescapably bulky cuboid design that makes room for a cooling fan, but Realme is banking that users will make the tradeoff for faster charging speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oD8xGq"&gt;When plugged into the company’s 65W SuperDart wired charger, Realme claims that the MagDart charger will fill a 4,500mAh phone...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="toli3h"&gt;Twitter is working with news agencies the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;to more proactively combat misinformation on its platform, the &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/bringing-more-reliable-context-to-conversations-on-twitter"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The platform’s internal teams already work to explain and add context to Twitter content, but it says the two news agencies will help provide more authoritative information, especially when facts are in dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meIFu2"&gt;In particular, Twitter says it wants to be more proactive about providing accurate information on topics as they develop, before misinformation emerges. “Rather than waiting until something goes viral, Twitter will contextualize developing discourse at pace with or in anticipation of the public conversation,” the platform says. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; will also...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vb6p4B"&gt;HP has gone on a tear and announced seven new gaming monitors in its X lineup, featuring a range of sizes, panel types, and resolutions, as well as some that are curved or flat-screened. It seems like HP is aiming to deliver a flurry of options that have a high refresh rate, low response time, competent design, and crucially, competitive prices. HP is staggering this launch over the next few months, with availability starting now for some of its monitors and continuing through October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZaRHW"&gt;To being with, there’s HP’s X27, which is available now and comes in a 1080p version for $259.99 or a 1440p variant called the X27q that costs $339.99. Both are IPS panels with a 165Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s drone delivery program ‘one gigantic oversell,’ says report into UK operation</title>

  &lt;p id="K1f7IU"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into Amazon’s drone delivery program in the UK says the operation has lost over 100 employees, with insiders saying the project is “collapsing inwards.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4P7k9o"&gt;Citing testimony from former employees, &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;describes a culture of managerial dysfunction and overwork. In February 2020, for example, Amazon reportedly shut down a team of dozens in the UK dedicated to analyzing drone footage to identify humans and animals, only to re-open the unit months later. Other stories cited in the report include the fast turnover of senior staff, an employee drinking beer at their desk in the morning, and another “pinning down the ‘approve’ button on their computer so that all the frames of footage were being approved irrelevant of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi overtakes Samsung to take top spot in European phone shipments in Q2 2021</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GDnNl2"&gt;Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is continuing to post solid growth. After overtaking Apple as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22579771/worldwide-smartphone-market-share-ranking-q2-2022-canalys-xiaomi-apple-samsung"&gt;number two smartphone vendor in the world&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2021, it’s now become the top seller in Europe for the first time, according to &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210802005339/en/Strategy-Analytics-Xiaomi-Captures-Top-Position-in-European-Smartphone-Shipments-for-the-First-Time-in-Q2-2021-%C2%A0"&gt;new figures from Strategy Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fn4FXW"&gt;Xiaomi overtook Samsung to take the top spot in Europe, with 12.7 million phones shipped in Q2, up 67.1 percent year-on-year. Samsung’s shipments fell 7 percent in that same period to 12 million units, though the Korean company remains the world’s biggest phone vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
