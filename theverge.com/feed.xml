    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="51uKka"&gt;Square Enix, the studio behind the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;games, says it’ll allow most of its employees to &lt;a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/en/news/2020/html/df9995782da2d516db9ebac425d02d4019665f70.html"&gt;work from home permanently&lt;/a&gt;. The policy comes into effect on December 1st and will see its employees designated as either “home-based” or “office-based.” In its announcement, the company says it expects around 80 percent of its employees to be designated as home-based from December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGCTok"&gt;The company gives a number of reasons for making the policy permanent. These include creating a “flexible and diverse working environment,” helping employees “achieve the optimal work-life balance,” and helping to “bolster productivity.” It also hopes the policy will help it better adapt in the future, whether it’s to disasters or...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s Animaniacs reboot can’t survive a BoJack Horseman world</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KSImBW"&gt;Watching the original &lt;em&gt;Animaniacs &lt;/em&gt;today is probably the closest you can get to scrolling through a TikTok feed from the mid-’90s. The madcap variety show was like &lt;em&gt;Looney Tunes&lt;/em&gt; by way of golden-age &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;, a pre-social media era meme factory that seemed more interested in parodying show business and celebrity than actually entertaining children. (The first episode is about a dang &lt;em&gt;psychiatrist to the stars&lt;/em&gt;!) Funny thing is, kids loved the antics of the Warner brothers and sister as they guffawed and rampaged their way across studio lots. Adults, on the other hand, were laughing at the jokes actually taking place &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; said studio lots — jokes full of innuendo and references meant for avid consumers of celeb gossip, alongside...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Satellite images show online shopping’s growing footprint </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Satellite imagery shows the explosive growth of warehouses surrounding the San Bernardino International Airport between 2005 and 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZHJhSFW0yMT57ytr0AW-UW6x6Ag=/240x0:2640x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67981102/ESRI_After.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ehRiRh"&gt;You might not see it each time you make a purchase, but online shopping takes up a lot of space in the real world. The number of warehouses built to keep e-commerce running smoothly is growing quickly, and they’re creeping closer to neighborhoods in order to meet consumers’ expectations for quick deliveries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="342fqI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Online shopping has changed the landscape&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NJwWrB"&gt;These images taken by satellite show how dramatically online shopping has changed the landscape of one county in California. I grew up in this county, and I’ve seen that transformation happen in person. A lot of the stuff that Americans buy passes through here. The nearby ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach handle about &lt;a href="https://laedc.org/wtc/chooselacounty/infrastructure-goods-movement/#:~:text=The%20Port%20of%20Los%20Angeles,for%20the%20entire%20United%20States."&gt;40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all goods Americans import. Once it gets off a ship, most...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday tech deals at Amazon</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rzQIrV"&gt;Amazon is hosting a wide variety of tech deals for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The company started its deal festivities early by knocking down prices for many of its own devices, including some of its newer products that hadn’t yet seen any discounts. The fourth-generation Echo smart speaker, the latest Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi routers, and more are all discounted right now, in addition to several other Amazon devices, such as the company’s entire range of Fire TV streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7OYsE"&gt;Of course, that’s just the beginning. More deals will come later this week, and we’ll be including the best deals we find below. The latest deals to hit the wire will be at the top, while the others will be organized by category. If your search for gifts spans...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals on noise-canceling headphones</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wvhQHESYT7wUmXxcrFO4BQgz4TE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67930970/akrales_190716_3546_0312.5.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="WmMrK3"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones are an important piece of tech if you enjoy having zero distractions or outside noise while you jam to funky tunes or listen to podcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC95lA"&gt;While not as convenient as popping earbuds into your ears, noise-canceling headphones do a better job of erasing sound distractions when stacked up against popular wireless earbuds like Apple’s AirPods Pro or Jabra’s 75t. But if you prefer earbuds over headphones, we have rounded up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611428/black-friday-earbuds-deals-wireless-cyber-monday"&gt;the best wireless earbud deals this Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVgfg2"&gt;We are picking out all of the best deals going on right now on several brands that offer noise-canceling headphones. If you want more deals for other tech categories, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;check out our best Black Friday deals post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSby2y"&gt;Most &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; deals will launch the day after Thanksgiving (November 26th) in the US as usual, but the pandemic has shaken things up in yet another way. The best deals will be happening online, with fewer in-person sales for the sake of safety. Better yet, some of those great deals are already available, so you can get started on your holiday gift (or personal) shopping. With this post, we’re rounding up the best early Black Friday deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Adorama, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Newegg, and anywhere else we find deals you should know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kq7sS1"&gt;Smart speaker and audio deals&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="StfBhI"&gt;The Baltimore County Public School (BCPS) system has canceled classes after an apparent ransomware attack shut down internal networks. Described by officials as “a networking issue,” the outage is affecting the schools’ email and grading systems, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfGcK2"&gt;BCPS chief of staff Mychael Dickerson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DMDForward/status/1331601353085513728"&gt;confirmed on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the outage is believed to be the result of a ransomware attack. “We were the victim of a ransomware cyber attack,” he said. “Our BCPS technology team is working to address the situation.” Dickerson could only tweet the message since &lt;a href="https://www.bcps.org/"&gt;the BCPS website&lt;/a&gt; is currently down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxLeav"&gt;As a result of the outage, offices have been closed for the day and students have been given the day off. “We knew it wouldn’t be a quick fix,”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A brief chat with xQc</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DFNo4F"&gt;Last week, the streamer Félix “xQcOW” Lengyel was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573715/twitch-ban-xqc-felix-lengyel-cheating-twitch-rivals"&gt;temporarily banned from Twitch for cheating at a GlitchCon Twitch Rivals event&lt;/a&gt;. It was the third time this year he’s been suspended from Twitch, and his teammates Rabia “Nightblue3” Yazbek and Lucas “Mendo” Håkansson were banned alongside him. I got in touch with Lengyel to chat about what happened, and what he’s learned from the experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J58IHl"&gt;According to him, the stream sniping incident — when he and his teammates queued into a competitor’s lobby with the intent to derail their game — was a bit of banter that went too far, though Lengyel is careful to note that he’s not trying to justify what happened. “The atmosphere was really like funny, banter-y — we went to their Discord, they went...&lt;/p&gt;
