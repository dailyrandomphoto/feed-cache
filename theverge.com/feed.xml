    <title>Jaguar I-Pace is Google’s first electric Street View car</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yo0Hgo"&gt;Google finally has its first all-electric vehicle for capturing Street View. The tech giant and Jaguar Land Rover announced today that they have collaborated to rig up an all-electric I-Pace SUV with the equipment required to capture Street View imagery, and deployed the car in Dublin, Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ii5hbB"&gt;The I-Pace will also collect more general Google Maps data, and it will be outfitted with air quality sensors from Aclima — something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/29/9067171/street-view-car-air-quality-detection-google-aclima"&gt;Google has done with its Street View cars for the better part of the last decade&lt;/a&gt;. The I-Pace will collect “street-by-street air quality” data in Dublin, measuring nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions, as well as fine particles. Google will make the data available to the Dublin City Council.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philo is the latest live TV streaming service to get a price hike</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ezTqVe"&gt;Philo has become the latest live TV option for cord-cutters hoping to skirt cable contracts to get a price bump — but there’s a workaround for current subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ja9dwm"&gt;Beginning June 8th, Philo’s monthly subscription cost for incoming customers will hike to $25 from $20. But those who are subscribed to the service before that date will be able to keep their plans at the current cost with no change, Philo CEO Andrew McCollum said in a Tuesday &lt;a href="https://blog.philo.com/posts/package-and-price-changes"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s blog. To offset the price increase, Philo will be increasing its unlimited DVR storage period to a full year, up from 30 days, and existing customers who’d like to upgrade their storage will be able to bump up to the new price tier if they so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QueStn"&gt;McCollum cited an...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA for US Congresspeople: Please do not enter your phone’s passcode on TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 looks great. The new design feels both modern and classic." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fIM4IFgjVzP_Qy-U19nbpKnIROA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341948/vpavic_4243_20201017_0088.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jn082c"&gt;Hello again, it has come to my attention that Republican Senator Ted Cruz and I are in perfect alignment on one issue: if you enter your iPhone passcode on live TV, you need to change the passcode. This means you &lt;em&gt;in particular&lt;/em&gt;, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEq677"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I recognize it’s happened before.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P7yehk"&gt;I honestly didn’t think anyone needed to explain this, particularly since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/10/11/17964848/kanye-west-iphone-passcode-trump-iplane-apple-meeting"&gt;Kanye West accidentally revealed his passcode&lt;/a&gt; (000000, in case you are curious) during a video with then-president Donald Trump in 2018. But here we are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rfd31R"&gt;If you are a member of the US federal government, you are a desirable target for all kinds of hackers, most of whom do not have your best interests at heart. Your phone stores a lot of sensitive data about where you...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon workers demand company quit polluting near communities of color</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7AOxgGDXM8Y7mSCdYiOjxTjy2J8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341910/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qa8Zu1"&gt;Hundreds of Amazon tech workers are pressuring Amazon to quit polluting — especially in  communities near its warehouses. More than 600 workers signed a &lt;a href="https://secure.everyaction.com/Xsul4-F6BUuVi_MofTP5YA2"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; asking Amazon to bring its pollution down to zero by 2030. They also called on the company to prioritize deploying zero-emissions technologies near the communities hit hardest by Amazon’s pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJCvMJ"&gt;The petition was started after Amazon rejected a shareholder resolution asking the company to report how much pollution it emits in communities of color. Amazon says the proposal was similar to a resolution that was voted down by shareholders last year. Amazon’s annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for May 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCVx00"&gt;Amazon’s warehouses have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611862/satellite-images-online-shopping-growing-footprint-warehouses"&gt;mushroomed&lt;/a&gt; around working-class communities...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government decides pipeline cybersecurity ought to be regulated</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NgPfut"&gt;The hack of the Colonial Pipeline — which kneecapped oil availability on the East Coast for almost two weeks — was as disastrous as it was likely preventable. A branch of the Department of Homeland Security, however, is hoping to correct course by changing the rules on cybersecurity and disclosure for Colonial and other companies in the pipeline industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmsd94"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/25/colonial-hack-pipeline-dhs-cybersecurity/"&gt;As reported b&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Transportation Security Administration (yes, the same sub-branch of DHS everyone associates with taking their shoes off in airports) will be requiring pipeline companies to report breaches and other cybersecurity incidents, with additional rules on how to keep these critical infrastructure systems secure from digital threats arriving “in coming...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wow, investors actually just gave Turntable.fm $7.5 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSMmWn0_-1yoYZopGyGKD4Bg7sE=/0x47:2120x1460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341610/Screen_Shot_2021_05_25_at_11.25.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A9Rsfs"&gt;Turntable.fm, the social platform that lets people collaboratively build and perform DJ sets, has raised $7.5 million in venture capital funding, &lt;a href="https://blog.turntable.fm/im-super-excited-to-announce-that-turntable-has-raised-7-5-b3f676b90c0d"&gt;according to a Medium post&lt;/a&gt; by CEO Billy Chasen. Turntable.fm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313793/turntable-fm-return-two-versions-original"&gt;was revived by Chasen&lt;/a&gt; as a response to the pandemic, after it shut down in 2013. But it’s not the &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;version of Turntable in the works now, which makes that funding more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8C3KvX"&gt;The investment was led by the Andreessen Horowitz firm, also known as a16z, which has invested in products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261435/elon-musk-clubhouse-podcasts-robinhood"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, Coinbase, and Robinhood. The list of investors also includes Seth Goldstein, who was a co-founder and investor for the original incarnation of Turntable.fm in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwXqki"&gt;While Turntable.fm is being run by its original creator, another...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The greenest team in esports now has the perfect logo</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HPwsLi"&gt;For the last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132970/flyquest-league-of-legends-esports-treequest"&gt;FlyQuest has been on a mission&lt;/a&gt;. Though the team competes in the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; Championship Series, it has steadily become as known for its socially conscious efforts as its in-game performances. The team launched initiatives centered on &lt;a href="https://flyquest.gg/treequest/"&gt;planting trees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://flyquest.gg/seaquest/"&gt;donating to a coral reef foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://flyquest.gg/mequest/"&gt;improving mental health&lt;/a&gt;. But for FlyQuest CEO Tricia Sugita, the process was always a bit incomplete. “While we were doing those actions, a part of it always felt missing,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Because what was lagging behind was our design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="st3gW0"&gt;Today, FlyQuest is revealing a brand-new logo meant to invoke its focus on everything green. It’s a fairly simple design: a straightforward “Q” with a leaf in the middle. Despite this...&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it’s the fans, USB ports, headphone jack, power button, or speakers, &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; says virtually any repairs to the new desktop require battling through Apple’s adhesives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jf3GVX"&gt;Like the other M1 Macs, everything is soldered together now — so there’s no upgrading RAM or internal storage even if you do crack it open. The good news is if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; go through the effort of cracking it open, &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; says most of the other internal parts (including the ports, webcam, and speakers) are relatively easy to swap out with replacements. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla is already shipping cars without radar sensors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ngO4ykV_s4xtvRqfTYhumvViVN0=/848x1062:3175x2613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341548/0x0_Model_Y_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0hmzcv"&gt;Tesla has &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/transitioning-tesla-vision"&gt;stopped building forward-facing radar sensors&lt;/a&gt; into its Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs in North America, after CEO Elon Musk publicly expressed a desire to rely on cameras to power the company’s advanced driver assistance system, Autopilot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyFUSy"&gt;Tesla has been developing the vision-based version of Autopilot during the limited beta test of its “Full Self-Driving” software. But it’s not completely done making sure Autopilot works without the radar sensor, though, as it is limiting or disabling some features on these vehicles for an indefinite amount of time. Autosteer — the Autopilot feature that can keep a Tesla centered in a lane, even around curves — will only be usable at 75 miles per hour and below. Tesla is also only making it...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Report: Valve is secretly building a Switch-esque portable gaming PC </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;An early version of the Steam Controller.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQIKF6"&gt;Nearly a decade after introducing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17190394/valve-steam-machines-steamos-section-hidden-pc-gaming-living-room"&gt;an ill-fated line&lt;/a&gt; of Linux gaming PCs dubbed “Steam Machines,” PC gaming giant Valve is &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/exclusive-valve-is-making-a-switch-like-portable-gaming-pc/"&gt;reportedly trying its hand at hardware again&lt;/a&gt; — with its own handheld gaming computer a la the Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWeogu"&gt;That’s the word &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/exclusive-valve-is-making-a-switch-like-portable-gaming-pc/"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;’s Sam Machkovech&lt;/a&gt;, who claims to have multiple sources attesting that Valve has been working on such a device: a touchscreen, touchpad, button, trigger, and dual-joystick-equipped portable that’ll likely run Linux and an array of specially optimized Steam titles. It should have the ability to dock, a la Nintendo Switch, via a USB-C port, too. &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;suggests it could arrive as soon as the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blzr6e"&gt;It appears to be called SteamPal, or Neptune, according to &lt;a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/blob/3d8e7591e4464298b89c98d72a6c1b4a697db9af/ClientExtracted/steamui/6.js"&gt;a recent code...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
