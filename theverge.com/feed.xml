  &lt;p id="wMt3Ur"&gt;DoorDash is &lt;a href="https://doordash.news/2021/11/03/doordash-launches-safedash/"&gt;adding a set of tools for its delivery workers called “SafeDash,”&lt;/a&gt; which includes a way to contact an agent from the ADT security company or to call 911 through ADT. The company is first launching the tool in major cities like Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, but says it’ll roll out to all its US couriers by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYPydm"&gt;While it’s good that DoorDash is acknowledging the dangers its delivery workers face, some advocates say that SafeDash won’t help solve the problems of thieves targeting them for their money or bikes, and the apps giving them routes that put them in harm’s way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UXgXK"&gt;According to DoorDash, SafeDash will give delivery workers a button that will have an ADT agent call them if they feel...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="9yY9yT"&gt;Riot Games’ &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Teamfight Tactics&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Legends of Runeterra&lt;/em&gt; are now available to download from the Epic Games Store, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/riot-games-brings-league-of-legends-valorant-and-more-to-epic-games-store"&gt;the two companies announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. They’re free to download and play, just like they are from Riot. When you get them from the Epic Games Store, your computer will install the Riot Client, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679479/riot-games-new-client-pc-launcher-library"&gt;Riot’s new unified launcher&lt;/a&gt;, which is where you can actually install and launch the individual games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yVeeO"&gt;This isn’t the first time Epic has offered a way to get another company’s launcher; you’ve been able to download the Itch.io launcher from the Epic Games Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22395997/epic-games-store-pc-apps-windows-store-brave-discord-itch"&gt;since April&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Surprise! Facebook’s climate denial problem got worse this year </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z3ZvcR"&gt;As world leaders scramble to forge global agreements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/30/22753391/glasgow-climate-change-summit-cop-26-covid-restrictions"&gt;in Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; this month in a last-ditch effort to avert the worst of the climate crisis, there’s a threat to meaningful climate action lurking on social media. Climate denial on Facebook has gotten even worse this year, according to a new &lt;a href="https://stopfundingheat.info/facebook-in-denial/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by climate advocacy group Stop Funding Heat and the Real Facebook Oversight Board, a watchdog group made up of academics, journalists, and activists. It’s evidence that Facebook’s efforts to stomp out lies about climate change are failing, the study’s authors say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJd5V2"&gt;Reactions, comments, and shares per post from Facebook pages and groups dedicated to spreading climate misinformation jumped a whopping 77 percent since January, the report found....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Flex drivers will start getting checks for $60 million in withheld tips</title>

  &lt;p id="EeD01z"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission will send out more than $60 million to drivers for Amazon’s Flex program, representing tip money that the commission says was illegally withheld.&lt;/p&gt;

The highest back payout going to a single driver is more than $28,000, while the average repayment is $422. Nearly 20,000 drivers will receive checks for more than $600, the FTC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSmweo"&gt;Drivers are expected to receive their tips before January 7th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twelve South’s new Apple Watch sweatband doesn’t work with every watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twelve South’s new ActionBand for Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twelve South&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CZRMxW"&gt;One of the defining features of the Apple Watch is the vast number of bands you can buy to make it fit your needs and style. That can be particularly useful for workouts. You might not want to wear a leather band during a long run, but you can easily swap in bands made of other materials that can better withstand sweat. If you’ve been looking for a full-on wrist sweatband to use alongside your Apple Watch, though, accessories maker Twelve South now has you covered with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch%3Futm_source%3DKlaviyo%26utm_medium%3Dcampaign-email%26utm_campaign%3DActionBand%2520Apple%2520Watch%2520Launch%2520%25282021-11-04%2529%26utm_content%3DProduct%2520Launch%26_kx%3DWNYk2ScXZZeZl25hceRvBiPt-VjkAjdGEPkerJ_q6N-dP4mjJhn-rRC0jGSKN8OD.MWj2bN&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ActionBand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch%3Futm_source%3DKlaviyo%26utm_medium%3Dcampaign-email%26utm_campaign%3DActionBand%2520Apple%2520Watch%2520Launch%2520%25282021-11-04%2529%26utm_content%3DProduct%2520Launch%26_kx%3DWNYk2ScXZZeZl25hceRvBiPt-VjkAjdGEPkerJ_q6N-dP4mjJhn-rRC0jGSKN8OD.MWj2bN&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; for Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PglZr"&gt;The ActionBand is a terry cotton band that sits tight on your wrist and has a frame for you to slot in the watch part of your Apple Watch. The frame is designed in such a way to let you access the Digital Crown and the watch’s side button,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft warns Windows 11 features are failing due to its expired certificate</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pZHyn0"&gt;Microsoft has started warning Windows 11 users that certain features in the operating system are failing to load due to an expired certificate. The certificate expired on October 31st, and Microsoft warns that some Windows 11 users aren’t able to open apps like the Snipping Tool, touch keyboard, or emoji panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imJv8p"&gt;A patch is available to fix some of the issues, but it’s currently in preview, meaning you have to install it manually from Windows Update. The patch, &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-21-2021-kb5006746-os-build-22000-282-preview-03190705-0960-4ba4-9ee8-af40bef057d3"&gt;KB4006746&lt;/a&gt;, will fix the touch keyboard, voice typing, emoji panel, and issues with the getting started and tips sections of Windows 11. You’ll be able to find this patch by checking for updates in the Windows Update section of Settings in Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet is launching a company that uses AI for drug discovery</title>

  &lt;p id="X7ReMi"&gt;A new Alphabet company will use artificial intelligence methods for drug discovery, Google’s parent company &lt;a href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/blog"&gt;announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll build off of the work done by DeepMind, another Alphabet subsidiary that has done groundbreaking work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22586578/deepmind-alphafold-ai-protein-folding-human-proteome-released-for-free"&gt;using AI to predict the structure of proteins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81Rhb0"&gt;The new company, called Isomorphic Laboratories, will leverage that success to build tools that can help identify new pharmaceuticals. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis will also serve as the CEO for Isomorphic, but the two companies will stay separate and collaborate occasionally, a spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mS2A8"&gt;For years, experts have pointed to AI as a way to make it faster and cheaper to find new medications to treat various conditions. AI could help scan through...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0PF6tG"&gt;Square &lt;a href="https://cash.app/13+"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that people over 13 years old can use Cash App to deposit and spend money or send it to friends. The app was previously only available to people aged 18 or older, and while minors will have to get their parent or guardians’ permission to use the app (and that parent-figure will have significant oversight), they’ll still be able to use some of the app’s most popular features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ic8Dyc"&gt;Teens won’t be able to do just &lt;em&gt;anything &lt;/em&gt;with Cash App, though — they won’t have access to the investing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1455944391604850689"&gt;or Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; features, despite Jack Dorsey’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617551/jack-dorsey-bitcoin-unite-country-world-peace-cryptocurrency"&gt;passion for crypto&lt;/a&gt;, and Square says they won’t be able to deposit checks. That last one really feels like a missed trick, as I remember getting a lot of checks as gifts or payments for odd jobs as a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and AT&amp;T delay crucial 5G expansion over aircraft interference concerns</title>

  &lt;p id="MR2uYu"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are delaying the rollout of their wider 5G networks after the Federal Aviation Administration warned that the new wireless technology could interfere with the safety systems of some aircraft, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-verizon-to-delay-5g-rollout-over-faas-airplane-safety-concerns-11636039555"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBNlyf"&gt;The two companies planned to light up new 5G networks that use so-called “C-band” frequencies on December 5th. That rollout will now be delayed until at least January 5th, the companies said Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQLr73"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T still currently offer ultra-fast 5G connectivity in specific areas using high-band millimeter-wave technology and much slower 5G over low-band frequencies. But the two companies have been banking on using the C-band — which covers midrange frequencies with good-to-great speed — to...&lt;/p&gt;
