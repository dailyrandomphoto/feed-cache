    <title>Twitter may be close to launching Super Follows, as new research shows what it could look like </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;A mockup of what Twitter Super Follows could look like | Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tv6uOu"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; it was working on a Super Follows feature that would allow some users to charge followers and give them access to extra content. On Sunday, app researcher Jane Manchun Wong tweeted screenshots of what she says it will look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J48vGm"&gt;According to Wong’s research, which is typically very &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437690/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets"&gt;accurate&lt;/a&gt;, the Super Follows program will be limited to Twitter users with at least 10,000 followers, who have posted at least 25 tweets within the past 30 days, and are at least 18 years old. As Twitter has referenced, one of the main features of Super Follows will be bonus content, such as exclusive tweets for Super Followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEG7nN"&gt;Wong also discovered a list of content categories that Super Follows users would choose from to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple heads into developer conference under more scrutiny than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5_f6blu4byEVOq4Ae1XSs1u-Jmo=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69413334/wwdc_scrutiny.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z1fpLh"&gt;Apple needs a distraction, and it needs one fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kv4Hd"&gt;On Monday, the company will hold its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple-wwdc"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt;) during one of the most fraught moments for developer relations in Apple history. While Apple emerged from the Epic v. Apple trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452035/epic-apple-antitrust-trial-final-arguments"&gt;in a seemingly strong legal position&lt;/a&gt;, its reputation took a body blow. Evidence revealed the company &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments"&gt;“treat every developer the same”&lt;/a&gt; — it cut special deals with big companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;like Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and Hulu and made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;arbitrary&lt;/a&gt;, cutthroat decisions to lock competition out and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;lock users in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zUWB7"&gt;Developers have known or suspected these things for years, and at first, online reactions seemed muted. This is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18647249/wwdc-apple-parental-control-app-store-mdm-spotify-moderation-developers-2019"&gt;third year&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;in a row&lt;/a&gt; that the shadow of antitrust regulation has hung over...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Roadrunner, Black Widow, Reminiscence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Anthony Bourdain" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1-qP2aniZOzOuPc9L3W-I_fFtSc=/0x31:3000x2031/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69413330/620646350.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A trailer for the new documentary about the late Anthony Bourdain, &lt;em&gt;Roadrunner&lt;/em&gt;, is among this week’s titles. | Photo by Mike Pont/WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ouZPx"&gt;It hit me this morning that there is no new episode of &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; on this evening and I felt a little sad, but wow what a finale. Emmys for Kate Winslet and Julianne Nicholson, please (and be sure to read Sophie Gilbert’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/05/mare-easttown-hbo-finale/619055/"&gt;excellent analysis in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the way women and mothers were centered in this very good series). I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; correctly predict who the killer was (but ICYMI, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1399097288677638152?s=20"&gt;Stephen King did&lt;/a&gt; and don’t click that link if you haven’t watched the finale because obvs, spoiler). All this is to say I am in the market for a new show so I just started &lt;em&gt;Hacks&lt;/em&gt; and can’t wait for the &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; premiere on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFjD4I"&gt;The (unintentional) theme(s) for this week’s trailers roundup: Memories and nostalgia. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil doesn’t plan to upgrade its existing watches to the new Wear OS </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fossil&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvt3Ci"&gt;Fossil executives Greg McKelvey and Steve Prokup &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fossil-is-planning-a-premium-google-watch-for-fall/"&gt;said in an interview with CNET&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s existing Wear OS watches won’t get upgraded to the new combined Wear software platform from Samsung and Google. Instead, Fossil is planning a premium watch that Prokup said would have “pretty major hardware upgrades,” and existing watches will probably be discounted as budget options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgL86r"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;CNET,&lt;/em&gt; Fossil’s Gen 6 watch should have features similar to upcoming watches from Google and Samsung, with faster performance, longer battery life, new chips, and LTE cellular options. “All of the software benefits that Google’s talking about and launching with the unified platform is something we’ll be building into that as well,” McKelvey said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wq5AdK"&gt;Twitter is suspended “indefinitely” in Nigeria, “for the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence,” according to a statement (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FMICNigeria/status/1400843062641717249?s=20"&gt;threaded on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) from the country’s minister of information and culture.

&lt;p id="PNfuo1"&gt;On Saturday, the office of Nigeria’s attorney general and ministry of justice said it would arrest and prosecute anyone who tried to get around the block, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/05/africa/nigeria-prosecute-twitter-users-intl/index.html"&gt;CNN reported&lt;/a&gt;, and directed government agencies to cooperate with prosecutors “to ensure the speedy prosecution of offenders without any further delay.” Several news...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3oO9u"&gt;The US Department of Justice has charged a Latvian woman for her role in allegedly developing the Trickbot malware, which was responsible for infecting millions of computers, targeting schools, hospitals, public utilities, and governments, the agency said &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization"&gt;in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3106W"&gt;The DOJ alleges that Alla Witte was part of a criminal organization known as the Trickbot Group that operated in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Suriname. She allegedly helped develop the malware which was used to enable ransomware demands and payments. Victims would receive a notice that their computers were encrypted, the DOJ said, and were directed to buy special software through a bitcoin address linked to the Trickbot Group to have their files decrypted. &lt;/p&gt;

The hack led to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443933/colonial-pipeline-ransom-4-million-hack-gas-shortage"&gt;ransomware payout of $4.4 million&lt;/a&gt;, and resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-gas-prices-hit-3-a-gallon-as-shortage-sets-in-amid-colonial-pipeline-shutdown-11620832180"&gt;gas prices around $3 per gallon&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in several years at US gas stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTOhAS"&gt;According to cybersecurity firm Mandiant, the VPN account didn’t use multi-factor authentication, which allowed the hackers to access Colonial’s network with a compromised username and password. It’s not clear whether the hackers discovered the username or were able to figure it out independently. The password was discovered among a batch of passwords leaked on the dark web, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7TtaW"&gt;The breach occurred...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NwdI3B"&gt;The California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) &lt;a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M387/K064/387064893.PDF"&gt;said Friday&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) it has authorized General Motors-owned self-driving vehicle company Cruise to provide driverless passenger service to the public in its robotaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNdgvL"&gt;The CPUC said Cruise is the first entrant in its driverless pilot program, which lets companies give test rides in vehicles without drivers. Under the terms of the program, Cruise may not charge passengers for the rides, and the company must submit quarterly reports to the CPUC about the vehicles’ operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xk04DI"&gt;Cruise has been testing its driverless vehicles in San Francisco, and last month &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-waymo-cruise-seek-permits-charge-self-driving-car-rides-san-francisco-2021-05-11/"&gt;applied for a permit&lt;/a&gt; that will allow the company to charge for autonomous rides and deliveries in the area. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;unveiled its Cruise...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
