    <title>Microsoft made a giant climate pledge one year ago — here’s where it’s at now</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iDzTqO"&gt;One year after pledging to remove all of its historic and future planet-heating emissions within a few decades, Microsoft says it has already slashed its carbon footprint by 6 percent. It’s an incremental change that’s in line with what’s needed globally to address the climate crisis, but there is a whole lot of work left for Microsoft to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="cCwnfF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There is a whole lot of work left for Microsoft to do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QmvLM1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068799/microsoft-carbon-capture-climate-change"&gt;Last January&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft pledged to do something that, at the time, was pretty unheard-of: it planned to become carbon &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; by 2030. That gave the company a deadline to capture more planet-heating carbon dioxide than it emits. Not only would it target future emissions, but the company also pledged that, by 2050, it would remove the equivalent...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is testing clips on live streams and VODs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3XqbaSQbtRVshlRyA2KsN3hgY4=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735325/youtube.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xVCqa1"&gt;YouTube &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/95526465"&gt;is introducing clipping&lt;/a&gt; — the ability to make short clips of live streams or videos — starting today with a small group of creators. Those clips can be anywhere between five and 60 seconds in length and will have a new URL associated with them. Creators and viewers will be able to create clips by clicking on the clip icon, though the feature is currently limited to desktop and Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9LNE4"&gt;It’s a smart move from YouTube, because clipping is something of a live-streaming industry standard. You can more easily share live video content via a short video clip that can be passed around social media, rather than requiring viewers to skim through a potentially hourslong stream. Every platform from Twitch to the dearly departed site...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AOC and others call for investigation into Robinhood’s GameStop freeze</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zLwuX8"&gt;Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) called on Congress to investigate the Robinhood app after it banned small investors from buying stock in companies like GameStop. Over the last week, Reddit users have rushed to buy the bemoaned video game retailer’s stock, inflating its price in what some are calling the “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1352683263001812992?s=20"&gt;squeeze of a lifetime&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eg8HrC"&gt;In a Thursday tweet, Ocasio-Cortez called Robinhood’s decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock in companies like GameStop and Blackberry “unacceptable,” and that’d she’d “support a hearing if necessary.” Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the House Financial Services Committee, which &lt;a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/about/jurisdiction.htm"&gt;has jurisdiction to oversee the stock market&lt;/a&gt; and “securities and exchanges” more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple retakes second place in smartphone shipment rankings as sanctions bite Huawei</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pesyUj"&gt;Apple overtook Huawei to reclaim its spot as the second-bestselling smartphone manufacturer in the world in 2020, according to new research reports from &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-shipped-record-iphones-q4-2020-global-smartphone-market-continues-recover/"&gt;Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-shipment-Q4-2020"&gt;Canalys&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung was still the leading seller in terms of number of smartphones shipped, while Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo took the next three spots, according to Counterpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwdPw2"&gt;It was just under a year ago that the same research analysts reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114885/huawei-overtakes-apple-2019-analysts-strategy-analytics-counterpoint-research-canalys"&gt;Huawei had overtaken Apple&lt;/a&gt; to take second place in 2019. But since then, US trade sanctions seem to have hit Huawei hard. The Chinese company’s smartphone shipments were 21 percent lower in 2020 compared to 2019, according to Counterpoint, and Huawei dropped out of the top five entirely in the fourth quarter of the...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Smd00e"&gt;In the wake of Robinhood’s surprise trading block, a new class of Reddit investors are looking for apps that will let them plow their money into their favorite stocks. On Thursday morning, Robinhood announced that it would temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;block investors&lt;/a&gt; from purchasing or trading companies including GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond, and Nokia, all of which have been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;unexpected rallies over the past few days&lt;/a&gt;. But for the online communities that fueled those rallies, the block is being treated as an outright betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLCypZ"&gt;Discussion about switching ramped up on Twitter and in investment discords after Robinhood halted buying and trading on stock, citing “recent volatility” in the market with the aforementioned stock as...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With Parler down, QAnon moves onto a ‘free speech’ TikTok clone</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7b6NKq"&gt;After this month’s deadly attack at the Capitol, QAnon has been widely banished from the internet. Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have all banned Q-related content, and the right’s favored platform, Parler, has been forced offline for weeks. But it hasn’t all disappeared. A new platform called Clapper, a “free-speech” TikTok clone, is becoming a home for QAnon followers.         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kD5LiA"&gt;Clapper launched last July as a “Free Speech Short Video” app — it’s basically TikTok, but the company promises a lot less moderation. In the six months since its launch, the app has been downloaded over half a million times, with a considerable amount of that growth coming in just the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Yjqtb"&gt;Once you download Clapper, you can start scrolling through a...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="u1gqgv"&gt;In Steve Gaynor’s attic, there is a box that does not belong to him. He bought his Portland home from a family who put the house up for sale after the death of its elderly owner. Months later, Gaynor and his wife discovered a cardboard box full of letters and other artifacts from a stranger’s life. “There was this backstory about this person who had been part of this family that was all contained inside this one cardboard box,” Gaynor said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcJsyK"&gt;It’s an anecdote almost too good to be believed: a co-founder of Fullbright, a studio known for pioneering “walking sim” games, living out his very own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/15/4621514/gone-home-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-style adventure.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H0ZI1U"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board has issued its first round of rulings, upholding one removal and overturning four decisions involving hate speech, nudity, and misinformation. Together, the rulings take an expansive view of what users can post under the current policies, based on concerns about vague rules and protecting freedom of expression online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l94zG4"&gt;The Oversight Board — composed of experts outside Facebook — accepted its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755133/facebook-oversight-board-supreme-court-first-cases-hate-speech-pandemic-misinformation"&gt;first set of cases&lt;/a&gt; in December. While the original slate included six incidents, a user in one case &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-KBHZS8BL/"&gt;proactively deleted their post&lt;/a&gt;, rendering the decision moot. Facebook has pledged to follow its rulings within seven days and respond to recommendations for new policies within 30 days. &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/responding-to-the-oversight-boards-first-decisions/"&gt;In a response to the rulings&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook...&lt;/p&gt;
