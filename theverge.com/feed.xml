    <title>Amazon changed traffic light timing during union drive, county officials say</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WmH8Xl"&gt;As part of its ongoing fight over an Alabama warehouse’s efforts to unionize, Amazon reportedly changed the timing of a traffic light outside the warehouse, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1361819139866828803"&gt;according to reporting by &lt;em&gt;More Perfect Union&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Union organizers at the site had previously accused the company of altering the timing so that pro-union workers would not be able to canvass workers while stopped at the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWIu8Y"&gt;Until recently, the altered timing on the traffic light outside the factory had been dismissed as a rumor. But &lt;em&gt;More Perfect Union&lt;/em&gt; confirmed with Jefferson County officials that last year, Amazon notified the county of traffic delays during shift changes and asked for the light to be changed. On December 15th, the county increased the green light duration in an...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maps show ZIP codes hit hardest by COVID-19 have low vaccination rates</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oDmNp7"&gt;From the start of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, experts &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/addressing-racial-equity-vaccine-distribution/"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that it would take careful attention to make sure it was distributed equitably. Making sure non-white and poorer communities had access to life-saving vaccines would be an issue of justice and a public health necessity. Throughout 2020, these groups had &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22252693/covid-19-deaths-us-who-died"&gt;higher rates of death&lt;/a&gt; and disease from the virus than &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/health-equity/data-10-cities-show-covid-19-impact-based-poverty-race"&gt;white and wealthy&lt;/a&gt; people, so protecting them would be key to the overall goal of using vaccines to save the most lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TAIBy"&gt;Despite those warnings, the COVID-10 vaccination campaign got off to a rough and unequal start. By the middle of January, when 17 states were reporting race and ethnicity data, analyses showed that Black and Hispanic people were vaccinated at &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/early-state-vaccination-data-raise-warning-flags-racial-equity/"&gt;lower rates...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All Your Base Are Belong To Us has turned 20 </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5HPFC5"&gt;As of yesterday, it’s been 20 years since “All Your Base Are Belong To Us” was uploaded to Newgrounds. Let that sink in. And while you’re doing that, &lt;a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/11940"&gt;feel free to watch the video in its entirety there&lt;/a&gt;, too. It’s been kept safe in a Flash-emulating container, so even now, it’s safe from the inconvenient fact that Flash has been discontinued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oF1XyS"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/get-ready-to-feel-old-the-all-your-base-music-video-turns-20-today/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, the history of the “All Your Base” video is longer than just a single upload. Much of it is taken from a tiny GIF of the Mega Drive game &lt;em&gt;Zero Wing&lt;/em&gt;, which had been circulating widely online because of its disastrous English translation (and the GIF itself existed because of early emulation culture). “Early Internet communities poked fun at the sequence by creating and sharing...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York State is suing Amazon for alleged worker safety failures during COVID-19</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JiIBG7"&gt;New York Attorney General Letitia James &lt;a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=muvelgaOEvSt6Yc1gGqzAg=="&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Amazon in the state’s supreme court on Tuesday, claiming the company failed to protect its workers early on in the COVID-19 pandemic and also retaliated against employees who voiced concerns over what they felt were inadequate safety measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5kD9o"&gt;The news, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/technology/amazon-new-york-lawsuit-covid.html"&gt;reported yesterday by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, follows Amazon’s decision earlier this month to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279819/amazon-new-york-ag-state-lawsuit-covid-19-warehouse-conditions-pandemic"&gt;preemptively sue the New York AG’s office&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to prevent James from bringing charges, doing so by trying to have jurisdiction over its workplace safety measures in New York be deemed a federal issue not within the purview of the state AG. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First trailer for Disney’s live-action Cruella movie feels more Joker than 101 Dalmatians</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lM5qY275OBC-aIHh_O1SOWK0NiM=/97x0:1207x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830012/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_8.59.58_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o7tWpw"&gt;There’s a moment in the first trailer for Disney’s live-action &lt;em&gt;Cruella &lt;/em&gt;movie when Emma Stone utters in a terrible faux British accent, “I am woman, hear me roar.” It feels less like something Disney fans will remember from the iconic &lt;em&gt;101 Dalmatians &lt;/em&gt;villain, Cruella de Vil, and more like Jared Leto’s Joker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22278944/zack-snyder-justice-league-official-premiere-trailer-hbo-max"&gt;telling Batman, “We live in a society.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0MSzZ"&gt;All of which is to say that Disney may have found its own Joker-type character in Stone’s Cruella de Vil... but not necessarily in a good way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNrujM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella &lt;/em&gt;is set in 1970s London. Stone plays the soon-to-be-villain in an origin story of sorts. She’s an aspiring punk designer — and a grifter — who is trying to get society’s wealthiest people to take notice of her and her designs. Throughout the...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="YzE2tQ"&gt;Ecobee has updated its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221291/ecobee-smartcamera-haven-security-platorm-smart-home-price-specs-features"&gt;SmartCamera home security camera&lt;/a&gt; with a few new features that make it easier to use as a baby monitor. The new Baby Monitor mode, which is enabled during setup of the camera, adjusts the camera’s settings to dim the LED lights on the front, makes it harder to accidentally enable the camera’s Siren alarm, and, perhaps most importantly, adds an audio-only streaming option that lets you continue to listen for disruptions even if you switch to a different app or lock your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHzDF9"&gt;Using a home security camera as a baby monitor is hardly a new idea, but this is the first one to my knowledge that actually makes it easier to do so. While traditional video monitors provide an always-on feed to a dedicated screen, home...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="8UMJyH"&gt;If you’re into gaming, you’ll want to know that Nintendo is hosting a 50-minute live stream today that it calls Nintendo Direct, and the company will focus on games coming to the Switch in 2021. This is the first time the company has hosted a full-fledged Nintendo Direct live stream &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20850031/nintendo-direct-switch-seven-biggest-announcements-news-super-smash-snes-overwatch"&gt;since September 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZlig5"&gt;Nintendo already confirmed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1361676737730519042"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that it would be announcing information on &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,&lt;/em&gt; but it did not offer any hints, though there’s a good chance we’ll be hearing about a new character for &lt;a href="https://smashbros.nintendo.com/buy/dlc/"&gt;the game’s second Fighter Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, the live stream will focus on games coming to Nintendo Switch “in the first half of 2021,” leaving fans to speculate what could be shown during the...&lt;/p&gt;
