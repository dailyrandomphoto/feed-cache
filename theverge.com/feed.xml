    <title>Unplug your WD My Book Live, or you might find your drive’s data wiped</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4tdizQ"&gt;If you own a WD My Book Live NAS, you should immediately disconnect it from your network — users have discovered that their data has seemingly been deleted off the device, with no action on their part (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/mass-data-wipe-in-my-book-devices-prompts-warning-from-western-digital/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://community.wd.com/t/action-required-on-my-book-live-and-my-book-live-duo/268147"&gt;a post on its community forum&lt;/a&gt;, WD says that the data loss appears to be the result of “malicious software,” and advises any My Book Live or My Book Live Duo owners to disconnect their devices from the internet to protect their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxKiEm"&gt;Some users &lt;a href="https://community.wd.com/t/help-all-data-in-mybook-live-gone-and-owner-password-unknown/268111/19"&gt;on WD’s forum&lt;/a&gt; report that their devices appear to have been factory reset, while others report seeing &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wd-my-book-nas-devices-are-being-remotely-wiped-clean-worldwide/"&gt;a page requesting a password they don’t know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cw6GnB"&gt;In most cases, those who have been affected say that all of the data on the device appears to be gone, with their file structure...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is now a $2 trillion company</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RHpggulYAV5s2Sl9zHRYerqXS98=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501756/vpavic_180502_2536_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZaDnTb"&gt;Microsoft can add &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/24/microsoft-closes-above-2-trillion-for-first-time"&gt;ending the day as a $2 trillion company&lt;/a&gt; to the list of things it’s accomplished today, alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;announcing Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. That makes it the second American publicly traded company ever to have a market capitalization of over $2 trillion (the other member of the club being Apple, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;which achieved it in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/tech/microsoft-2-trillion-market-cap/index.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkPpPq"&gt;It’s easy to see how 2020 contributed to Microsoft’s success: the PC market &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;grew by over 10 percent in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, according to estimates from IDC and Canalys, and seems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380920/pc-market-q1-growth-year-over-year-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;to have kept some of that momentum&lt;/a&gt; this year. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334725/microsoft-q4-2020-earnings-azure-surface-xbox-gains-growth-profits-sales"&gt;also saw success&lt;/a&gt; with with its Surface devices, Xbox content, and cloud services — the company says its Intelligent Cloud segment &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2FInvestor%2Fearnings%2FFY-2020-Q4%2Fsegment-revenues" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;brought in $48 billion alone&lt;/a&gt; in its...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit recovers from major outage </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQ2APLAogSFb5qS1A8E_IMBtVnM=/81x67:1151x780/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501469/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_3.20.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit’s error page.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y7awr5"&gt;Reddit was down for many on Thursday, but the company has implemented a fix and the site seems to be working normally. While the outage was going on, Reddit would regularly take a while to try to load a page before showing an error screen with error code 503. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ic34n1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.redditstatus.com/"&gt;On its status page&lt;/a&gt;, Reddit first reported an “elevated level of API errors” at 5:04PM ET Thursday, but &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/reddit/"&gt;Downdetector showed&lt;/a&gt; a huge spike of user reports of problems shortly after. (At their peak, reports surpassed 40,000.) At 6:51PM ET, Reddit said a fix was being implemented, and at 7:18PM ET, &lt;a href="https://www.redditstatus.com/incidents/3710db57k6n8"&gt;Reddit said the fix was in place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is supporting AMD’s answer to DLSS on Xbox consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KrgnTG4QrlAonCramQjA-0lTbuI=/142x0:1650x1005/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501671/xboxamdfsr.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fpJH50"&gt;Microsoft is enabling Xbox developers to utilize AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s DLSS on console games. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) appeared recently&lt;/a&gt; on Windows PCs with the aim of boosting frame rates and maintaining image quality. It’s AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and early tests have shown it’s a promising technology that will work across multiple games and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9HLxp"&gt;FSR is now making its way to Xbox games, too. Microsoft has started previewing support for FSR in its Game Development Kit for both Windows and Xbox today. “It’s supported on Windows, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One consoles,” says Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s director of Xbox program management. “FSR was designed to enable developers to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Thermapen One promises to make the best meat thermometer even better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NBID9YftBCio6HIqabguTCZFVOY=/208x0:2197x1326/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501379/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_5.19.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZdZfdl"&gt;The ThermoWorks Thermapen is legendary among chefs as the gold standard in kitchen thermometers, affording the fastest and most reliable temperature readings around. And today, the company has revealed its latest model: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2Fthermapen-one%3Fquantity%3D1%26color%3D16&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F24%2F22548839%2Fthermoworks-one-meat-thermometer-faster-grilling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $105 Thermapen One&lt;/a&gt;, which promises to achieve even faster temperature readings: less than a second (hence the name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTafjq"&gt;ThermoWorks says the new thermometer is the only sub-second instant-read thermometer that can take a “full temperature reading” — technically five full readings in order to reduce uncertainty — without using estimations or predictive algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bd8HEP"&gt;The company says it spent more than five years developing the new thermometer, which features an improved thermocouple system developed in conjunction with...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Baltimore spy plane program was invasion of citizens’ privacy, court rules</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fN6L0i"&gt;The city of Baltimore’s spy plane program was unconstitutional, violating the Fourth Amendment protection against illegal search, and law enforcement in the city cannot use any of the data it gathered, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680040/fourth_circuit_decision_baltimore_june_24_2021.pdf"&gt;a court ruled Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The Aerial Investigation Research (or AIR) program, which used airplanes and high-resolution cameras to record what was happening in a 32-square-mile part of the city, was &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-plane-canceled-20210203-ha3ixtgiyfg4rpgmfftrsd6uwu-story.html"&gt;canceled by the city &lt;/a&gt;in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKTCqd"&gt;Local Black activist groups, with support from the ACLU, sued to prevent Baltimore law enforcement from using any of the data it had collected in the time the program was up and running. The city tried to argue the case was moot since the program had been canceled. That didn’t sit well with civil liberties...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is acquiring a podcast hosting and monetization platform</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cRZYor"&gt;Amazon Music is getting more serious about its podcast endeavors. Today, the company &lt;a href="https://podcasters.amazon.com/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s acquiring Art19, a major podcast hosting and monetization platform for an undisclosed sum. This means Amazon will now have a hand in hosting podcasters’ shows as well as selling ads against them because Art19 operates an ad marketplace that targets and inserts ads into programming. An Amazon Music spokesperson says nothing will immediately change on the Art19 platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfNKJz"&gt;This is a major step for Amazon as it looks to take on a bigger role in the podcasting world. Amazon Music only started offering podcasts in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439531/amazon-music-podcasts-prime-titles"&gt;September last year&lt;/a&gt;, as did Audible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536963/amazon-free-podcast-update-catalog"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. But in the time since, Amazon Music has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22098312/amazon-music-wondery-acquire-buy-podcast-industry"&gt;acquired Wondery&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last major...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft will let devs keep every penny their Windows app makes — unless it’s a game</title>

  &lt;p id="LFZuGI"&gt;As part of its Windows 11 announcements on Thursday, Microsoft revealed &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/"&gt;a major policy change&lt;/a&gt; to incentivize developers to make apps for the Microsoft Store: starting on July 28th, if a developer uses their own or a third-party payment system in their app, Microsoft will let them keep 100 percent of the revenue. But the deal has one important caveat: it doesn’t apply to games, Microsoft confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Uher5"&gt;That omission further muddies the ongoing debate about the differences between an app and a game and app store policies around each — a distinction that is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;core issues&lt;/a&gt; in the ongoing legal battle between &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-maker Epic Games and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKSjej"&gt;Microsoft is largely on the side of apps and games being different because its...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="VeaCGG"&gt;Today’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546829/microsoft-windows-11-event-live-blog-updates-news"&gt;Windows 11 news&lt;/a&gt; is all about where Microsoft sees computing going over the next few years, but it’s just as much the story of how Skype has flourished and ebbed since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/14/2489611/microsoft-skype-deal-complete"&gt;its $8.5 billion acquisition&lt;/a&gt; a decade ago. Five years ago, Skype was the big name in internet calling and video, and Microsoft made it an “inbox app” for Windows 10 that was included at installation and launched at startup by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftAfzH"&gt;Now, after a pandemic year that has had more people using their PCs for voice and video than ever before, Skype was nowhere to be seen in the Windows 11 presentation or materials. Instead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;Microsoft Teams gets a highlight spot&lt;/a&gt; in the new center-aligned taskbar and deep integration into Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11’s Intel-powered Android apps will run on AMD and Arm processors, too</title>

  &lt;p id="Mbafi7"&gt;One of the biggest announcements at today’s Windows 11 reveal was that Microsoft would offer the option to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;run Android apps on its new operating system&lt;/a&gt;, powered by a new “Intel Bridge” compiler that helps those apps run on x86 systems. But despite being an Intel-developed system, Android apps on Windows 11 won’t just be limited to computers with Intel CPUs. AMD and Arm-based processors will also support Android apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyt4a3"&gt;“Intel believes it is important to provide this capability across all x86 platforms and has designed Intel Bridge technology to support all x86 platforms (including AMD platforms),” Intel confirmed in a statement to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Microsoft further corroborated that Android applications will be available for all silicon...&lt;/p&gt;
