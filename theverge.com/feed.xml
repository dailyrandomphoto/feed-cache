    <title>The latest phishing scam to watch out for: fraudulent QR codes on parking meters</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PzC1FZ"&gt;Police in several US cities are warning residents not to pay for their parking using QR codes stuck to parking meters. That’s because these codes have been placed there by scammers, who are using them to direct people to fraudulent sites that capture their payment details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4x9t0U"&gt;Warnings have been issued by law enforcement in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Austin_Police/status/1478122920371232770"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SATXPolice/status/1473025923951775755"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt; over the holiday period (we spotted the story &lt;a href="https://theoverspill.blog/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Overspill&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;). Police say they discovered a number of stickers with illicit codes appearing on parking meters, while a report by local news site &lt;a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2022/01/05/qr-code-scammers-hitting-on-street-parking-in-texas-cities-this-is-what-houston-officials-want-you-to-know/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click2Houston&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows how one of the fraudulent codes directed people to a site promising “quick pay parking.” (The site now appears to be offline.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7nc2t"&gt;Police are advising anyone who inadvertently...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Wordle clones have disappeared from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zZmq0Lstg1m_wcC2YCTG26fErM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377148/VRG_ILLO_4536_001_7.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier today, the App Store was overflowing with games ripping off a viral web app. &lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLIZAP"&gt;Has Apple taken action against apps that cloned the popular web game Wordle? They have now disappeared from the App Store, after &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/psa-wordle-clone-with-annual-subscription-is-the-latest-rip-off-to-hit-the-app-store/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wordle-copycat-app-store-twitter"&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"&gt;including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) called out a flood of copycats so blatant as to be named “Wordle” and that featured the same gameplay and UI, each taking advantage of the fact that developer Josh Wardle didn’t create an Apple app of his own. While we’re still seeing a few clones on the App Store, they don’t use the Wordle name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMeMb6"&gt;The clone apps had a spotlight shone on them today, when one developer &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/tech-dude-rips-off-wordle-angers-internet-1848341422"&gt;started bragging about how many downloads his version of Wordle was getting&lt;/a&gt;. Following some intense backlash from the community, he set his account to private, but people had already started finding many...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile say they’re not blocking Apple’s iCloud Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bVCnW6IcjHg1auWUvneXHpkTC_U=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376980/og__ishslgdhhimq.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gsPVr9"&gt;T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T — the three biggest US cellular carriers — have all confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they aren’t blocking Apple’s new iCloud Private Relay feature, following reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;some customers were having issues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;with the VPN-like feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjO0fq"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon straight-up say they’re not blocking the feature from functioning. Verizon spokesperson George L. Koroneos confirms that Private Relay works on both cellular and Fios internet connections, and AT&amp;amp;T spokesperson Seth Bloom says the carrier’s policy is not to block Private Relay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IG6Sn"&gt;T-Mobile’s situation is a little more complex: most customers shouldn’t have any issues with iCloud Private Relay. But those who use content filtering services (like the carrier’s Family...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The App Store clones are here to profit off Wordle’s success</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lw21bUEW8l0kQjcVdBZ7XBEnmGI=/16x0:1110x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376898/IMG_3664.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copies of the popular web app have made it past App Review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oddcq1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt;, the word-guessing puzzle game that’s &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/09/lifestyle/what-is-wordle-why-is-everyone-twitter-playing-it/"&gt;taken over our Twitter timelines&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t currently have an official app. That may come as a surprise to anyone who’s searched for it on the App Store, though — earlier today, doing so would show you several blatant unofficial copies, each of which use the same name and mechanics as the original, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle"&gt;was made by Josh Wardle&lt;/a&gt; and distributed on the web for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iobEAS"&gt;Most people who’ve been online recently will have had at least some exposure to Wordle if they haven’t been playing it themselves (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it has 2 million daily players). It’s a simple concept but done well: each day, you go to the Wordle website, where you’re given five chances to guess a five-letter word. The game gives...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sFSC2h-JZ0-lcBTLwMcFwudM67E=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151213/LG_A1_OLED_Lifestyle_Press_Image.16.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 48-inch configuration of the LG A1 OLED is now available for just shy of $800 at Amazon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KGZoGb"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22870203/ces-2022-best-of-gadgets-concepts-tech"&gt;CES 2022 having just wrapped&lt;/a&gt;, the future looks bright if you’re looking to nab a great TV deal. At CES, many manufacturers — including LG and Samsung — announced new versions of some of their most popular models, ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22858577/samsung-frame-2022-tv-matte-antireflective-screen"&gt;The Frame&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;LG’s new C2 lineup&lt;/a&gt;. That means we’re probably going to start seeing prices fall on last-gen models as newer models become available throughout the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJ1Fo"&gt;For those looking to pick up a solid deal before the new models arrive, however, fret not, as retailers will also likely be discounting TVs in the run up to the Super Bowl next month. And if you need one now, there are currently a lot of discounted 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It fills me with glee that Canon printers now think Canon’s own toner is fake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1fi7F8742hPtI_YmQYLctnQgbM=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376666/canon_printer_2400.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sadly, not for consumer inkjets like this one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tLZ9nT"&gt;Printers are the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt;. They’re unreliable, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-printer-ink-so-expensive-2019-8"&gt;they guzzle reportedly $12,000-a-gallon ink&lt;/a&gt;, and their manufacturers have been known to use dirty tricks, scare tactics, and DRM to &lt;em&gt;strongly encourage &lt;/em&gt;you to buy cartridges exclusively from them. But Canon is now getting a taste of its own medicine. Some of Canon’s own toner cartridges are now being detected as fakes — and they’re forcing the company to teach customers how to bypass its own DRM (via &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20220110/06555048260/chip-shortage-forces-canon-to-issue-workarounds-own-obnoxious-drm.shtml"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techdirt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRwALM"&gt;According to Canon’s own support website (&lt;a href="https://www.canon-europe.com/support/business-product-support/interim-toner/"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.canon.de/support/business-product-support/interim-toner/#id2"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;), the company is “currently facing challenges in sourcing certain electronic components that are used in our consumables for our multifunction printers.” In other words, Canon’s been hit by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;the great chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, too — only the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California budget aims to clear up port congestion and pollution</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h4yCpc"&gt;California Governor Gavin Newsom’s newly proposed &lt;a href="https://www.ebudget.ca.gov/FullBudgetSummary.pdf"&gt;budget&lt;/a&gt; includes plans to tackle pollution choking portside communities while also expanding the state’s capacity to accommodate the nation’s growing hunger for imported consumer goods. The proposal comes as pandemic-fueled supply chain problems have created a crisis at California’s ports, thrusting them into the national spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4fE3E"&gt;The draft budget released yesterday for the 2022–23 fiscal year proposes investing $2.3 billion in the state’s congested ports. That includes $875 million for zero-emission vehicles and infrastructure — with a majority earmarked for trucks. It also includes $1.2 billion for “port-related” projects, like rail yard expansions, meant to increase the flow of goods...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of voice-enabled Echo devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. Maybe you want to add Alexa to a spare bedroom, for example, or you’re looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your lighting or other smart home devices. Regardless of the reason, this is one of the best times of the year to pick up an Echo device, even if Black and Cyber Monday are behind us. Below, we’ve curated a list of some of the very best Amazon Echo deals available right now, from the last-gen Echo Dot to Amazon’s latest Echo Show 10.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4ob1ga"&gt;The second union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama will begin on February 4th, according to a notice posted Tuesday by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which you can read below. The election is a redo of the one that was carried out in 2021, the results of which were declared invalid by the regulatory agency after reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;Amazon had broken labor laws&lt;/a&gt; during the union drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzk62X"&gt;The election will be carried out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;almost a year after&lt;/a&gt; workers originally voted on whether to unionize Amazon’s BHM1 facility. The union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;lost that election nearly two-to-one&lt;/a&gt; but disputed the results, taking issue with a mailbox that employees feared Amazon had access to.
