  &lt;p id="StfBhI"&gt;The Baltimore County Public School (BCPS) system has canceled classes after an apparent ransomware attack shut down internal networks. Described by officials as “a networking issue,” the outage is affecting the schools’ email and grading systems, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfGcK2"&gt;BCPS chief of staff Mychael Dickerson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DMDForward/status/1331601353085513728"&gt;confirmed on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the outage is believed to be the result of a ransomware attack. “We were the victim of a ransomware cyber attack,” he said. “Our BCPS technology team is working to address the situation.” Dickerson could only tweet the message since &lt;a href="https://www.bcps.org/"&gt;the BCPS website&lt;/a&gt; is currently down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxLeav"&gt;As a result of the outage, offices have been closed for the day and students have been given the day off. “We knew it wouldn’t be a quick fix,”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These are the best Black Friday TV deals</title>
    <content type="html">

    <title>A brief chat with xQc</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DFNo4F"&gt;Last week, the streamer Félix “xQcOW” Lengyel was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573715/twitch-ban-xqc-felix-lengyel-cheating-twitch-rivals"&gt;temporarily banned from Twitch for cheating at a GlitchCon Twitch Rivals event&lt;/a&gt;. It was the third time this year he’s been suspended from Twitch, and his teammates Rabia “Nightblue3” Yazbek and Lucas “Mendo” Håkansson were banned alongside him. I got in touch with Lengyel to chat about what happened, and what he’s learned from the experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J58IHl"&gt;According to him, the stream sniping incident — when he and his teammates queued into a competitor’s lobby with the intent to derail their game — was a bit of banter that went too far, though Lengyel is careful to note that he’s not trying to justify what happened. “The atmosphere was really like funny, banter-y — we went to their Discord, they went...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhitJa"&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; this year, you can expect to find many of the best wireless earbuds on sale for their lowest prices yet. Apple’s AirPods Pro, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus, and other popular models from Jabra, Sony, 1More, and more companies have never been more affordable. If you haven’t yet treated yourself to a set of truly wireless earbuds that connect via Bluetooth, prepare to never look back to using wired earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAI1eM"&gt;We have collected deals across multiple retailers below, and they’re all significantly lower than their usual asking price. As new deals become available or go out of stock, we’ll update this post.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX sent a Falcon 9 rocket on its seventh trip to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ExHgfwk2A5HQcamytOgudY3ZuI=/252x0:1398x764/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67980541/Screen_Shot_2020_11_25_at_8.00.16_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNb6b8"&gt;On Tuesday night, SpaceX successfully launched another batch of the company’s internet-from-space Starlink satellites to orbit, using a very space-hardened Falcon 9 rocket for the job. This launch marked the rocket’s seventh flight to space and back — the first time SpaceX has flown such a seasoned vehicle to orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nyo1uA"&gt;The Falcon 9 took off at 9:13PM ET from SpaceX’s launch site at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, with 60 Starlink satellites in tow. After a quick trip to space, the first stage of the Falcon 9 — the bulk of the vehicle that contains the main engines and most of the fuel — separated from the rest of the rocket and came back to Earth. It then performed one of SpaceX’s signature rocket landings, touching down on...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="rGB7RG"&gt;Let’s be honest: gaming is expensive, but the holiday season is a good time to take advantage of deals and sales and buy more than one game. Whether you are adding games to your personal library for your backlog, or you are planning to buy some games for a friend or family member, retailers like Amazon, GameStop, and Target have various discounts on titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0KAAJ"&gt;If you are planning to buy a PS5 or an Xbox Series X / S on Black Friday, please keep in mind that both are in high demand, limited supply, and are receiving irregular restocks at retailers. But if you are looking for games on PS4, Xbox One, and Switch, there are many deals available right now. If you own a next-gen console, several of these games on PS4 and Xbox One are either...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s Back Button Attachment is a glimpse at the PS5 controller we didn’t get</title>

  &lt;p id="IXC698"&gt;Over six years after it was first released, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21025959/sony-back-button-attachment-ps4-dualshock-4-controller-buttons-accessory-paddles"&gt;Sony suddenly created&lt;/a&gt; a new set of buttons for its DualShock 4 controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2EvCE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21025959/sony-back-button-attachment-ps4-dualshock-4-controller-buttons-accessory-paddles"&gt;Back Button Attachment&lt;/a&gt; was a bizarre product, both conceptually and in terms of timing. The vaguely wing-shaped accessory had two extra buttons and an OLED panel on the back that allowed players to add new functionality to their controller. And it was released in January 2020 — just months before Sony revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;the PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"&gt;feature-packed DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password is offering a 50 percent discount on family plans for Verge readers</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password was recently updated to support macOS Big Sur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4cIIOq"&gt;In case you still don’t use a password manager, or if you’re looking to switch services, 1Password is offering an exclusive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; offer to readers of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; until Thursday, December 3rd. You can save 50 percent each month on the cost of a family subscription (up to five people, and &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;restricted to a single household) to 1Password’s services, &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://1password.com/promo/black-friday/the-verge/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $2.50 per month&lt;/a&gt; for up to one year. After that year is up, you’ll be charged the regular $5 per month rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaQJCb"&gt;Having a password manager within reach is one of those things you didn’t know you needed until you try it. That’s just one feature that 1Password provides with a subscription: letting you access your saved, secure passwords through its app on Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, or...&lt;/p&gt;
