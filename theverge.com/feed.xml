    <title>Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-shot vaccine is effective, FDA confirms</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Zaqwv"&gt;The one-dose COVID-19 vaccine made by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson protects against severe disease and has no serious safety concerns, according to a new analysis &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; by the US Food and Drug Administration. The report takes the vaccine one step closer to authorization by the agency, meaning the United States could have a third shot available in a matter of days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLvTo8"&gt;The FDA has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267984/covid-vaccine-johnson-fda-one-dose-review"&gt;spent the last three weeks&lt;/a&gt; reviewing data submitted by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson. The company ran its clinical trial in the United States, South Africa, and Latin America. The vaccine was over 80 percent effective at preventing severe cases of COVID-19 in both South Africa and the United States. No one who was 28 days out from their dose of the vaccine was hospitalized with...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cult classic Star Wars: Republic Commando is getting remastered for the PS4 and Switch</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqRSiz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Republic Commando&lt;/em&gt;, the mid-2000s cult classic tactical first-person shooter, will get a new life on modern consoles when an HD remaster releases on April 6th for PS4 and Switch for $14.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwGG8y"&gt;Aspyr Media is handling the new version. The studio previously released a remaster for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301436/star-wars-episode-1-racer-ps4-switch-release-price"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars Episode 1: Racer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the PS4 and Switch and is also working on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22280459/stubbs-the-zombie-remaster-release-date-pc-playstation-switch-xbox"&gt;remaster&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse&lt;/em&gt;, which is set to launch on March 16th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jk4JK3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Republic Commando&lt;/em&gt; was originally released on the Xbox and PC in early 2005 and was developed and published by Lucasfilm Games, then known as LucasArts. Set during the Clone Wars, players assume the role of a squad leader consisting of four elite clone troopers as the squad...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo IV’s art director on the gritty tone: ‘Darkness does not mean bleakness’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYo3CTqXiB0etvdL2AAYIbB9AnY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867427/Diablo_IV_Rogue_Key_Art.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tAY8OC"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt; launched in 2000, it was praised for its grittiness, injecting a sense of realism into an otherwise dark, fantastical realm. With &lt;em&gt;Diablo III,&lt;/em&gt; things went in a more expressive direction, with a style that art director John Mueller describes as “painterly.” Now, with the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;, Mueller says the goal is to blend those two approaches. “With technology the way it is now,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “we can have the best of both worlds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqkHmf"&gt;One of the challenges with a game like this is creating a world that feels dark and foreboding, yet also one that players want to spend hours and hours exploring. &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; games are the kind that players typically lose themselves in, scouring dungeons for the best loot and teaming up with...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn will build a new electric vehicle for Fisker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CA7l7-m6WCnd4cdhEICcABiRYZ4=/0x0:2880x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867352/Fisker_Ocean_Unveil_CES_and_Los_Angeles.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Fisker Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m6BOyh"&gt;iPhone-maker Foxconn has agreed to build electric vehicles for Fisker Inc., the eponymous EV startup of automotive designer Henrik Fisker. In a memorandum of understanding &lt;a href="https://investors.fiskerinc.com/news/news-details/2021/Fisker-and-Foxconn-Set-to-Collaborate-on-Electric-Vehicle-Project/default.aspx"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, the two companies say Foxconn will build Fisker Inc.’s second vehicle, which has yet to be announced and is due out in late 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLYk8N"&gt;Fisker &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/foxconn-to-build-cars-for-electric-vehicle-startup-fisker-11614169530?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the companies are considering building the car in the US and that there’s a “very good chance” it may happen at Foxconn’s factory in Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3QJsR"&gt;That factory, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;former president Donald Trump called the “eighth wonder of the world” at the 2018 groundbreaking event&lt;/a&gt;, was originally supposed to be used to build LCD panels. Foxconn had promised a $10 billion investment that would...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>E-bikes are expensive, but this congressman wants to make them more affordable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Electric Bike Store As Sales Jump During Coronavirus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z7rOHgKbXKLjw-eYKaC3Shj_Hl0=/1x0:5016x3343/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867293/1212203103.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fkRYu4"&gt;Electric bikes can transform the way we live by replacing car trips, encouraging cities to improve their infrastructure, and decreasing the amount of carbon we emit into the atmosphere. But e-bikes will be transformational only if people can afford them — and as of today, most e-bikes are prohibitively expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WlWEQ"&gt;Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) wants to change this. The 72-year-old congressman from Portland has introduced a bill to help make e-bikes cheaper, and thus more accessible. Along with Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-CA), Blumenauer helped author the Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act, which would give a refundable tax credit of 30 percent on the purchase of a new e-bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1hRjS"&gt;“The bottom line here is to fully...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile has 5G leverage and isn’t afraid to use it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OVKcu2qMlEhiNYS9VyX_VG9hVg4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867161/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="azC2BE"&gt;T-Mobile created a lot of buzz this week when it announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;bringing back an unlimited plan&lt;/a&gt; without data throttling. In the age of data caps and deprioritization, that seems like a pretty nice deal — and it might be. But as always, there’s more at play here than T-Mobile just offering a better unlimited plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRP5Eu"&gt;T-Mobile says its new plan, Magenta Max, is truly unlimited. It includes 4K video streaming and high-speed data without deprioritization, where all other “unlimited” plans impose slowdowns once a user hits certain thresholds. T-Mobile chief marketing officer Matt Staneff confirmed in a call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; yesterday that there are no strings attached to the deprioritization bit — it’s all-you-can-eat 5G data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RISIqI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile says...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s ‘supervised experiences’ help parents choose what content their kids can see</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5nPYd3"&gt;YouTube is announcing “supervised experiences,” a new set of restrictions that allows parents to better control what content their children can access on the streaming video platform. According to a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supervised-experiences-for-families-on-youtube"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube hopes the filters will help parents slowly introduce their older children to age-appropriate content and features outside of the YouTube Kids app. The program will launch first with an early beta, with a wider beta rolling out “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psHndH"&gt;Parents have three levels of strictness to choose from, which determines the content a child is allowed to view on their account. There’s the “Explore” level, which YouTube says is “generally suitable” for kids nine and up’ “Explore More,” which is meant for kids 13 and up; and...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RyNQEl"&gt;Ring has announced the latest model in its line of video doorbells, the Video Doorbell Pro 2. The Pro 2 is a new top-of-the-line model that comes with a number of enhancements over its predecessor, including a taller field of view and enhanced motion detection capabilities. It is available to preorder for $249.99 starting today, with shipments expected to begin on March 31st, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wwPOU"&gt;The most significant update for the Pro 2 is its new square video capture. First popularized by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17312166/nest-hello-yale-lock-smart-home-review"&gt;Google’s Nest Hello&lt;/a&gt; and adopted by many other video doorbells, this field of view makes it possible to see who is at your door from head to toe. It also makes it possible to see when packages are left on the ground in front of the doorbell. The Pro 2 captures a 1536...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP is buying gaming accessory brand HyperX for $425 million</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3O5w1x"&gt;HP has announced that it is &lt;a href="https://press.hp.com/us/en/press-releases/2021/hp-inc-to-acquire-hyperx.html"&gt;acquiring gaming peripheral company HyperX&lt;/a&gt; for $425 million. The purchase will give HP a major foothold in the gaming accessory market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2Sna6"&gt;This transaction will result in HP buying the HyperX brand from Kingston, the current owner, but HP notes in the announcement post that “Kingston will retain the DRAM, flash, and SSD products for gamers and enthusiasts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdivnM"&gt;HP has been making strides to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21274815/hp-omen-gaming-mice-vector-essential-x1000-wireless-pc-ps4-headset"&gt;enter the gaming peripheral space&lt;/a&gt; for the last several years under the Omen brand, but it has not gained much traction compared to competitors such as Corsair, Logitech, and Razer.&lt;/p&gt;
