    <title>Disney Plus original series will now release on Wednesdays, not Fridays</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki was Disney’s first show to make the switch.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PRRfKx"&gt;From July, all of Disney Plus’ global original series will be released on Wednesdays rather than Fridays, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/disney-plus-shifts-original-series-to-wednesday-release-date-schedule-1234968809/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The change has reportedly been made to give the service’s increasing number of original TV shows more space in the schedule, while the service’s original movies will continue to release on Fridays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFpaol"&gt;Disney has announced a number of new premiere dates following the change, with most now releasing a few days later than previously planned. &lt;em&gt;Monsters, Inc. &lt;/em&gt;spinoff &lt;em&gt;Monsters at Work &lt;/em&gt;for example, will now release on Wednesday, July 7th rather than July 2nd, while &lt;em&gt;Turner &amp;amp; Hooch&lt;/em&gt; has shifted from July 16th to Wednesday, July 21st. However a couple of series will now release earlier, like &lt;em&gt;The Wonderful World...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon put AI cameras in its Chinese offices that only let smiling workers inside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wG13SMls2yqJWC2MhPD_lenFJMY=/0x0:3200x2133/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465571/canon_smile_recognition.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Smile recognition” in action. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Canon Information Technologies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mty2Mn"&gt;Tech company Canon has come up with a downright dystopic way to tackle the problem of workplace morale: it’s installed cameras with AI-enabled “smile recognition” technology in the offices of its Chinese subsidiary Canon Information Technology. The cameras only let smiling workers enter rooms or book meetings, ensuring that every employee is definitely, 100 percent happy all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwJMrO"&gt;This depressing tale was highlighted in a &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b74b6ad6-3b8d-4cd8-9dd6-3b49754aa1c7"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on how Chinese companies are surveilling employees to an unsettling degree with the help of AI and algorithms. Firms are monitoring which programs employees use on their computers to gauge their productivity; using CCTV cameras to measure how long they take on their lunch break; and...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Zens’ latest battery pack can create a wireless charging sandwich</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EieTrvi6Scv6mcLzwY2EsS3iv_k=/0x0:1467x978/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465331/press_release_powerbanks_1536x864.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery pack can wirelessly charge two devices at once.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Zens&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="toclEy"&gt;Zens’ new battery pack has a wireless charger on both sides, allowing you to charge two Qi-compatible devices simultaneously in what can only be described as a “charging sandwich.” The &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-dual-powerbank"&gt;Dual Powerbank&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/blog/blog/experience-the-convenience-of-on-the-go-wireless-charging/"&gt;announced alongside&lt;/a&gt; a trio of other battery packs including the &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-single-powerbank/"&gt;Magnetic Single Powerbank&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-single-powerbank-with-stand"&gt;Single Powerbank with Stand&lt;/a&gt; (which can itself be wirelessly charged, as well as wirelessly charge other devices), and the &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-single-powerbank-stand-10000mah/"&gt;10,000 mAh Powerbank with Stand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXxnvy"&gt;Although you could theoretically use it to charge two Qi-compatible phones, the intended use case appears to be charging an iPhone along with an accessory like a pair of AirPods. That’s because one side of the battery pack includes a MagSafe connection, which should keep it centered on iPhone...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus integrates further with Oppo, if that’s even possible</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PreLxGWjXgAkVLh2rVaTwuyIo_8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465329/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DTWuj"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has announced a “new journey” for the company including a plan to “further integrate our organization with Oppo.” Lau made the announcement by way of a &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/a-new-journey-for-oneplus.1454492/"&gt;post on OnePlus’ forums&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we’re at a turning point for the future of OnePlus” and “we must adapt as a team and a brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85hr9Q"&gt;It sounds like a dramatic move for OnePlus, the company Lau started with Carl Pei after ostensibly leaving Oppo in 2013. OnePlus made its name with rebellious marketing and hype-driven online retail strategies, portraying itself as a smarter alternative to bigger smartphone brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1xwGeW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was always clear that OnePlus had ties to Oppo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3aHu8H"&gt;But it remained a private company with ownership tied up in Oppo and the shadowy BBK Electronics empire, and it...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leica phone announced by SoftBank in Japan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOBU2_fK_41ENIQWpT0H1W67TMs=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465217/leitz.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zzd58N"&gt;SoftBank has announced a Leica-branded phone for the Japanese market. Leica has lent its name to phone camera systems before, but this Leitz Phone 1 is the first time the Leica brand and iconic red dot has taken precedence on a smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYoJyG"&gt;The camera system is of course going to be paramount for a device like this, and the hardware here is certainly unusual. There’s a single 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor — the biggest in any phone — with a 19mm-equivalent f/1.9 ultrawide lens, meaning other focal lengths need to use digital zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SB59G"&gt;If that sounds familiar, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439883/sharp-aquos-r6-japan-biggest-phone-camera-sensor-1-inch"&gt;Sharp announced the exact same thing a month ago&lt;/a&gt;. The Aquos R6 has the same Leica-branded camera system — though the Leitz Phone 1 makes it look a lot bigger — and other specs like...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China successfully launches three astronauts to new space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5NdPkSgYBMVwdhuyKBsPF7wB8dU=/166x0:1711x1030/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69464656/Screen_Shot_2021_06_16_at_9.24.58_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CGTN&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pJ1wPR"&gt;A Long March rocket blasted off from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center today, carrying three astronauts to China’s new space station. The launch marks China’s &lt;a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2021/06/09/long-march-2f-rocket-rolls-out-to-launch-pad-for-chinas-next-human-spaceflight/"&gt;first crewed mission&lt;/a&gt; in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0BHsq"&gt;The launch of the Shenzhou-12 spacecraft took place at 9:22AM local time on Thursday morning. The &lt;a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-06/16/c_1310010243.htm"&gt;three astronauts&lt;/a&gt;, Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming, and Tang Hongbo, will be the first three people to board China’s space station, Tianhe. They will stay on Tianhe for three months, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57504052"&gt;bringing the space station online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7cszn"&gt;The core module of Tianhe, which contains the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/16/china-to-send-the-first-astronauts-to-its-self-developed-space-station.html"&gt;crew’s living quarters&lt;/a&gt;, was launched in &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/china-launches-core-module-tianhe-space-station"&gt;April 2021&lt;/a&gt;. This first crewed mission is part of &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/china-launching-shenzhou-12-astronauts-to-space-station"&gt;eleven planned missions&lt;/a&gt; during the space station’s construction phase — two more modules and several...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Is Facebook cornering the VR market?</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="am38oB"&gt;Imagine that, over the past year, Facebook had managed to acquire the battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, the kid-focused game creation engine Roblox, and the best-selling game of 2020, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfxZU5"&gt;For many reasons, such a spree of acquisitions would never happen. One of the biggest is that antitrust scrutiny has made it increasingly difficult for Facebook to acquire anything that resembles a social network. It was more than a year ago that the company bought the moribund GIF search engine Giphy, which had few prospects for success as a standalone company; the United Kingdom’s competition watchdog &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/facebooks-acquisition-of-giphy-raises-concerns-for-uks-cma.html"&gt;has so far blocked the deal from closing&lt;/a&gt;, warning the acquisition would somehow harm Facebook’s competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRrlsB"&gt;And yet if you...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon pulls an Apple by reducing its app store cut for some smaller developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fc0uhGQjOijIrjNmqlpuvI_6owk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69464448/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cfgWL0"&gt;Amazon has decided it would really like to attract more developers to its Android and Fire OS app store, so it’s following in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;the footsteps of Apple&lt;/a&gt; (and Google) by announcing &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/appstore/post/93e89be7-1611-4764-8f97-f4eef0a7c0e0/coming-soon-amazon-appstore-small-business-accelerator-program"&gt;a new “Amazon Appstore Small Business Accelerator Program”&lt;/a&gt; that takes less money out of developer’s pockets (&lt;a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-appstore-will-reduce-developer-revenue-cut-from-30-to-20-and-give-10-in-free-aws-credit/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;AFTVNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UE3Jmj"&gt;But where Apple and Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;reduce their cut of a developer’s first $1 million in revenue from 30 percent down to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s formula has a slight tweak: it’ll take a higher 20 percent of revenue, but give developers an additional 10 percent in “AWS promotional credits.” The idea is that if your app is using Amazon’s popular AWS cloud services anyhow, it’ll be equivalent to you keeping 90 percent of the money. And if you happen to...&lt;/p&gt;
