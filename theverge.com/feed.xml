    <title>AT&amp;T is giving its top prepaid hotspot plan a big price cut and more data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F6nYNSjSefgz4FUmbf23KKjuw7g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69202232/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customers already enrolled in the prepaid plan will get a data boost and a lower price when their plan renews.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCXn6a"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says it will now offer a prepaid 5G data-only plan with up to 100GB of data for $55 per month — a big upgrade from its previous offering of 40GB for $75. The new pricing extends to Cricket Wireless customers as well as AT&amp;amp;T’s direct prepaid subscribers, though those on Cricket won’t be able to access the 5G network. These plans allow customers to buy data for their tablet or mobile hotspot separate from their voice plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEnrf2"&gt;That 100GB is a lot of data at a lower price than the other major carriers are offering; currently, T-Mobile has a prepaid data-only plan of 50GB for $50 and Verizon has a 30GB plan for $65 per month. It may be no coincidence that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497743/verizon-home-lte-service-rural-communities-48-states"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; are also eager to expand their own 5G and LTE-based fixed home...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Space community mourns the death of Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Michael Collins Studying Flight Plans" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GkE4stmIsKUKEK68OdCmV0i5Q1g=/0x20:3989x2679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69201988/517427560.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kuQOSQ"&gt;Michael Collins, the witty “forgotten” astronaut of NASA’s legendary Apollo 11 mission to the Moon, died of cancer on Wednesday, his family said. An icon of space exploration and an eloquent storyteller (who, arguably, had the best sense of humor among the Apollo 11 crew), Collins passionately advocated for further exploration of other worlds. Astronauts, NASA officials, and others in the space community who are heeding his advocacy mourned his death today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKtfx9"&gt;Collins was the Columbia command module pilot who stayed in orbit around the Moon in 1969 while his crew mates, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, descended to the lunar surface and became the first two humans to set foot on another world. Aldrin, now the only living Apollo 11 astronaut,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook temporarily hid posts calling for India’s prime minister to resign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NejP3qeOZaAQUaLrvkqiS_3MN7c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69201908/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLTZoh"&gt;When Facebook users tried to view a hashtag calling for the resignation of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/srinivasaiims/status/1387472195316711426"&gt;instead saw a message&lt;/a&gt; saying that Facebook was temporarily hiding the posts in order to keep the community safe. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-blocking-posts-hashtag-resign-modi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the posts were hidden for about three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3qohU"&gt;Facebook has now restored the posts and told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it is “looking into what happened,” echoing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1387491715171422215"&gt;a public statement&lt;/a&gt; from a member of its communications team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeLMIH"&gt;The temporary suspension of the hashtag is likely to fuel concerns about the influence that Modi’s BJP party wields over Facebook operations and social media in general. Last weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;Twitter hid tweets critical of various officials&lt;/a&gt; after receiving an emergency order from...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook expects ad tracking problems from regulators and Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2r1HaM-7DVxkDsuWX56glio-d28=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69201604/acastro_180522_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YMzHQN"&gt;Facebook’s ad revenue was up more than 45 percent during the first three months of 2020, soaring to $25.4 billion — or about seven times what Twitter makes in an entire year. But the company sees some potential problems on the horizon that could limit continued growth: regulators are closing in on ad tracking practices, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;a feature launched this week by Apple&lt;/a&gt; could harm its ability to target ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1BP9s"&gt;“We continue to expect increased ad targeting headwinds in 2021 from regulatory and platform changes,” Facebook CFO Dave Wehner writes in the company’s &lt;a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;Q1 2021 earnings release&lt;/a&gt;. Wehner specifically calls out iOS 14.5, which includes a feature that lets iPhone and iPad users easily stop apps from tracking them in certain ways. Facebook expects...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iPhone 12 and Mac sales skyrocket despite ongoing pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i99fSomk-kSyCJQESjrxlXCOLSM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69201444/akrales_201018_4238_0194.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mEoNl7"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 12 lineup maintained enormously strong demand from consumers from January through March, according to the company’s fiscal Q2 earnings &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-reports-second-quarter-results%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F28%2F22407894%2Fapple-q2-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;posted today&lt;/a&gt;. Apple reported record March quarter revenue of $89.6 billion, up 54 percent year over year. The iPhone took in just under $48 billion, jumping up by 66 percent from a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eusbyT"&gt;Sales of Mac and iPad hardware also surged for yet another quarter, up 70 and 78 percent respectively, due in part to continued remote work and schooling necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. That success might slow down as some regions of the world return to a sense of normalcy, so most eyes — as usual — are on the iPhone. It’s been reported that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;iPhone 12 mini isn’t doing as well as Apple hoped&lt;/a&gt;,...&lt;/p&gt;

WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar has also confirmed in a March analyst event that HBO original shows won’t get ads added in, so customers won’t have to worry about &lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;getting interrupted by commercials. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fired Amazon worker is trying to unionize four NYC-area facilities</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GMMI60"&gt;Amazon workers at four different facilities near Staten Island have begun the process of unionizing with the &lt;a href="https://amazonlaborunion.org/"&gt;Amazon Labor Union&lt;/a&gt;. The organizing effort is being led by Christian Smalls, a former warehouse worker who was fired in March after organizing a walkout to protest unsafe working conditions during the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/amazon-labor-union-staten-island"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BWGEe"&gt;The company has responded by posting anti-union messages on TV screens at JFK8, the fulfillment center where Smalls used to work. “KNOW THE FACTS BEFORE YOU SIGN A UNION CARD,” reads one of the messages &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvzx7v/amazon-launches-another-union-busting-campaign"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “If someone asks you to provide your personal information or sign a union card, do not release your personal information without knowing all the facts.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s who Apple and Epic are calling to testify in next week’s trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MAAnYH"&gt;Next week, Epic Games and Apple will appear in court for a long-anticipated legal battle. Epic argues that Apple unfairly kicked its hit game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store last year, exercising an illegal monopoly over the ubiquitous iOS platform. Apple claims Epic is trying to break the iOS platform’s vaunted safety and security for its own gain. Both parties have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;laid out how&lt;/a&gt; they expect to win their respective cases, and this week, they’ve provided near-final lists of the people they expect to call for testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeudKo"&gt;Apple and Epic both filed revised tentative witness lists on April 26th. The lists don’t guarantee every witness will be called, and crucially, they don’t tell us &lt;em&gt;when &lt;/em&gt;we’ll see a given person on the stand. But with the closely...&lt;/p&gt;

The goal is to create a seamless experience in which an owner of a GM electric vehicle can drive up to a station, plug in, and start charging without having to juggle multiple apps or third-party memberships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7zRco"&gt;“There is a lot more to EV adoption than just buying the vehicle and just having a large connected network,” said Travis Hester, GM’s chief EV officer. “And our mission is to...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="lKGtNM"&gt;Earlier this month, we learned that the iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was a huge revenue driver for Epic Games — the game earned more than $700 million from iOS customers over the two years before it was pulled by Apple, according to &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.405.0.pdf"&gt;court documents (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; released ahead of Epic’s trial against the iPhone maker. But even though iOS &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players brought in a staggering amount of money for Epic, iOS isn’t the biggest platform in terms of revenue for the game — apparently, it might even be &lt;em&gt;among the smallest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9AyB3"&gt;Court documents reveal that PlayStation 4 generated 46.8 percent of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s total revenues from March 2018 through July 2020, while Xbox One, the second-highest platform, generated 27.5 percent. iOS ranked fifth, with just 7 percent of...&lt;/p&gt;
