    <title>Former employees say Apple stood by while suppliers violated Chinese labor laws</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Factory&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YdEiwP"&gt;Apple has been complicit in its suppliers’ violations of Chinese labor laws, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-turned-blind-eye-to-supplier-breaches-of-chinese-labor-laws?utm_campaign=%5Brtsu%5D+Automated+RTS&amp;amp;utm_content=1002702&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=cio&amp;amp;utm_term=1000266"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Suppliers have periodically filled their factories with temporary workers or “dispatch labor,” violating a Chinese labor law requiring no more than 10 percent of a factory’s workers be temporary employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rILLI"&gt;Much like in the US, temporary employees in China receive lower pay and fewer benefits, and they’ve become increasingly common as interest in factory jobs has shrunk according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources. The law limiting the use of dispatch labor came into effect in 2014, and that year Apple conducted a survey of its suppliers in China to determine how many already complied. The company found that among 362...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces massive 110-inch 4K TV with next-gen MicroLED picture quality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eng9ersKU7LfcTruv9O_VcZlzIA=/0x11:2296x1542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68488273/Screen_Shot_2020_12_09_at_8.06.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocbCn9"&gt;Over the last couple years, Samsung has showed off (and sold to a very rich few) its &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/business/products/displays/direct-view-led/the-wall/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;futuristic, modular TV dubbed The Wall&lt;/a&gt; that uses MicroLED technology. MicroLED shares many of OLED’s best traits — without most of the associated drawbacks — and is widely viewed as the next big upgrade leap for the displays in our lives. Now, Samsung is taking MicroLED and putting it into a more traditional TV form factor. Today the company announced the 110-inch MicroLED TV, which goes up for presale today in Korea and will launch globally in the first quarter of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COmqhL"&gt;As for the first question that probably comes to mind, no, Samsung isn't yet revealing a price for this enormous TV using the latest picture technology. But you can expect it’ll cost...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is buying anime streaming service Crunchyroll from AT&amp;T for $1.175 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rF4efHRCnG5wPHovm_wc_gwL3xs=/22x0:933x607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68488042/crunchyroll_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l4Peux"&gt;Sony will be buying anime streaming service Crunchyroll from AT&amp;amp;T for $1.175 billion, Sony and AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2020/1209/atttosellcrunchyrolltosonysfunimationglobalgroup"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, Crunchyroll will become part of Sony’s Funimation, which already licenses many popular shows such as &lt;em&gt;Attack on Titan&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;One Piece.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vHXOS"&gt;Now that Sony owns both Crunchyroll and Funimation, the company has &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/21547657/sonys-funimation-acquires-crunchyroll-deal-price-watching-anime"&gt;tremendous power over&lt;/a&gt; anime in the US at a time when many other media companies are trying to figure out their anime content. Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/theres-something-super-weird-about-netflix-anime/"&gt;also invested heavily&lt;/a&gt; in both licensing and producing its own anime content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zvR6Mw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are excited to embark on this new journey”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Florida’s justification for raiding COVID data whistleblower Rebekah Jones is looking a little shaky</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FE2cK9HKOihMIRe4DBVD7FdN8ak=/31x0:369x225/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487687/emfGgCL9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Io8uS"&gt;On Tuesday, Florida state police entered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160181/rebekah-jones-raid-seizure-search-warrant-covid-19-whistleblower-florida"&gt;the home of Rebekah Jones with guns drawn&lt;/a&gt;, seizing her computer and phone, in an attempt to prove that she’d sent an unauthorized “group text” through “a Department of Health messaging system” that is “to be used for emergencies only,” according to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56danA"&gt;There are now two reasons why that’s significant. First, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160181/rebekah-jones-raid-seizure-search-warrant-covid-19-whistleblower-florida"&gt;as we reported at the time&lt;/a&gt;, Jones isn’t just any former Florida Department of Health employee: she’s the whistleblower who built Florida’s once-celebrated COVID-19 tracking dashboard, then accused her bosses &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/29/884551391/florida-scientist-says-she-was-fired-for-not-manipulating-covid-19-data"&gt;of ordering her to manipulate Florida’s data&lt;/a&gt; to justify reopening the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sKQUA"&gt;Second, it’s now come to our attention that the supposedly private messaging system that Jones might...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook calls antitrust lawsuits ‘revisionist history’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bjt85p"&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of 48 state attorneys general &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;filed broad antitrust charges against Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, seeking a reversal of its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. Now, Facebook has responded to those charges in an extensive post titled &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/lawsuits-filed-by-the-ftc-and-state-attorneys-general-are-revisionist-history/"&gt;“Lawsuits Filed by the FTC and the State Attorneys General Are Revisionist History,”&lt;/a&gt; written by general counsel Jennifer Newstead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxvNUX"&gt;Newstead’s primary defense is that both acquisitions resulted in better products for consumers — an implicit reference to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21524886/google-market-power-justice-department-antitrust-lawsuit-consumer-harm"&gt;the “consumer harm” standard&lt;/a&gt; that has also been central to the Department of Justice’s case against Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fCzTtt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Regulators correctly allowed these deals to move forward”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>SpaceX flies Starship prototype rocket to highest altitude yet — but doesn’t stick the landing</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ecJeDn"&gt;During a test flight on Wednesday, SpaceX flew a prototype of its next generation Starship rocket to its highest height yet in the skies above Texas — but failed to stick the landing, with the vehicle exploding when it hit the ground. Propelled by three main engines, the vehicle launched to an altitude of nearly 8 miles, or 12.5 kilometers, before crash landing into the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9Ef04"&gt;The nearly seven-minute test flight took off at around 5:45PM ET from SpaceX’s facility at Boca Chica, Texas. The prototype climbed to its target altitude, but during the flight, two of its three main engines seemingly shut down while it ascended. Eventually all three engines cut off, and SpaceX attempted to perform a “bell flop” maneuver, with the vehicle falling...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A secretive treasure hunter is unmasked by a court case</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0i0YTO"&gt;Finding a long-hidden treasure in the woods of Wyoming seems like a tall tale that would be told around a campfire, but it happens to be reality for Jack Stuef. As with many treasure hunting stories, though, the intrigue isn’t over just because the prize has been found. Stuef had been trying to stay anonymous and had done so until this week, but now he says he’s been forced to reveal his identity &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-treasure-chest-rocky-mountains-forrest-fenn-20200608-xltbeao5zvbkjiby732x73fhxe-story.html"&gt;after a lawsuit was filed&lt;/a&gt; alleging that he obtained the treasure through hacking and stalking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfKhyu"&gt;The chest in question, &lt;a href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/forrest-fenn-confirms-his-treasure-has-been-found/article_37006cfe-a8d7-11ea-8653-873ca96e31ef.html"&gt;filled with 22 pounds&lt;/a&gt; of treasure-y things like gold coins and jewelry, was hidden by Forrest Fenn, a Santa Fe art dealer, and has been the object of a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/forrest-fenn-treasure-chest-pictures-trnd/index.html"&gt;widely publicized hunt&lt;/a&gt; that’s been going on since 2010.

    <title>Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical to become an actual one-night Broadway-style show</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d3pgHB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/11/ratatouille-musical-tiktok.html"&gt;TikTok’s fan-made crowdsourced &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical&lt;/a&gt; is making the jump from social media to the stage. &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical&lt;/em&gt; is going to debut as an actual show for a one-night-only concert on January 1st, which will benefit The Actors Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmByGX"&gt;The streamed show will be produced by &lt;a href="https://seaviewprods.com/work/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical/"&gt;Seaview Productions&lt;/a&gt; (best known for producing &lt;em&gt;Slave Play&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/theater/tony-award-nominations.html"&gt;most Tony Award-nominated show&lt;/a&gt; in Broadway history) and is being presented “in association with TikTok.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMKWIG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ratatouille-tiktok-musical-oral-history-1091547/"&gt;so-called &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical&lt;/a&gt; — based on the 2007 Disney / Pixar film — has been percolating over the past several months on TikTok. What started as a one-off bit has slowly snowballed into a massive undertaking, with bored Broadway fans, composers, set designers, costume makers,...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tnNvUL"&gt;The economic fallout from COVID-19 has temporarily muted some of the noise coming from maritime traffic. That’s given scientists a rare opportunity to study what happens to marine life when humans quiet down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxZpZU"&gt;Humans today pollute oceans with whirring ship propellers and booming air guns searching for oil and gas deposits. Seeing whales and other creatures’ behavior now that the pandemic has quieted things down is like a peek into what marine life was like before humans drastically turned up the volume over the past 200 years. &lt;/p&gt;
