    <title>Apple’s AirPods Max are $30 off at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9st56iOy91X0sdGE_jo8wjIUbJQ=/0x0:2075x1383/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69405646/AirPodsMax.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1FZwy8"&gt;Apple’s over-ear AirPods Max are $30 less than usual at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733321576396561727#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; today. Normally $549, every color option is $520 (Best Buy has most, but not all, colors at this price). Are they worth the purchase even with this slightly more affordable cost? If you’re a discerning shopper looking for unparalleled design and build quality, as well as great sound quality and ease of use, then perhaps they’ll be worth it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXCx2k"&gt;This price is hundreds more than the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;, both of which will serve most people very well. My colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Welch notes in his review&lt;/a&gt;, though, that the AirPods Max are tough to beat on the little details that might make a big difference with your...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple WWDC 2021: iOS 15, new MacBook Pros, and what else to expect</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qq4VZ46b6ppEuSTkzmyvRj8pXY=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69405394/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrPAza"&gt;Apple’s annual developer extravaganza, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), is coming up fast, kicking off with the keynote presentation on June 7th at 1PM ET. Like last year, WWDC will be an entirely digital and online-only event due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and for the keynote, that means we can likely expect another tightly produced video highlighting everything Apple has in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcZ4wB"&gt;While we aren’t expecting any announcements on the level of Apple’s shift to custom silicon in its computers, which was WWDC 2020’s big news, Apple presumably has some notable changes in the works for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and its other operating systems. And if the current rumors pan out, we could also see brand-new MacBook Pros with the return of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s proposed budget keeps a block on recreational weed sales in Washington, DC</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="48XIFE"&gt;A rider that has effectively blocked recreational cannabis for years in Washington, DC appears in President Joe Biden’s proposed 2022 budget, which may keep weed on the back burner yet again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4Ufdh"&gt;Even though residents of DC &lt;a href="https://wamu.org/story/14/11/05/pot_legalization_approved_by_dc_voters/"&gt;voted to legalize&lt;/a&gt; possession of recreational marijuana in 2014, the measure has been in limbo since then, &lt;a href="https://dcist.com/story/21/06/01/biden-budget-keeps-ban-on-weed-sales-in-dc/"&gt;derailed by a rider&lt;/a&gt; to DC’s appropriations bill first introduced by Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), that prohibits the District from spending its local funds on commercialization of recreational cannabis, such as dispensaries. And Biden’s proposed 2022 budget includes the rider’s language yet again.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmKpWy"&gt;Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) &lt;a href="https://norton.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/norton-secures-major-victories-for-dc-in-biden-budget-disappointed-with"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; she was having a hard time reconciling the Biden administration's...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU and UK open antitrust investigations into Facebook Marketplace</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mwtjs4"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2848"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-investigates-facebook-s-use-of-ad-data"&gt;UK regulators&lt;/a&gt; have opened antitrust investigations into Facebook over concerns its Marketplace service is unfairly distorting competition for classified ads. Both are interested in whether or not Facebook unfairly used advertising data to compete in the classified ads market, and are collaborating as part of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgCYVc"&gt;“Facebook collects vast troves of data on the activities of users of its social network and beyond, enabling it to target specific customer groups,” the European Commission’s competition head Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. “We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage in particular on the online classified ads sector, where people buy...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new TV remote is great, but only when apps properly support it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGjeS3jkHTEzIJSHAoxONF76doc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404757/DSCF3948_4.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JbNWB6"&gt;Users are complaining that the Disney Plus and HBO Max Apple TV apps aren’t properly supporting the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;new Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;. Disney Plus has &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/nrem4m/disney_doesnt_work_with_new_apple_tv_remotes/"&gt;yet to be updated&lt;/a&gt; to make use of the remote’s helpful scroll wheel scrubbing feature, which works on rival Netflix and Apple TV Plus apps. The HBO Max app has more issues, &lt;a href="https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-tvos-update-breaks-several-key-features-degrading-experience-significantly"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, and lacks support for several of the remote’s features and voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNBA7o"&gt;When we tried the HBO Max app for ourselves, we found it doesn’t seem to support the new remote’s D-pad. Instead, we could only use the remote’s touchpad circle, which is technically an element of the remote you’re supposed to be able to disable. Scrubbing using the touchpad works, just very badly. The cause of these problems...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A very sus chicken nugget shaped like an Among Us crewmate sells for $99,997 on eBay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3aSSXd7jAizhVH_IYno9waPdUP4=/0x160:1200x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404693/s_l1600.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d still eat it.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/304012821839?_trksid=p2471758.m4704" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UI0t59"&gt;After an intense, dayslong bidding war, a single McDonald’s chicken nugget shaped like one of the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; crewmates has just sold for an eye-watering $99,997&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F304012821839%3F_trksid%3Dp2471758.m4703&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F6%2F4%2F22504587%2Famong-us-mcdonalds-chicken-nugget-ebay-auction-bts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on eBay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpPCcV"&gt;The little nugget started off from humble beginnings, listed for a respectable 99 cents on May 28th. (I’d pay that much for it. Maybe even $5.) And for a little while, there were no bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cumi2C"&gt;But then, two days after it was first listed, somebody placed an (at the time) astonishingly high $14,869.69 first bid on the nugget, and things just escalated from there. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fbfl%2Fviewbids%2F304012821839%3Fitem%3D304012821839%26rt%3Dnc%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.l2565&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F6%2F4%2F22504587%2Famong-us-mcdonalds-chicken-nugget-ebay-auction-bts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;I recommend scrolling through the bid history, it’s wild&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The completed listing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A7d4Js"&gt;One factor that may have driven up the price is that the nugget apparently came from &lt;a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/bts-meal.html"&gt;a BTS...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taito announces mini arcade cabinet with rotating screen and trackball controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDH2eMvkcCQXwbrp_ZCGWmtQgNo=/1x0:1000x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404638/taito1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zBZ6Hi"&gt;Taito is the latest Japanese video game publisher to resurrect old hardware in mini form. The company behind &lt;em&gt;Space Invaders&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bubble Bobble&lt;/em&gt;, and many more arcade classics has just announced the &lt;a href="https://taito.co.jp/egret2mini"&gt;Egret II Mini&lt;/a&gt;, which like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22347909/astro-city-mini-review-sega-arcade-cabinet-us-release-price-games"&gt;Sega’s excellent Astro City Mini&lt;/a&gt; is a shrunken-down version of a popular arcade cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3A3OIp"&gt;The original Egret II was released in the ‘90s, and its key feature was the ability to rotate its screen 90 degrees so that games with tall aspect ratios — like &lt;em&gt;Space Invaders&lt;/em&gt; and other shooters — could be played in &lt;em&gt;tate&lt;/em&gt; (vertical) mode. Appropriately enough, that feature is present on the Egret II Mini, which has a 5-inch 4:3 LCD that can be played in either orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OHAVB6"&gt;The Egret II Mini’s primary controls include six...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next iPad Pro has wireless charging and a glass back: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2021 11-inch iPad Pro. This review has focused a lot on the 12.9, but other than the screen and size the 11-inch is the same." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xD1MZdg_0RBL6JtRDapYh_oyZsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404453/vpavic_210512_4592_0203.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sYmdkN"&gt;Apple is working on a new version of the iPad Pro with wireless charging, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/apple-working-on-ipad-pro-with-wireless-charging-new-ipad-mini"&gt;new report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. To accommodate the technology, Apple will reportedly switch to a glass back for the new models, instead of the aluminum found on the rear of every iPad released so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nmfVk"&gt;Apple is said to be testing a magnetic charging system for the new iPad Pro similar to the MagSafe connector introduced with the iPhone 12 range of phones last year. Apple may also include reverse wireless charging in the new iPad Pro, according to the report, which would allow the iPad to serve as a wireless charging point itself.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hiring private contractors to sample greenhouse gases from the air is an important aspect of NOAA’s climate research. Here, Paolo Wilczak pilots a sampling flight over southeastern Connecticut on April 25, 2020, as part of the East Coast Outflow field mission. The Global Monitoring Laboratory hopes to add civilian airliners to its sampling fleet.&amp;nbsp; | Paolo Wilczak, Scientific Aviation&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7IXYA"&gt;A greenhouse gas-tracking technology is about to go commercial. Greenhouse gas detectors will soon take flight on an Alaska Airlines-run Boeing 737-9, in an effort to help federal scientists get even more information about how we’re changing the climate. The tools would measure concentrations of planet-heating pollution in the air, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwQyHa"&gt;They’re calling the plane, which won’t have any passengers, an “&lt;a href="http://www.boeing.com/principles/environment/ecodemonstrator"&gt;ecoDemonstrator&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s testing a number of contraptions along with the greenhouse-gas detector — including features that might make the plane more fuel-efficient or less noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bR1OzA"&gt;Over several test flights this year, NOAA will figure out the best place to install their...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google confirms diversity exec no longer in role after problematic post</title>

  &lt;p id="laUksJ"&gt;One of Google’s top executives in diversity strategy and research has left his position after a 2007 blog post slamming the state of Israel resurfaced on June 1st. In the post, Kamau Bobb used antisemitic language, insinuating Jews have an “insatiable appetite for war and killing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z37YRi"&gt;The post was quickly picked up by the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt;. “While Google has been a vocal supporter of diversity initiatives... it has not commented on the recent spike in anti-Semitic hate crimes,” &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/google-diversity-head-said-jews-have-insatiable-appetite-for-war/"&gt;read a &lt;em&gt;Washington Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article on the subject&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qvq8H6"&gt;But the controversy likely didn’t start with the right-wing press. It seems to have begun internally, with an email from a member of Google’s Jewish employee resource group. On June...&lt;/p&gt;
