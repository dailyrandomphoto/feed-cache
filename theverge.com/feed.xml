    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dN7cX0"&gt;Apple just wrapped up its “Spring Loaded” event, announcing new iPads, iMacs, and more. It was jam-packed with news from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tri6hY"&gt;If you want to read about what was announced as it happened, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384269/apple-event-live-blog-news-announcements-ipad-pro-spring-loaded"&gt;check out our live blog&lt;/a&gt; with commentary from Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Chaim Gartenberg.

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22149716"&gt;Apple’s new iPad Pros have the company’s M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LQgYgx"&gt;Apple unveiled its newest iPad Pro tablets, and they’re equipped with the same Apple-designed M1 chip in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini (and the new iMac, also announced today). The 12.9-inch model has an upgraded display that uses 10,000 Mini LEDs, and Apple calls it the Liquid Retina XDR...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord reportedly dismisses Microsoft deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/30AGbmJ-8c0JPwWghZYhuJ7d9QE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158084/acastro_210129_1777_discord_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e4fXxu"&gt;Discord is ending talks to sell itself to Microsoft or other companies, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/discord-ends-deal-talks-with-microsoft-11618938806?mod=breakingnews"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The popular online chat app was reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345792/microsoft-discord-acquisition-report-10-billion"&gt;in talks to sell to Microsoft in March&lt;/a&gt;, for a price that valued Discord at over $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNlG8O"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; writes that Discord was in talks with at least three other companies, but has decided to stay independent because it’s “doing well.” Discord has around 140 million monthly users and earned about $130 million in revenue in 2020, but still isn’t profitable, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-social-network-without-ads-discord-defies-convention-11615199401"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwnLVj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352028/microsoft-discord-acquisition-analysis-report"&gt;Microsoft’s interest in Discord&lt;/a&gt; had a lot to do with the latter’s role as a home for online communities. The app is a destination for creators cultivating their own forums, as well as home-grown groups...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overwatch director Jeff Kaplan has left Blizzard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jeff Kaplan Portrait Shoot, London" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8_RcVgbMFAq8NF106UMpm2OnnM=/0x0:4827x3218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158016/871693790.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hodLXZ"&gt;Jeff Kaplan, the most public face of Blizzard’s team shooter &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, has left the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7neurj"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/overwatch/23665015/new-leadership-for-overwatch"&gt;a letter posted today&lt;/a&gt;, Kaplan said that “it was truly the honor of a lifetime to have the opportunity to create worlds and heroes for such a passionate audience. I want to express my deep appreciation to everyone at Blizzard who supported our games, our game teams, and our players. But I want to say a special thanks to the wonderful game developers that shared in the journey of creation with me.” It’s not clear where Kaplan is headed, but his tenure at Blizzard lasted 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qb750N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was truly the honor of a lifetime.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XnfXic"&gt;It’s also unclear what this might mean for &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;. The game is in a strange place at the moment, with a sequel in the work...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches new iPad Pro with M1 processor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RThDKKvsa37AWzXULQcYRLpf3Bw=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157640/lcimg_06ebca85_7eac_4c32_9e8f_4b98fad99ec8.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rquOpZ"&gt;Right on schedule, Apple has launched the next generation of its iPad Pro. As was the case with the recent MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, Apple’s improvements to the iPad Pro are largely on the inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELYssq"&gt;The device has a new M1 processor, the same chip that powers the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini. Apple claims this will deliver “a big jump in performance” over the previous generation. The graphics performance is over 1,500 times faster, per the company. Apple also says you can expect all-day battery life from the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzNQb8"&gt;The iPad Pro now supports Thunderbolt, 5G connectivity, and an improved camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnRj5d"&gt;Apple says the ISP and LIDAR scanner will capture “incredible details” in low-light conditions. There’s a TrueDepth camera system on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces thinner iMac with M1 chip and bright colors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing all seven colors of the new iMac: green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, and silver." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/01Hwl_PP17A1y5ukMWlyzLOqhrk=/168x0:1977x1206/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157337/apple_new_imac_spring21_hero_04202021_Full_Bleed_Image.jpg.medium_2x.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sq8H0d"&gt;Apple introduced a redesigned iMac today with a slimmer display, an Apple Silicon chip, and a case with bright bold colors that throws back to the classic colorful all-in-one iMacs. Apple said the new iMac was designed from the ground up for the M1 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIOw47"&gt;The new iMac has a 24-inch, 4.5K display with narrower borders than its predecessor around the top and sides. It still has a large chin on the bottom, but the rear of the display is now flat instead of curved — Apple says the volume has been reduced by over 50 percent. The screen also has Apple’s True Tone tech for automatically adjusting the color temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2UaH0"&gt;Apple is also promising a &lt;em&gt;much-needed&lt;/em&gt; update to the iMac’s camera and mics so that you’ll look better on video calls. It now has...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ted Lasso season 2 is coming in July, and it looks as charming as ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_NZXh_xi2CKlWgGGdF1Njz-z7KA=/54x0:1226x781/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157256/ted_lasso.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple TV Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PoY09O"&gt;Apple’s event today was full of hardware and new products, but the company also took some time to have fun by unveiling a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season. The show — which stars Jason Sudeikis as a perpetually positive football coach who takes on a gig helming an English soccer team — has been one of the breakout hits on Apple TV Plus, the company’s fledgling streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="beiCR8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I always hear the question: who let the dogs out (who who who who)? With respect to The Baha Men, I prefer WHEN let the dogs out (when when when when)? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘Cause guess what, Greyhounds? Our 2nd season starts 7/23! Can I get a Bah Amen!? That’s what I used to think they were called&lt;/p&gt;— Ted Lasso (@TedLasso) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TedLasso/status/1384556102856024073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k4wX62"&gt;Season 2 follows Lasso as he leads...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple unveils a redesigned remote for its new Apple TV 4K</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ZlNorpb2ByNkPP15vvxDBKbkJE=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157146/WcGeQVXeT3.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g60avE"&gt;The Apple TV remote is one of the weakest parts of the company’s set-top box, and Apple is, at last, addressing it today. The company just unveiled a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-unveils-the-next-generation-of-apple-tv-4k%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F18277449%2Fapple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;redesigned Siri remote&lt;/a&gt; alongside its new Apple TV 4K. You’ll get the new remote with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22386298/apple-tv-4k-a12-bionic-price-features-release-date"&gt;new $179 4K set-top box&lt;/a&gt;, or it’s available separately for $59. As well as being compatible with the new Apple TV 4K, it also works with the 2017 model and Apple TV HD. Apple will also sell the remote bundled with the Apple TV HD for $149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4OhwO"&gt;The new Siri remote has an iPod-style scroll wheel, a five-way click pad, touch controls, a mute button, and a power button that can turn your TV on and off. Meanwhile, the Siri button is now on the side of the remote, and Apple says that the voice assistant now works...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IQ2lHr"&gt;Apple has just announced a new Apple TV streaming box, replacing the Apple TV 4K that came out in 2017. The new model retains the name of the prior model but comes with a more powerful A12 Bionic chip that lets it play HDR video at higher frame rates. It’s also powerful enough to support 60FPS Dolby Vision playback over AirPlay from a compatible iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mNwFG"&gt;The old Apple TV 4K, which has been Apple’s flagship set-top box for four years, supports 4K streaming as well as HDR, including Dolby Vision. It also supports Dolby Atmos sound codecs. But it doesn’t support 120Hz refresh rates, which might be important should you ever want to play serious games on an Apple TV. It also has the most notoriously bad remote control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CreNyM"&gt;Fortunately, Apple has...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces $29 AirTag, a new Tile-like item tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dVKWehDNWYWp3kjdEXvEtfrGWhM=/0x0:2142x1428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157033/airtag.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j8KDpM"&gt;Apple is officially launching a Tile-like item tracker that will work with the company’s software and services. Dubbed AirTag, the small circular tag will allow you to track items within Apple’s “Find My” app on iOS. Much like Tile, Apple’s AirTags will be useful for tracking items like keys or wallets, and you’ll be provided with notifications when you’re separated from your item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFHPxJ"&gt;The AirTag itself is a small puck-like device that includes a built-in speaker, accelerometer, Bluetooth LE, and a user-replaceable battery. Apple says the tracker should last for a year of battery life, and you can use an NFC tap to activate a lost mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBClv4"&gt;AirTag will be available for $29 on April 30th, or $99 for a four-pack of the devices. Preorders begin...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

  &lt;p id="U3LDqi"&gt;A monumental change is coming to Apple Podcasts’ business: the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-leads-the-next-chapter-of-podcasting-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22381980%2Fapple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is launching subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; within the Apple Podcasts app. During its spring event today, the company announced that people will be able to subscribe to content from the app for extra perks, like ad-free and bonus content, as well as early access. It’ll launch in 170 regions and countries next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfFnbY"&gt;Initial partners include Pushkin Industries, QCODE, and NPR. It appears that content creators will have to pay Apple $19.99 per year in order to offer subscriptions, and Apple &lt;a href="https://cldup.com/7A0ryPSQNi.pdf"&gt;will take&lt;/a&gt; 30 percent of revenue for the first year and 15 percent for the years following. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yXRzM"&gt;The app is also getting a redesign with channels to help people find new content curated by their favorite...&lt;/p&gt;
