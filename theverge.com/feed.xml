    <title>Updating an Apple Watch Series 3 is a nightmare in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Novi9Y"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 3 was first released in September 2017, bringing fitness improvements and a faster processor. Nearly four years later, in 2021, Apple is still selling the Series 3 as its entry-level Apple Watch model starting at $199, an $80 savings compared to the more recent Apple Watch SE. Only, as I’ve recently learned, “still selling” and “supporting in a reasonable manner” are two very different things, and updating an Apple Watch Series 3 in 2021 is a nightmare of infuriating technological hoops to jump through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoLbgp"&gt;Normally, updating an Apple Watch is an annoyingly long but straightforward process: you charge your Watch up to 50 percent, plug it in, and wait for the slow process of the update transferring and installing to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Basecamp CEO apologizes to staff in new post: ‘We have a lot to learn’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KKoYWie3h97Tve-DeoaFnSxD7Tc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237186/acastro_210427_4564_basecamp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alex Castro/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pGk0QD"&gt;In a new blog post, Basecamp CEO Jason Fried apologized after the “policy changes” he announced last week ultimately led to a third of the company’s workforce opting to leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSiBc3"&gt;“Last week was terrible. We started with policy changes that felt simple, reasonable, and principled, and it blew things up culturally in ways we never anticipated,” Fried wrote. “David and I completely own the consequences, and we’re sorry. We have a lot to learn and reflect on, and we will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQwEBo"&gt;The blog post that started the software company’s terrible week was a &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5"&gt;list of new company policies&lt;/a&gt; that prohibited, among other things, “societal and political discussions” on internal forums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HFRQ9e"&gt;Today’s social and political waters are especially choppy. Sensitivities are at...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Google prematurely announces ‘Pixel Buds A-Series’ with now-deleted tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c_PD1_cHCLjXAnx68fkbmtT5uJI=/82x0:1333x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237170/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_4.56.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X4BOpf"&gt;Google seems to be getting a little ahead of itself. This afternoon, as noticed by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/04/google-pixel-buds-a-series-tweet/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and others, the official Android account on Twitter tweeted a photo of the “Pixel Buds A-Series” and said the earbuds “have arrived.” Except... they definitely haven’t. Google has yet to properly announce the Pixel Buds A-Series, which are expected to be sold at a lower price than the standard $179 model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOM3Pz"&gt;The tweet, which also mentioned the “quality sound and quick Bluetooth pairing” of Google’s latest buds, has since been deleted. Google has a history of, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18663172/google-pixel-4-camera-sensor-design-official-photo"&gt;just tweeting out future products&lt;/a&gt;, but this does seem to have been an error.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bUsgx5"&gt;Google I/O 2021 is scheduled to start in two weeks on May 18th. But based on the mistaken...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Donald Trump’s ‘social media platform’ has launched, and it’s just a blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the US President Donald Trump..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wl3V9r17SPiMhE05YQIpx2lTykA=/13x0:4531x3012/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237068/1230683934.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SnCqg6"&gt;After months of promising &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-social-media-platform-return-adviser"&gt;his own social media network&lt;/a&gt; for banned posters, former President Donald Trump on Tuesday launched a new section of his website that’s essentially just a WordPress blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCVQdi"&gt;The new “platform” is styled like a generic version of Twitter but hosted as &lt;a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/desk"&gt;a running blog of commentary&lt;/a&gt; from Trump. People can sign up for post alerts on the platform through their email and phone numbers and are allegedly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ASankin/status/1389678050422448129"&gt;able to like them&lt;/a&gt;, although that function doesn’t appear to work as of publication. Users are also allowed to share Trump’s posts on Facebook and Twitter. The Twitter sharing option doesn’t currently work, but Facebook’s does allow people to share Trump’s posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nM81zE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new “platform” is effectively a blog styled like a generic...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Dell is issuing a security patch for hundreds of computer models going back to 2009</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D7KgkN"&gt;Dell has released a security patch &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000186019/dsa-2021-088-dell-client-platform-security-update-for-dell-driver-insufficient-access-control-vulnerability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that fixes a security vulnerability affecting&lt;/a&gt; many Dell computers going back to 2009, along with instructions on how to install it if your computer is affected (&lt;a href="https://threatpost.com/dell-kernel-privilege-bugs/165843/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;threatpost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://labs.sentinelone.com/cve-2021-21551-hundreds-of-millions-of-dell-computers-at-risk-due-to-multiple-bios-driver-privilege-escalation-flaws/"&gt;found by security research firm SentinelLabs&lt;/a&gt;, is present in a driver used by Dell and Alienware’s firmware update utilities, and it allows an attacker to gain full kernel-level permissions in Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfQQ5C"&gt;If you have a Dell computer, there’s a good chance it could be vulnerable — &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000186019/dsa-2021-088-dell-client-platform-security-update-for-dell-driver-insufficient-access-control-vulnerability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the list of affected computers on Dell’s website&lt;/a&gt; has over 380 models on it, including some of the latest XPS 13 and 15 models, and the G3, G5, and G7 gaming laptops.

    <title>The best free apps for video calling</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jz5xAw"&gt;Things may be starting to open up, but for now, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to limit face-to-face association and most of us are still relying on video calls to keep in touch with work colleagues, family, and friends. And for most of us — especially those who are facing financial difficulties — free is best. Zoom continues to top the list of videoconferencing apps, but there are a bunch of applications out there that will allow you to meet others online for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBifoi"&gt;We’ve listed a few of the best known videoconferencing apps, along with a couple of popular text chat apps that include video calling features. While most of these already have free versions, some are offering access to additional features for those who are currently...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tinder will now quiz you on your vibes</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sr0SRf"&gt;Tinder wants to give you more info on what you and a match have in common, so it’s launching a new quiz feature to help out. The quizzes, called Vibes, will pop up once a week and ask an assortment of goofy questions, from “_____ is not picnic food” to “Are you always 20 minutes early or 10 minutes late?” Users’ answers will be visible on their profile to other people who have taken the quiz; if two users match, their answers will appear in their chat together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIquEK"&gt;Vibes isn’t turning Tinder into a full-on OkCupid rival for endless, silly personality quiz questions. The answers are temporary, vanishing after a few days. So you’ll have to return to the app and answer new questions the following week if you want to participate again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Tim Sweeney emailed Tim Cook personally to call for open app sales after WWDC in 2015</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jdmmXn"&gt;Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney was asking Apple to open its phones to other app stores as early as 2015, according to new emails made public as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the companies’ antitrust trial&lt;/a&gt;. Under the subject line “iOS as an open platform,” Sweeney &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20697668-tim-sweeney-tim-cook-email-open-ios"&gt;emailed Apple CEO Tim Cook directly&lt;/a&gt; to make the case for allowing other app stores to distribute software on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biLoWU"&gt;“The App Store has done much good for the industry,” Sweeney wrote to Cook, “but it doesn’t seem tenable for Apple to be the sole arbiter of expression and commerce over an app platform approaching a billion users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtfE9M"&gt;In particular, Sweeney asked to “separate iOS App Store curation from compliance review and app distribution,” essentially suggesting that Apple could maintain its security...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti keeps leaking ahead of rumored launch later this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZynro3bRHH8UPFo40KBNptYzJQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69236642/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WJsr7g"&gt;Nvidia appears to be getting ready to launch its RTX 3080 Ti graphics card later this month. Over the past few weeks, RTX 3080 Ti cards have reportedly been spotted on &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-ventus-3x-12gb-spotted-during-transit"&gt;shipping pallets&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-suprim-x-pictured"&gt;retail boxes&lt;/a&gt;, and now in the hands of someone. &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt; has been at the center of tracking down Nvidia’s rumored RTX 3080 Ti card, and it &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-and-rtx-3070-ti-to-be-announced-on-may-31st-launching-in-june"&gt;reports the GPU will be launched on May 31st&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the RTX 3070 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="co66Wj"&gt;The RTX 3080 Ti will reportedly include 12GB of GDDR6X memory, a 2GB increase over what’s found on the RTX 3080. A wider 384-bit bus is rumored, matching the RTX 3090 — and an increase to the memory bandwidth over the RTX 3080. What this all means in terms of performance isn’t exactly clear yet, but it certainly looks like the RTX 3080 Ti will...&lt;/p&gt;
