    <title>Ludwig ends his 31-day stream by breaking Ninja’s all-time sub record</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g6Hjph"&gt;Near the end, Ludwig Ahgren slept a lot. Nestled in his race car bed with a blanket over his face and something new playing in the bottom corner of his screen, Ahgren exuded exhaustion. It was after all day another day in the streamer’s Twitch subathon; he’d been live &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352226/ludwig-subathon-twitch-live-two-weeks-straight"&gt;since March 14th&lt;/a&gt;, and now there was less than an hour left on the clock. Though as he knew, this had happened before. A number close to zero was no guarantee that the stream would end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sp1vah"&gt;Except this time was different, because he’d finally reached the limit he’d set for himself — 31 straight days of streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwBsrt"&gt;Since he started his subathon, Ahgren had become the most subscribed to streamer on Twitch. On the 13th, the day before he took his subathon live, he’d amassed 1,730...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Overwatch League is bringing back some live matches with a trio of events in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qY6-nlNd9QU77-tTPmHtkOlNkAc=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123020/NYXL_Fan_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A 2020 &lt;/em&gt;Overwatch&lt;em&gt; League match at the Hammerstein&amp;nbsp;Ballroom in New York.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: steadyprime&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;NYXL.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ao1T5G"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League kicks off its fourth season this week, and while the majority of matches will be played remotely, today the league announced plans to hold multiple live events in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Or9Cj6"&gt;There will be three events spread across three cities — Hangzhou in June, Shanghai in July, and Guangzhou in August — and the league says they will take place in venues with reduced capacity “in order to comply with local safety requirements.” The events will be something of a hybrid between online and in-person competition. Here’s how OWL describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MVt7Ip"&gt;The five China-based teams — Hunters, Charge, Spark, Valiant, and Dragons — plan to travel to each of the events to compete onstage, while the three Korea-based teams — NYXL, Fusion, and Dynasty — are...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>The next Oculus Quest 2 update brings native wireless PC streaming and a 120Hz mode</title>

&lt;p id="xYFi3f"&gt;Infinite Office is a feature that Oculus includes as part of Oculus Home, which lets users work in a virtual environment. With the v28 update, Infinite Office will have an experimental feature that allows users to add a virtual desk where their real-life desk is, letting users know where they can sit and put real-life physical objects down without having to leave VR. The Quest 2 will also be able to show a virtual representation of the Logitech K830 keyboard, though Facebook says that support for visualizing more...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FBI is remotely hacking hundreds of computers to protect them from Hafnium </title>

  &lt;p id="GW6zzM"&gt;In what’s believed to be an unprecedented move, the FBI is trying to protect hundreds of computers infected by the Hafnium hack &lt;em&gt;by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-effort-disrupt-exploitation-microsoft"&gt;&lt;em&gt;hacking them itself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, using the original hackers’ own tools (via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/fbi-launches-operation-to-remotely-remove-microsoft-exchange-server-backdoors/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Now, the FBI has taken advantage of this by using those same web shells / backdoors to remotely delete themselves, an operation that the agency is calling a success.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US carriers have thankfully abandoned at least one bad plan for RCS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qR0YepDCoxN1VkapUXCRiSdAW6o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69122020/VRG_ILLO_2411_Google_Messaging_3.0.gif" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ppkPbJ"&gt;According to the telecom industry news site &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ossbsscx/verizon-atandt-t-mobile-blow-rcs-launch/d/d-id/768729"&gt;Light Reading, the big three US carriers are walking away from&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;Cross Carrier Messaging Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. The CCMI was meant to be a joint effort to promote RCS, the next-generation messaging standard designed to replace SMS. But while that might seem like bad news on the face of it, what it actually means is that carriers have given up on a bad plan that would have been bad for consumers. Whether or not they will replace it with a &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;plan remains, as ever with RCS, to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUOqAt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;CCMI was launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and by all indications was a joint effort that was spearheaded by Sprint. It initially seemed like a mixed bag of news. At the time, any effort by carriers to support proper...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung teases ‘the most powerful’ Galaxy device is coming at its April 28th Unpacked event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Xi2NDMyTHa6d-YSXcdQ7iR5abo=/247x0:2854x1738/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69121986/Screen_Shot_2021_04_13_at_4.36.25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MPRK9S"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vXN2MOi0s"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new Galaxy Unpacked event set for April 28th at 10AM ET, teasing the announcement of “the most powerful Galaxy” device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWnPZr"&gt;The teaser, as is typical for these invitations, isn’t too forthcoming. But given the nature of the announcement and Samsung’s usual release cycle, there are a few hints we can suss out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbGnAT"&gt;First, the description of whatever Samsung is announcing as “the most powerful Galaxy” would seem to rule out a phone, like the rumored Galaxy Z Fold 3. The most generous depiction of a mobile processor — even one as powerful as Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 888 — still isn’t in the same ballpark as a true laptop processor. And despite recent headlines, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-launch-date-1216922/"&gt;Samsung is still rumored&lt;/a&gt; to reveal the Z Fold 3 at a July...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Detroit man sues police for wrongfully arresting him based on facial recognition</title>

  &lt;p id="lO3tqz"&gt;A man who was falsely accused of shoplifting has &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/michigan-father-sues-detroit-police-department-wrongful-arrest-based-faulty-facial"&gt;sued the Detroit Police Department&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html"&gt;arresting him&lt;/a&gt; based on an incorrect facial recognition match. The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit on behalf of Robert Williams, whom it calls the first US person wrongfully arrested based on facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMBe1c"&gt;The Detroit Police Department arrested Williams in 2019 after examining security footage from a shoplifting incident. A detective used facial recognition technology on a grainy image from the video, and the system flagged Williams as a potential match based on a driver’s license photo. But as &lt;a href="https://www.aclumich.org/en/press-releases/farmington-hills-father-sues-detroit-police-department-wrongful-arrest-based-faulty"&gt;the lawsuit notes&lt;/a&gt;, facial recognition is frequently inaccurate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21031255/facial-recognition-algorithm-bias-gender-race-age-federal-nest-investigation-analysis-amazon"&gt;particularly with Black subjects&lt;/a&gt; and a low-quality picture.

    <title>Gigabyte is announcing three gaming monitors with HDMI 2.1 and TV sizes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RYlkbRoBSfYHMDCnUQH950AdxJs=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69121351/AORUS_4K_Gaming_Monitors_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Gigabyte&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DFyVGn"&gt;Gigabyte has announced three new 4K gaming monitors for its Aorus brand, each features HDMI 2.1, the somewhat hard-to-find display connector that allows for high refresh rate gaming at 4K  (&lt;a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/78707/aorus-fo48u-48-inch-4k-120hz-oled-gaming-monitor-with-hdmi-2-1-tech/index.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TweakTown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Besides having some of the best tech available in TVs or monitors, all three have desk-dominating sizes. According to &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/press-release/aorus-announces-32-43-and-48-inch-4k-gaming-monitors-with-hdmi-2-1"&gt;a press release posted by &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the monitors will also feature VESA’s HDR 1000 standard and come in three sizes: 32, 43, and a mind-boggling (for a gaming monitor anyway; we’ll get back to that) 48 inches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLJEa0"&gt;The 48-inch version is a little different, and it set off a firestorm of discussion at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, so let’s set it aside for just one moment. The 32- and 43-inch monitors, named the FI32U and the FV43U,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CS:GO has a years-old bug that can let a hacker take over your computer</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auo56r"&gt;Hackers have found a new exploit in &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&lt;/em&gt; that could allow a hacker to take control of your computer if you click on a Steam invite to play the popular first-person shooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nC1hh"&gt;The bug was discovered by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/the_secret_club"&gt;The Secret Club&lt;/a&gt;, a white hat hacking group, which found that the hackers can exploit the bug by using Steam’s invite system. Should a victim click on the link, a hacker could acquire private information from anyone who accepts it. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZEuXaG"&gt;Anker has &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/anker-launches-smart-ai-enabled-webcam-and-portable-noise-isolating-conference-speaker-301267988.html"&gt;announced a new webcam&lt;/a&gt; as part of its new AnkerWork line of home office gear. The new webcam, called the PowerConf C300, is a 1080p webcam with a “built-in AI chipset,” which Anker says “provides a high-quality image with accurate color reproduction and unparalleled low-light performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5LL1z"&gt;The webcam offers three field-of-view options: 78 degrees, intended for closeups; 90 degrees; and 115 degrees, which offers a wider field of view. It also has dual stereo microphones that can pick up your voice. The PowerConf C300 is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-AI-Powered-Noise-Cancelling-Microphones-Adjustable/dp/B08RNHCZ3K/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=anker+powerconf+c300&amp;amp;qid=1618338789&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FAnker.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F13%2F22382179%2Fanker-webcam-ankerwork-powerconf-c300-s500-home-office-gear" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt;, and “select retailers,” and it costs $129.99 in the US, €129.99 in Germany, and £119.00 in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
