    <title>Netflix trans employees and allies release a list of demands ahead of the walkout</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TYddrX"&gt;The trans employee resource group at Netflix has released a list of demands for the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723592/netflix-trans-employees-walkout-statements-ceo"&gt;ahead of Wednesday’s walkout&lt;/a&gt;. “We want the company to adopt measures in the areas of content investment, employee relations and safety, and harm reduction, all of which are necessary to avoid future instances of platforming transphobia and hate speech,” employees wrote in a press release, which has not yet been made public but was supplied to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QL7YQ1"&gt;The news comes after weeks of controversy due to Netflix executives continuing to support Dave Chappelle and his comedy special &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which many LGBTQ people and allies have criticized as transphobic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dll4A6"&gt;Last week, Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle"&gt;fired a leader of the trans ERG&lt;/a&gt; who was helping to organize the walkout....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 8 biggest announcements from Apple’s Unleashed event</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="txvrRb"&gt;Apple has just finished its October 2021 event, which was full of news and announcements from the company — including the long-awaited M1-equipped MacBook Pros. There was a whole lot of news, so if you want to get caught up on the biggest updates from the show, you can catch up with our roundup right here.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oDUSLU"&gt;Apple announced two MacBook Pros with an all-new design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6PJZD2"&gt;Apple revealed a brand-new set of MacBook Pros, available in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; models. The Touch Bar is gone, replaced with a full-size function row. Many ports are back; there’s an HDMI port, three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card slot, a headphone jack, and the return of the MagSafe charger. The 14-inch model...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS Monterey is officially launching on October 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/orse-py0bHdXG97r9KiIu70nQRs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012089/akrales_20210515_4583_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LjQqvB"&gt;Following several beta releases, Apple announced that the next version of its macOS software, macOS Monterey, is about to release. It’ll be rolling out as an update starting on Monday, October 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Dr8m8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;My colleague Monica Chin previewed the public beta software&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, highlighting Monterey’s improvements to Facetime. The software will bring other exciting features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;SharePlay and Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, which will enable Mac and iPad users to move files seamlessly between devices, but perhaps not at launch. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-unveils-game-changing-macbook-pro/"&gt;In its press release for the new, redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, Apple says that those features are coming “later this fall.” Additionally, Apple made significant tweaks to Safari, its own web browser, for Monterey, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686070/apple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back"&gt;it has since...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new M1 MacBook Pros are the first with mini LED 120Hz refresh displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MqkmUqKiGp2FPD73T754i2UGx4=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012080/lcimg_81296345_e747_40c4_9960_c33954de9718.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nv7fDm"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;has just announced&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, powered by its newly revealed M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, and featuring a huge jump in display technology for the company’s laptops, with Mini LED displays that support Apple’s 120Hz ProMotion technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncpost-list-post-content-2857077"&gt;The larger 16-inch MacBook Pro has a 16.2-inch display with a 3456 x 2234 resolution, while the 14-inch model has a 14.2-inch panel at 3024 x 1964. Both sizes feature the same Mini LED technology that Apple debuted on the iPad Pro earlier this year, which offers local dimming on a level beyond traditional LED displays (although it’s still not quite on the level of OLED panels used by competitors like Samsung.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncpost-list-post-content-2857105"&gt;The new displays also feature Apple’s 120Hz “ProMotion” technology, which...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple brings MagSafe 3 to the new MacBook Pro</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;MagSafe 3 | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="52peMg"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;ditched MagSafe five years ago&lt;/a&gt; when it moved to USB-C charging on its new laptops, but MagSafe 3 brings the familiar quick-release connector back to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max"&gt;this latest lineup&lt;/a&gt; of MacBook Pro laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple MacBook Pro ports with MagSafe 3&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk4qTX"&gt;Other than their M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; computers ditch the much-hated Touch Bar in favor of physical keys and bring back the additional ports (HDMI, SDXC) power users love. A less familiar addition is the new notch atop those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733122/apple-macbook-pro-mini-led-display-120hz-promotion-refresh-rates"&gt;Mini LED-packed 120Hz displays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2Nebi"&gt;But for the clumsy people with cable-strewn desks, the return of MagSafe — what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;we’ve seen on iPhones&lt;/a&gt; just isn’t the same — might be the most important feature. According to Apple,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn reveals three ‘Foxtron’-branded electric vehicle prototypes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pIjHDjq0aADb-NnbCPzAtYmyunw=/0x0:3868x2579/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012028/foxconn_model_e.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Foxtron Model E sedan.&lt;/em&gt; | Images: Foxconn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jifjLR"&gt;iPhone assembler Foxconn has &lt;a href="https://www.foxconn.com/en-us/press-center/press-releases/latest-news/694"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; three prototype electric vehicles as part of its effort to become a major player in the automotive industry. The Taiwanese conglomerate showed off an SUV it calls the Model C, a sedan it calls the Model E, and a bus dubbed the Model T, all under a new “Foxtron” branding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ssilst"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/article/20140609/OEM02/306099974/why-ford-just-said-no-when-musk-tried-to-put-the-e-in-sex"&gt;Ford may take issue with the naming convention&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t seem that Foxconn plans to make these specific vehicles itself. Rather, it wants them to be seen as reference designs, examples of the types of vehicles that can be built on the EV platform it’s been developing, and advertisements for the automotive components and software it plans to sell. In fact, Foxconn didn’t even build the prototypes — the were made by Taiwanese...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces 16-inch MacBook Pro with new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q3n76A8lOcCeTxI7UKOuQ0M1CsQ=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012026/lcimg_982af7b3_d14a_4a82_8073_a94b6e73fdd5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2xXc9"&gt;Apple has introduced its new 16-inch MacBook Pro, promising an upgrade in both design and performance. Models &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/NK054v" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will be available&lt;/a&gt; in silver and space gray next week, with a starting price of $2,499.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvKeTJ"&gt;The new Pro is configurable with the M1 Pro and the M1 Max, Apple’s new 10-core processors with eight “high-performance” cores and two “high-efficiency” cores. The M1 Max has double the Pro’s GPU cores (32 to the Pro’s 16) and double the memory bandwidth, as well as 64GB of unified memory (the Pro has 32GB). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyW7Ra"&gt;The chassis has also received a modern redesign. The device is 4.7 pounds and 16.8mm thick, with a 16.2-inch display. The Touch Bar has been replaced by physical keys, and there’s an HDMI port on the right side in addition to a Thunderbolt...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new MacBook Pro has a notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3CMwp32ZFRWfA8RZUAGz44A4bc=/25x0:1936x1274/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012024/Apple_MacBook_Pro_16_inch_Photoshop_10182021.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple is bringing the notch to its pro laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="koVG91"&gt;Apple is adding a notch on the display of its new MacBook Pro models. It’s a cut-out that will house the camera system, much like how Apple moved to a notch design for its iPhone X launch in 2017. The surprising addition of the notch comes in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;new 14-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch models&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are equipped with updated Apple M1 silicon inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPNtvK"&gt;Both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are completely redesigned, and the bezels have been trimmed down thanks to this notch. The bezels at the side are 3.5mm — that’s 24 percent thinner than before — and up top, it’s 60 percent thinner. The macOS menu bar now wraps around the camera, and it seems to look a lot better with dark mode enabled so the notch isn’t as noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
     ...&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pzYFl7"&gt;Apple has announced a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-14-and-16/"&gt;redesigned MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which now includes a 14-inch screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;Apple’s new M1 Pro and Max chips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;a notch&lt;/a&gt;, and a wider selection of ports in addition to the standard Thunderbolt ones — it brings back the HDMI port and SD card reader and adds a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733119/apple-new-macbook-pro-magsafe-back"&gt;MagSafe 3 connector&lt;/a&gt; for charging (though you can also charge it with the Thunderbolt ports if your house is littered with USB-C power bricks). It starts at $1,999 and &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/2r5oMg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can be ordered “today.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDMM04"&gt;It has a 14.2” 120Hz ProMotion MiniLED display, which Apple is branding as “Liquid Retina Pro XDR.” It has slimmer bezels than the previous generation but also includes a notch, which houses a 1080p webcam but not Apple’s FaceID system. Resolution-wise, the 14-inch model runs at 3024 by 1964,...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s HomePod Mini ... now in color&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0FT5Ir"&gt;With Siri now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22720890/siri-voice-control-ecobee-smart-thermostats"&gt;socializing on other smart speakers&lt;/a&gt;, Apple took to the stage at its October event to announce a new look for its HomePod Mini smart speaker. In addition to white and black (space gray), you will soon be able to pick up a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod Mini&lt;/a&gt; in yellow, orange, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dctHY3"&gt;Apple is catching up with the competition here. Google’s Nest Mini smart speakers have blue and orange options, and there’s also a blue Amazon’s Echo Dot, plus some fun animal-themed colors offered on the Echo Dot Kids edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ql281U"&gt;The new speakers will have color-matched details throughout, including the tinted touch surface, the fabric mesh, volume icons, and that (non-removable) power cable. They will cost the same as the original Minis, $99, and will &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/kjMyZn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;be available...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
