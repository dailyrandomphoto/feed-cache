    <title>Build-A-Bear’s new Matrix Bear probably doesn’t know kung fu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w0yA6eOuChkndm3KQt3Pgt_JNDs=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251820/matrixbear.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Enter the Bear-trix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5P2SqV"&gt;Build-A-Bear has announced its latest movie tie-in: an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buildabear.com%2Fonline-exclusive-matrix-bear-with-costume%2F329693_29694.html%3Fcgid%3Dshop-by-license-matrix&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22826150%2Fbuild-a-bear-matrix-bear-neo-outfit-teddy-stuffed-animal-toy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;absolutely incredible-looking &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-themed bear&lt;/a&gt; (officially called “Matrix Bear”) just in time for the release of the upcoming fourth film in the absolutely-not-for-children film series, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKPz8X"&gt;Matrix Bear is unique among Build-A-Bear bears, with green and black fur patterned after the iconic “digital rain” effect from the films. It also features &lt;em&gt;The Matrix &lt;/em&gt;logo on one of its feet, with an optional “hacker costume” outfit patterned after Neo’s garb from the films. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy pulls TCL Google TVs amid complaints of slow, buggy software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/speHBcienQnWeFQXFBYRIf-kme4=/20x0:2168x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251693/327063D4_692F_4275_A45A_6A2026E0BFEF.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VaLJJm"&gt;Back in late summer, TCL announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;upgraded version of its high-end 6-Series TV&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from some technical improvements — the newer set fully supports HDMI 2.1 and 4K gaming at 120Hz — the biggest change had to do with software, with the latest 6-Series running Google TV instead of the Roku OS that has shipped on many of TCL’s most popular sets in the United States. The company has already released TVs powered by Android TV internationally and on a few budget models in North America, but the 2021 6-Series was meant to be a combined showcase for TCL hardware and Google software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkl6Du"&gt;So far, it’s not working out that way, and things aren’t going quite as well as TCL might’ve hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XqmHWT"&gt;Some early buyers of the 6-Series with Google TV (model...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Apple employee says she won’t withdraw her labor board complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QhlsXd"&gt;Former Apple employee Cher Scarlett says the company didn’t adequately live up to its half of a settlement, so she won’t withdraw her complaint to the National Labor Relations Board as agreed, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/12/09/ex-apple-engineer-cher-scarlett-reinstates-us-labor-agency-complaint-against-apple"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__8jy2n3rr1sb"&gt;Scarlett says that her settlement with Apple required it to post “a company-wide memo clarifying employee rights including discussing pay &amp;amp; working conditions,” “in a prominent and visible location on the People site.” She says that the company did post a notice to its site, but that it was only up during the week that Apple employees were given off for Thanksgiving. “I’d argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible,” Scarlett &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032"&gt;tweeted on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple has reportedly closed an Apple Store in Texas due to a COVID-19 outbreak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GlyHyyF7X96_IbKY3YI_o7wC6Yk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251538/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Me4IJw"&gt;Apple closed one of its Southlake, Texas retail stores Wednesday after many staff members contracted COVID-19, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/apple/apple-store-texas-closes-covid-outbreak-rcna8000"&gt;according to NBC News&lt;em&gt;’ &lt;/em&gt;Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. A manager told employees Wednesday that 22 staffers “have shared that they’re positive for COVID-19,” NBC News reported, and four of the store’s 151 employees reported positive cases right after Black Friday. The store will be closed through Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnEhom"&gt;NBC News’ report highlights a few worrying trends about the Southlake location. One employee said they had previously raised concerns about being unable to keep social distancing. He and another employee said the store was packed “shoulder to shoulder” on Black Friday. And a manager at the Southlake store apparently had asked employees to come...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford stops taking reservations for the F-150 Lightning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LIRLIa"&gt;Ford has &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/ford-caps-f-150-lightning-reservations-near-200000-production-nears?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;stopped taking reservations&lt;/a&gt; for the all-electric F-150 Lightning as it prepares to start making and shipping the new pickup truck in the first half of 2022. The company says it has collected 200,000 refundable $100 deposits for the Lightning since it debuted in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXPMPy"&gt;That means that anyone not already in line may have to wait a while to buy Ford’s first mass-market electric pickup truck off a dealer lot (or order one from the company’s website). Ford hasn’t said how many it plans to build in 2022, but &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/ford-caps-f-150-lightning-reservations-near-200000-production-nears?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports that the automaker is looking to build as many as 80,000 in 2023. The company has publicly said it wants to build that many in 2024 after originally targeting just 40,000 annually and has been hiring new...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Life360 makes millions selling location data, and it’s about to buy Tile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An iPhone is in the center showing the Life360 app with locations of family members on a map. Surrounding the iPhone are images of trackable items by Tile and people and pets for Life360." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BiVIxwXkL3N4CE163DbmY7grN0E=/91x0:3241x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251172/One_Map_To_Rule_Them_All.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Life360’s marketing image of acquiring Tile is also a reminder of how much data it owns now | Image: Life360&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7UuBs"&gt;Life360, the company that bills its product as a “family safety service,” has been selling location data on its 31 million customers — including kids — since 2016, &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/12/06/the-popular-family-safety-app-life360-is-selling-precise-location-data-on-its-tens-of-millions-of-user"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebad8L"&gt;Former employees from data broker companies told &lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;that Life360 is “one of the largest sources of data” for what has become a $12 billion phone location tracking industry. In November, the company announced it’s reached a deal to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22797559/tile-bluetooth-tracker-location-gps-acquisition-life360"&gt;acquire&lt;/a&gt; the popular item tracking company Tile for $205 million and said it plans to pursue a dual public listing in the US (it’s currently listed on the Australian Securities Exchange) next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="LhNA7t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;there are currently no plans to sell Tile’s data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5G3PH0"&gt;“Our philosophy has been first ... be open with our users with what we are...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch The Game Awards 2021</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wbQOlO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thegameawards.com/"&gt;The Game Awards&lt;/a&gt; are back. The awards ceremony / game conference / concert hosted by Geoff Keighley will deliver a couple hours’ worth of performances (notably, Sting will be playing), game reveals (one of which is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1464812686244401153?s=20"&gt;over two years in the making&lt;/a&gt;), and almost certainly, a few new memes. There have been very few teases as to what we’ll see onstage, but don’t take that as any indication that this could be a quiet show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1THRf"&gt;A few years ago, this is where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21016575/microsoft-xbox-series-x-next-xbox-console"&gt;the debut of the Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; was an unexpected surprise. I wouldn’t expect any game console announcements for this year’s show. What you can expect (even if you’d rather avoid it) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820270/the-game-awards-red-carpet-core-metaverse"&gt;are some metaverse happenings&lt;/a&gt; that aim to give you a more immersive way to experience the Game Awards. Speaking of...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="gk1ivs"&gt;It appears that Louis Vuitton is launching yet another version of its Tambour Horizon Connected Watches.

It’s not dissimilar to Louis Vuitton’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583644/louis-vuitton-horizon-light-up-speaker-design-price-release-date"&gt;bizarre $2,890 light-up speaker&lt;/a&gt; that looks like it belongs in a space opera. There’s a lot that could be written about this thing, from its ostentatious design to its simple feature set. But the big thing to note here is the watch may purportedly forgo Wear OS in favor of a proprietary operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="wufCfX"&gt;Last week, a Reddit user reported that they &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/"&gt;weren’t able to call 911 using their Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; and later said they were working with Google support to figure out the issue. Yesterday, Google &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/hnrvsr1/"&gt;announced what was causing the issue&lt;/a&gt; in a reply to the post: an “unintended interaction between the Microsoft Teams app and the underlying Android operating system” (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/08/android-emergency-calling-bug/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Auq1G4"&gt;In its comment, Google says that the bug happens when someone is using Android 10 or later and has Teams installed but isn’t logged into the app. The company says that Microsoft will be releasing an update to Teams “soon” to prevent the issue and that there’s an update to Android coming January 4th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vur50g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you’re running Android 10 or above and aren’t logged into Teams, uninstall...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
