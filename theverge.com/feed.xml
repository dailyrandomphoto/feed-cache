    <title>Rep. Jamaal Bowman introduces new bill to lower broadband costs</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xXxnDP"&gt;For years, the broadband debate has centered around connecting people living in rural and unserved areas across the country. But while some rural Americans don’t have the infrastructure necessary to connect to the internet, other families in urban communities face difficulties affording what’s already available. Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) is set to introduce a new measure Tuesday that could help millions of households access more affordable broadband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isDiay"&gt;“The more access to broadband people have, the more access and opportunity they have to the world beyond where they currently exist,” Bowman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Tuesday. “The internet is a library. It’s an encyclopedia. It’s information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V7htUt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The internet is a library. It’s an encyclopedia. It’s...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Tinder is giving away free mail-in COVID-19 tests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KHUTiiNBw164I_i5CSFg3sKtQNM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975382/TinderEverywell_NEWgradientBG_hand.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tinder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bVC0w7"&gt;Tinder is giving 500 users a pair of free mail-in COVID-19 test kits — one for them and one for a Tinder match. The company says it’s a way to help people feel more comfortable meeting up with matches for real-life dates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKJXu5"&gt;It’s using tests from the medical testing company EverlyWell. People taking &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.everlywell.com%2Fproducts%2Fcovid-19-test%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F16%2F22333930%2Ftinder-covid-test-free-mail-in-everlywell" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EverlyWell’s coronavirus tests&lt;/a&gt; swab their noses at home and mail the sample to the lab. Results are posted online within one to two days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HgFpk"&gt;Throughout the pandemic, dating app companies have introduced new features to help people date safely. One main focus was on ways to facilitate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324221/tinder-bumble-video-virtual-dating-calls-feature-whyd-you-push-that-button-podcast"&gt;virtual dates&lt;/a&gt;, which are actually a good way to meet people without the risk of spreading or contracting COVID-19. Bumble recently launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325404/bumble-virtual-date-trivia-quiz-social-distancing"&gt;Night In&lt;/a&gt;, a feature that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google antitrust suit takes aim at Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K4Ec_EvpkBEEJu-jHeyEtonebjU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975277/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kzpnw1"&gt;State antitrust watchdogs are targeting Google’s plans to phase out third-party tracking cookies, building on a major lawsuit filed last year. The group of 15 attorneys general, led by Texas, updated its complaint about Google yesterday to include a more detailed case against the search giant, including new claims about Google’s strategic use of the Chrome browser. In particular, the new complaint takes aim at recent privacy updates to Chrome, which could better protect users’ personal data while also entrenching Google’s market position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHbos8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Filed in December&lt;/a&gt;, the Texas complaint is one of three ongoing antitrust cases against Google. That same month, the Colorado attorney general led a group alleging that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;stifled competition by...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: LastPass’ free offering is changing today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJQ2g2HYVUh22Vumczq79YDM3_Q=/0x0:2288x1525/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975067/lpdevicesvault2xmin1png.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LastPass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4rzJsY"&gt;LastPass, the popular password manager, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;announced changes&lt;/a&gt; last month to the free version of its software designed to make its Premium paid version much more attractive — and the free one much less so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iddYPN"&gt;“LastPass offers access across two device types – computers (including all browsers running on desktops and laptops) or mobile&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;devices (including mobile phones, smart watches, and tablets),” the company wrote in a &lt;a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2021/02/changes-to-lastpass-free/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Starting March 16th, 2021” — that’s today — “LastPass Free will only include access on unlimited devices of one type.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OTFzY"&gt;What that means: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;if you’re a LastPass free user, you’ll have to choose&lt;/a&gt; whether you want to access your passwords on your computer — in browser or via desktop app — or on your mobile device. You won’t...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will reduce Play Store cut to 15 percent for a developer’s first $1M in annual revenue</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xe9ZA4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/boosting-dev-success.html"&gt;Google is reducing&lt;/a&gt; its long-standing 30 percent cut, which it takes from each Play Store digital purchase for all Android developers around the world, on the first $1 million they make on the digital storefront each year, starting on July 1st. According to Google, that change means that 99 percent of Android developers that “that sell digital goods or services” will see a 50 percent reduction in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="al4tx8"&gt;Google’s news follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;Apple’s announcement of a reduced 15 percent fee&lt;/a&gt; last year as part of a new small business program, with one critical difference: &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;Apple’s fee reduction&lt;/a&gt; only applies to developers that make under $1 million per year. But if an app maker goes over the $1 million threshold at any point in the year, they’ll be booted from...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s 11th Gen desktop chips are here with faster speeds but fewer cores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1VXr2aM1xMOheCdlRNphASMD4GA=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68974858/RKL_i9_with_Box.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W8j3Mp"&gt;Intel’s next-generation desktop chips are finally here: after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225541/intel-processor-11th-gen-ces-2021-chips-specs"&gt;brief preview at CES&lt;/a&gt;, the company is fully unveiling its 11th Gen Core desktop chips (better known by their codename, Rocket Lake-S.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVHayt"&gt;Leading the pack is Intel’s new flagship chip, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225541/intel-processor-11th-gen-ces-2021-chips-specs"&gt;Core i9-11900K&lt;/a&gt;, with eight cores, 16 threads, boosted clock speeds up to 5.3GHz, support for DDR4 RAM at 3,200MHz, a total of 20 PCIe 4.0 lanes, and backwards compatibility with Intel’s 400 Series chipsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHl4LY"&gt;Eagle-eyed Intel fans might notice that the new chip is, on paper, actually a downgrade from last year’s top model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/30/21242512/intel-10th-gen-desktop-lineup-offers-gaming-processor-speed"&gt;the Core i9-10900K&lt;/a&gt;, which offered 10 cores and 20 threads (and a similar boosted clock speed of 5.3GHz). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMrgTD"&gt;That’s because Intel is debuting a new desktop core architecture for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s experimental storytelling continues with a brief, thrilling single-player event</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="iNWgWF"&gt;I woke up at 3AM this morning so I could help a glowing butterfly save all of reality. At least I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that’s what happened during the most recent mind-bending &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; event, which kicked off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;the game’s new season&lt;/a&gt; and served as a showcase for its narrative ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vW4tn9"&gt;Epic’s battle royale has become defined in part by its massive in-game events. There was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/30/17521122/fortnite-rocket-launch-epic-games-dimensional-rift"&gt;the original rocket launch in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701930/fortnite-epic-games-live-event-mecha-monster-battle-showdown-giant-robot"&gt;the sprawling mech vs. kaiju battle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"&gt;a black hole that erased the original &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;took the game down for several days&lt;/a&gt;. Last season ended with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;Marvel villain Galactus fighting millions of players&lt;/a&gt;, creating a rift that caused multiple realities to converge. These events have been exciting in part because they were shared, something...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="gNbBu6"&gt;Earlier this month, streaming service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299615/paramount-plus-launch-date-price-cbs-all-access-shows-movies"&gt;CBS All Access was rebranded as Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;, combining the franchises and assets from both Viacom and CBS. It offers a wide range of TV shows and movies available to stream from studios and networks such as CBS, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, and Paramount Pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqt494"&gt;If you are interested in &lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/1013037/3065?subId1=VergeDeals031621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F"&gt;subscribing to Paramount Plus and want to save some money&lt;/a&gt;, you can get a one-year subscription with ads for $30, or get a one-year subscription with no ads for only $50. There are a few steps you need to follow to apply the code, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCx2Y1"&gt;First, you will need to go to the Paramount Plus website, click “Try It Free,” and choose the plan you want; at the bottom of the subscription plans, check the box that reads...&lt;/p&gt;
