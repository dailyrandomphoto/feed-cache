    <title>Lime is bringing its electric mopeds to New York City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rGpjZzfBwTiuUGy9PIZpl7XodpI=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204498/Moped_DC__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sja2Mg"&gt;Lime’s bright green electric mopeds are coming to New York City. The company that’s better known for its electric kick scooters will initially roll out 100 mopeds in Queens, Brooklyn, and Lower Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJ5KB6"&gt;It’s the second US market for Lime’s mopeds, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22248805/lime-electric-moped-scooter-niu-washington-paris"&gt;first launching them in Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;.  (The company is also operating a fleet in Paris.) Lime was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383976/nyc-scooter-permit-selection-lime-bird-veoride"&gt;recently approved to deploy 1,000 electric scooters in the Bronx&lt;/a&gt; as part of New York City’s inaugural shared scooter pilot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0GNR8D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the second US market for Lime’s mopeds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X3RiEN"&gt;The mopeds are manufactured by NIU, a Chinese company that also supplies mopeds to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/16/18677586/revel-mopeds-scooter-nyc-review"&gt;New York City-based mobility company Revel&lt;/a&gt;. NIU’s mopeds typically get between 25–100 miles of range. Lime’s mopeds will be speed...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 6 is $249 now at Best Buy and Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The blood oxygen animation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dqFRVtWs7Wj7FD9DSYpZHaRqxcU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204449/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UXw07U"&gt;Best Buy and Amazon are offering the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 (GPS) for $249, smashing yesterday’s discounted price of $299. This model normally sold for $399, and today’s price drop makes it more affordable than — and superior to — the Apple Watch SE that costs $279. The one downside to this promo is that it only loops in the Product Red model that’s all red, which might not go with your look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RDawh"&gt;At this price, it’s currently about $80 more than 38mm-sized Apple Watch Series 3, yet it provides a sizable boost in power and capabilities. For one, the Series 6 has more internal storage. A few other perks of this discounted watch include its always-on display that’s surprisingly efficient, and its ability to take blood oxygen readings. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438413/apple-watch-series-6-se-5-3-comparison-smartwatch-models-versus"&gt;You...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite will support crossplay and cross-progression on Xbox and PC</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U5NFrt"&gt;Microsoft is announcing today that &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinit&lt;/em&gt;e will support crossplay and cross-progression when it launches later this year. This will allow PC and Xbox players to match together and play the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; campaign, and the support also extends to multiplayer. Any multiplayer customization and progress will sync across both PC and Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVJvT1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer mode &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349236/halo-infinite-multiplayer-free-to-play-120fps-rumors"&gt;will also be free to play&lt;/a&gt; when it launches later this year, with support for up to 120fps in the arena mode on Xbox Series X. Microsoft is also ensuring all of the customizations PC players expect are available inside &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite. &lt;/em&gt;This includes support for ultrawide monitors, triple keybinds, advanced graphics options, and other customizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="A21SnY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Halo Infinite: watch 8 minutes of gameplay on Xbox Series X","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"},{"title":"Microsoft confirms Halo Infinite multiplayer will be free-to-play and up to 120fps ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349236/halo-infinite-multiplayer-free-to-play-120fps-rumors"},{"title":"Halo Infinite is looking a lot better in these 4K screenshots ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22302094/halo-infinite-4k-screenshots-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="S5hkAV"&gt;We’re now waiting to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s library redesign makes it easier to find your downloaded content</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ri8Wis"&gt;Spotify is trying again to make its Your Library tab easier to navigate. It’s &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-29/listeners-can-explore-their-spotify-collections-faster-and-easier-with-a-new-your-library"&gt;introducing&lt;/a&gt; dynamic filters, a new grid view, the ability to pin content, and different sorting options. The changes are coming to all users across iOS and Android over the coming week. The filters will likely be the most useful change, with users being able to filter between album, artist, playlist, or podcast. Premium users can also choose to view only downloaded content, which, up until now, has been hard to find within Spotify without scrolling through every artist and album they’ve saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K14lZA"&gt;Users can also choose to pin four playlists, albums, or podcast shows that’ll show up at the top of their content. To pin, swipe right on what you want to keep at the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft shakes up PC gaming by reducing Windows store cut to just 12 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJHMC2LiwaIdhtYqrumVnd9STdE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204323/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uhzx1p"&gt;Microsoft is shaking up the world of PC gaming today with a big cut to the amount of revenue it takes from games on Windows. The software giant is reducing its cut from 30 percent to just 12 percent from August 1st, in a clear bid to compete with Steam and entice developers and studios to bring more PC games to its Microsoft Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ntGFw"&gt;“Game developers are at the heart of bringing great games to our players, and we want them to find success on our platforms,” says Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios at Microsoft. “A clear, no-strings-attached revenue share means developers can bring more games to more players and find greater commercial success from doing so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkPAYp"&gt;These changes will only affect PC games and not Xbox console games in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku does customizable buttons right on the Voice Remote Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LZ-EGmE6YSNq_MtkdoB5kTavNR0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204223/cwelch_20210428_4565_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pLVDcf"&gt;Roku has a strange relationship with remotes: it’s one of the worst offenders when it comes to branded buttons, with a seemingly ever-rotating list of streaming services — Netflix, Sling, even Rdio at one point — that have come and gone over time. One of its remotes even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21436977/roku-touch-remote-button-useless-design-purpose-feature-software-update"&gt;bears a mysterious glyph&lt;/a&gt; that’s never been used for anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pt4Fcb"&gt;And yet, Roku also leads the pack when it comes to customizability. For the last couple years, some of its remotes have offered programmable buttons, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22391174/roku-voice-remote-pro-review-features-price"&gt;its recently released Voice Remote Pro&lt;/a&gt; elevates them to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QxUk3b"&gt;The programmable shortcut keys, labeled with just a 1 and a 2, are almost infinitely customizable. And Roku actually has the software support to back them up in an easy and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Returnal is dark, challenging, and the perfect PS5 showcase</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PRQG8S"&gt;We’re nearly six months into the life of the current generation of game consoles, but there are still vanishingly few high-profile exclusives that show off what the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X can do. After getting through the initial wave of launch titles, I’ve spent most of 2021 using my PS5 to play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. But this week sees the launch of &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, a PS5 exclusive that comes with some caveats. It’s challenging and complex, making it the kind of game you’ll die in repeatedly. But it also might be the best showcase for Sony’s new console yet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvRiUG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; puts you in the spaceboots of an astronaut experiencing the worst case of deja vu imaginable. After crash landing on a mysterious alien planet, she soon realizes she’s stuck in a...&lt;/p&gt;

Once issued, such takedown notices will apply across the EU, with countries able to levy financial penalties against firms that refuse to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sKwlT"&gt;The legislation will come into force 12 months after it is published in the EU’s &lt;a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/oj/direct-access.html"&gt;official journal&lt;/a&gt;, a standard step for all EU law. It will then have to be adopted by each member state.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EV charging network ChargePoint now supports Android Auto  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Q4crVHGD5kpCNXPN0D7ZvbmWmU=/162x0:1356x796/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203865/Android_Auto_Screens_Nearby_Stations.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The integration lets you view charging stations directly from your car’s infotainment screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: ChargePoint&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qdPP52"&gt;ChargePoint, operator of one of the largest EV charging networks across Europe and North America, is adding support for Android Auto to its app. The functionality means Android phone users will be able to find, navigate to, and start charging from a ChargePoint charging station from their car’s infotainment screen, without having to pick up their phone.
