    <title>Microsoft Office is now updated for M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y1GLPv"&gt;If you’ve been using Microsoft Office on an M1 Mac, it’s about to get better — &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2020%2F12%2F15%2F4-ways-microsoft-365-is-improving-the-experience-for-mac-users%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft is announcing an update&lt;/a&gt; today that brings native support for Apple’s new custom chip architecture to the Windows productivity suite. The apps getting the updates are Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Notably absent, however, is Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIdd2Z"&gt;The updates are making the apps universal ones — meaning these versions will run on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, so any upcoming updates or features will be coming at the same time for both platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXhJja"&gt;If you’re a heavy user of Teams, you may be disappointed to hear that it hasn’t been included in today’s rollout of updates. Microsoft promises they’re working on that platform in their blog post, but...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this WSJ documentary about living on digitally after you die</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Abstract waves (SHUTTERSTOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3OLYyPEFNEDEqrJFllB3QeWIZmo=/0x74:1100x807/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517200/shutterstock_52715227_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UEWM61"&gt;How do you want to be remembered after you die? A new documentary from &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; tech reporter (and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; alum) Joanna Stern examines the idea of what it means to pass on a digital legacy, and how we think about preserving our identities after death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXCtUR"&gt;She interviews Lucy, a young woman with a medical condition who is bound to a wheelchair and needs a feeding tube. Lucy is acutely aware of creating a digital footprint that will outlive her, but her mother Kate is not so certain about what may comfort her if Lucy passes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhwJtC"&gt;Stern also spoke to James Vlahos, a man who recorded interviews with his terminally ill father and created a “Dadbot” to keep his father’s personality traits — as well as his jokes and his singing — alive...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spelunky is coming to the Switch along with other great-looking indies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dAnM6_jrtWL8t7DFUgf8q1pNV9E=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516875/50343276481_8cbf4a7507_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wSvMCN"&gt;At its latest indie showcase, Nintendo revealed a handful of intriguing titles coming to the Switch in 2021. The biggest reveal is that &lt;em&gt;Among Us,&lt;/em&gt; one of 2020’s biggest games, isn’t just coming to the Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176459/among-us-nintendo-switch-cross-play-launch"&gt;but it’ll be available later today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rx4Rq"&gt;There were plenty of other cool announcements as well. One of the most notable reveals was that classic rouguelike series &lt;em&gt;Spelunky&lt;/em&gt; is coming to the Switch next year. That includes both the original &lt;em&gt;Spelunky&lt;/em&gt; as well as &lt;em&gt;Spelunky 2&lt;/em&gt;, with local multiplayer for both (and online for the sequel) in summer 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5VCdz"&gt;Other reveals include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HGBLPO"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fisti-fluffs&lt;/em&gt;, a physics-based brawler about cats wreaking havoc in an empty house, will launch in early 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rK9l5H"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tunche&lt;/em&gt;, a hand-drawn action game about exploring a fantasy...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Among Us launches for the Nintendo Switch today</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7qxoMw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, Innersloth’s breakout hit of 2020, is coming to the Nintendo Switch today. The news was announced during a special indie game-focused Nintendo Direct. The game will feature crossplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xzsfn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is an online social deduction game, one in which players have to work together to complete tasks around the ship and figure out who the crew’s imposters are. Imposters, meanwhile, attempt to quietly kill as many other players as they can. Although the game first launched in 2018, it’s become a sensation, thanks to a newfound popularity on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452358/fall-guys-among-us-twitch-facebook-gaming"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, played by streamers and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523878/aoc-twitch-stream-among-us-pokimane"&gt;Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; has become so popular, in fact, that Innersloth &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;canceled the game’s sequel&lt;/a&gt; to focus on improving the original. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA Play won’t come to Xbox Game Pass for PC until 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EOh1g2"&gt;PC gamers subscribed to Xbox Game Pass for PC or the pricier Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier will need to wait just a little while longer until they have access to EA Play on Windows machines. Today, Microsoft announced that EA Play would arrive on PC as part of Xbox Game Pass sometime in 2021. Originally, the partnership was supposed to &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/15/update-on-ea-play-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-2021/"&gt;go into effect today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpXa0q"&gt;“We established this partnership with Electronic Arts because they are as passionate as we are about helping people and communities discover great games, and we knew we could provide a great experience for members by working together. In order to deliver on that, we need more time to provide the Xbox Game Pass experience,” reads &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/15/update-on-ea-play-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-2021/"&gt;a Microsoft blog post published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos will soon be able to add a 3D effect to 2D photos</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0hwFDQ"&gt;Google Photos will soon be able to take your 2D images and make them appear as if they’re 3D, the company announced in a blog post on Tuesday. Google is calling these types of images “Cinematic photos,” and they’re a new type of image the app can show as part of its Memories feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpYDO0"&gt;Here’s a GIF from Google comparing a 2D image to a Cinematic photo. I think the feature looks pretty impressive:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WIOWAI"&gt;To make Cinematic photos, “we use machine learning to predict an image’s depth and produce a 3D representation of the scene—even if the original image doesn’t include depth information from the camera,” Jamie Aspinall, a Google Photos product manager, writes in Tuesday’s blog. “Then we animate a virtual camera for a smooth panning...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad’s new leather MacBook Pro sleeves are luxurious but pricey</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B23XwTLixrhWFayQZQMAtkaQSDg=/114x0:1926x1208/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516593/Untitled_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="khMIkp"&gt;Accessory company Nomad is expanding its case lineup once again with its first &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Flaptop-sleeve-horween-leather-rustic-brown-macbookpro-16-inch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F15%2F22176171%2Fnomad-new-leather-macbook-pro-sleeves-luxury-expensive-price-release-date-hands-on#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro sleeves&lt;/a&gt;, available today. The cases might be the nicest that Nomad has made so far, but with a starting price of $229.95 (for the 13-inch model) and $249.95 (for 16-inch MacBook Pros), they’re also the most expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8gWsh"&gt;The MacBook Pro cases are made out of the same brown Horween leather that Nomad uses for most of its products. But instead of the plastic shell the company uses on its iPhone cases (which I’m less of a fan of), the new cases are just solid expanses of leather on the outside, backed by EVA foam to keep your computer safe, with a final layer of microfiber cloth for the interior. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;p id="cBnkZL"&gt;Google Meet is adding live captions on the web in four languages to make meetings more inclusive, the &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/12/additional-language-support-for-live-captions.html"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Live captions in Spanish, French, German, and Portuguese will be available across all versions of Meet starting today. Meet rolled out real-time captions in English last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WJhYP"&gt;“We know from our work with teachers and parents over the years how essential caption tools can be for students with learning disabilities, as well as English-language learners in both K-12 and higher education,” Google Workspace project manager Philip Nelson wrote in a blog post announcing the update. “By expanding live captions to more languages, we can help more students feel empowered to participate, and help more teachers share a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s not as easy to get a Cyberpunk 2077 refund as CD Projekt Red suggested</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h21efq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; developer CD Projekt Red has confirmed it has no special refund agreement with Microsoft or Sony, despite saying dissatisfied players should return their copies of the game in a statement. It means players are covered by both platforms’ standard refund policies, which, in the case of Sony, explicitly prohibits refunds if you’ve already started playing a game “unless the content is faulty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8SpLo"&gt;The confirmation came from the company’s senior vice president of business development, Michał Nowakowski, on an &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2020/12/call-transcript_en.pdf"&gt;investor call&lt;/a&gt; held on Monday evening. “Microsoft and Sony have refund policies for every product that is released digitally on their storefronts,” Nowakowski said. “Despite several articles I’ve seen that things are being set...&lt;/p&gt;
