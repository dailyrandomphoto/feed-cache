    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niantic and a crypto debit card company made an AR game where you earn Bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from the Niantic/Fold app Fold AR." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L-K1yZudSGdGIvUoJxgMQPQNlYU=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183191/AR_Marketing_Subway.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jJSUpu"&gt;Have you ever played &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; and thought, “I wish this game let you earn small amounts of Bitcoin by engaging with internet finance memes and a cryptocurrency debit card system?” If so, I don’t believe you, but I have good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwj6i9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fold AR&lt;/em&gt; is a new augmented reality game from &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; developer Niantic and the financial company Fold. The game — which a press release dubs part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt; — is very loosely modeled on &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;but themed around cryptocurrency. As explained by Fold CEO Will Reeves, it runs with the metaphor of “mining” Bitcoin. So instead of capturing cute monsters, the central mechanic involves finding cubes of binary code and tapping them like &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; blocks until they reveal a prize.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0y8ycM"&gt;The prizes...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The AirPods Pro with MagSafe hit an all-time low of $159 on an early Black Friday deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iObYZbicahrhp4pLOgBoRIMoBjo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183080/cwelch_191031_3763_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="1UIw3f"&gt;The Black Friday season just keeps on rolling, and we keep seeing such &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;exceptional early deals&lt;/a&gt; day in and day out. If things keep up at this rate, we may all go broke by the time Black Friday actually arrives — but wow, will we have saved so much money on the coolest tech in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJeVro"&gt;As the days go on, we continue to track the latest deals we can find for you.

&lt;p id="nZZNoo"&gt;Today is no exception, where we have the best price ever on the AirPods Pro.

    <title>Hawkeye starts out strong because it doesn’t take itself too seriously</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hawkeye" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTmFGXmeWhvRBy-BOQlWy06pLtI=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183028/APT_102_06114_R5.G.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Chuck Zlotnick / Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HkKgUG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; is a few different things. It’s a chance to spend more time with one of the lesser-known Avengers, it’s an origin story for an up-and-coming hero, and it’s a detective drama set amidst the backdrop of Christmas in New York City as the MCU adds yet another genre to its all-enveloping fold. Most importantly, though, it’s a Marvel series that doesn’t take itself too seriously — making the first two episodes unexpectedly fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5puQE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This review contains some light spoilers for the first two episodes of Hawkeye.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WujvMW"&gt;Though it’s named after the bow-wielding Avenger, &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; really is a story about two people. Yes, one of those is Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), a surly hero and one-time vigilante who is now doing his best to enjoy life with his...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arc raises $30 million to power its electric boat ambitions</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jAJH1t"&gt;Electric boat startup Arc has raised $30 million just five months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598790/arc-one-electric-boat-photos-interview"&gt;coming out of stealth mode&lt;/a&gt; and has started putting its first prototype through its paces. The Series A funding round was led by Greg Reichow, a partner at Eclipse Ventures and a former vice president of production at Tesla. The round also includes existing Arc investors like Andreessen Horowitz and celebrities like Will Smith, Kevin Durant, and Sean “Diddy” Combs, who &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/will-smith-kevin-durant-and-sean-diddy-combs-invest-in-electric-boat-startup-arc/"&gt;first put money into the startup in October&lt;/a&gt; through their own funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8tqvl"&gt;Arc aims to sell a limited number of its first electric boat, the 24-foot Arc One, at an extraordinary price of $300,000 before moving on to making more affordable boats. It plans to justify that price by promising a much lower cost of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amid calls for CEO resignation, Activision Blizzard announces a workplace committee</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xbdEJC"&gt;In the fight against ongoing allegations of harassment, discrimination, and complaints of insufficient action to address such allegations, Activision Blizzard’s board of directors has announced that the publisher is forming a new committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9yzjdm"&gt;The Activision Blizzard board of directors today announced that it has formed a ‘Workplace Responsibility Committee,’ initially comprised of two independent directors, to oversee the company’s progress in successfully implementing its new policies, procedures, and commitments to improve workplace culture and eliminate all forms of harassment and discrimination at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rIb8WE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-board-directors-continues-build-upon-its"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; — delivered at an extremely late hour during an employee holiday week granted hours before the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Porsche acquires a majority stake in high-end electric bike maker Greyp</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ZwNae"&gt;Croatian electric bike manufacturer Greyp Bikes has a new majority shareholder: Porsche. The sports car manufacturer’s venture capital arm, Porsche Ventures, has held a stake of around 10 percent in the e-bike company since 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zwEMmW"&gt;Greyp (pronounced like the fruit) was founded Mate Rimac — aka &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55938754"&gt;“Croatia’s Elon Musk”&lt;/a&gt; — the brainchild behind electric supercar startup Rimac Automobili. The company makes highly connected, extremely powerful electric mountain bikes, including the $10,000 flagship, full-suspension G6. The company sells its bikes in Europe and recently launched its US operations based in San Pedro, Calif. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uHxnne"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The investment is another sign of Porsche’s confidence in Rimac’s business prowess&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Reddit winds down Dubsmash, but its video creation tools live on</title>

After February, the app will no longer be available on apps stores and will stop functioning on devices that already have the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Feyuj"&gt;A competitor to TikTok, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173774/reddit-acquires-dubsmash-tiktok-rival-short-form-video-tools"&gt;Dubsmash was acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Reddit late last year with the purpose of embedding its video creation tools into the larger platform. Now that the integration is nearing completion, Reddit is introducing a slew of new video creation tools to its own TikTok-like video feed, courtesy of the Dubsmash team that came over with the buyout.&lt;/p&gt;
