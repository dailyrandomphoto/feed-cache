    <title>Google sets new water goals as droughts worsen </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7AKB3I"&gt;With drought sucking the Western US dry, Google announced new plans to protect vital water resources. Google guzzles up water to cool its data centers, three of which are in the drought-stricken West. To offset its thirst, the company said that by 2030, it wants to replenish 120 percent of the water it consumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JotJgA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google guzzles up water to cool its data centers, three of which are in the drought-stricken West&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g9C9in"&gt;Google laid out three strategies to accomplish that goal: using water more efficiently in its operations, partnering with communities to make watersheds healthier, and offering its technologies as tools to predict and prevent water stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svlgc9"&gt;The company has faced &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-04-01/how-much-water-do-google-data-centers-use-billions-of-gallons?sref=7mwUMHq1"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt; from communities near its data center in South Carolina and a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Jio’s smartphone collaboration has been delayed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3U7MdyLIpYSaVzSMTTKwHi5EUq0=/1x0:835x556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838947/jiophone_next_google.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Jio Platforms&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bklin2"&gt;The JioPhone Next, a smartphone being jointly developed by Google and Indian tech giant Jio Platforms, has missed its planned September 10th launch date, the &lt;a href="https://www.ril.com/getattachment/9071467e-5a43-415e-bfed-b831d0360df8/JioPhone-Next-in-Advanced-Trials,-with-Festive-Sea.aspx"&gt;companies have announced&lt;/a&gt;. The delay is needed to give both companies more time to refine the device, and to navigate problems created by the global semiconductor shortage. The JioPhone Next is now scheduled for wide release around Diwali, which will take place in early November. The phone is currently in testing with a small number of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fidBXi"&gt;The phone is designed to be an affordable 4G smartphone to help the roughly 300 million Indian users currently on 2G networks upgrade to 4G. When it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548453/jiophone-next-google-android-smartphone-affordable"&gt;announced the phone in June&lt;/a&gt;, Jio’s parent company Reliance said it would include voice...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi promises its 120W fast charger won’t kill its new phone’s battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shoppers are seen leaving the Chinese multinational..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qU_JsUcuMu9inFyT4qdB0knyVvo=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838893/1235139501.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pf8peD"&gt;If you’ve been following the Chinese phone scene for the past few years, you’ll have noticed the inescapable fast-charging arms race. It feels like every few months there’s a new champion, with high-wattage chargers constantly pushing down the time it takes to fill a phone battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1130hI"&gt;This month, Xiaomi is making its biggest effort yet to bring its “HyperCharge” technology to a mainstream, global audience. The upcoming Xiaomi 11T Pro has a 120W charger, a huge power increase on the current global flagship Mi 11, which uses a 55W charger that can get you to 100 percent in 45 minutes. Xiaomi hasn’t revealed estimating charging times for the 11T Pro yet, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s China-only Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; also had a 120W charger that took just 23 minutes...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam’s downloads page just got a lot more informative</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJETzbnAXPMPO6V2nhtyxku5Vz0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838769/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xmtZWj"&gt;Valve has just released a &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/2941402621044012222"&gt;big update for Steam&lt;/a&gt; that offers a number of small but significant tweaks to the digital games store. Many of these changes have been &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/steam-client-beta-overhauls-downloads-page-and-storage-management-looks-great/"&gt;available in beta for months&lt;/a&gt;, but now they’re hitting the software’s stable release channel. The update overhauls the downloads page and introduces a much improved section for managing your storage, amongst a host of other tweaks and fixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWFF0a"&gt;The downloads page has seen the bulk of the improvements. For starters, as well as showing download progress, the page also now shows installation progress. It should cut down on those frustrating moments when a game appears to be fully downloaded but isn’t playable because it’s not yet fully installed. The priority of downloads in the queue...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Material You design is coming to Gmail, Calendar, and Docs on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qe9tgoEPg8imvzWOdIKxwU63pT8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838608/acastro_201210_1777_gmail_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RitgUJ"&gt;Google is starting to roll out its new Material You design system to Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and more on Android. The new look will include changes to navigation bars, improved action buttons, and Google’s Sans text for better readability. It’s part of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;bigger Android 12 redesign&lt;/a&gt; that includes big, bubbly buttons, shifting colors, smoother animations, and some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663710/android-12-beta-5-ui-updates-features-clock-widgets-search-bar-calculator"&gt;overhauls to built-in apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYtqg5"&gt;The design changes mean Pixel devices with Android 12 or newer will be able to match the colors inside apps like Gmail, Google Meet, and Google Drive with their wallpapers for &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/09/material-you-for-android.html"&gt;what Google calls&lt;/a&gt; a “more dynamic, personalized look.” Existing color schemes and color-coded file types and folders will remain unchanged within the apps, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly overcomes Watch Series 7 manufacturing issues</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sw59Vp6iuCSMLr2W7hB1I19xOFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838523/apple_watch_series_6_dbohn_821.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hnmit8"&gt;Apple has reportedly overcome the production issues it’s been having with its unreleased smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 7, and will now begin mass manufacturing the device in mid-September, according to a report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/kuo-apple-watch-series-7-ship-late-sept/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The news comes as Apple gears up for a major launch event on September 14th. The fall event will presumably be focused on its latest iPhone models with the new Apple Watch also expected to make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAzCXE"&gt;Late last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had temporarily halted production of its latest smartwatch while it fixed the problems. The issues were thought to be related to the Series 7’s revamped design, which is said to consist of “&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;a flatter display and edges&lt;/a&gt;”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music is adding more DJ mixes with new features powered by Shazam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T2ZQnxXtXtKmSK-HQGqIANMbcsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838305/acastro_210831_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="quFQc3"&gt;Last year Apple showed how it could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444506/apple-ios-14-2-beta-shazam-identify-music-phone-apps-headphones"&gt;embed Shazam’s music identification features even more deeply within iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s taking things another step forward within Apple Music. Apple Music initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11235428/apple-music-stream-remixes-dj-mixes-dubset"&gt;introduced DJ mixes and mash-ups in 2016 through a partnership with Dubset Media Holdings&lt;/a&gt; to identify and pay for licensed music within mixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uj1TvW"&gt;Now Apple says that by building upon the Shazam tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896350/apple-shazam-app-acquisition-complete-free"&gt;acquired in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and partnering with various labels, Apple Music has the tools to identify and compensate individual creators, event promoters, labels, etc. It also allows subscribers to see the names of individual tracks, skip songs within the mix, listen with lossless audio on “most mixes,” and save them to their library for viewing offline. &lt;/p&gt;
...

    <title>Apple won’t let Epic bring Fortnite back to South Korea’s App Store</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLYuio"&gt;Apple says it won’t let Epic Games back in the App Store until they agree to “play by the same rules as everyone else.” Earlier today &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665826/epic-games-apple-reinstate-fortnite-ios-korea-app-store-payment"&gt;Epic asked Apple&lt;/a&gt; to reinstate its developer account so that it could re-release the iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in South Korea, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; forcing Apple and Google to allow alternate in-app payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BVTLT"&gt;Apple, however, maintains it’s under no obligation to let Epic in the App Store at all. “As we’ve said all along, we would welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else,” an Apple spokesperson says in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Epic has admitted to breach of contract and as of now, there’s no legitimate basis for the reinstatement of their...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vivo finally adopts wireless charging with new X70 Pro Plus flagship</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1f8OIT"&gt;Vivo has announced the X70 series, its latest line of flagship phones. It sees the company further extend its camera partnership with renowned lens company Zeiss while refining the blueprint laid down by the X50 and X60 phones from the past year-plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfwdW3"&gt;The X70 Pro Plus is the top-of-the-line device, featuring a Snapdragon 888 Plus processor, a 6.783-inch (yes that’s the stated spec) 1440p OLED screen, and a 4,500mAh battery that uses Vivo’s 55W FlashCharge technology. More importantly, it has 50W wireless fast charging that also works with Qi. This is Vivo’s first ever phone to support wireless charging, which should make it a more viable switching option for anyone who’s already put Qi chargers all over their house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9QWaP"&gt;The X70 Pro Plus’...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="xfqpAL"&gt;Apple has fired senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly violating the company’s rules against leaking confidential information. For months, Gjøvik has been tweeting openly about allegations of harassment, surveillance, and workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="O0K58X"&gt;Gjøvik has raised concerns that her office is in an Apple building located on a superfund site, meaning it requires special oversight due to historical waste contamination....&lt;/p&gt;
