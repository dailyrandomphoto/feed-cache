    <title>AT&amp;T is reportedly in talks to merge its media business with Discovery</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vlDm8s"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery are in talks that would combine AT&amp;amp;T’s media business with Discovery’s reality-TV dynasty to create a massive new entertainment entity, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/at-t-is-said-in-talks-to-combine-content-assets-with-discovery-kor6r2uj?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources. Neither company confirmed the deal, but if it came to pass, the combined company would be a potentially significant competitor for streaming brands like Netflix and Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gm5ih"&gt;But as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, AT&amp;amp;T only recently added some major entertainment brands to its portfolio when it &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-m-a-at-t/att-closes-85-billion-deal-for-time-warner-idUSKBN1JA36U"&gt;acquired Time Warner for $85 billion&lt;/a&gt;, a deal that was finalized in 2018. And while AT&amp;amp;T’s streaming channel HBO Max has performed relatively well since its somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21268490/hbo-max-launch-price-warnermedia-att-dc-harry-potter-friends-disney-netflix-peacock"&gt;messy launch last May&lt;/a&gt;, it’s still not quite as robust as older streamers like Netflix. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212963/new-discovery-plus-streaming-channel-roku-hbo-peacock"&gt;Discovery...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon debuts free video-streaming service MiniTV in its India app</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H06VAa"&gt;Amazon has launched an ad-supported, free video streaming service called MiniTV within the Amazon India app, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a different offering than its separate Amazon Prime Video service, as MiniTV is contained within Amazon’s traditional shopping app, rather than its own standalone app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0VhbT"&gt;Only available to users in India, MiniTV’s catalog includes mostly older content which its content partners made originally for YouTube and other platforms. The lineup includes beauty and fashion content, tech news, and cooking shows, and Amazon’s partners for the channel include Indian web content studios Pocket Aces and TVF, and  list of well-known Indian comedians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wyz1dN"&gt;The company says it’s planning “new and exclusive videos” in the coming...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New leak ahead of Google I/O claims Android 12 may include changes for widgets and notifications </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kdTvT_cLRm-gr8gouPHYteBvyqY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69294807/VRG_1777_Android_12_005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ClIYju"&gt;Just ahead of Google I/O, which gets underway on Tuesday, a new leak purporting to be a preview of what’s coming during the annual developers’ conference gives some insight into what Android 12 might look like. A new &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRd8v2eRAA&amp;amp;ab_channel=FRONTPAGETECH"&gt;video from Jon Prosser&lt;/a&gt; shows what appear to be slides from a presentation of Android 12.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzHcVl"&gt;The first slide sets up what to expect: “A beautiful new experience,” “Stronger privacy and security protections,” and “All of your devices work better together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKLg96"&gt;The usual caveats about leaked materials apply, of course; there’s no guarantee this is what the final interface will look like, or how much may be announced during I/O. But the most interesting slide in Prosser’s video shows what appears to be a new user interface for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cloudflare says it’s time to end CAPTCHA ‘madness’, launches new security key-based replacement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_SHlkE8mjS_Vw3NWwyJtyiB7Fg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69294752/akrales_190220_3226_0034.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dIXSKy"&gt;Cloudflare, which you may know as a provider of DNS services or the company telling you why the website you clicked on won’t load, wants to replace the “madness” of CAPTCHAs across the web with an entirely new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAkTSp"&gt;CAPTCHAs are those tests you have to take, often when trying to log into a service, that ask you to click images of things like busses or crosswalks or bicycles to prove that you’re a human. (CAPTCHA, if you didn’t know, stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.”) The problem is, they add a lot of friction to using the web and can sometimes be difficult to solve — I’m sure I’m not the only person who has frustratingly failed a CAPTCHA because I didn’t see that corner of a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this look at how Clubhouse’s blocking system is problematic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Clubhouse logo is seen on a smartphone screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vSBa-42nkkLrr3HsumM29jx2uG8=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292986/1232816107.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lRKsUn"&gt;Anyone who’s spent more than five minutes on social media can tell you that most platforms have plenty of trolls, reply-guys and other people who may just be unpleasant to interact with. On big platforms like Twitter, Faecbook, and Instagram, the option to block another user allows you to keep someone out of your feed. Blocking is far from a perfect solution, but at least it gives users a way to continue to use the platforms and avoid (some) nasty interactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsBh1h"&gt;But as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/05/clubhouse-has-blocking-problem/618867/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;Will Oremus writes for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the year-old audio chat platform Clubhouse has a different mechanism for blocking, one that affects more than just the blocker and the blockee (I know, but what would you call it?): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ugrqj0"&gt;When you block someone on Clubhouse, it doesn’t just...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Colonial Pipeline says operations back to normal following ransomware attack</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CeagMe"&gt;Colonial Pipeline said Saturday that all of its systems are back to operating normally, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;pipeline it shut down a week ago&lt;/a&gt; amid a ransomware attack. The pipeline is now servicing all its markets including Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Washington, DC, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, the company tweeted. Colonial carries 45 percent of the fuel supplies for the eastern United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YprrWR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As we previously reported, Colonial Pipeline initiated the restart of pipeline operations at approximately 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, May 12. Since that time, we have returned the system to normal operations, delivering millions of gallons per hour to the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is reportedly continuing a ban on anti-coup groups in Myanmar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWuyZsTB73Jql1G3uPp3vwWD6rA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292441/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3amtd"&gt;Facebook has reportedly upheld a ban on many organizations in Myanmar that have joined forces to resist the military coup that occurred back in February, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/facebook-is-still-censoring-groups-fighting-the-military-coup-in-myanmar/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The bans were put in place back in 2019, when organizations like the Arakan Army, and many of its allies, were classified as terrorist organizations by the democratically-elected government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IE5Jnd"&gt;Things have changed in Myanmar since then. After the military coup and government takeover by the Tatmadaw (carried out after an election which &lt;a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/election-fraud-01282021184631.html"&gt;the military claims was fraudulent&lt;/a&gt;), the political situation has become extremely complex. There is, however, one thing that is seemingly clear: the Arakan Army is no longer classified as a terrorist organization, either by the &lt;a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-military-regime-removes-arakan-army-list-terrorist-groups.html"&gt;c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter may be working on Twitter Blue, a subscription service that would cost $2.99 per month</title>

  &lt;p id="IV4i7C"&gt;Twitter has previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349644/twitter-subscription-service-survey-undo-sent-analytics-feature-ideas"&gt;confirmed that it’s exploring&lt;/a&gt; a paid subscription model for some features, and app researcher Jane Manchun Wong tweeted Saturday that she’s discovered how much it will cost and what it will be called. Twitter Blue, Wong says, will cost $2.99 per month, and will include an Undo Tweets feature and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393287285156859911?s=20"&gt;bookmark collections&lt;/a&gt;. Wong says it appears Twitter is working on a tiered subscription model, which she posits could mean a less-cluttered, premium experience for the highest-paying subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zgZgW2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is calling their upcoming Subscription Service “Twitter Blue”, priced at $2.99/month for now, including paid features like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Undo Tweets: &lt;a href="https://t.co/CrqnzIPcOH"&gt;https://t.co/CrqnzIPcOH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Collections: &lt;a href="https://t.co/qfFfAXHp1o"&gt;https://t.co/qfFfAXHp1o&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/yyMStpCkpr"&gt;p...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;we showed you a map&lt;/a&gt; of the worst counties for broadband in the US — and on Friday, we closed the week by showing how satellite services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt; aren’t enough to close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VeSTgq"&gt;But even for the people who do have high-speed internet access, many of them have done desperate things to secure access to it. Our team resides all around the US, and they’ve shared some personal tales below about their experiences getting (or failing to get) high-speed internet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="BV2gd3"&gt;President Biden on Friday &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/14/executive-order-on-the-revocation-of-certain-presidential-actions-and-technical-amendment/"&gt;revoked several of former President Trump’s executive orders&lt;/a&gt;, including one that would have changed legal protections for social media sites and other online platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMLIC8"&gt;Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act limits how much online platforms can be held liable for content users share on their platforms. The Trump order, titled “preventing online censorship,” would have allowed federal authorities to hold companies like Twitter, Google, and Facebook responsible if they were found to be infringing on users’ speech by deleting or otherwise modifying users’ posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gB5SPn"&gt;Trump signed the order last May, just as Twitter started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;applying labels to his tweets as “misleading.”&lt;/a&gt; Trump was eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
