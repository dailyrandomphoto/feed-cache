    <title>Amazon driver was warned she’d be fired for returning with packages during a tornado</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ve4ra"&gt;An Amazon delivery driver in Illinois was told to keep delivering packages after she reported hearing tornado sirens, with the dispatcher saying that the sirens were “just a warning.” According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-12-17/amazon-tornado-aftermath-workers-say-they-lacked-emergency-training"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which includes screenshots of the conversation, the driver was told that returning to the warehouse would be viewed as a route refusal, “which [would] ultimately end with you not having a job come tomorrow morning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSAL3j"&gt;The conversation reportedly happened on Friday evening, around an hour and a half before a tornado &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829363/amazon-warehouse-tornado-collapse-edwardsville-illinois"&gt;hit an Amazon facility&lt;/a&gt; around 30 miles away from the driver. After being told twice to “just keep delivering,” the driver was eventually instructed to shelter in place “for 15-20 minutes, then continue as...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter wasn’t built for spoilers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n2CDo1WXKdM_kWOR9vsukDudpyU=/480x0:4098x2412/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70287711/domestic_1_stills_for_print_39.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s5R5di"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; hit theaters today, which means that (of course) Twitter was immediately flooded with spoilers for the latest superhero flick. The problem isn’t a new one: people either intentionally or inadvertently spoiling major twists and turns in big films or TV shows is inherent to the idea of surprise reveals in media. And it’s only grown as Twitter (and to a larger extent, the entire internet) has been around and entwined with the hype cycles of these movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOfASR"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;’s spoiler-palooza does highlight just how poorly Twitter’s design handles spoilers and sensitive information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KVNNEU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Spider-Man: No Way Home swings big on two decades of fan payoff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834061/spider-man-no-way-home-review-tom-holland-marvel-multiverse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0QxrDy"&gt;Facebook and Instagram tend to limit your reach to whoever you follow or are friends with. YouTube and TikTok leave you to the mercy of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Still on the hunt for the perfect gift? Here are some last-minute ideas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-11f4EZTKLOliR5wXoD98SMx3Yg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70287556/cgartenberg_211020_4803_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A gift card offering access to thousands of books from Amazon or Barnes and Noble is a great present for bookworms.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kj64xj"&gt;So the holidays are just days away, and you’re panicking because you still haven’t found a gift yet. Perhaps the present you wanted to give simply won’t arrive in time, or maybe you’ve just been too busy — or lazy — to pick something up (no judgment there). Whatever the reason, don’t worry; thanks to the internet, procrastinators, busy bees, and even lazy folks can still buy some great digital gifts without needing to leave their house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lPllZ"&gt;The only problem? There are tons of digital gifts to choose from, ranging from streaming subscriptions to concert tickets, and finding the right one can be overwhelming. That’s why we’ve rounded up a few gift ideas across a number of popular categories, including film and travel, so you quickly choose,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chipotle hides the assembly line, testing new online-order-only ‘Digital Kitchen’</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chipotle’s Digital Kitchen for Pickup &amp;amp; Delivery kind of looks like a regular Chipotle&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Chipotle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzjKNI"&gt;Chipotle &lt;a href="https://ir.chipotle.com/2021-12-16-CHIPOTLE-TO-OPEN-FIRST-CHIPOTLANE-DIGITAL-KITCHEN#assets_all"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s opening a new “Digital Kitchen” restaurant this month in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio (about 40 miles south of Cleveland) — which will exclusively accept online orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="1rfLlw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hungry customers should avoid knocking on that pickup window expecting to have their order taken&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n539OS"&gt;The prototype location will offer its pickup-only drive-thru “Chipotlane,” some outdoor seats and tables for eating (no dining room), and a walk-up window. Hungry customers should avoid knocking on that pickup window expecting to have their order taken. Instead, order online or on the Chipotle app and then check back at the window or roll up to the drive-thru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Verizon tries to defend collecting browsing data on its network</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPknxr"&gt;Verizon has sent an email to customers to let them know they’re getting opted in to its Custom Experience data collection scheme after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22818783/verizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history"&gt;reports came out&lt;/a&gt; about it being turned on by default for some users. If you (understandably) trashed the email without reading it, the TL;DR is that Verizon’s program collects data about your apps and web browsing activity to help “provide you more personalized experiences with Verizon.” But of course, Verizon says, you have a choice — you can turn it off anytime because your privacy is important to it (though not important enough to make the program opt-in instead of opt-out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6pi66"&gt;Custom Experience is a sort of spin-off / successor / rebrand of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/2/16085062/verizon-up-rewards-program-track-browsing-history-data-select-oath"&gt;Verizon Selects&lt;/a&gt;, which people were enrolled into when they used...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rx8qKK"&gt;TikTok said Friday that it’s working to remove “alarmist warnings” about a supposed day of school violence that was rumored to take place on Friday, December 17th. A supposed threat of a nationwide day of violence at schools across the country, that allegedly started as a TikTok challenge, prompted some districts to cancel classes Friday even as law enforcement mostly determined that the threats were not credible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3sRcME"&gt;TikTok said on Twitter that the warnings &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/helping-our-community-stay-safe-while-having-fun-on-tiktok"&gt;violated its misinformation policy&lt;/a&gt;, which prohibits the spread of hoaxes or warnings about hoaxes that treat them as real. After searching “exhaustively,” Tiktok said it had not found content on its platform promoting violence at US schools on Friday, despite the widespread but...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tencent is acquiring Back 4 Blood developer Turtle Rock Studios</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tencent is acquiring Turtle Rock Studios.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Turtle Rock Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="96iHTI"&gt;Tencent is adding to its already large roster of video game studios by &lt;a href="https://turtlerockstudios.com/news/trsandtencent"&gt;acquiring Slamfire&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; developer Turtle Rock Studios. Turtle Rock will be “retaining its independent operations” in California and the current leadership team will still run the studio, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211217005008/en/"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxbR6D"&gt;Tencent is behind some of the biggest games on the planet. It owns the studio behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/17/10410952/riot-games-league-of-legends-acquired-tencent"&gt;the hugely popular MOBA &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; the developer of the mobile hits &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings, and Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;; and has a 40 percent stake &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/21/4131702/tencents-epic-games-stock-acquisition"&gt;in Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, the developer of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and Unreal Engine. And the company has made many significant investments just this year, including acquiring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583186/tencent-sumo-digital-buyout-announced-price-acquisition"&gt;British game studio Sumo&lt;/a&gt;, buying...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s large 70-inch MQ7 TV is $350 off at Best Buy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZgvUID"&gt;The Christmas holiday is just one week away. I repeat: seven days from now is Christmas Eve. Let that sink in for a moment, but don’t panic just yet. There is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22833986/ups-usps-fedex-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target-shipping-deadlines-2021"&gt;still time to get gifts in time for the holidays&lt;/a&gt; before we reach cutoff times for shipments, though we’re getting a little tight on time. Just because you’re cutting it close doesn’t mean you have to overspend. Today, we have a bunch of great deals at a variety of price points — many of which can make exceptional gifts for a friend, family member, or yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JL2VfT"&gt;Starting off, Vizio’s midrange 70-inch MQ7 4K LED TV (M70Q7-J03) with voice controls and HDR is just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgd341IQaDG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$749.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a $350 discount on quite a large TV. You may ask, “How can I gift a 70-inch TV to just one...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clockwork Aquario brings a long-lost arcade game back to life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NHu4gwp39Xin4W0HHa-4TBoc2Ek=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286522/CWA_Screenshot_3.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bu4Viz"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Clockwork Aquario&lt;/em&gt; had come out in the early ’90s, it would have cost me &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of quarters. It’s the kind of arcade game that lures you in: big sprites, bright colors, inventive worlds, a bubbly soundtrack. You see it, and you want to play it. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to experience it in an arcade because it was never actually released. But a few decades later, it’s finally available in a new format — you can now play it on both the PS4 and Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IavSuV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clockwork Aquario&lt;/em&gt; was initially a victim of the game industry’s shift to 3D games. Development started in 1992 at Westone Bit Entertainment, a now-defunct studio best-known for the &lt;em&gt;Wonder Boy&lt;/em&gt; series. The game was completed after two years, but by that time, arcades had...&lt;/p&gt;
