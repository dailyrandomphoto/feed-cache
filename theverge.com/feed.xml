    <title>Microsoft Teams’ new front row layout arrives later this year</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RFUbPw"&gt;Microsoft has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447048/microsoft-teams-future-meetings-features"&gt;teasing its vision&lt;/a&gt; for the future of Teams meetings recently, and it’s now committing to making parts of it a reality this year. Front row is the official name for the new Microsoft Teams layout, which includes methods designed to bridge the hybrid work gap between those physically present in a meeting and remote participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5utVq"&gt;“Visually, this new layout moves the video gallery to the bottom of the screen so in-room participants can see remote colleagues face to face across a horizontal plane–similar to if they were in the same room,” explains Jared Spataro, head of Microsoft 365.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Fluid Office documents are coming to life in Teams, OneNote, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ba8QvcvFMbXrEmdbDbWkBzYONsk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465948/acastro_200514_4022_microsoftFluid_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9LFEtR"&gt;The biggest change to Microsoft’s Office documents in decades is coming to life soon, as the company’s Fluid framework arrives in Microsoft Teams, OneNote, Outlook, and Whiteboard. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build"&gt;first unveiled Fluid&lt;/a&gt; last year, showing how the framework allows blocks of Office content to live independently across the web. That idea is now becoming a reality, with collaborative content that can be copied, pasted, and shared with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sb75Gu"&gt;Instead of tables, graphs, and lists that are static and bound to specific documents, Fluid components are collaborative modules that exist across different applications. They will begin showing up in Microsoft Teams first this summer, embeddable in meetings and chats. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Why it took Nintendo 15 years to make Metroid Dread</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OwWJc6esQdATmsHXiZJSjhJrjSs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465956/MD_Movie_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wc7Lyy"&gt;Around 15 years ago, Yoshio Sakamoto had an idea for the next mainline &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; game. Called &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt;, the game would feature longtime protagonist Samus Aran constantly pursued by some kind of all-powerful force. The idea was to instill fear in players with an enemy they couldn’t defeat. This was the same time that the Nintendo DS was becoming a breakout hit, but Sakamoto soon realized that the handheld wasn’t powerful enough for his ideas. “It was difficult to realize that concept with that hardware,” he said recently during a meeting with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1t0lec"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:645329"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5uYF6d"&gt;Development on &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; stopped and started a few times due to these technical limitations, before eventually being shelved indefinitely. “We had put it on hold,” Sakamoto explains. Which is what...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat will let developers put their apps inside its TikTok copycat Spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_9d6CHauSkcnDmMT1QVI7bNLDk=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465949/snapchatspotlight.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D7VtyQ"&gt;Snapchat is making it easier for developers to use viral content to directly promote their apps. Today, it’s launching Creative Kit for Spotlight, which will allow app developers to give users the power to publish directly to Snapchat’s TikTok rival, Spotlight. At the same time, Snapchat users can browse content made on those apps and then easily navigate to download them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJjdxo"&gt;It’s a win-win for both parties: Snapchat gains more content on its platform while developers are rewarded with additional downloads if an effect or tool they launch goes viral. Developers can also set up hashtag topics that’ll tag this content, so they can track how well it’s doing, and viewers can see everything made with that effect. Snap says it won’t take any sort...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus original series will now release on Wednesdays, not Fridays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/93AQehx-5obrd0f_ngOn1Guqw3g=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465654/ARC_101_09922.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki was Disney’s first show to make the switch.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PRRfKx"&gt;From July, all of &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1084177/9358?subId1=VergeLoki&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Floki%2F6pARMvILBGzF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;’ global original series will be released on Wednesdays rather than Fridays, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/disney-plus-shifts-original-series-to-wednesday-release-date-schedule-1234968809/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The change has reportedly been made to give the service’s increasing number of original TV shows more space in the schedule, while the service’s original movies will continue to release on Fridays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFpaol"&gt;Disney has announced a number of new premiere dates following the change, with most now releasing a few days later than previously planned. &lt;em&gt;Monsters, Inc. &lt;/em&gt;spinoff &lt;em&gt;Monsters at Work &lt;/em&gt;for example, will now release on Wednesday, July 7th rather than July 2nd, while &lt;em&gt;Turner &amp;amp; Hooch&lt;/em&gt; has shifted from July 16th to Wednesday, July 21st. However a couple of series will now release earlier, like &lt;em&gt;The Wonderful World...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon put AI cameras in its Chinese offices that only let smiling workers inside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wG13SMls2yqJWC2MhPD_lenFJMY=/0x0:3200x2133/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465571/canon_smile_recognition.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Smile recognition” in action. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Canon Information Technologies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mty2Mn"&gt;Tech company Canon has come up with a downright dystopic way to tackle the problem of workplace morale: it’s installed cameras with AI-enabled “smile recognition” technology in the offices of its Chinese subsidiary Canon Information Technology. The cameras only let smiling workers enter rooms or book meetings, ensuring that every employee is definitely, 100 percent happy all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwJMrO"&gt;This depressing tale was highlighted in a &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b74b6ad6-3b8d-4cd8-9dd6-3b49754aa1c7"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on how Chinese companies are surveilling employees to an unsettling degree with the help of AI and algorithms. Firms are monitoring which programs employees use on their computers to gauge their productivity; using CCTV cameras to measure how long they take on their lunch break; and...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Zens’ latest battery pack can create a wireless charging sandwich</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EieTrvi6Scv6mcLzwY2EsS3iv_k=/0x0:1467x978/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465331/press_release_powerbanks_1536x864.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery pack can wirelessly charge two devices at once.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Zens&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="toclEy"&gt;Zens’ new battery pack has a wireless charger on both sides, allowing you to charge two Qi-compatible devices simultaneously in what can only be described as a “charging sandwich.” The &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-dual-powerbank"&gt;Dual Powerbank&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/blog/blog/experience-the-convenience-of-on-the-go-wireless-charging/"&gt;announced alongside&lt;/a&gt; a trio of other battery packs including the &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-single-powerbank/"&gt;Magnetic Single Powerbank&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-single-powerbank-with-stand"&gt;Single Powerbank with Stand&lt;/a&gt; (which can itself be wirelessly charged, as well as wirelessly charge other devices), and the &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-single-powerbank-stand-10000mah/"&gt;10,000 mAh Powerbank with Stand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXxnvy"&gt;Although you could theoretically use it to charge two Qi-compatible phones, the intended use case appears to be charging an iPhone along with an accessory like a pair of AirPods. That’s because one side of the battery pack includes a MagSafe connection, which should keep it centered on iPhone...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus integrates further with Oppo, if that’s even possible</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PreLxGWjXgAkVLh2rVaTwuyIo_8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465329/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DTWuj"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has announced a “new journey” for the company including a plan to “further integrate our organization with Oppo.” Lau made the announcement by way of a &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/a-new-journey-for-oneplus.1454492/"&gt;post on OnePlus’ forums&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we’re at a turning point for the future of OnePlus” and “we must adapt as a team and a brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85hr9Q"&gt;It sounds like a dramatic move for OnePlus, the company Lau started with Carl Pei after ostensibly leaving Oppo in 2013. OnePlus made its name with rebellious marketing and hype-driven online retail strategies, portraying itself as a smarter alternative to bigger smartphone brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1xwGeW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was always clear that OnePlus had ties to Oppo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3aHu8H"&gt;But it remained a private company with ownership tied up in Oppo and the shadowy BBK Electronics empire, and it...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leica phone announced by SoftBank in Japan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOBU2_fK_41ENIQWpT0H1W67TMs=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465217/leitz.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zzd58N"&gt;SoftBank has announced a Leica-branded phone for the Japanese market. Leica has lent its name to phone camera systems before, but this Leitz Phone 1 is the first time the Leica brand and iconic red dot has taken precedence on a smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYoJyG"&gt;The camera system is of course going to be paramount for a device like this, and the hardware here is certainly unusual. There’s a single 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor — the biggest in any phone — with a 19mm-equivalent f/1.9 ultrawide lens, meaning other focal lengths need to use digital zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SB59G"&gt;If that sounds familiar, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439883/sharp-aquos-r6-japan-biggest-phone-camera-sensor-1-inch"&gt;Sharp announced the exact same thing a month ago&lt;/a&gt;. The Aquos R6 has the same Leica-branded camera system — though the Leitz Phone 1 makes it look a lot bigger — and other specs like...&lt;/p&gt;
