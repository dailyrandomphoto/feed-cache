    <title>Sony is reportedly remaking The Last of Us for PS5 as it chases big hits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Last of Us" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jSEmvqxAZ33gWRcjWMbLzm4FdWk=/75x0:885x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101182/2013_06_13_LaunchDayPost_960p.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jmzqvn"&gt;Sony is reportedly working on another remake of Naughty Dog’s &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; — first released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3, followed by a PlayStation 4 remaster in 2014. The latest version of the game is intended for the PlayStation 5 and would reportedly feature the gameplay and graphical improvements introduced in 2020’s &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/sony-s-obsession-with-blockbusters-is-stirring-unrest-within-playstation-empire?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKWoJT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports the remake’s status is part of a broader reorganization at Sony’s first-party development studios, which are struggling with the conflicting goals of the company’s desire for larger, blockbuster-scale projects from its major studios and the smaller, less lucrative passion projects from its smaller teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrqlRc"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; remake is one such project. The...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine could be a heavier period  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GyvRpd"&gt;Katharine Lee got her COVID-19 vaccination early on in the United States’ rollout. So did a friend of hers — they got their shots on the same day. They compared notes, curious to see what the side effects would be. Lee, a research fellow in the Division of Public Health Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, says that they both had one surprising symptom: they both started their period soon after they took the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkBXJb"&gt;“It wasn’t a symptom that was on the list,” she says. “I expected that my arm would be sore, or that I might have a fever or a headache, but this just wasn’t on the list.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdGACl"&gt;Lee reached out to Kate Clancy, who studies the menstrual cycle at the University of Illinois, to share the observation. When Clancy got her...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How an offshore wind boom in the US could boost ocean research </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aQDagO"&gt;The US wants to use offshore wind farms to collect valuable data on climate change and ocean health. Renewable energy giant Ørsted recently signed a memorandum of agreement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), agreeing to help the agency gather data in US waters leased to the company&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; NOAA &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/noaa-signs-data-share-agreement-with-offshore-wind-energy-company"&gt;says the agreement&lt;/a&gt; “paves the way for similar data-sharing agreements with other developers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJsezC"&gt;The Biden administration plans to dramatically &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/03/us-secretary-commerce-gina-m-raimondo-announces-efforts-advance"&gt;expand&lt;/a&gt; the country’s offshore wind capacity. The US currently only has 42 megawatts of capacity from two relatively small projects on the East Coast. If the Biden administration makes good on its commitment to offshore wind development, that’ll grow this decade to 30,000 megawatts...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung tries to woo iPhone users with a browser-based Galaxy test drive</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y70C9m"&gt;Samsung has released &lt;a href="https://www.itest.nz/"&gt;a new website&lt;/a&gt; to give iPhone users “a little taste of Samsung” from their mobile browser. When visited on an iPhone, the site prompts users to add it to their phone’s home screen, after which it turns into a shortcut to a simulated Samsung Galaxy device. The site appears to be the work of Samsung New Zealand, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/samsung-itest-galaxy-device-iphone-experience/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqyLej"&gt;The experience might be limited, but it’s a neatly designed bit of marketing. Open up the camera “app” and a video will automatically play featuring influencer Logan Dodds, who describes Samsung’s camera app features in the interface around him. Poke around the other “apps” in the home screen and Samsung happily markets its phone’s other features and accessories, while text messages and even a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I’m salivating over this new four-volume Philip K. Dick collection by the Folio Society</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IW-TE6zanU9vW-QmRFobZxA0Kuo=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69100273/maxresdefault.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eugdg6"&gt;The Folio Society has released a &lt;a href="https://www.foliosociety.com/uk/the-complete-short-stories.html"&gt;limited-edition, four-volume set&lt;/a&gt; of Philip K. Dick’s collected short stories and I am seriously considering selling my plasma to buy a copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lg2Yux"&gt;Each volume is bound in fluorescent colors, with 2,560 pages of text containing some 118 stories. There are 24 illustrations by 24 different artists, and the set itself has a theme inspired by the symbols found on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_cards"&gt;Zener cards&lt;/a&gt; — famously used throughout the 20th century to test for telepaths (mind-reading being a recurrent theme in Dick’s fiction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XPpBC"&gt;The collection is absolutely stunning, like so many special editions by The Folio Society, but has a hefty price-tag of £495 ($679). There are also only 750 copies available to buy and it looks like they’re selling out...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung reportedly inks deal to buy OLED TV panels from rival LG Display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fApiIr"&gt;Samsung Electronics is close to ordering millions of OLED TV panels from LG Display, according to &lt;a href="https://m.mtn.co.kr/news/news_view.php?mmn_idx=2021040910490127790"&gt;new reports from &lt;em&gt;MTN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.etnews.com/20210409000074"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ETNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsVIew/22L0NM8RQV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seoul Economic Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Officials reportedly met recently to agree to the deal, which would see 1 million panels supplied to Samsung in the second half of this year, rising to 4 million panels next year. If the deal is finalized, it would be the first time Samsung has bought OLED panels from its South Korean rival and market leader. TVs with LG’s OLED panels consistently rate amongst the best in professional reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrJYhP"&gt;Samsung exited the OLED TV market &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-tv/how-samsung-fell-behind-sony-and-lg-in-the-premium-tv-market-idUSKBN1I24K2"&gt;over half a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;. Today, LG Display supplies OLED panels to a variety of TV manufacturers including Sony, Vizio, and Hisense, as well as LG Electronics....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airplane takes off a metric ton heavier than expected after computer error weighs adults as children</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wh1FQZ"&gt;A flight from the UK to Spain took off with more than a metric ton of unexpected weight after a software error classified female passengers using the title “Miss” as children. This led to the flight’s load sheet estimating the weight of 38 female passengers as 38 kg or 77 pounds each, the standard weight for children, instead of 69 kg or 152 pounds, the standard weight used for female adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePt20H"&gt;The error was classified as a “&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/aaib-investigation-to-boeing-737-8k5-g-tawg-21-july-2020"&gt;serious incident&lt;/a&gt;” by the UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) but did not affect the flight’s safety. Despite a discrepancy of 1,244 kg (2,743 pounds) between the expected and actual mass of the aircraft, the thrust used in takeoff by the pilot was only “marginally less” than what was required. “This meant...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says iMessage on Android ‘will hurt us more than help us’  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBZmZy"&gt;Apple knows that iMessage’s blue bubbles are a big barrier to people switching to Android, which is why the service has never appeared on Google’s mobile operating system. That’s according to depositions and emails from Apple employees, including some high-ranking executives, revealed in &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.407.0.pdf"&gt;a court filing&lt;/a&gt; from Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;as part of its legal dispute&lt;/a&gt; with the iPhone manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVNGvI"&gt;Epic argues that Apple consciously tries to lock customers into its ecosystem of devices, and that iMessage is one of the key services helping it to do so. It cites comments made by Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddie Cue, senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi, and Apple Fellow Phil Schiller to support its...&lt;/p&gt;
