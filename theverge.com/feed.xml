    <title>New test brings Reels to Facebook in the US</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FaJ78t"&gt;Facebook in the US is going to look slightly more like TikTok for some users. Today, the company announced that it’s testing Facebook Reels stateside, which will bring the short-form, TikTok-like videos to the platform. These will show up for some users in the News Feed and within Groups, where people can watch them together. (The company is already testing this in India, Mexico, and Canada, and the US limited rollout is just an extension of that test.) As part of this test, Instagram users will also be able to cross-post their reels to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQPzK6"&gt;People can watch and create reels from the Facebook app, and the feature is designed to give people a way to “express themselves, discover entertaining content, and to help creators broaden...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird’s new electric bike looks like a VanMoof, and you can buy it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOa7dvbK3ONJOkWD_U_R-7_CzgQ=/0x1:2468x1646/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747472/Bird_Bike_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pL41Q1"&gt;Shared electric scooter company Bird is branching out into new two-wheeled vehicles, namely electric bikes. A few months after it introduced its first shared e-bike, the company announced that it would also offer its own e-bike for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="te7Fvp"&gt;The bike, dubbed Bird Bike of course, has a 500W rear hub motor, a Gates carbon belt drive, pedal- and throttle-assisted power, and the relatively modest sticker price of $2,299. Design-wise, the bike looks very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof’s popular e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;, with a slightly elongated top tube and embedded front and rear lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7P65L1"&gt;Bird, which was the first company to introduce shared electric scooters in a US city, has always flirted with the idea of e-bikes. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20926658/bird-scoot-electric-moped-la-cruiser-specs-speed"&gt;first rolled out its Scoot-branded electric...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kd0Lp6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vale: Shadow of the Crown&lt;/em&gt;, an audio-based adventure game by indie studio Falling Squirrel, is available on Xbox and PC today for $19.99. The game was developed in collaboration with the Canadian National Institute for the Blind, and made for and tested by blind and low-vision players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhHICz"&gt;Players navigate a medieval setting as Alex, the blind second heir to a kingdom, who is on her way to the borderlands when her caravan is attacked by enemy soldiers. Left on her own, Alex has to travel the land, find weapons, learn spells, and fight enemies without sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsenFo"&gt;Besides menus, which are presented in text and through audio description, the only visuals in &lt;em&gt;The Vale &lt;/em&gt;are colored specks that float across a black screen. The behavior of the specks...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Netflix engineers charged with insider trading </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AGg5Yp"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged three former Netflix engineers with being part of a “long-running” insider trading scheme, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-158"&gt;the agency announced&lt;/a&gt;. The engineers and two close associates allegedly traded on confidential information about Netflix’s subscriber growth, generating more than $3 million in total profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61hYk4"&gt;According to the SEC complaint, while employed at Netflix in 2016 and 2017, Sung Mo “Jay” Jun tipped information about the streaming giant’s subscribers to his brother Joon Mo Jun and friend Junwoo Chon, who used the info to trade ahead of Netflix earnings announcements. After Sung Mo Jun left Netflix in 2017, the SEC alleges, he continued to get confidential information about the company’s subscriber...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Smartwatch-induced health anxiety led one woman to run 916 ECGs in a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zgqnMuAwsetL7U_xjHbURCIfEps=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747269/acastro_190219_1777_watch_health_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uno6Cg"&gt;One year after getting diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, a heart condition that causes an irregular heartbeat, a 70-year-old woman was back for another diagnosis: new-onset health anxiety triggered by her smartwatch. Despite not having concerning symptoms, the patient became more and more preoccupied with and worried about notifications from her watch. Over the one-year period, she took 916 ECG recordings through her device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmMqlq"&gt;That patient isn’t an outlier, says Lindsey Rosman, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, who wrote about the case in a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8357265/pdf/nihms-1705938.pdf"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;. She was just one example of a pattern seen in cardiology clinics. “Patients with underlying...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steve Jobs email confirms Apple was working on an ‘iPhone nano’ </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XSWnPZj3HS3fhCH8_3LQ8CFEbaw=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747204/vpavic_4279_20201107_0081.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zEvBRi"&gt;In 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/81768/more-detail-on-apples-iphone-nano-exclusive/"&gt;rumors swirled&lt;/a&gt; that Apple was working on a so-called “iPhone nano,” a new iPhone that would be smaller and cheaper than the top-of-the-line model at the time, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-06-22-iphone-4-review.html"&gt;the iPhone 4&lt;/a&gt;. While Apple never did release that rumored super-small phone, a Steve Jobs email we spotted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"&gt;while collecting the very best emails from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; confirms the company was indeed working on an iPhone nano at one point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Py0fBN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oZ53Yd"&gt;Unfortunately, Jobs’ October 2010 email, which is an agenda for a strategy meeting, doesn’t reveal much about the device. There’s a bullet for an “iPhone nano plan,” a sub-bullet for its “cost goal,” and another sub-bullet indicating that “Jony,” presumably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761736/jony-ive-apple-leave-iphone-chief-design-officer-lovefrom-company-quit"&gt;Apple’s former design chief Jony Ive&lt;/a&gt;, would “show model (and/or...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YF5wgo"&gt;In May, the world watched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;as Epic Games dragged Apple to court&lt;/a&gt;, challenging the most profitable company in the world in the name of app fairness (and securing more &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; profits for itself). We’re still waiting for a verdict in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, but we haven’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; been sitting around. We’ve also been digging through these companies’ dirty laundry, reading scores of internal emails and confidential presentations unearthed during the legal discovery process. It’s fascinating stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6E73m"&gt;In fact, we found dirt on a variety of other companies as well: Microsoft, Sony, Google, Nintendo, Valve, Netflix, Hulu, and many others were caught up in discovery, and many details of their businesses, strategies, and conversations with Apple and Epic are...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge staff talks about their favorite laptop bags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="man crossing street with messenger bag" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ArcCnWWzzS3AVfwXJU5TmbhNys0=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747141/missionworkshop2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Mission Workshop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t8JEd2"&gt;It’s surprisingly how attached you can get to a bag — especially the bag that you use to carry your laptop, your sweater, your lunch, your notebook, your exercise shoes, and all the other stuff you need. Whether you’re heading to the office, visiting a friend, hanging in a coffee shop, going on a hike, or just sitting outdoors to read or work, having a bag that can accommodate everything on your “gotta have this” list can help you avoid a lot of aggravation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NiKVEC"&gt;We asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to tell us about their go-to laptop bags. We got a variety of answers, including messenger bags, camera bags, backpacks, well-worn bags that have lasted for years, and leather bags with lots of style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rL7kof"&gt;So here are some stories about why we like our...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces new wired Xbox stereo headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HiJcuRZQO_lmP5JU5dZIDld1WvM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747091/E9J5XTTUcAIZ4nL.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6V96gj"&gt;Microsoft has unveiled a refreshed Xbox stereo headset, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fheadsets%2Fxbox-stereo-headset" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a $59.99 wired model&lt;/a&gt; that’s more affordable than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;its stellar $100 wireless headset&lt;/a&gt; that launched earlier in 2021. It’s launching on September 21st, and as is to be expected, it’s missing a few features. But much of its design is intact. You can twist the dial on the outside of the right ear cup to adjust the volume, and there’s a mute button on the back side of the flexible microphone — mirroring what you get with the wireless version. The stereo headset doesn’t appear to have the chat / game audio mixing dial on the left ear cup as the pricier model does, but that’s not a horrible loss given the price difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PknieG"&gt;This headset connects through your Xbox controller via its bold green...&lt;/p&gt;
