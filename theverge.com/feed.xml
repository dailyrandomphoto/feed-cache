    <title>Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical to become an actual one-night Broadway-style show</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="d3pgHB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/11/ratatouille-musical-tiktok.html"&gt;TikTok’s fan-made crowdsourced &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical&lt;/a&gt; is making the jump from social media to the stage. &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical&lt;/em&gt; is going to debut as an actual show for a one-night-only concert on January 1st, which will benefit The Actors Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmByGX"&gt;The streamed show will be produced by &lt;a href="https://seaviewprods.com/work/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical/"&gt;Seaview Productions&lt;/a&gt; (best known for producing &lt;em&gt;Slave Play&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/theater/tony-award-nominations.html"&gt;most Tony Award-nominated show&lt;/a&gt; in Broadway history) and is being presented “in association with TikTok.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMKWIG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ratatouille-tiktok-musical-oral-history-1091547/"&gt;so-called &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical&lt;/a&gt; — based on the 2007 Disney / Pixar film — has been percolating over the past several months on TikTok. What started as a one-off bit has slowly snowballed into a massive undertaking, with bored Broadway fans, composers, set designers, costume makers,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic turned the volume down on ocean noise pollution</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tnNvUL"&gt;The economic fallout from COVID-19 has temporarily muted some of the noise coming from maritime traffic. That’s given scientists a rare opportunity to study what happens to marine life when humans quiet down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxZpZU"&gt;Humans today pollute oceans with whirring ship propellers and booming air guns searching for oil and gas deposits. Seeing whales and other creatures’ behavior now that the pandemic has quieted things down is like a peek into what marine life was like before humans drastically turned up the volume over the past 200 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="kRh3wP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Once in a lifetime opportunity to study whale communication in natural quiet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>At his last Space Council meeting, Mike Pence announces new cadre of lunar astronauts</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EydK9M"&gt;On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence hosted his last meeting of the National Space Council in Florida, using the opportunity to announce a list of NASA astronauts who will be considered for future missions to the Moon as part of NASA’s Artemis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIRPPY"&gt;This cadre of astronauts — &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis-team/"&gt;dubbed the Artemis Team&lt;/a&gt; — includes 18 astronauts, some with past flight experience and some who have yet to fly to space. The list includes some notable names, such as Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, the two women who made history by performing the first all-women spacewalk. Two of the astronauts, Victor Glover and Kate Rubins, are currently living on board the International Space Station. Five of the 18 made an appearance at the National Space Council...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boeing’s 737 Max is back in service</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DPYGdc"&gt;Boeing’s troubled 737 Max made its first commercial flight since March 2019 today, marking the end of a 20-month grounding following two deadly crashes that killed 346 people. Brazil’s Gol Airlines was the first in the world to put paying customers on the plane again since the Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573113/boeing-737-max-cleared-fly-grounding-faa-crashes"&gt;approved its return to flight in November&lt;/a&gt;. A 737 Max 8 ferried passengers from Sao Paulo to Porto Alegre, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-737-max-back-in-air-2-years-after-grounded-by-crashes/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9I7rRc"&gt;Gol Airlines told the publication it plans to use the 737 Max in regular service starting later this month, and passengers who don’t want to fly on the plane will be able to exchange their tickets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLrAbJ"&gt;Other airlines are getting ready to bring the plane back into their fleets, too. American...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe just released the last Flash update ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Adobe Flash Logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bHLBA_dPBaAcuHeGoZ0f7QnExOw=/0x23:600x423/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487031/adobe-flash-logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rEA041"&gt;Adobe has released the final scheduled update to its Flash Player plugin, weeks before Flash’s official retirement. As noted &lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/release-note/fp_32_air_32_release_notes.html"&gt;on Adobe’s site&lt;/a&gt;, yesterday marked the last update for Flash outside mainland China, which has a separate version of the software. Adobe will stop supporting Flash on December 31st, 2020, and it will block Flash content from running on January 12th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ietqEh"&gt;Adobe offered a brief farewell in its release notes. “We want to take a moment to thank all of our customers and developers who have used and created amazing Flash Player content over the last two decades,” the note says. “We are proud that Flash had a crucial role in evolving web content across animation, interactivity, audio, and video. We are excited to help...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Privacy group files complaint against five online test-proctoring services</title>

  &lt;p id="XNOamV"&gt;The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) has &lt;a href="https://epic.org/privacy/dccppa/online-test-proctoring/EPIC-complaint-in-re-online-test-proctoring-companies-12-09-20.pdf"&gt;filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the DC Attorney General’s office against five online test-proctoring services: Respondus, ProctorU, Proctorio, Examity, and Honorlock. EPIC claims that the firms violate the privacy rights of students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5waCJ0"&gt;The five companies sell software designed to prevent cheating in online tests and exams. Some are designed to track applications that are running on test-takers’ computers or restrict access to certain programs during the testing period. Others track students’ activity during the test via their webcams and microphones and flag potentially suspicious behavior to their instructor, using either algorithms or live monitoring. In some cases, test-takers need to show a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Redbox’s free ad-supported streaming service adds on-demand movies</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uP5sOn"&gt;Redbox has added on-demand movies to its free ad-supported streaming service in a section called Free On Demand (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/redbox-streaming-free-movies-tv-shows-video-on-demand-205208288.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Last February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138485/redbox-free-live-tv-ad-supported-streaming-platform-launch-rollout"&gt;the company launched Free Live TV&lt;/a&gt;, with ad-supported live TV channels from specific publishers like Tastemade and curated channels based on genres. Free movies now make that offering a bit more enticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USHNjc"&gt;Redbox is still best known for its red kiosks for renting DVDs and Blu-rays, but free streaming and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16775778/redbox-on-demand-streaming-service"&gt;digital rental service&lt;/a&gt; now allow the company to reach customers who might not have a kiosk in their area or don’t own a DVD or Blu-ray player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTYqRh"&gt;The selection in Free On Demand lacks some of the big blockbusters and classics that you might expect from a streaming service, but there are a few...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch SpaceX fly a prototype of its Starship rocket to its highest altitude yet</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qIK1iO"&gt;Sometime today, SpaceX hopes to conduct a pivotal test flight of its next-generation Starship rocket, flying a prototype of the vehicle to its highest altitude yet. The company plans to launch the massive rocket to a height of nearly 8 miles, or 12.5 kilometers, up above SpaceX’s facility in Boca Chica, Texas, before landing the vehicle back down on the ground again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YISOcP"&gt;The test is meant to prove out Starship’s capability of launching and landing upright, something the spacecraft will be expected to do both on Earth and on other worlds. SpaceX aims to use Starship to send cargo and people to deep-space destinations like the Moon and Mars. A test like this will help demonstrate Starship’s ability to perform a controlled flight and see if...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google CEO Sundar Pichai apologizes for Timnit Gebru controversy but not her firing</title>

  &lt;p id="rkD4rh"&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai addressed the controversial departure of AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru in an email to staff on Wednesday. “We need to accept responsibility for the fact that a prominent Black, female leader with immense talent left Google unhappily,” he wrote. News of the email was &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/sundar-pichai-memo-timnit-gebru-exit-18b0efb0-5bc3-41e6-ac28-2956732ed78b.html"&gt;first published by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZAAar"&gt;While Pichai did not say Gebru was fired as she and many others have claimed, he promised to review the steps that led to her leaving the company. “We need to assess the circumstances that led up to Dr. Gebru’s departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jzOSM"&gt;He also apologized for how Gebru’s departure had “led some in our community to question their place at Google” and...&lt;/p&gt;
