  &lt;p id="awuqT7"&gt;Electronic Arts is promoting chief studios officer Laura Miele to chief operating officer, &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/news/driving-transformation-for-players-and-growth-for-our-company"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The change is a big promotion for Miele, who already had significant leadership at the company overseeing 25 different studios. The new role will give Miele greater oversight over the company and arguably makes her the most powerful woman in gaming, an industry where there are few female executives, fewer in the C-suite, and where those C-suite execs are often in charge of HR or finance rather than the company’s products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kciWhb"&gt;Ubisoft did make Virginie Hass its chief studios operating officer last August, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332534/ubisoft-serge-hascoet-harassment-sexism-racism-metoo"&gt;scandals over a toxic culture including sexual harassment and misconduct&lt;/a&gt; that went as high as the C-suite...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn is buying Lordstown Motors’ Ohio EV factory for $230 million</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="63Shtf"&gt;iPhone assembler Foxconn is buying an automotive factory from struggling EV startup Lordstown Motors for around $230 million, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/30/2306712/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-and-Hon-Hai-Technology-Group-Announce-Agreement-in-Principle.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday. Foxconn says it has agreed to build Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck at the plant, which is where General Motors used to make the Chevrolet Cruze, and that the startup will remain a tenant there. Lordstown Motors will also “agree to provide Foxconn with certain rights with respect to future vehicle programs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmMNZn"&gt;The deal gives the Taiwanese conglomerate its first automotive factory, and a significant new presence in the United States — one that the company will use as it tries to establish itself as a global electric vehicle automaker. Foxconn previously announced a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom won’t buy Five9 after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eX8ITlt86e3STudJYXS6_SOInFs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69934738/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9JxH8h"&gt;Five9 will remain independent — its deal to be acquired by Zoom is off. Though a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210930006016/en/"&gt;press release from Five9&lt;/a&gt; says it was “terminated by mutual agreement,” it’s also the case that Five9 shareholders rejected the $14.7 billion deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzYv5n"&gt;Zoom originally announced the acquisition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583371/zoom-buys-five9-14-7-billion-videoconferencing-lockdown"&gt;on July 18th&lt;/a&gt;. Five9 automates managing customer contacts for businesses, and the deal was supposed to bolster Zoom’s business offerings. Its major competitors are behemoths like Microsoft and Google, and the deal would have helped the smaller company expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBFwf8"&gt;This was supposed to be an &lt;a href="https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-acquire-five9"&gt;all-stock transaction&lt;/a&gt;, but unfortunately for Zoom, its stock price has lost more than a quarter of its value since they announced the acquisition. Usually, when a company is bought,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney and Scarlett Johansson have settled their lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ELzQ-sgHRiddp7JxPAbw7A9NBOs=/232x0:2737x1670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69934715/fbg7020_comp_v003_bf38a189.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9pOEWt"&gt;Three months after Scarlett Johansson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;sued Disney over its streaming release of &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, arguing she stood to lose millions of dollars because her salary was based on the box office performance of the film, the suit has now been settled, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/scarlett-johansson-disney-settle-black-widow-lawsuit-1235022598/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/scarlett-johansson-disney-lawsuit-settled-1235078355"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/business/scarlett-johansson-disney-black-widow.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and others. Representatives for Johansson confirmed the settlement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeinh2"&gt;While the terms of the settlement don’t appear to be public, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/09/disney-black-widow-lawsuit-scarlett-johansson-rsettlement-1234847437/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline &lt;/em&gt;cites a source&lt;/a&gt; saying that the deal was in the “tens of millions.” Both parties have paid lip service to continuing to work together: Johansson told &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; that she was “happy to have resolved our differences with Disney,” and “look[s] forward to continuing our...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lil Nas X, Bella Poarch, Grimes, and more are releasing TikTok NFTs</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9arAGY"&gt;Because no peace can be found in the age of man, TikTok has decided to partner with select creators, celebrities, and online entities like Lil Nas X, Bella Poarch, and Grimes &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-launches-first-creator-led-nft-collection-powered-by-immutable-x"&gt;to release a collection of non-fungible tokens&lt;/a&gt;. These TikTok Top Moments, as the company is calling them, are inspired by six “culturally significant” TikTok videos in the form of one-of-one NFTs. TikTok plans to auction them alongside a selection of limited edition NFTs it’ll sell weekly throughout October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFdwrI"&gt;The partnerships, creators, and new material being tokenized and put up for auction vary. Musician Lil Nas X is up first on October 6th with a collaboration with artist Rudy Willingham, while Grimes is collaborating with Brittany Broski (“Kombucha Girl”), and...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bFfyTE"&gt;One of the features Google offers exclusively through its Pixel Android phones is the Personal Safety app. Over the years, it’s added features like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21276908/google-pixel-feature-drop-june-2020-safety-check-bedtime"&gt;safety check-in&lt;/a&gt; that automatically notifies your emergency contacts if you don’t respond as scheduled and the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892875/google-pixel-personal-safety-app-car-crash-detection"&gt;automatically dial 911 if it detects you’ve been in a car accident&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="PhyMgt"&gt;We installed the update &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.safetyhub"&gt;from Google Play&lt;/a&gt; on a Pixel device.

&lt;p id="pkYh2l"&gt;The Dallas-based company said in a news release that an “unauthorized third party obtained personal information associated with certain Neiman Marcus customers’ online accounts.” Neiman Marcus notified law enforcement, and is “working quickly to determine the nature and scope of the matter.” The company did not say who was responsible for the breach or how they were able to access its systems. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the Surface Laptop Studio and Surface Pro 8 stack up against other creator laptops</title>

  &lt;p id="5FWQMS"&gt;Microsoft announced a new version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22685923/microsoft-surface-pro-8-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro&lt;/a&gt; last week, along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;. The Surface Pro 8 feels very much like a logical evolution of Microsoft’s tablet / laptop. Some of the more notable improvements include a 120Hz display with slimmer bezels, Thunderbolt 4 support, as well as a reworked surface keyboard that includes a dedicated space to store and charge the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686095/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-haptics-features-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Slim Pen 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCXxU1"&gt;Meanwhile, the Surface Laptop Studio features a uniquely hinged screen and more powerful hardware. This is effectively a replacement for the Surface Book 3, with a three-point adjustable display that can lay flat for drawing or snap upright to deliver a more traditional laptop experience.

  &lt;p id="LITrUb"&gt;Amazon announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;Astro home robot on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, which is designed to be an Alexa on wheels that can also bring you stuff (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22699251/amazon-astro-robot-cannot-fetch-your-beer"&gt;if other people load it into the cargo bay&lt;/a&gt;) and act as a sort of guard dog. With a touchscreen for a face and the ability to move itself around a single story of your house, it’s a bit like the personal robots from decades of science fiction. Given that Amazon seemingly wants to continue making home robots, though, we figured we’d go through a little history to look at some previous attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S13wHu"&gt;Of course, there’s plenty of discussion to be had about what does or does not count as a robot — to anyone with a smart home setup, Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant could be considered robots, as they can do any number of tasks...&lt;/p&gt;
