  &lt;p id="nFGSLE"&gt;A federal judge has blocked a Texas law that aimed to limit large social platforms’ ability to moderate content on the grounds that it is likely to violate the First Amendment. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23057162/order.pdf"&gt;The order&lt;/a&gt;, issued by a federal district court in Austin on Wednesday night, granted an injunction proposed by NetChoice and the CCIA that puts the HB 20 law on hold until the conclusion of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuWUTM"&gt;“HB 20’s prohibitions on ‘censorship’ and constraints on how social media platforms disseminate content violate the First Amendment,” determined Judge Robert Pitman in the decision. “Content moderation and curation will benefit users and the public by reducing harmful content and providing a safe, useful service,” Pitman said, explaining why the injunction was...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HYaZ7v"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any AirPods deals to be had. In October, Apple finally launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third generation of AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, introducing a new AirPods lineup and dropping the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level AirPods from $159 to $129. Since then, we’ve seen many retailers starting to discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even seen some of the first discounts on the latest AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s ‘notebook upgrade program’ could get businesses new M1 Macs for $30 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="From $30/ Month" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a0rqB5rVch510AifqGVWwXx3bWw=/0x130:1162x905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70217415/FFXiWQ5VgAcOtih.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZaNwO"&gt;Apple has apparently introduced a business-only program that enables members to obtain and eventually upgrade computers for a relatively low monthly fee. A tweet from writer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1465326203049414656"&gt;Max Weinbach&lt;/a&gt; shows an image of Apple’s “New Mac Notebook Upgrade Program” promotional material that popped up for a customer with access to a business portal (via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/29/apple-macbook-upgrade-program-businesses/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GiahGV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The credit application makes clear this is all about the Apple M1 refresh&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXsroC"&gt;The deal appears to be in partnership with CIT Group&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a bank for business customers where this &lt;a href="https://landing.cit.com/mac-upgrade.html"&gt;landing page&lt;/a&gt; for the program shares the monthly rates for different MacBook models — starting with the 13-inch MacBook Air for $30, 13-inch MacBook Pro for $39, 14-inch MacBook Pro for $60, and 16-inch MacBook Pro for $75. Apple...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RVnR5s"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-employee-technology-company-charged-stealing-confidential-data-and-extorting"&gt;indictment from the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22226061/ubiquiti-data-breach-email-third-party-unathorized-access"&gt;Ubiquiti hack reported in January&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360409/ubiquiti-networking-data-breach-response-whistleblower-cybersecurity-incident"&gt;subsequent whistleblower claims of a cover-up&lt;/a&gt;, were the work of someone who was then an employee of the company. The DOJ alleges that Nickolas Sharp, 36, was arrested on Wednesday on accusations that he used his employee credentials to download confidential data and sent anonymous demands to the company he worked for pretending to be a hacker in an attempt to get a ransom of 50 Bitcoin. You can read the full indictment below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTRmG1"&gt;The indictment doesn’t specifically name Ubiquiti, only referring to a “Company-1.” However, all the details line up. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22226061/ubiquiti-data-breach-email-third-party-unathorized-access"&gt;Ubiquiti sent an email to users&lt;/a&gt; saying an unauthorized party had accessed its...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2bIO5o"&gt;Five major publishers have sued Shopify over pirated learning materials like PDFs of ebooks and test materials, saying the e-commerce platform fails to remove listings and stores that violate the publishers’ trademarks and copyrights. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23056830/Shopify_complaint_12.1.21.pdf"&gt;The lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, filed today in the US District Court for Eastern Virginia, claims statutory damages higher than $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4OQaT"&gt;The publishers — Pearson Education, Inc., Macmillan Learning, Cengage Learning, Inc., Elsevier Inc., and McGraw Hill — say in the lawsuit that Shopify “assists and profits from the online sale of infringing copies” of the textbooks and other products. The publishers also say that Shopify has received “detailed notices virtually every week for years” that identify listings selling...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="agoeMK"&gt;Sony’s $9,000 Airpeak S1 drone is now available to order, the company announced Wednesday. It’s expected to ship starting December 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUTuAE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526921/sony-airpeak-s1-drone-cinema-video-acceleration-flight-time"&gt;The Airpeak S1&lt;/a&gt;, which was first teased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225758/sony-airpeak-drone-alpha-photography-cameras-ces-2021-announcement"&gt;in January at CES 2021&lt;/a&gt;, is targeted toward video professionals and is designed to be used with Sony’s mirrorless cameras. According to the drone’s &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/more/airpeak/p/arss1"&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt;, it has a flight time of 22 minutes without a payload and up to 12 minutes with a “heavy payload,” such as a Sony A7S Mark III camera. Sony says the Airpeak is stable in winds of up to 44.7mph, which could be useful for capturing footage in windy conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new G3x platform could usher in a new wave of Nintendo Switch-alikes</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SutTDa"&gt;Qualcomm is upping its investment in gaming with a new Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 Gaming Platform, which manufacturers can use to make Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck-like handheld gaming devices. The Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 is an Android-based platform designed to let you play Android games, stream games from a console or PC, or play games via cloud gaming services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jTm6l"&gt;The basis of the platform is the new G3x chip. It has an Adreno GPU, similar to Qualcomm’s existing smartphone chips, which will let you play games at up 144fps. It also supports sub-6Hz 5G, mmWave 5G, and Wi-Fi 6E for speedy networking. If you want to connect G3x-powered devices to other screens, the chip supports output to a 4K display or tethering to a mixed reality headset over a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 is its latest attempt to hit a Windows on Arm home run</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MDxx2e"&gt;Qualcomm has announced its latest flagship chip for PCs: the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3, which, as the name implies, succeeds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020"&gt;last year’s 8cx Gen 2 model&lt;/a&gt; and offers some substantial jumps in performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mC6ra7"&gt;The 8cx Gen 3 is the first chip for Windows computers built on a 5nm process and promises up to 85 percent better CPU performance and up to 60 percent faster GPU performance compared to the 8cx Gen 2. Additionally, Qualcomm boasts that its new chip offers “60 percent greater performance per watt over the competitive x86 platform” — although the company is notably quiet on which x86 platform its comparing things to. Qualcomm also touts that the chip supports “multi-day battery life,” although again, it didn’t provide too many details. &lt;/p&gt;
