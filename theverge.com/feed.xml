    <title>CES 2022 starts to fall apart as T-Mobile, Amazon, and others bail on in-person conference</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjBRnX"&gt;Another year, another gigantic tech tradeshow that looks like it may be falling apart as the COVID-19 pandemic continues — now that T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert, one of the Consumer Electronics Show’s featured speakers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065"&gt;has publicly announced&lt;/a&gt; that his company won’t be attending the world’s largest electronics show next month. Amazon has also decided not to attend the show in-person, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1473486307657539584?s=21"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CIAE17"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m sorry we’ll miss seeing everyone at CES this year, but we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our statement here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7"&gt;https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Sievert (@MikeSievert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>TCL resumes selling its Google TVs after rolling out software fixes</title>

  &lt;p id="XSuaHS"&gt;After briefly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826619/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-best-buy-removal-os-bugs-slow"&gt;halting sales of its 6-Series and 5-Series Google TVs&lt;/a&gt; due to sluggish, buggy software, TCL this evening announced that the TVs are back. “Recent software updates have allowed us to make significant improvements on the stability and speed of the TCL televisions featuring Google TV,” spokesperson Rachelle Parks said by email. “With these updates, this product now represents the powerful performance that TCL and Google believe is the future of TV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTfkgI"&gt;The Google TVs represent TCLs effort to take a platform agnostic approach with its TV hardware; the company is best known for its popular sets that come preloaded with Roku software, but it has also manufactured Android TV products. The 6-Series (R646) and 5-Series (R546) are the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s new 16:18 monitor looks like a multitasking powerhouse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVNWPAC4X6Ycy-L8nVHxgBRCsFw=/93x0:1085x661/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304258/LG_DualUp_Lifestyle_00.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J9ivA9"&gt;Are monitors with traditional aspect ratios just not getting the job done for you? LG might have the answer. Today the company has announced what it touts as “a completely new format in the monitor market” called the DualUp. With a unique 16:18 aspect ratio, LG claims the DualUp gives you “the same screen real estate as two 21.5-inch displays and has a vertical split view function that lets users see more in one glance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnqeJY"&gt;With a resolution of 2560x2880 and measuring 27.6 inches on the diagonal, the DualUp (model 28MQ780) tops out at 300 nits of brightness and covers 98 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. It attaches to LG’s included Ergo stand, which can clamp to “most” desks and tables to save on space. Aside from the productivity and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Still on the hunt for the perfect gift? Here are some last-minute ideas</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kj64xj"&gt;So the holidays are just days away, and you’re panicking because you still haven’t found a gift yet. Perhaps the present you wanted to give simply won’t arrive in time, or maybe you’ve just been too busy — or lazy — to pick something up (no judgment there). Whatever the reason, don’t worry; thanks to the internet, procrastinators, busy bees, and even lazy folks can still buy some great digital gifts without needing to leave their house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lPllZ"&gt;The only problem? There are tons of digital gifts to choose from, ranging from streaming subscriptions to concert tickets, and finding the right one can be overwhelming. That’s why we’ve rounded up a few gift ideas across a number of popular categories, including film and travel, so you quickly choose,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel will put unvaccinated employees on unpaid leave</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RNRH6dgAYM1egyIPOrecxVraQgw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304134/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YZ8lqp"&gt;Intel has reportedly notified employees that anyone who remains unvaccinated will need to get the COVID-19 vaccine or submit an exemption by January 4th. Otherwise, they face being put on unpaid leave, according to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-religion-oregon-1366bdfdf1f72d947fddfe39694f2223"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2021/12/intel-oregons-largest-employer-tells-unvaccinated-employees-they-may-face-unpaid-leave-in-april.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oregonian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzYmrZ"&gt;In the December 7th memo obtained by both publications, Intel HR boss Christy Pambianchi said unvaccinated employees will need to seek an exemption or get weekly tests, even if they’re working from home. She also reportedly told employees that the company will review medical and religious exemptions up until March 15th of next year. The company initially put the January 4th vaccine deadline &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2021/11/intel-oregons-largest-employer-sets-vaccine-deadline-for-us-workers.html"&gt;in place last month&lt;/a&gt;, but didn’t specify what would happen to unvaccinated employees if they didn’t...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ZZrBoN"&gt;Details on this website are murky, however. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said today that “We will have more information as it is available including what the website looks like,” she said, adding, “We will make the website available as soon as these tests are available.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4zbsC"&gt;President Biden also said that his administration is working with Google to make it easier for Americans to find COVID-19 testing locations. “We’ve...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ad board tells Mint Mobile it should stop abusing the word ‘unlimited’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mint Mobile says it will comply with the board’s decision.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Mint Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iZRFey"&gt;The National Advertising Review Board &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/nad-clamps-down-mint-mobile-unlimited-ad-claims"&gt;has denied Mint Mobile’s appeal&lt;/a&gt; defending its use of the word “unlimited” in its advertising since its unlimited prepaid plan includes a high-speed data cap of 35GB per month. That’s not unusual — most unlimited plans include a cap on high-speed or “premium” data — but Mint actually slows customers down to unreasonably slow 2G speeds after 35GB. That &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;unusual, even in an industry that has rendered the term “unlimited” virtually meaningless, and &lt;a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/decisions-details/mint-mobile-unlimited-claims-appeal"&gt;the ad board sides with AT&amp;amp;T’s argument&lt;/a&gt; that it’s slower than a customer would reasonably expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNM4a0"&gt;Carriers and MVNOs have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13330158/t-mobile-unlimited-data-settlement-fine-discount-free-data"&gt;throttled heavy data users&lt;/a&gt; more or less since unlimited plans made a comeback.

    <title>Scammers steal $150K worth of crypto from NFT project with Discord hack</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kv0Llt"&gt;Buyers hoping to get a limited-edition NFT from Fractal, a new marketplace for game item NFTs, were given an unpleasant and costly surprise on Tuesday morning when it was revealed that a link sent through the project’s official Discord channel was a scam set up to steal crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnPs5X"&gt;Users who followed the link and connected their crypto wallets, expecting to receive an NFT, instead found that their holdings of Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency were emptied and transferred to the scammer’s account. An analysis posted on Medium by Tim Cotten, founder of another NFT gaming project, estimated the value of SOL stolen &lt;a href="https://blog.cotten.io/the-150k-discord-crypto-hack-b3dde6698072"&gt;to be around $150,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qtG5p"&gt;Fractal is a &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/12/13/twitch-cofounder-justin-kan-is-back-with-nft-gaming-marketplace-fractal/"&gt;startup project from Twitch co-founder Justin Kan&lt;/a&gt; specializing in the buying and selling of NFTs...&lt;/p&gt;
