    <title>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is like an epic yet enigmatic novel</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="12nuhP"&gt;At some point during my time with &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium: The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;, after I read yet another minutes-long dialogue sequence to try and learn more information about the game’s murder mystery, I realized I felt like I was slowly working my way through a long novel — one that went just a little bit over my head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kvtgct"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;, an enhanced version of the 2019 cult hit role-playing game that made its console debut on PlayStation in March, you play as a cop with amnesia investigating a murder case about a hanged man. You’ll explore a fictional place called Revachol and talk to a huge cast of characters to piece together clues about the hanged man’s killer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cb1L8i"&gt;Almost every conversation or interaction has an extensive dialogue tree, allowing you...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Florida bill would fine social media platforms for banning politicians— with exemption for Disney</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jk9T3HNt7XfRqHyNQFwcn_uarBQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69218332/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AcOSH8"&gt;Florida is on the verge of passing &lt;a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/7072/BillText/e1/HTML"&gt;legislation that would fine&lt;/a&gt; social media companies like Twitter and Facebook that “knowingly de-platform” political candidates. The bill was first &lt;a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/gov-desantis-holds-press-conference-from-florida-state-capitol/"&gt;proposed in February by Gov. Ron DeSantis&lt;/a&gt;, a supporter of former President Trump, although &lt;a href="https://www.cltampa.com/news-views/florida-news/article/21151908/floridas-big-tech-crackdown-bill-goes-to-desantis-but-with-a-special-exemption-for-disney"&gt;Florida Republicans insist&lt;/a&gt; the bill has nothing to do with the former president, a famous denizen of social media who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; by major platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQC0gc"&gt;The Florida House of Representatives passed &lt;a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/7072"&gt;SB 7072 by a vote of 77 to 38&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, after the state Senate voted Monday to pass the measure. The bill now goes back to the Senate to approve some of the changes made by the House; the Senate’s version called for fines of $10,000 per day for banning a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New vaccine perks: halftime shots and savings bonds  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A woman holds a child on her lap, while a healthcare worker prepares to give the woman a COVID-19 vaccine injection. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AV520pc5WJeJpW9ftXhLkBiywc4=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69218119/1232610818.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rTXg8F"&gt;If you’re one of the few thousand people heading to see the Milwaukee Bucks play the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday, May 2nd, you have a chance to get a very special souvenir during the game — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407753/covid-vaccine-milwaukee-bucks-arena-nba"&gt;your first dose of a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. The unusual vaccination drive is part of a host of new efforts across the US to get people their shots, whether that’s by bribing them with savings bonds in West Virginia or hosting vaccine clinics at professional basketball games in Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qL6fUl"&gt;In the US, vaccine supplies are high, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22399889/vaccine-supply-demand-antivirus-newsletter-covid"&gt;demand is starting to taper off&lt;/a&gt;, as my colleague Nicole Wetsman wrote last week. That means that people are getting a lot more creative about ways to convince people to get their shots. You know, in case the &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/news/free-beer-for-getting-covid-vaccine-budweiser-samuel-adams"&gt;free beer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2021/03/22/covid-vaccine-free-donuts-krispy-kreme-vaccination-card-freebie/4750302001/"&gt;free...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Enjoy these limited-time tech and gaming discounts</title>

  &lt;p id="vvskRD"&gt;We’ve reached the weekend, and the start of another month. Sayonara, April, and hello to May. The past few days at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have been some of the best tech deals so far this year, like the now-expired deal that knocked $150 off the Apple Watch Series 6, putting it lower in price than even the Apple Watch SE. That one sold out in just a few hours, though I wouldn’t be surprised to see it come again soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkJFs3"&gt;Not all of the best sales of the week have ended. You can save on PC games in celebration of Golden Week in Japan, and get $80 off a Google Nest Wifi bundle, to name a couple of examples. Find even more below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VFw4lY"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qEG4do"&gt;Save up to $147 on a preorder of a new M1 iPad Pro or iMac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QP5Tpi"&gt;Apple announced that the new iPad Pro and the colorful iMacs will...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s new prime lenses are the small saviors I’ve been looking for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H7xAVBtFM6C9CuNhytSsU7lze4s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69217934/BFARSACE_042221_4548_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sony’s newest lenses are three new compact primes lenses that each cost $600.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ItS4cR"&gt;The new Sony 24mm f/2.8, 40mm f/2.5, and 50mm f/2.5 are three new compact prime lenses that each cost $599.99 and will be shipping in mid-May. While they uphold the reputation of quality Sony has established with the G lineup, it’s their uniformity and small size that come as a welcomed surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExaDUW"&gt;Uniformity and size are so rarely a topic of discussion in regards to lenses. As a video-first creator, 67mm, 77mm, and 82mm are common thread sizes in my gear bag. But it feels like with every new lens I buy I have to factor in the cost of a new ND filter or a step-up or down ring. These three new lenses all conveniently share the same 49mm filter thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFPPDj"&gt;Then there is weight and size. It’s no secret that bags with full-frame camera gear are...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s app store changes crank up the Apple pressure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UltTp-k1aCq4k4mOzZ3XxyzyMM8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69217712/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8jumvR"&gt;Microsoft shook up the PC gaming industry this week with the announcement that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;cutting the fee it takes from game sales on the Windows store&lt;/a&gt;. On the surface, it’s a welcome move, with Microsoft matching the 12 percent cut that Epic Games takes, and putting more pressure on Valve, which still takes a 30 percent cut on most Steam purchases. But the cut is also a tactical move: Microsoft wants to help pressure Apple, and this week’s changes could play a role in the bigger app store battles kicking off next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKtdxU"&gt;Microsoft’s announcement comes just days before a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;huge court trial between Epic Games and Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and just as the EU has found issues with Apple’s rules — claiming the company has a “dominant position in the market for the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned that card grading companies are drowning in Pokémon cards</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="703a8P"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv9a9/pokemon-cards-psa-cgc-bgs-turnaround-times"&gt;A report from Vice&lt;/a&gt; has opened my eyes to just how big the Pokémon trading card collecting market is getting — apparently to the point where card rating companies have waitlists that range from six to ten months, with one company claiming it’s receiving over 500,000 cards to grade per week. The card graders, who rate trading cards’ conditions to determine how collectable (and therefore valuable) they are, are so swamped that people who want to get their Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, or sports cards graded are also having to wait in line (or &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22360269/pokemon-card-psa-rating-services-halted"&gt;pay out the nose&lt;/a&gt; to skip it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xn1u75"&gt;One card rating company apparently needed employees so bad it offered $1,000 starting bonuses — and then &lt;em&gt;bumped them up to $2,500&lt;/em&gt;. Another company had to buy &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; warehouses to store...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFJuIO"&gt;If you’d like a visual of one way that doom could overtake Earth almost immediately, then YouTube user Anselo La Manna has just the video for you: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bU1QPtOZQZU"&gt;a large asteroid impact simulation scored to nothing other than Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opzGUC"&gt;Specifically, that’s “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVBCE3gaNxc"&gt;Great Gig in the Sky&lt;/a&gt;,” off what might be the band’s most beloved and over-analyzed album, &lt;em&gt;Dark Side of the Moon&lt;/em&gt;. It’s got everything total annihilation needs: contemplative piano, pedal steel guitar, and of course, a plaintive wail, capturing the whole range of emotions that people might feel if they were burned to a crisp because one big rock hit another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrgVIK"&gt;Anselo La Manna also hosts &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENT_hnyO-o"&gt;the original clip&lt;/a&gt; the mashup video uses on their YouTube page, a simulation of a large asteroid impact. It appears...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook acquires the developers of VR military simulator Onward</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K0_S_XLwQ_g7_WSofbyrC69bDIg=/101x0:1190x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69215417/_joK6MdQ.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Onward&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Downpour Interactive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OiAynm"&gt;Facebook’s Oculus division has snatched up yet another popular virtual reality game developer. On Friday, the company announced &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwelcoming-downpour-interactive-to-facebook%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it has acquired Downpour Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, the studio behind the hit multiplayer military simulator &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbdHpD"&gt;“We’ve seen great success with &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt; on the Oculus platform for several years — first on Rift and more recently on Quest,” Mike Verdu, Facebook’s VP of AR / VR content, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwelcoming-downpour-interactive-to-facebook%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Becoming part of the Oculus Studios family will give Downpour Interactive the opportunity to cultivate both the &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt; community with the full support of Oculus Studios resources, and, in the future, pursue other projects.”&lt;/p&gt;
