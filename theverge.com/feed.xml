    <title>Taco Bell had beef with Beyond Meat’s fake carne asada</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2hUjQZ"&gt;Taco Bell, the restaurant known for having ground beef that's utterly indescribable, reportedly told Beyond Meat that its version of carne asada wasn’t good enough to serve. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/taco-bell-abandoned-plan-to-test-beyond-meat-s-carne-asada?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the chain canceled a test product that featured Beyond’s plant-based steak after samples failed to live up to its standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiMfHU"&gt;Beyond Meat denies the report — Shira Zackai, head of communications at the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that “the test between Beyond Meat and Taco Bell was not canceled. Our partnership is strong, and we are actively working together to create a plant-based protein that’s completely new to the national QSR (quick serve restaurant) space. We look forward to sharing more details on what Beyond Meat and Taco Bell...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sen. Warren and AOC demand answers from Amazon after warehouse deaths</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Six people were killed when an Amazon warehouse in Illinois was struck by a tornado&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L9HN3w"&gt;A group of progressive Democratic lawmakers, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Reps. Cori Bush and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is demanding answers from Amazon after six people were killed in a tornado strike at one of its warehouses in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxRpyq"&gt;A letter sent Monday to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and founder Jeff Bezos says the events that happened on December 10th at the Edwardsville facility “fit a larger pattern: Amazon puts worker safety at risk in everyday situations and emergencies alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dO9Ugc"&gt;“As we work to ensure that tragedies such as this one are not repeated, we seek answers about what happened at your Edwardsville warehouse,” the letter continues, “and whether your policies may have contributed to this tragedy.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says he’ll pay over $11 billion in taxes this year</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rs8zWG"&gt;Elon Musk expects to pay over $11 billion in taxes in 2021, the Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1472754632325795843"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. The figure is roughly in line with &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/12/15/elon-musk-to-pay-record-high-12-billion-tax-bill.html"&gt;a report from CNBC&lt;/a&gt; last week, when it estimated that Musk has already paid $7 billion in state and federal taxes this year, and will pay a further $5 billion by January 1st. CNBC said the figures could represent “the single largest tax bill ever.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHGaiJ"&gt;The disclosure comes as Musk and other billionaires are facing increasing scrutiny over the amount of tax they pay. As &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/20/elon-musk-says-he-will-pay-over-11-billion-in-taxes-this-year.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC &lt;/em&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, Musk doesn’t take a salary or cash bonus in his role as Tesla CEO, and instead is compensated in stock awards. When he needs money, he’s able to borrow it using his stock holdings as collateral, which doesn’t carry the same tax...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s ‘first gaming laptop’ has an RTX 3080 and 11th Gen Intel CPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t1nmexUaylYsa2wJQh-7QgRHy7M=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296146/LG_UltraGear_Gaming_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The laptop features an RGB keyboard.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4yDZdI"&gt;LG has announced what it’s calling its “first gaming laptop,” the UltraGear 17G90Q. The 17-inch laptop is powered by a combination of an 11th Gen Intel Tiger Lake H CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Max-Q graphics card, and can be configured with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqCALl"&gt;The company is no stranger to making laptops, but the focus of its previous models has generally been on office productivity rather than offering a top-of-the-line gaming experience. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review"&gt;LG Gram 17&lt;/a&gt; we reviewed earlier this year, for example, was a great lightweight work machine, but its lack of a beefy dedicated GPU meant it definitely wasn’t a gaming machine. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tom Brady’s best throw of the night destroys Microsoft tablet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TyTgnOcUxWut3Ckn3bV8IYgUYts=/47x0:553x337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296124/brady_vs_microsoft_surface.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom Brady rage quitting Microsoft Surface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S3Er4z"&gt;After throwing a fourth-quarter interception to seal a 9-0 loss against the Saints on Sunday night, Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady managed to connect with a Microsoft Surface tablet, absolutely destroying it. The defeat was &lt;a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-gets-shut-out-for-first-time-in-15-years-vs-saints-keeping-a-drew-brees-nfl-record-safe/"&gt;Brady’s first shutout in 15 years&lt;/a&gt;, according to CBS Sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehReaz"&gt;Brady joins an illustrious group of Surface abusers that include &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/8/9693380/the-packers-are-terrible-aaron-rodgers-surface"&gt;Aaron Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SN_Ohio/status/691374430728130560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;Johnny Manziel&lt;/a&gt;, and former boss Bill “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13320664/bill-belichick-patriots-microsoft-surface-tablet-nfl"&gt;I just can’t take it anymore”&lt;/a&gt; Belichick, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0kiYq"&gt;Surface tablets have suffered regular abuse since &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/9/7359503/microsoft-surface-nfl-demo-hands-on"&gt;their introduction in the 2014 NFL season&lt;/a&gt; after Microsoft became the official provider of tablet-based image reviews for teams during games, replacing the black-and-white photographs that had been in use for decades. The tablets were...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ABg3IK"&gt;A trove of leaked images shows what Garmin’s upcoming 2022 smartwatch lineup may look like. A report by German technology site &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,127058.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winfuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows the supposed images of the Garmin Fenix 7 series, Venu 2 Plus, Epix Gen2, and Instinct 2 series smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKZCtR"&gt;The post shows that the Fenix 7 series may consist of three models: the standard Fenix 7, 7S, and 7X, all of which are rumored to be made of both reinforced plastic and stainless steel. At least one model will carry over the built-in solar panel from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/29/20838081/garmin-fenix-6-solar-price-date"&gt;the top-end Fenix 6&lt;/a&gt; that charges the device while you’re wearing it, while others will include the familiar tracking features. It appears that the base model will only come in black, while the Fenix 7S may have an all-white variation, as well...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1kaPt"&gt;Disney and YouTube TV have reached a deal today to put more than a dozen Disney-owned channels back on Google’s internet TV streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDgJod"&gt;The news follows a previous announcement late Friday that the two had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;failed to reach an agreement&lt;/a&gt; before their contract expired, and users were informed they would no longer have access to the channels, which included ESPN, Disney, FX, and other Disney-owned properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYw0eS"&gt;“We are pleased to announce that after a brief disruption, we have reached a new distribution agreement with Google’s YouTube TV for continued carriage of our portfolio of networks,” Disney said in a statement. “We appreciate Google’s collaboration to reach fair terms that are consistent with the market, and we’re thrilled that...&lt;/p&gt;

The companies will pay a total of $6 million combined and also agreed to ensure compliance with the FCC’s 911 availability rules going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUOACx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T will pay $460,000 to settle two different investigations regarding network outages that took place on September 28th, 2020. Both Lumen Technologies and Intrado agreed to resolve investigations into outages that occurred on that same day, with Lumen Technologies paying $3.8 million and Intrado paying $1.7 million.
