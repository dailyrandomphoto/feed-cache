    <title>Microsoft brings Office and OneNote apps to Amazon’s Fire tablets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6n8zy-ESVBoKF8qJawYR251G694=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193974/Fire_HD_10_Plus_Lifestyle_Productivity_Bundle.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ddn8mz"&gt;Microsoft is launching its Office and OneNote apps on Amazon’s Fire tablets today. Both apps are available in Amazon’s Appstore, with the Office app combining Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a single tablet app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46lUFG"&gt;Microsoft is no stranger to Amazon’s Appstore, having previously published apps like Outlook, Xbox, and Xbox Game Pass for Fire tablets. This is the first time Office has appeared on Amazon’s tablets, though. Microsoft has essentially taken its Android Office app that’s already available on the Google Play Store and modified it to work on Amazon’s Fire OS — a forked version of Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1zK1qU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s new Fire HD 10 tablet has slimmer bezels and better specs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405230/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-announced-kids-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FPmAeY"&gt;Both the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08WC1B9D2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VVX1QLD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OneNote&lt;/a&gt; apps will be available on Amazon’s Appstore in regions where Fire tablets are currently sold. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F27%2Fmicrosoft-365-apps-now-available-for-amazon-fire-tablets%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; it has...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People who are vaccinated don’t need to wear masks during many outdoor activities, CDC says</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eDZKag"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/participate-in-activities.html"&gt;new guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, outlining the situations where vaccinated people can stop wearing masks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfHs43"&gt;People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and two weeks after the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8VAK2"&gt;The guidelines, announced today by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, give fully vaccinated people more leeway to return to normal activities — recognizing how effective the vaccines are at preventing disease. But they’re complicated, and they ask people to keep track of different mask guidelines for a wide range of situations. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Secretlab’s first PC desk keeps your cables under control with the help of magnets</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MUSxhG"&gt;Secretlab, which you may know for its gaming chairs, is announcing its first-ever PC desk — the Magnus Metal Desk — and the company has a smart solution to help you manage your cables: you’ll be able to attach magnetic cable-management accessories right onto the desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvzHF5"&gt;The company will offer proprietary accessories like magnetic cable holders to keep your phone’s charging cable from slipping off your desk and a magnetic cable sheath that can be attached to one of the desk’s legs. The desk has a cable tray in the back you can use to store cables as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkoYz6"&gt;The Magnus desk doesn’t just use magnets to help hide cables, though — Secretlab is also making a desk mat that attaches magnetically so it will stay in place while you’re gaming or...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford takes its first step toward producing its own electric car batteries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ee_7gQMUaXLUBt6ePSpJtfX501s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193185/acastro_200406_1777_ford_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j4ZMtl"&gt;Ford announced the launch of a new battery development center in Michigan, the first step toward taking on some of the burden of building its own battery cells for electric cars in-house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqM5m0"&gt;The new “global battery center of excellence” will be called Ford Ion Park and will be based in Southeast Michigan. Ford said the purpose is to conduct research on how to go about making its own electric vehicle batteries. A team of 150 experts will work on ways to build EV batteries that are long lasting, quick to charge, and sustainable for the environment. They will also develop a process for making batteries quickly, cheaply, and at scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4j1Xvb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There will be “lab scale and pilot scale” battery assembly at the new center&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1SS5od"&gt;But Ford Ion Park, which will...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose no longer requires you to make an account just to use its app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A close-up photo of the Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700, the best noise-canceling headphones for video conferencing and voice calls." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p5XrFitUIcOi-c8mzWiA4l1PZ78=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193061/cwelch_190605_3471_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ITjLQM"&gt;Recent Bose headphones and earbuds have come with a somewhat frustrating requirement: to use the accompanying Bose Music app, you needed to create an account. So if you wanted to, say, customize the noise cancellation of the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, you’d have to make a Bose account just to access those important controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eITGqt"&gt;Now Bose is doing away with the needlessly annoying mandatory account. The update notes for the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bose-music/id1364986984"&gt;latest version of Bose Music on iOS&lt;/a&gt; say “when you set up your Bose headphones and earbuds, you can skip creating an account and get right to enjoying your product.” That’s the way it ought to be. (Bose previously had &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.bose.com/en_us/support/articles/HC2547/productCodes/noise_cancelling_headphones_700/article.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this help article up&lt;/a&gt; for customers with “privacy concerns regarding data...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC now lets you directly buy Vive repair parts through iFixit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="vive space pirates" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XDLJoseY5BG2s1yOIbK3VXUqmAU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192939/Vive_Space_Pirates.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QicUrB"&gt;HTC has partnered with iFixit to make its Vive virtual reality systems more repairable, selling a list of screws, cables, adapters, and other standalone components directly to consumers. &lt;a href="https://blog.vive.com/us/2021/04/26/vive-ifixit-repair-partner/"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, HTC says the move is aimed at helping people whose headsets are out of warranty or potentially no longer being sold. iFixit also offers repair guides for the original Vive, the Vive Pro, the original Vive controller, and the Vive Pro Eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kH1pe4"&gt;HTC confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this is the first time consumers have been able to order many of these replacement parts directly. A few listings, like a $3.99 controller lanyard, wouldn’t be hard to find through other sellers. But VR headsets are specialized and niche devices, so if you want a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Legal chatbot firm DoNotPay adds anti-facial recognition filters to its suite of handy tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aCu15NxD4Hvg6YLXLpwvlClMmPw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192915/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BPTk4B"&gt;Legal services startup &lt;a href="http://donotpay.com/"&gt;DoNotPay&lt;/a&gt; is best known for its army of “robot lawyers” — automated bots that tackle tedious online tasks like canceling TV subscriptions and requesting refunds from airlines. Now, the company has unveiled a new tool it says will help shield users’ photos from reverse image searches and facial recognition AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PKCte"&gt;It’s called Photo Ninja and it’s one of dozens of DoNotPay widgets that subscribers can access for $36 a year. Photo Ninja operates like any image filter. Upload a picture you want to shield, and the software adds a layer of pixel-level perturbations that are barely noticeable to humans, but dramatically alter the image in the eyes of roving machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="my0SDE"&gt;The end result, DoNotPay CEO Joshua Browder tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Orochi V2 wireless gaming mouse has astoundingly long battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Orochi V2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPv-tkN9EDCFqABemC33NTPURS4=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192711/razerorochilede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Id1t33"&gt;Razer’s new $69.99 Orochi V2 is a wireless gaming mouse that promises &lt;em&gt;extremely &lt;/em&gt;long battery life. It can apparently last up to 950 hours on a single AA battery when it’s in Bluetooth mode or up to 425 hours if you toggle its wireless switch to use the 2.4GHz Hyperspeed mode that can deliver lower-latency performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFcwY7"&gt;Alternatively, you can use an AAA battery for a slightly lighter weight. Razer says you’ll get approximately a third of the longevity this way compared to an AA battery. Still, it’s nice that either size of battery can power this mouse for many, many hours. Razer includes a USB-A dongle near the battery slots, which is accessible by lifting up on the mouse’s magnetically attached shell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GHs3rB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Available in white or black, or you...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Pixar’s next animated short expands the complex world of Soul</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="22 vs. Earth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_vBtVJ_OuFKpLmriV_aGRz8iMA=/381x0:1667x857/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192686/22vsEARTH_ONLINE_USE_ss881_3_cs.sel16.347_copy.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Pixar Animation Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JM2t0b"&gt;From the very beginning of Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;, 22 — a soul who refuses to come down to Earth — is cynical. She hates the idea of inhabiting a body or finding her inspiration, instead being content with spending eternity in the “great before,” a space meant to prepare souls for their human lives. Viewers don’t really get a sense of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; she feels that way — but that’s about to change in the upcoming animated short &lt;em&gt;22 vs. Earth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMZLQS"&gt;“I didn’t want the short to be a mirror of what she was like in the feature,” says director Kevin Nolting, who also served as lead editor on &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;. “In looking at what the story would be, the interesting thing for me is what makes her who she is in the feature. This is one of those incidents. In the beginning she was one...&lt;/p&gt;
