    <title>Go read this story of why Aaliyah’s ‘One in a Million’ album took 20 years to come to streaming </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eWoKb7"&gt;The 1996 album “One in  a Million,” by Aaliyah finally came to streaming platforms on Friday, almost 20 years after the singer’s death in a 2001 plane crash. A huge star in the 1990s and early 2000s, much of Aaliyah’s music has been missing from streaming platforms for the past two decades. As &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9610793/aaliyah-music-return-streaming-services-blackground-empire/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; magazine reported&lt;/a&gt; in a lengthy feature earlier this month, Aaliyah’s uncle, music producer Barry Hankerson, and her estate, controlled by her mother Diane Haughton and brother Rashad Haughton, have been at odds for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scB1w1"&gt;According to&lt;em&gt; Billboard,&lt;/em&gt; Hankerson has made a distribution deal to release the entire catalog of Blackground Records— which includes Aaliyah’s music as well as recordings from other artists including Timbaland &amp;amp; Magoo,...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="hcOkeU"&gt;China has passed a new privacy law aimed at protecting users’ personal data, state media &lt;a href="http://m.news.cctv.com/2021/08/20/ARTIwr19ckRZu9Bhobw4k5wp210820.shtml"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The new law comes as Chinese tech firms have come under renewed scrutiny in the country, and sets rules around how companies handle users’ information. The law takes effect on November 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGNemt"&gt;The law—formally called the Personal Information Protection Law— was passed by China’s legislature on Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-passes-new-personal-data-privacy-law-take-effect-nov-1-2021-08-20/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, and calls for companies to get users’ consent before collecting personal data, and has rules for how companies should ensure users’ data is protected when it’s transferred outside of China. Tech companies that handle personal information must have a designated person tasked with overseeing its protection, and companies must...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse removed personal info from users’ accounts in Afghanistan as a safety measure</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Clubhouse has removed some info from users in Afghanistan as a safety measure | Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9fE9RP"&gt;Social audio app Clubhouse has joined other social platforms in taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of its users in Afghanistan. Earlier this week, the platform reset tens of thousands of its Afghan users’ bios and photos, and made their accounts more difficult to discover in search. A spokesperson for Clubhouse said the actions didn’t affect the users’ followers, and all of the changes can be reversed if a user prefers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wHI3A7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A message form &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Afghanistan?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;’s users. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CpS4iz0L1J"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CpS4iz0L1J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zaki Daryabi (@ZDaryabi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZDaryabi/status/1428233850296184836?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Judge rules California Prop 22 gig workers law is unconstitutional</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="App-based drivers from Uber and Lyft protest in a caravan in front of City Hall in Los Angeles on October 22, 2020 where elected leaders hold a conference urging voters to reject on the November 3 election, Proposition 22, that would classify app-based drivers as independent contractors and not employees or agents" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2KVUW0SAtiJlqu_PjrEb68tXysc=/396x0:4404x2672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69756985/1229223235.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="awPxLG"&gt;California’s gig workers law, which allows companies like Uber and Lyft to treat workers as independent contractors— not employees— has been ruled unconstitutional and unenforceable by a judge. Voters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;approved the law as ballot initiative Proposition 22&lt;/a&gt; in November, with companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash spending more than $200 million to campaign for the measure. Labor organizations, including the Service Employees International Union, opposed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4QeG9"&gt;California Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch ruled Friday that the law illegally “limits the power of a future legislature to define app-based drivers as workers subject to workers’ compensation law,” adding that “The entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable.” He also ruled that it was...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="LV8f67"&gt;The red Apple Watch Series 6 has already seen an array of big discounts, but you don’t always get nice pricing on the more subtle colorways. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F435851135%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are both currently offering $75 off the handsome navy-colored watch, as well as the white model, bringing them down to $325. Walmart also has a few more colors available at the same price, and both offer the red at an additional $6 markdown. In addition to a myriad of fun colors, Apple’s latest and greatest wearable also offers built-in sleep tracking, a blood oxygen sensor, and an always-on display. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton’s app indicates a rowing machine may finally be coming</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bAM8Zz"&gt;Peloton’s rumored rowing machine may finally be on the way, according to text that &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/20/peloton-app-confirms-rower-prepares-scenic-waterways/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; discovered in the Peloton Android app&lt;/a&gt;. When looking through the app’s code, &lt;em&gt;9to5 &lt;/em&gt;discovered references to the rowing machine we’ve been hearing about for the past couple of years — including instructions on how to do a rowing stroke, as well as language suggesting Peloton will offer real-world water scenery that people could view on a screen while rowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFX2M3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-13/peloton-to-sell-cheaper-treadmill-and-a-rowing-machine-in-2020?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;wrote about plans for a Peloton rower&lt;/a&gt; nearly two and a half years ago. More recently, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.pelobuddy.com/peloton-rower-job-posting/"&gt;job listings&lt;/a&gt; mentioning a rower, and Peloton’s CEO has made multiple comments &lt;a href="https://www.pelobuddy.com/peloton-john-foley-rower-strength-bloomberg/"&gt;about rowers&lt;/a&gt; and rowing. If information about the rower is starting to show up in the app’s code,...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="LmNmf8"&gt;Amidst the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627253/google-pixel-5a-specs-price-screen-battery-availability"&gt;news of a new Pixel phone&lt;/a&gt; this week, Google quietly indicated that it’s the end of the road for two other Pixel devices: the Pixel 4A 5G and the Pixel 5. Both are currently listed on Google’s online store as sold out, and remaining stock at other retailers likely won’t last long. A company spokesperson offered the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aijLY1"&gt;With our current forecasts, we expect Google Store in the U.S. to sell out of Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 in the coming weeks following the launch of Pixel 5a (5G). These products will continue to be available through some partners while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vZ4hZ6"&gt;It’s not too surprising that the 4A 5G being discontinued given that the 5A 5G looks to be a fairly direct successor. However, it is a little...&lt;/p&gt;

It was the first time it had released such a report. But &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/facebook-popular-posts.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook was working on a similar report for the first quarter of 2021 that it opted not to share because it might have reflected poorly on the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYUyXH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, which obtained a copy of the report, says that the most-viewed link in the first quarter had a headline that could promote COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330428/facebook-research-vaccine-hesitancy-doubt-coronavirus"&gt;been an issue on the social media platform&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p id="gEuVCT"&gt;On Thursday the video and image sharing site OnlyFans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632797/onlyfans-prohibit-sexually-explicit-content-porn-creators"&gt;announced plans to ban “sexually-explicit content”&lt;/a&gt; starting October 1st. While we’re still not sure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22633411/onlyfans-banned-explicit-porn-sex-content-after-bbc-investigation-leak"&gt;exactly why&lt;/a&gt; it’s changing so drastically, it just sent out an updated Terms of Service policy to the creators who’ve built the site detailing exactly what won’t be allowed going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olv5aF"&gt;Comparing &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/aup"&gt;the new OnlyFans Acceptable Use Policy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/terms#acceptable-use-policy"&gt;the old one&lt;/a&gt; makes the additions clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldp61G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not upload, post, display, or publish Content on OnlyFans that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uQlMlr"&gt;Shows, promotes, advertises or refers to “sexually explicit conduct”, which means:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WdnGw0"&gt;actual or simulated sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, between persons of any sex;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vyQkWo"&gt;actual or simulated...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p id="dpGLWZ"&gt;NASA’s Mars rover, Perseverance, is getting ready for another attempt, in the coming weeks, to scoop up Martian rocks after its first attempt earlier this month didn’t play out as engineers expected. The rover’s sample-caching arm worked, engineers say, but the sampling tube turned up empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdRc2b"&gt;Now the rover, a science lab on wheels that landed on Mars in February, will drive to a new location called Citadelle for a second shot at picking up its first rock sample. This time, to make sure a sample is actually collected, engineers will wait for images of the sample tube to come back before it gets processed and stowed inside the rover’s belly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dzpnPc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘No sample? What do you mean no sample?’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
