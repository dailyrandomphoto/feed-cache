    <title>Texas cold snap froze cleanup efforts at some Superfund sites</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NiWCTT"&gt;Texas’ deep freeze was the latest warning that extreme weather events threaten to derail efforts to clean up the most toxic sites in the US. In a worst-case scenario, a natural disaster can unleash buried toxic substances. But even minimal damage or the mere threat of a storm can stop or slow cleanup efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prRtP7"&gt;That vulnerability could become a bigger problem as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/superfund-sites-climate-change/index.html"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; brings about more weather-related disasters. For years, experts have pushed the Environmental Protection Agency to prepare for the onslaught. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBbhAh"&gt;“We have over two dozen Superfund sites here in our county, and we are one of the most threatened coasts in the world by natural forces,” says Jackie Young-Medcalf, executive director of the Houston-based nonprofit Texas...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon Sound certification promises a big wave of hi-fi wireless headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYmtmgMJkh3S_NtAqBK-cxAZl80=/1x0:1365x909/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911041/snapdragonsound.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qLEf74"&gt;Qualcomm today announced Snapdragon Sound, which is what the company describes as “a chain of audio innovations and software” that work together to significantly improve audio quality when listening to music through wireless headphones, earbuds, and other devices. The goal is to deliver “high-resolution, wired quality audio, wirelessly,” according to James Chapman, Qualcomm’s VP of voice, music, and wearables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2fNbs"&gt;Snapdragon Sound takes advantage of the company’s latest processors, Bluetooth audio SoCs, and codecs like aptX Adaptive to achieve playback of hi-fi music up to 24-bit 96kHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R54EyN"&gt;The concept of high-quality wireless audio isn’t new to Android; Sony has been largely pushing that mission forward with its own LDAC technology, which can...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM is close to building a second EV battery factory in the US, report says</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pOfyP1"&gt;General Motors is considering building a second battery factory in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-looking-to-build-second-battery-factory-in-u-s-11614853806?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, in order to ramp up its production of electric vehicles in the interest of becoming a completely &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;carbon neutral company by the year 2040&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIwiS0"&gt;The factory would be built in collaboration with LG Chem, the South Korean battery maker that is already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20996866/gm-lg-ev-electric-vehicle-battery-joint-venture-chem-lordstown"&gt;working with GM on a battery factory&lt;/a&gt; in northern Ohio. According to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, the second facility is likely to be located in Tennessee, though a final location has yet to be selected. A spokesperson for GM confirmed that a second factory is being discussed with LG Chem, and a decision is expected sometime in the first half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJHAu6"&gt;GM announced the construction of its first...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Pacific Rim’s sci-fi world was transformed into a Netflix anime</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pacific Rim: The Black" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lRBQS54mI2_gXFj_5EjH7uit2mI=/240x0:1680x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68910974/PRA101_63_003_00.0101.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ie9d8b"&gt;Yuki Moriyama still remembers the first time he saw &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt;. He was a bit of a latecomer, and he ended up catching it in theaters with some friends who had already seen the movie multiple times. It wasn’t long before Moriyama — an art director at animation studio Polygon Pictures — was hooked as well. “It’s the type of film that, once you get into it, it becomes quite addictive,” he says of the straightforward mech vs. kaiju battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkdNV5"&gt;Now, Moriyama and the team at Polygon are releasing their own take on the franchise. Created in collaboration with Legendary Television and writers Greg Johnson and Craig Kyle, &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim: The Black&lt;/em&gt; is an animated series on Netflix that explores a new time period. It’s set after the two films and takes...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s first-gen Surface Headphones are down to their lowest price yet</title>

  &lt;p id="yVZ3Xw"&gt;Microsoft’s first-generation Surface Headphones released in 2018, and despite being three years old, these headphones are still a good option if you’re looking for a pair of noise-canceling headphones. Usually $250, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeDealsrRoundup030421/https://computers.woot.com/offers/microsoft-surface-headphones-7?" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot currently has a deal on this model&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $111.&lt;/p&gt;

You can grab the late-2020 Apple laptop, which comes with 256GB of SSD storage, for $1,200 ($99 off) right now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604809-REG%2Fapple_myd82ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html#donotlink"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uMlpWJ"&gt;Today let’s talk about a comprehensive new report on election integrity, and the particularly low marks it gave to one platform in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6WvZX3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5Nb0VR"&gt;The 283-page report, which was published today, is called “&lt;a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/report"&gt;The Long Fuse: Misinformation and the 2020 Election&lt;/a&gt;.” It is the final work of a coalition of some of the most respected names in platform analysis in academia and the nonprofit world: the Stanford Internet Observatory, the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public, Graphika, and the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bJoKN"&gt;The report builds on work that the partnership did leading up to and after November to identify and counter false narratives about the 2020 US presidential election. It describes its goals this...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tXmGA"&gt;Alice Proujansky photographed her first birth when she was seven years old. “My parents gave me this little point-and-shoot camera that I photographed my sister’s birth with,” she says. “It was the first person I ever photographed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQrvg1"&gt;Now, Proujansky is a documentary photographer photographing stories of births and maternal health. When COVID-19 first hit New York City, where she lives, Proujansky wanted to capture birth during a pandemic. But in March and April 2020, hospitals and birth centers were restricting who was allowed to be in the delivery room with someone giving birth — for a short time, some New York City hospitals were &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/parenting/nyc-coronavirus-hospitals-visitors-labor.html"&gt;barring everyone&lt;/a&gt;, even partners, and asking people to deliver alone. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="vO5jlE"&gt;Amazon has announced a new feature for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Halo fitness-tracking gadget&lt;/a&gt;: Alexa integration. With this new feature, Halo owners will be able to ask Alexa devices for various health stats, such as their sleep score or activity points obtained during the day. The integration will be off by default and owners will need the latest firmware on their Halo bands and the latest version of the iOS or Android app to enable it. Amazon says the feature rollout is starting today, March 4th, and will be continuing over the next week or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CehWnZ"&gt;The Halo band is Amazon’s first fitness-focused product and it’s had a less than stellar reception since it was announced last fall. Aside from the standard fitness things of tracking your movement and sleep...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eve is rolling out Thread support to more of its smart home lineup</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DKD04N"&gt;Eve Systems, a maker of smart home products that work with Apple’s HomeKit platform, is announcing an expanded range of devices that support the Thread smart protocol. The news consists of updated versions of its existing smart plug, a forthcoming firmware update for the company’s smart sprinkler, and a new outdoor weather station.&lt;/p&gt;
