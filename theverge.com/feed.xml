    <title>Section 230 has become a bargaining chip in ongoing stimulus talks</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ksQvgr"&gt;A series of unexpected negotiating maneuvers have put Section 230 — a critical liability shield for online platforms — back in play in ongoing congressional stimulus talks. In a floor statement made Tuesday, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) linked a handful of unrelated policy measures to the future of the increased stimulus checks; amongst them, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that shields tech companies like Facebook and Google from legal liability over the content users post on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xMGRI"&gt;McConnell’s statement comes amid increasingly chaotic negotiating over the level of direct payments to be included as part of stimulus efforts. On Sunday, President Trump signed into law Congress’ $900 billion...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Brexit deal calls for DNA profiles to use a 20-year-old email app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ReXMQ7w1-Vlx5LUE_yEh1J_obw=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68593780/netscape.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="js3fyr"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/25/world/europe/brexit-britain-european-union.html"&gt;mammoth, last-minute deal&lt;/a&gt; that will govern the United Kingdom and European Union’s trade relations going forward post-Brexit has been finalized in the nick of time. But some security researchers have noted some puzzling aspects of the deal, including mentions of the defunct, 23-year old Netscape Communicator email software and recommendations of outdated encryption standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rNEDLf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just in case you forget what Netscape Communicator 4.0 looked like ... &lt;a href="https://t.co/573xNdN3ZH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/573xNdN3ZH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Prof B Buchanan OBE (@billatnapier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/billatnapier/status/1342935639663259648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 26, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zKgRcw"&gt;The mention occurs in a series of regulations concerning “encrypt[ing] messages containing DNA profile information” between countries, which must be done using a &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Secure_Multipurpose_Internet_Mail_Extensions"&gt;specific set of encryption protocols&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google inexplicably takes away wide-angle astrophotography from Pixel phones</title>

  &lt;p id="ILFVCu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;4a 5G&lt;/a&gt; users can no longer use their ultrawide cameras to take pictures of the stars: Google apparently removed the lens’s astrophotography capabilities with the Google Camera 8.1 update. The feature was a selling point of the Pixel 4, and was available on the regular and telephoto cameras. When the 4a 5G and 5 were announced with new wide-angle lenses, the feature was added to those as well. Now it’s been taken away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAOoxZ"&gt;The astrophotography feature lets users capture the night sky by pointing their phone up and keeping it still, either by balancing it on a nearby object or putting it on a tripod. The feature is still available on the phones’ other cameras, but if you go to Night Sight mode and switch to the ultrawide camera,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>26 great apps for your new 2020 Windows PC</title>

  &lt;p id="t4RQBU"&gt;If you bought a new Windows laptop on Black Friday or received one as a gift, you may be struggling to figure out which apps to download. Never fear. I have scoured the internet, the Microsoft Store, and my own downloads folder to find all the best Windows apps for whatever purpose you may need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0Cbu0"&gt;You might be surprised how many online services you already use that have their own dedicated Windows app. I find that the main benefit of many Windows apps is to help mentally separate my life. It can get hard to navigate all of my various streaming services, work apps, chats, and social media using Chrome tabs — and it also puts me at greater risk of getting distracted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjqWUi"&gt;There are also some services that are significantly better in app form...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats Powerbeats Pro are selling for just $90 refurbished at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AVmL7q"&gt;You can snag a refurbished set of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s latest truly wireless earphones, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1727919844346770522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $90 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This deal is exclusive to the green “moss” color variant shown in the picture above. Looking at new options, the price ranges from $130 to $180 depending on the color you want, so today’s deal is worth jumping on if you don’t care as much about what the headphones look like. And hey, if this shade of green happens to vibe with your look, then even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tCUBP"&gt;Though these are refurbished, they’ve been cleaned and tested by Best Buy. They come with a 90-day warranty, as well as all original accessories including ear tips and the charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="szdyLg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kM3bgP"&gt;Also at Best Buy, Apple’s latest iPad with 128GB of storage &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1727920106073161754" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $50 off of...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>11 great apps ready for your new 2020 M1 Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CNGYlf2Kg4I8qzyZj5Qg1fwiaB8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68592449/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ajXKN7"&gt;This year marked the introduction of the first Macs to be powered by Apple’s own silicon instead of Intel chips. As is evidenced by our reviews of the M1 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21334538"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21334087"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt;, these machines are incredibly powerful and offer wicked fast performance. This is especially true for apps that are designed to run natively on them and take full advantage of Apple’s latest technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7tLg8"&gt;So in that vein, this year’s Mac apps list is going to focus on some of the software that has already been optimized for this new era of Apple hardware. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/27/21029022/best-macos-apps-apple-mac-macbook-air-pro-airmail-alfred-bear-lastpass-vlc"&gt;Last year’s picks&lt;/a&gt; remain just as relevant and useful today if you’re on an Intel machine. But if you’ve been gifted (or are gifting yourself) one of these new speed-demon Macs, these are...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch leak offers rare glimpse inside ‘Ultra security program’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dgl2PV"&gt;New images and video purporting to show an Apple Watch prototype, concealed by a security case that resembles a tiny iPod, offer a rare look behind the product-development curtain of the notoriously secretive company built by Steve Jobs. First &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/4/20975197/apple-watch-prototype-tiny-ipod-security-case-rumor"&gt;teased a few months ago&lt;/a&gt; by Twitter user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleDemoYT"&gt;Apple Demo&lt;/a&gt;, this is our first look at the device turned on and running Apple’s own internal development apps on a pre-watchOS 1.0 software build. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4d5lGV"&gt;The video starts by showing what appears to be the original cardboard packaging used to deliver the prototype hardware to testers. “This product is classified as Apple Confidential and is designated an ‘Ultra’ security program,” reads the label. “This prototype MUST be returned when recalled or when your,” says the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s new ‘QNED’ TVs will have up to nearly 30,000 tiny LEDs behind the screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TCVKEeqJNBCtuKInA9OdnPpvRWA=/88x0:1882x1196/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68591325/LG_QNED_grab.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s new QNED TV uses Mini LEDs as the light source.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XGvhhb"&gt;LG might be the company that’s most synonymous with OLED TVs, but tonight it’s announcing what to expect from its LCD-based sets in 2021. Like other manufacturers including TCL have already done (and &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/excited-first-samsung-mini-led-tvs-are-just-around-the-corner/"&gt;Samsung is expected to soon join in on&lt;/a&gt;), LG is adopting Mini LED technology for its premium LCD 8K and 4K TVs coming next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4maltP"&gt;LG says Mini LED allows for “a giant leap forward in LCD TV picture quality.” The best LCD TVs today have what’s called “full-array local dimming,” where LEDs — in some cases hundreds of them — serve as the backlighting behind the screen. These can be controlled in zones, and each zone can be dimmed as appropriate for dark scenes, which helps improve black levels and contrast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmtF53"&gt;Mini LED changes up the strategy a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase halts trading of XRP following SEC suit against Ripple</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5JQuZf"&gt;Coinbase announced today that it is halting all trades of XRP on its cryptocurrency exchange, according to &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-will-suspend-trading-in-xrp-on-january-19-2e09652dbf57"&gt;an official blog post&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-suspends-xrp-trading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coindesk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Certain kind of trades became restricted today, and the full suspension will go into place January 19th, 2021 at 10AM PT. Coinbase is the largest cryptocurrency exchange, and suspending a currency like XRP naturally casts doubt on the currency’s future, even before the SEC lawsuit over it is settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDQK9S"&gt;Coinbase says it made the decision to suspend XRP “in light” of the suit the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed against XRP’s original creator, Ripple. With the suspension in place, people will no longer be able to trade XRP on Coinbase, though they will still be able to deposit and...&lt;/p&gt;
