    <title>The Royal Navy is testing using jet suits to fight high-seas piracy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdYlg0"&gt;The British Royal Navy has apparently been testing using jet suits to board ships like a scene out of some scrapped Christopher Nolan film, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suHOLFhbwsM"&gt;according to a new video&lt;/a&gt; released by UK-based Gravity Industries. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/video-royal-marines-board-ship-at-sea-with-jet-packs-2021-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt; that the tests were conducted over three days on the HMS Tamar, a Royal Navy Batch 2 River-class offshore patrol ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEA3KD"&gt;Royal Marines used Gravity Industries’ Jet Suit to conduct a “visit, board, search, and seizure” operation or VBSS. Basically a marine launched from a fast boat tailing the HMS Tamar, flew through the air like a slightly askew Iron Man, and landed on the larger ship, dropping a rope below so their fast boat buddies could climb up and “visit” the simulated enemy vessel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PnotiW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xIoy3M"&gt;The whole thing is very...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic pushed Xbox chief to open free multiplayer just ahead of Apple Fortnite battle</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g2736R"&gt;Epic pushed Microsoft to open up its Xbox network for free multiplayer gaming just weeks before the Apple and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; battle. In the weeks leading up to Epic Games’ decision to circumvent Apple’s 30 percent cut on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in-app purchases, CEO Tim Sweeney sent an email to Xbox chief Phil Spencer teasing something big and asking whether Microsoft could time free multiplayer with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; season 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ78ST"&gt;“Epic has certain plans for August that will provide an extraordinary opportunity to highlight the value proposition of consoles and PCs, in contrast to mobile platforms, and to onboard new console users,” said Sweeney. “While I can’t share details with any third party at this point, I give you Epic’s assurance that our efforts will be...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One of Samsung’s best phones ever is now officially retired</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus rear view" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dDkt6Hi-KKqo3wFzuqknvwMqMc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235494/jbareham_170414_1603_0044.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After four years of support, the S8 and S8 Plus will no longer receive security updates.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7CVLJg"&gt;Four years after its launch, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has received its last security update. The Galaxy S8 was a well-timed success story for Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15092590/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-screen-size-aspect-ratio-edge"&gt;launching in the spring of 2017&lt;/a&gt; with a bold design that drew attention away from the well-documented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12767670/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-fire-risk"&gt;Galaxy Note 7 battery problems&lt;/a&gt; of the previous six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjJvyk"&gt;The S8 marked a design shift for Galaxy devices, with a wider-aspect edge-to-edge screen with minimal bezels that made it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15087530/samsung-galaxy-s8-announced-features-release-date-video-specifications"&gt;one of the best-looking phones&lt;/a&gt; we’d seen at that point. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus"&gt;wasn’t just a good-looking device, either&lt;/a&gt;; it offered excellent hardware and a great camera, combined with a remarkably restrained software implementation. Best of all, the batteries did not catch fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DuyWyZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung has one of the best support policies in the...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sa3dSK"&gt;In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, as people avoided doctors’ offices and hospitals canceled nonessential appointments, routine cancer screenings plummeted. Now, we’re starting to see the consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDnlfN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-crisis-of-undiagnosed-cancers-is-emerging-in-the-pandemics-second-year"&gt;tells the story&lt;/a&gt; of Teresa Ruvalcaba, a factory worker in Chicago who ignored searing pain in her chest for six months. She was busy with work and afraid of catching COVID-19 at the doctor’s office, and when she finally went to the emergency room, she was diagnosed with advanced inflammatory breast cancer. It was one of the most severe cases oncologist Pam Khosla had seen in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9ca98"&gt;Cancer death rates have dropped over 30 percent since the early 1990s, a decline fueled by early detection and new...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wHJ3vY"&gt;The new lineup of originals also includes a third season of Liza Koshy’s &lt;em&gt;Liza on Demand&lt;/em&gt;; a new special focused on Asian American chefs, celebrities, activists, and creators that counts LeBron James and Michelle Kwan as executive producers; and a new special called &lt;em&gt;Barbershop Medicine&lt;/em&gt; that explores the intersection of race and socioeconomic status that came out of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505891/youtube-black-voices-fund-first-originals-slate-announced"&gt;the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund&lt;/a&gt; that was announced last...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Targus buys Sanho and its Hyper line of accessories</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4BC4uX"&gt;Two companies that have built their businesses on computer accessories are coming together. Targus, a company best known for its laptop cases and bags, today &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fblogs%2Fnews%2Ftargus-to-acquire-hyper-by-sanho-corporation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419204%2Ftargus-acquires-sanho-hyper-drive-usb-c-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced that it’s acquiring Sanho&lt;/a&gt;. You might not be familiar with Sanho itself, but it’s more likely you’d recognize the company’s Hyper and HyperDrive lineup of USB-C accessories that are sold on Amazon, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3Fst%3Dhyperdrive&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kA5bLz"&gt;Targus CEO Mikel Williams said the deal “allows for Targus to add capability and support to Hyper’s growing tech brand, and gives Hyper access to new channels, customers and a global footprint of sales and marketing resources.” Williams added that “Hyper has a strong and exciting brand that has excellent reach into the Apple community and, importantly,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood crypto trading crashed during a Dogecoin spike</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XUSRA-44RxnmgY4TDA0JWBJZtN8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235047/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JqQqnJ"&gt;Robinhood ran into issues processing cryptocurrency trades this morning, during a spike in the price of Dogecoin that sent users flocking to the app. The website &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/robinhood/"&gt;DownDetector&lt;/a&gt; shows the outage starting around 9:30AM ET and reducing in severity about an hour later. Robinhood confirmed that it experienced a “partial outage” in crypto trading and said the issues had been resolved as of 11:15AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tq2Zmv"&gt;The outage was particularly noticeable since it came during a spike (and subsequent dip) in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Fprice%2Fdogecoin&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419159%2Frobinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dogecoin prices&lt;/a&gt;. Coins were priced at around $0.40 USD at the beginning of the day. Around 8AM ET, they spiked past $0.50 USD and reached as high as $0.60 USD near 10AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7CSWeY"&gt;

    <title>Instagram will now let you auto-caption Stories with just a sticker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gif of an Instagram story showing a person speaking and the words “It’s a beautiful day out here so we’re gonna go on a walk” appearing at the top of the screen." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5qYaIDti6FUu0Jrf7IApB5sXggk=/84x0:1004x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69234951/Stories_viewer_captions.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jQmdNQ"&gt;Instagram now has a captions sticker for Stories, which will automatically transcribe speech in videos. The sticker will be available only in “English and English-speaking countries” for now but will eventually roll out to other languages and countries. Instagram says it will also start testing automated captions in Reels soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MuwQ4"&gt;Captions have been available in IGTV and the Threads app, and Instagram says it’s adding them to Stories and Reels to make them more efficient and inclusive to watch. The feature should be a welcome addition for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, are not native English speakers, or just generally watch videos without sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The edit option lists each word of the captions separately. You can...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
