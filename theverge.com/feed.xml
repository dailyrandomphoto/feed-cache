    <title>Bose’s latest sport earbuds won’t block out the outside world</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;By sitting above rather than inside the ear, the earbuds let you hear what’s going on in your environment.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bose&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jUuqXR"&gt;Bose’s latest true wireless earbuds, the Sport Open Earbuds, are designed to keep you aware of your surroundings while you listen. While most other earbuds sit inside the ear canal, blocking out at least some ambient noise, the Sport Open Earbuds instead sit outside it. Bose has officially announced the earbuds a little over a month after their existence was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150405/bose-sport-open-earbuds-fcc-leak-photos"&gt;leaked via a Federal Communications Commission filing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gwAyD"&gt;A design that lets in ambient noise might sound unintuitive, given how headphone manufacturers (including Bose) spend so much money trying to do the exact opposite with noise-canceling tech. But there are plenty of instances where being aware of your surroundings is a very good thing, like when you’re cycling through traffic or...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s what we know about the Google union so far</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZJgXuur0NZi0aDpmT9R7-3XRHv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68622963/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lTXnOp"&gt;On Monday, roughly 230 Google employees announced they were forming a union with the Communication Workers of America (CWA). It’s open to employees and contractors at Alphabet, Google’s parent company. As a minority union, it doesn’t need to go through a formal legal process in order to exist. It just needs to announce itself. That part is done. World, meet the &lt;a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/"&gt;Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; (AWU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhNlj6"&gt;The news prompted a wave of support from organizers like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1346125551539548162"&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ekp/status/1346120251109359618"&gt;Ellen Pao&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1346050124544233473"&gt;Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&lt;/a&gt;. It also led to some questions. What is a minority union? Isn’t 230 members rather small? Why is CWA involved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bj902G"&gt;Here’s what we know so far about the Alphabet Workers Union — and what we are still waiting to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSLnao"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft commits to fix Xbox Series X controller disconnects in a future update</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yDG3Gl"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; feels like a huge PC-like upgrade for your Xbox games, but a fraction of buyers have been experiencing an unusual &lt;em&gt;downgrade&lt;/em&gt; as well — the new Xbox Series X gamepad doesn’t seem to stay connected to the console in some games and some situations, &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/xba_console/xbox-series-x-controller-keeps-disconnecting/16d9f462-57c0-4b6c-93fd-b03711e632ee?page=1"&gt;according to a 40-page thread in Microsoft’s help forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7x2hp"&gt;The good news: Microsoft knows about the issue, and a fix is on the way. “We are aware some players may be experiencing disconnects with their new Xbox Wireless Controllers and our teams are actively working on a solution to be included in a future update,” a company spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SfQc1"&gt;Again, it’s not clear how widespread this issue truly is — though nearly 1,700 co-signers on a 40-page forum post is enough to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s ambitious Minecraft Earth game is closing down on June 30th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0kk4b4"&gt;Microsoft is closing down its &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; mobile game in June, due to the ongoing pandemic. The ambitious game had aimed to rival &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; and cover the world in virtual blocks for players to meet and play together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ul3t7p"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; was designed around free movement and collaborative play – two things that have become near impossible in the current global situation,” &lt;a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-earth-coming-end"&gt;says the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; team&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, we have made the difficult decision to re-allocate our resources to other areas that provide value to the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; community and to end support for &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; in June 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lmb5Y1"&gt;The final build of the game is being released today, which reduces the amount of time it takes to craft in the game and the cost of certain materials....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook ads made News Feeds in Georgia more partisan and less informative</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bCOkVm"&gt;When Facebook lifted its ban on political ads in Georgia, local News Feeds became dramatically more partisan and less informative, according to research published &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/05/in-georgia-facebooks-changes-brought-back-a-partisan-news-feed"&gt;on Tuesday by &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkiTRW"&gt;Facebook banned US political advertising in the wake of the November 3rd presidential election as part of its broader effort to fight election misinformation. However, the platform partially lifted the ban on December 16th, allowing ads specific to the Georgia runoff on January 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp27TJ"&gt;To study the effect of those ads,&lt;em&gt; The Markup&lt;/em&gt; paid 58 Facebook users in Georgia to provide data on the content that appeared in their News Feeds in the weeks leading up to the runoff election. The resulting data (which is &lt;a href="https://github.com/the-markup/citizen-browser-georgia"&gt;available on Github&lt;/a&gt;) showed a huge change in users’...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA tells US health providers not to modify COVID-19 vaccine dose schedule</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKkE7l"&gt;Health care providers in the United States should stick to the two-dose schedule for both authorized COVID-19 vaccines, the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement this week. Some experts have suggested that delaying the second dose could stretch limited quantities of the vaccines further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2T3ROr"&gt;Any dose adjustments&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;could be evaluated in clinical trials, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn and Peter Marks, the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-statement-following-authorized-dosing-schedules-covid-19-vaccines"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “However, at this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9mG01"&gt;Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine takes two doses given 28 days apart, and the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hades, one of 2020’s best Switch games, is $20 at Best Buy</title>

&lt;p id="MzyAJl"&gt;Released last September, &lt;em&gt;Hades &lt;/em&gt;is a roguelike hack-and-slash action RPG released by Supergiant Games. Players control Zagreus, the son of Hades, who is trying to fight his way out of the Underworld. &lt;/p&gt;

Several of our staff also really enjoyed the game, including news editor Chaim Gartenberg, who said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"&gt;it was his favorite game of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the Google union could boost labor organizing in Silicon Valley</title>

  &lt;p id="cfd8yt"&gt;Just over a year ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21021005/google-youtube-moderators-ptsd-accenture-violent-disturbing-content-interviews-video"&gt;I spent some time in Austin meeting with Google contractors&lt;/a&gt;. They had been hired through Accenture to moderate some of the most disturbing content on YouTube: videos that contain violent extremism, including murders and acts of terrorism. Several told me they had either been diagnosed with or were suffering from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. The people I talked with made about $37,000 a year, and several had immigrated to the United States from the Middle East. Many found their working conditions intolerable, but they feared speaking out publicly for fear they would be fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgPvfc"&gt;They were, in short, the sort of people who benefit from membership in a union. But with a handful of &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-kickstarter-employees-formed-union/"&gt;exceptions&lt;/a&gt;, the labor...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon is taking over as CEO</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRBrDk"&gt;Qualcomm is getting a new CEO: Cristiano Amon, who already serves as president for the company, will replace Steve Mollenkopf, who took over as CEO in 2014. Amon has already served as the public face of the company for some time, presiding over introductions of new products like the Snapdragon 888, making him an obvious choice to succeed Mollenkopf at the helm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23LY1E"&gt;Mollenkopf’s tenure as CEO saw Qualcomm face numerous challenges: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363629/qualcomm-win-appeal-antitrust-ftc-lawsuit-frand-patents-chips"&gt;antitrust accusations&lt;/a&gt;, allegations of anticompetitive behavior, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18410985/apple-qualcomm-settle-royalty-dispute-patent-licensing-terms-high-fees"&gt;massive fight with Apple&lt;/a&gt; that saw the two companies sever their relationship (before patching things up in a settlement). But he also oversaw Qualcomm’s growth into the juggernaut it is today, one that nearly completely dominates the industry for...&lt;/p&gt;
