    <title>Tencent is acquiring Back 4 Blood developer Turtle Rock Studios</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tencent is acquiring Turtle Rock Studios.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Turtle Rock Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="96iHTI"&gt;Tencent is adding to its already large roster of video game studios by &lt;a href="https://turtlerockstudios.com/news/trsandtencent"&gt;acquiring Slamfire&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; developer Turtle Rock Studios. Turtle Rock will be “retaining its independent operations” in California and the current leadership team will still run the studio, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211217005008/en/"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxbR6D"&gt;Tencent is behind some of the biggest games on the planet. It owns the studio behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/17/10410952/riot-games-league-of-legends-acquired-tencent"&gt;the hugely popular MOBA &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; the developer of the mobile hits &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings, and Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;; and has a 40 percent stake &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/21/4131702/tencents-epic-games-stock-acquisition"&gt;in Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, the developer of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and Unreal Engine. And the company has made many significant investments just this year, including acquiring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583186/tencent-sumo-digital-buyout-announced-price-acquisition"&gt;British game studio Sumo&lt;/a&gt;, buying...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s large 70-inch MQ7 TV is $350 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vizio" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-IYsMPWKPYrAbzHF0d2EpOsQ22Q=/0x0:1217x811/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286581/vizio_voice.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZgvUID"&gt;The Christmas holiday is just one week away. I repeat: seven days from now is Christmas Eve. Let that sink in for a moment, but don’t panic just yet. There is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22833986/ups-usps-fedex-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target-shipping-deadlines-2021"&gt;still time to get gifts in time for the holidays&lt;/a&gt; before we reach cutoff times for shipments, though we’re getting a little tight on time. Just because you’re cutting it close doesn’t mean you have to overspend. Today, we have a bunch of great deals at a variety of price points — many of which can make exceptional gifts for a friend, family member, or yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JL2VfT"&gt;Starting off, Vizio’s midrange 70-inch MQ7 4K LED TV (M70Q7-J03) with voice controls and HDR is just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgd341IQaDG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$749.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a $350 discount on quite a large TV. You may ask, “How can I gift a 70-inch TV to just one...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clockwork Aquario brings a long-lost arcade game back to life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NHu4gwp39Xin4W0HHa-4TBoc2Ek=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286522/CWA_Screenshot_3.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bu4Viz"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Clockwork Aquario&lt;/em&gt; had come out in the early ’90s, it would have cost me &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of quarters. It’s the kind of arcade game that lures you in: big sprites, bright colors, inventive worlds, a bubbly soundtrack. You see it, and you want to play it. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to experience it in an arcade because it was never actually released. But a few decades later, it’s finally available in a new format — you can now play it on both the PS4 and Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IavSuV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clockwork Aquario&lt;/em&gt; was initially a victim of the game industry’s shift to 3D games. Development started in 1992 at Westone Bit Entertainment, a now-defunct studio best-known for the &lt;em&gt;Wonder Boy&lt;/em&gt; series. The game was completed after two years, but by that time, arcades had...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>H&amp;R Block is suing Block, formerly Square, over its new name</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="ejWGQN"&gt;Tax preparation service H&amp;amp;R Block &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrblock.com%2Ftax-center%2Fnewsroom%2Faround-block%2Fabout-us%2Ftrademark-infringement-lawsuit%2F%3Fcid%3Dsf252192484%26amp%3Bsf252192484%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F17%2F22841182%2Fsquare-block-hr-block-trademark-lawsuit-jack-dorsey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Block, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.) for trademark infringement on Thursday, CNBC &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/16/hr-block-sues-over-squares-new-name-block.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIYMvH"&gt;“Today’s filing is an important effort to prevent consumer confusion and ensure a competitor cannot leverage the reputation and trust we built over more than six decades,”  said H&amp;amp;R Block president and CEO Jeff Jones in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1JB7q"&gt;H&amp;amp;R Block claims that Square’s new name competes directly with Block in several areas of financial services, including a recently purchased tax service named &lt;a href="https://cash.app/taxes"&gt;Cash App Taxes&lt;/a&gt; — previously Credit Karma Tax — a $0 tax filing service similar to H&amp;amp;R Block. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2FfMBt"&gt;

  &lt;p id="RaRYTM"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories. On the final Vergecast of 2021, Nilay and Dieter invite &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Alex Cranz and senior space reporter Loren Grush to the show to cover the last bits of news before the holiday break. &lt;/p&gt;

Loren explains what the JWST will be used for, how the telescope will launch, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663027/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date"&gt;the complications with its launch&lt;/a&gt; along the way. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly under investigation for how it treats Black female workers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oOWJzZ"&gt;The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) is looking into how Google treats its Black female employees, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/exclusive-california-probes-googles-treatment-black-female-workers-2021-12-17/"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report says that the regulator has been asking employees questions about harassment and discrimination, after receiving formal complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJ3Fub"&gt;The report doesn’t make any mention of the DFEH bringing charges against Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;as it did with Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; and says that the interviews being conducted don’t necessarily mean that Google could face charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JnxmW2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Black women made up 1.8 percent of Google’s workforce in 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uw0bFE"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560628/google-diversity-report-departures-black-women"&gt;a diversity report Google released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, Black women make up around 1.8 percent of its workforce and departed the company at a higher than...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horseshoe crabs are in danger because everyone wants their blood </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dis1QT_SK7-LoMVSA34PdjTIHeQ=/81x0:1191x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286162/Horseshoe_Crabs_Fadek_059_e1554413653315.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Horseshoe crabs are bled at the Charles River Laboratory in South Carolina. | Timothy Fadek&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfLf3M"&gt;Conservationists fear that horseshoe crabs, a 450-million-year-old living fossil, will be pushed to the brink of extinction because of the value of their blood to the pharmaceutical industry. Horseshoe crab blood provides a natural source of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/limulus-lysate-test"&gt;limulus amebocyte lysate&lt;/a&gt; (LAL) which is used to test vaccines, drugs, and medical devices to ensure that they aren’t contaminated with dangerous bacterial toxins called endotoxins. With hundreds of thousands of horseshoe crabs captured and bled of their milky-blue blood each year, conservation groups are now stepping up their advocacy efforts and taking legal action to help save horseshoe crabs and the other species that rely on them.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K16qe2"&gt;Fortunately, there’s already an alternative to horseshoe crab...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The only Christmas tradition I care about is Sweden’s arson goat </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PWSDvt"&gt;If you’ve never heard of the Gävle Goat before, there are just two critical pieces of information you need to know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeSqe1"&gt;First: the Gävle Goat is a giant straw statue of a goat erected every Christmas in the Swedish town of Gävle. It’s essentially a massive Yule Goat, a traditional symbol of the Yuletide season in areas of Scandinavia and Northern Europe, and was first installed in the town in 1966. The most recent incarnation stands 42 feet high and weighs 3.6 tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdhcWE"&gt;Second: every year, someone tries to set the goat on fire. And most years, they succeed — including this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBoFCP"&gt;As the BBC reported &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59696442"&gt;this morning&lt;/a&gt;: “A giant straw goat that has become an annual highlight in the Swedish city of Gavle has been burned by an arsonist. A man in his 40s...&lt;/p&gt;
