  &lt;p id="Qk8zKK"&gt;When Sina Bahram shifted into weightlessness for the first time on Sunday, he could feel the air brushing past his skin as his body began to float into the air. As someone who’d longed to be an astronaut since he was four years old, he’d been waiting many years to have this exact feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbtoV5"&gt;“I knew it would be a joyous experience just because I looked forward to it for many decades of my life, but the visceral nature of that joy wasn’t brought home until you actually experience it,” &lt;a href="https://www.sinabahram.com/"&gt;Bahram&lt;/a&gt;, a computer scientist who runs Prime Access Consulting, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It is truly indescribable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQEgEc"&gt;Bahram got to perceive free fall for the first time onboard a specially outfitted plane operated by the Zero-G Corporation, a company that provides...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scientists took the first steps toward pig-to-human kidney transplants </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1SO01c"&gt;For the first time, surgeons successfully attached a kidney from a genetically modified pig to a human patient — a major scientific breakthrough, and one that could open up a new way to provide organs to sick people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBQ2Lp"&gt;Scientists got the kidney from a pig genetically engineered so that it wouldn’t produce a sugar called alpha-gal, which the human immune system attacks and would trigger the body to reject the organ. Surgeons at NYU attached the organ to a brain-dead patient on a ventilator whose family agreed to the experimental procedure. It was connected outside of her body to blood vessels on her leg, and observed over a period of 54 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDxrVJ"&gt;The recipient’s body didn’t immediately reject the kidney, and the kidney functioned normally...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook fined $70 million for withholding information about Giphy acquisition</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="taAaCI"&gt;A UK watchdog has fined Facebook £50 million ($70 million USD) for purposely concealing information about its Giphy acquisition (via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/facebook-fined-70m-for-flouting-giphy-order-made-by-uk-watchdog/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21259965/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-buy-instagram-integration-cost"&gt;Facebook began its $400 million acquisition of Giphy&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21260653/facebook-giphy-acquisition-merger-elizabeth-warren-amy-klobuchar-josh-hawley-senate-antitrust"&gt;even members of Congress thought it was a bad idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k40p4y"&gt;The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621957/facebook-giphy-deal-blocked-uk-regulator"&gt;dealings with the massive GIF-making hub were called out by UK regulators&lt;/a&gt; in August, leading the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to launch an antitrust probe. As part of the investigation, the CMA issued an initial enforcement order (IEO) that prohibits any further integration between Facebook and Giphy, which is supposed to allow the companies to continue competing as if there was no acquisition at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI is making a cinema camera with a built-in gimbal and LIDAR focusing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjlRVLVKDZL-WPqHSTHPwdC_1Iw=/0x65:2048x1430/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020639/Ronin_4D___Leica_M_mount__diagonal_.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9O4ga6"&gt;Drone-maker DJI &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fronin-4d&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F20%2F22735184%2Fdji-ronin-4d-cinema-camera-gimbal-8k-zenmuse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced a cinema camera&lt;/a&gt; that comes with a built-in gimbal, can shoot at up to 8K resolution, and uses a LIDAR rangefinder that promises a “sharper, faster, and more reliable focusing experience,” even in low light. It’s called the Ronin 4D, and while it’s aimed squarely at professionals, it’s loaded with interesting features and shows that DJI is continuing to develop its camera tech outside of drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmlC1Z"&gt;The Ronin 4D’s camera is called the Zenmuse X9, and it’s full-frame, has interchangeable lens mounts for DJI’s DL and Leica’s M systems, and includes nine (nine!) built-in ND filters for controlling your exposure in the sun. The 6K model can do 6K at 60fps and 4K120, and the 8K model can do 75fps at its max...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The AI oracle of Delphi uses the wisdom of Reddit to offer dubious moral advice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tljvXL8Ivv1IL0i7FJvfSt4lJrA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020568/acastro_181017_1777_brain_ai_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ke7EAC"&gt;Got a moral quandary you don’t know how to solve? Fancy making it worse? Why not turn to the wisdom of artificial intelligence, aka &lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/"&gt;Ask Delphi&lt;/a&gt;: an intriguing research project from the Allen Institute for AI that offers answers to ethical dilemmas while demonstrating in wonderfully clear terms why we shouldn’t trust software with questions of morality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i60ZmD"&gt;Ask Delphi was launched on October 14th, along with a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07574.pdf"&gt;research paper&lt;/a&gt; describing how it was made. From a user’s point of view, though, the system is beguilingly simple to use. Just &lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/"&gt;head to the website&lt;/a&gt;, outline pretty much any situation you can think of, and Delphi will come up with a moral judgement. “It’s bad,” or “it’s acceptable,” or “it’s good,” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="52FKng"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Each answer from the AI oracle...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Samsung is adding new watchfaces to the Galaxy Watch 4</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic has a rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYWLjXj7NPnrm4R7ygh4bfYfVeQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020329/dbohn_210816_4717_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ytPdts"&gt;Samsung is bringing some new features to its Galaxy Watch 4 smartwatches in a new update, the company announced Wednesday. Perhaps the most significant change is four new watchfaces, which include a basic dashboard and a weather-focused one. You can see them in the GIF below from Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="55t0o6"&gt;New faces aren’t the only updates headed to the new watches; you’ll also be able to use a “knock-knock” motion in the air to launch a preset app or feature. Fall detection has also been improved so that if you’re standing still and you fall, the watch will still detect it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IK0CnS"&gt;The update adding the new features will roll out starting Wednesday for Bluetooth versions of the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, while the LTE versions...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet’s Wing is bringing its drone delivery service to Dallas-Fort Worth</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jiksKY"&gt;Drones will soon be buzzing overhead in Dallas-Fort Worth, bearing small containers filled with Tylenol and Band-Aids. Wing, a subsidiary of Google parent company Alphabet, is bringing its drone delivery service to the Texas city, its first densely populated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHUDSz"&gt;Wing is starting small, making deliveries from just one Walgreens to the city of Frisco and town of Little Elm. The company says it will be utilizing its new operational model, in which small shipping containers parked next to the store act as tiny hangers from which Wing’s drones will be deployed. Walgreens employees, rather than Wing technicians, will be trained in how to attach the packages to the company’s drones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HSQlTy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Drone deliveries were supposed to revolutionize the...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Samsung will now let you design your own Galaxy Z Flip 3</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="leuHcQ"&gt;Samsung released the Galaxy Z Flip 3 in August, but if none of the colorways were exactly what you wanted, the company will let you make your own design with the new Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition. The new phone was announced at the company’s Unpacked Part 2 event on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mkvx8"&gt;You won’t be able to customize the Bespoke Edition with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; color you want, but Samsung is offering a lot of options. You’ll be able to choose a black or silver phone frame and front and back colors (aka the top and bottom, if the phone is open) of blue, yellow, pink, white, or black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wNONt"&gt;If you get tired of your color combination, you’ll be able to make a slight change down the line by swapping out the colors on the back glass panel of the phone for a fee with the Bespoke...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create virtual desktops with Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UCnhDd"&gt;Virtual desktops aren’t new to Windows. In Windows 10, it was a simple matter to create a separate desktop so that, for example, you could have one desktop for one project and a second for another, or one for your work and a second for your personal apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmrsgO"&gt;However, in Windows 11, there has been an upgrade. Now, you can also have a different wallpaper for each desktop, making it easier to distinguish one from another (and offering you a different mood, depending on what you’re using it for). And there are a number of other features that make the use of virtual desktops easy and efficient. Note that some of these were actually introduced in Windows 10, but together with the new features of Windows 11, they make a handy toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="v09Ap2"&gt;Create a...&lt;/h2&gt;
