    <title>President of Elon Musk’s Neuralink venture tweets that he’s left the company</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pJpqJE"&gt;Neuralink President Max Hodak tweeted Saturday that he has left the company he co-founded with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk xxx. Hodak didn’t elaborate on why he left the company or elaborate on the circumstance for his departure. “I am no longer at Neuralink (as of a few weeks ago),” he tweeted. “I learned a ton there and remain a huge cheerleader for the company! Onward to new things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nCy8cC"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;✨Some personal news:✨ I am no longer at Neuralink (as of a few weeks ago). I learned a ton there and remain a huge cheerleader for the company! Onward to new things.&lt;/p&gt;— Max Hodak (@max_hodak) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/max_hodak/status/1388620553569726467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXJ6Lk"&gt;Neuralink is focused on developing brain-machine interfaces. Last month, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374749/elon-musk-neuralink-monkey-pong-brain-interface"&gt;posted a video to YouTube&lt;/a&gt; that appeared to show a monkey with...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Are we seeing the return of the closed-door office? I hope not.</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A 1960s-style open office, with rows of desks and people working." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/md2CsyEq1lunbNeKSc3Lj7D9FLc=/184x0:817x422/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69222357/Apartment_Office_United_Artists.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q5XPYK"&gt;So it seems that Google, the exemplar of the open-office concept, is trying now to figure out how to keep its design ideals intact while offering its employees at least some feeling of safety in these 6-foot-apart times. Apparently, these measures may include a number of interesting concepts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/30/22411593/google-post-pandemic-office-plans-inflatable-robot-walls"&gt;such as inflatable walls&lt;/a&gt;. (A GIF of one of those walls slowly unfolding nearly had me doing a spit-take with my morning coffee.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9sHDaq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s answer to the problems of open plan offices? Inflatable walls","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/30/22411593/google-post-pandemic-office-plans-inflatable-robot-walls"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3UehDn"&gt;These rather complex measures may have some people wondering whether we should abandon the entire open-office concept and go back to a more old-fashioned — but in these pandemic days, safer — plan of separate offices and high-walled cubicles. To tell you the truth, it doesn’t sound like a bad idea. But.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5kNAq"&gt;First, let me...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX Crew Dragon Resilience safely returns four astronauts to Earth</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YetoPH"&gt;Four astronauts returned from the International Space Station early Sunday morning aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico nearly six months after arriving at the orbital laboratory in November last year as the first operational, long-duration crew under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqsV5u"&gt;NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover, and Shannon Walker, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Soichi Noguchi boarded Crew Dragon and undocked from the space station at 8:35PM ET Saturday to begin their roughly six-hour trek home. The crew splashed down off the coast of Panama City, Florida at 2:56am ET on Sunday, NASA said in a &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/crew-1-astronauts-safely-splash-down-after-space-station-mission"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSqwGB"&gt;The crew’s return was initially set for Wednesday, April 28th,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft wants to reduce its Xbox store cut and shake up console gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l8MpbBOLoTfsXQZzhzATOhiw224=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69222090/acastro_210429_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yeZTYx"&gt;Microsoft has been planning to cut its Xbox store cut to just 12 percent, according to confidential documents filed in the Epic Games vs. Apple case. The software maker details its store fees and changes in a &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.551.7.pdf"&gt;document from January&lt;/a&gt;, where it also lists the 12 percent cut to PC games it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;announced this week&lt;/a&gt;. While most of the important parts of the document are redacted, one page reveals Microsoft also wants to reduce its 30 percent store cut on the Xbox console side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxjUaN"&gt;A table reveals “all games will move to 88 / 12 in CY21,” which means Microsoft had been planning a significant cut to Xbox transactions for some point in the 2021 calendar year. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;Microsoft has announced its PC cut&lt;/a&gt;, which is also listed in the same table, the company has...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As Epic v. Apple approaches the courtroom, Valve is getting sued over Steam too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Steam Box Header alt 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b0N3Bi3b0ocvgPZlxBIRwhd7o98=/8x0:1013x670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69220436/steam_box_header_alt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrKVAp"&gt;Just two days before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Apple gets dragged into a California court&lt;/a&gt; to justify its 30 percent App Store fee — and two days after Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;axed its 30 percent cut on PC&lt;/a&gt; — we’re learning that gaming giant Valve is now facing down lawsuits against its own 30 percent cut and alleged anticompetitive practices with its PC gaming platform Steam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PA9iFx"&gt;“Valve abuses its market power to ensure game publishers have no choice but to sell most of their games through the Steam Store, where they are subject to Valve’s 30% toll,” argues indie game developer and &lt;a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33272/GDC_2011_Humble_Indie_Bundle_Creators_Talk_Inspiration_Execution.php"&gt;Humble Bundle creator&lt;/a&gt; Wolfire Games, in a lawsuit filed Tuesday (via &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/humble-bundle-creator-brings-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-over-steam/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="okv3S3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clear parallels to Epic v. Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t5SABB"&gt;Much like Epic v. Apple, the new suit argues that a platform owner is using an...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Newsmax apologizes to employee of Dominion Voting Systems over false election accusations</title>

  &lt;p id="fnBX7N"&gt;Conservative news channel Newsmax has posted an apology to an employee of Dominion Voting Systems, after it reported without evidence that he was involved in manipulating results of the 2020 US presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lcIks"&gt;“On behalf of Newsmax, we would like to apologize for any harm that our reporting of the allegations against Dr. Coomer may have caused to Dr. Coomer and his family,” &lt;a href="https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/eric-coomer-dominion-voting-systems/2021/04/30/id/1019671/"&gt;a statement posted to Newsmax’s website states&lt;/a&gt;. According to the statement, there was no substance to the allegations made about Eric Coomer, Dominion’s director of product strategy and security:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bcWHOe"&gt;“Newsmax would like to clarify its coverage of Dr. Coomer and note that while Newsmax initially covered claims by President Trump’s lawyers, supporters and others...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Epic-backed expert says Apple’s app store profit is as high as 78 percent</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9a9cP"&gt;An expert witness for Epic Games testified that Apple’s App Store had operating margins above 70 percent in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22484513/ned_barnes_testimony.pdf"&gt;new court documents show.&lt;/a&gt;  Ned Barnes testified that information from Apple’s Corporate Financial Planning and Analysis group show the App Store had a 77.8 percent operating margin in 2019, and 74.9 percent in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rPK8V"&gt;The figures are close to Barnes’ calculations of the App Store’s profits, he testified, and “also refute criticisms of my report proffered by certain Apple expert witnesses that it is not possible to calculate reliably or usefully the operating margins of the App Store.” Barnes also testified that Apple has been tracking its App Store profits for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California appeals court finds Amazon responsible for third party sellers’ products</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9PXCby"&gt;An appeals court in California has ruled that Amazon can be held liable for products sold through its marketplace by a third-party seller, the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-04-29/column-amazon-product-safety-ruling"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367966/amazon-liable-defective-products-california-marketplace-third-party"&gt;second major case in California&lt;/a&gt; where an appeals court has rejected Amazon’s long-held position that it is merely an intermediary between buyers and its third-party sellers. Amazon collectively refers to these sellers as its “Amazon Marketplace” even though it’s not a separate or distinct part of Amazon’s website. Third-party sellers’ products typically appear in Amazon listings, with a small line of text to indicate that Amazon itself is not the actual seller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1iZvC"&gt;At issue was the case of a woman who suffered burn injuries after a hoverboard she purchased on...&lt;/p&gt;
