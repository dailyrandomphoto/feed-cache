  &lt;p id="1SWZhK"&gt;Console restocks are getting more and more frequent these days — particularly as the Black Friday season heats up and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals continue to roll out&lt;/a&gt; — but retailers have been quick to cull the herd of potential customers by putting some stock behind paid subscription services. Walmart has a next-gen console restock happening today at 3PM ET / 12PM PT, though, it’s exclusive to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart Plus paid subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p id="DrIyot"&gt;The US government &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/56-million-seized-cryptocurrency-being-sold-first-step-compensate-victims-bitconnect-fraud"&gt;has seized $56 million worth of cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; from an admitted participant in the BitConnect scam and intends to sell the coins and use the proceeds to reimburse victims. The Department of Justice says that it’s the largest recovery of cryptocurrency to date — and that it was willingly given up by Los Angeles resident Glenn Arcaro, who has called himself BitConnect’s “number one promoter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8271A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-172"&gt;According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&lt;/a&gt;, BitConnect convinced people to invest a total of $2 billion by telling them that it had a bot capable of generating incredibly high rates of return from crypto trading. In other words, BitConnect sold itself as a way for people to easily invest in cryptocurrency and to make a...&lt;/p&gt;

The information that has come to light about his behaviors and practices in the running of our companies runs counter to the culture and integrity we require of our leadership—and directly conflicts with the initiatives started by our peers. We ask that Bobby Kotick remove himself as CEO of Activision Blizzard, and that shareholders be allowed to select the new CEO without the input of Bobby, who we are aware owns a substantial portion of the voting rights of the shareholders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p id="cmtF4x"&gt;Apple employees will return to offices starting February 1st as part of a hybrid work pilot and will be able to work remotely for four weeks a year. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/apple-sets-feb-1-for-return-to-office"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, employees learned of the news Thursday via an internal memo from CEO Tim Cook. The company had previously offered two weeks of remote work per year but added two more weeks to give “more opportunity to travel, be closer to your loved ones, or simply shake up your routines,” Cook’s memo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPbyzN"&gt;The pilot will start workers at one or two days in the office, then in March, workers will come to the office to work on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. They’ll be able to work from home on Wednesdays and Fridays. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-pushes-back-return-office-plan-february-rcna6026"&gt;Some employees may be asked&lt;/a&gt; to come into the office four...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly wants to launch a self-driving EV in 2025 with a custom chip</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R7XrPj"&gt;Apple has completed “much of the core work” on a new processor meant to power its secretive autonomous electric car project known as Titan, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt;. The milestone comes as Apple is reportedly now accelerating its timeline for the autonomous car it’s developing, with a new target of launching it in just four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ynw50V"&gt;Apple’s own silicon team designed the chip, which Gurman says is the “most advanced component” that’s been developed for the project so far. The company is apparently getting ready to put the chip through its real-world paces in its fleet of test vehicles in California and hopes to make a vehicle with “stronger safeguards than what’s available from Tesla and Waymo,” according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fz0Qx5"&gt;The goal...&lt;/p&gt;

Text message providers have to support the three-digit code by July 16th, 2022, which is when the code will go into effect. On that same date, people will also be able to dial 988 to access Lifeline following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328600/national-suicide-prevention-lifeline-number-dial-988-fcc"&gt;a 2020 FCC ruling&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Belkin’s new $150 3-in-1 charger is the first to get Apple Watch Series 7 fast charging</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TxkRI0"&gt;Belkin has a pair of new wireless Apple Watch chargers it’s announcing today, which are notably the first third-party chargers to support the newly added fast charging on the Apple Watch Series 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iw8S32"&gt;The larger of the two is the $149.95 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2Fp-wiz016%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22785707%2Fbelkin-apple-watch-series-7-fast-charging-magsafe-charger-boost-charge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, which follows in the footsteps of last year’s 3-in-1 Belkin charger. In addition to adding Series 7 fast charging, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"&gt;Belkin has ditched the odd sculptural design&lt;/a&gt; on the previous model in favor of a more normal-looking flat rectangular pad that will probably fit better on a nightstand. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qvXJ9J"&gt;In the past several days, a number of headers, profile pictures, and tweets have disappeared across the wide network of BTS fan Twitter accounts. The culprit, the account owners say, is a recent barrage of fake DMCA takedown notices. Outcry from fans resulted in #TwitterMaliciousDMCA trending worldwide on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkQIWA"&gt;The owner of a fan account with over 233,000 followers, which posts videos, photos, and memes related to the South Korean band, claims that their original header and profile picture, as well as multiple tweets including their own screenshots and memes, have been taken down by the trolls over the past few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l70oPn"&gt;Per the owner’s screenshots, the attackers appear to have reposted the account’s header on a spoof website in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s better Battle Pass progression is now live</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A50wvRCkP5eE5HZCF0drb4EN1yk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158973/HaloInfinite_RXJtJxSVSl.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="urkns2"&gt;If you’re still stuck on level 1 of the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass, fear not, as 343 Industries’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1461124062021763072"&gt;promised changes to progression&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1461369370303598598"&gt;now live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qTANV"&gt;The existing &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass makes it difficult to level up, as you’re limited to completing daily or weekly challenges instead of earning XP for every game you play. While that isn’t changing yet, 343 Industries has added “Play 1 game” challenges, which will “help make sure you consistently progress through the Battle Pass by playing matches the way you want,” according to &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; community manager John Junyszek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3HF7SN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To address the feedback on Battle Pass progression we will be making targeted tunings to our model later this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start, we'll be adding "Play 1 Game" challenges to help...&lt;/p&gt;
