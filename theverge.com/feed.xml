  &lt;p id="9yLHtZ"&gt;Whether you’re shopping for a student, an older relative, or anyone in between, a laptop can make a great gift. And the internet’s largest retailers are offering all kinds of laptops at discounted prices for Cyber Monday, whether you’re looking for a convertible, a Chromebook, a gaming rig, or anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8Tv9N"&gt;Note that for some models, only certain configurations may be on sale. Make sure to double-check the specs of the item you’re buying to make sure they’ll suit your workload (and that you’re actually getting the discount) before you check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vRrnV"&gt;To learn more about some of these laptops, and others that may see discounts later this week, check out our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops of 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Cyber Monday deals on Apple devices</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5VU3Q"&gt;It’s rare that Apple slashes the prices on its own products. Fortunately, other retailers are putting a lot of Apple products on sale for Cyber Monday. A bunch of retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Walmart, and Woot are slashing the prices on everything from wearables to its wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIuihu"&gt;Additionally, the online Apple store will have a special promotion on Friday, November 27th, and running until Monday, November 30th. The promotion will allow &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you to get up to $150 in an Apple gift card&lt;/a&gt; if you purchase an eligible product during the four-day event as listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VKYPYw"&gt;Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy an &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-3#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wOJmIA"&gt;Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy AirPods (&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMRXJ2%2Fairpods-with-wireless-charging-case#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wireless&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMV7N2%2Fairpods-with-charging-case#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wired case&lt;/a&gt;) or a pair of &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMWP22AM%2FA%2Fairpods-pro#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;....&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new MacBook Air and Pro with M1 are at their lowest prices yet for Cyber Monday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LFzcaSZTwAw0H5MvCTvRjRWzmlM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67989253/akramer_201113_4290_0020.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zn4KWt"&gt;Apple’s new computers, based on the company’s own custom M1 chip, have been getting sterling reviews due to their great performance and better life. (Well, &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; sterling reviews; &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Nilay Patel is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;not a fan of the Touch Bar&lt;/a&gt; that still adorns the MacBook Pro. But aside from that...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WDHWO"&gt;Normally, brand-new Apple computers would not be on sale, even during Cyber Monday. But the M1-powered MacBook Pro 13 has already had a $50-off sale at Amazon, and now B&amp;amp;H is discounting the MacBook Pro with M1 chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ln3PC2"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is taking $100 off the M1-equipped MacBook Air with the base configuration, which includes 256GB of SSD storage. It’s the lowest price we’ve seen the new M1-powered Air sell for yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bZTN80"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Today is the last day of the record-smashing 2020 Atlantic hurricane season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-MEXICO-TROPICAL STORM-CRISTOBAL" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pf3lXrS249TrPoIXz83qRs8qSqk=/0x41:6220x4188/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68000309/1217487804.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A woman from the Mayan community of Tecoh wades through the water in a flood caused by Tropical Storm Cristobal in the town of Tecoh near Merida in Yucatan State, Mexico, on June 3rd, 2020.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Luis Perez / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SAW47h"&gt;The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season officially ends today, wrapping up a truly exhausting season that smashed records and dealt repeated blows to vulnerable coastal communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUbuGN"&gt;“It’s just been crazy,” says Allison Wing an assistant professor of meteorology at Florida State University. “For the forecasters and scientists involved I think everyone is really just a bit tired at this point and kind of ready for it to be over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="feXitM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This was the most active Atlantic hurricane season ever documented&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5qsl70"&gt;This was the most active Atlantic hurricane season ever documented. Thirteen storms strengthened into hurricanes, the &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/record-breaking-atlantic-hurricane-season-draws-to-end"&gt;second highest number&lt;/a&gt; in recorded history. Thirty storms grew strong enough to earn a name, beating 2005’s record of 28 storms. The...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Cyber Monday GameStop deals include steep discounts on several PS4, Switch, and Xbox One games</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gyNgwb"&gt;If you are a gamer looking to expand your gaming library, this time of year is an ideal time to get a ton of games for less. Like many other retailers, GameStop is slashing the prices on many products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1BRZ2"&gt;While the next-gen consoles, the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S are still being restocked at various retailers, the restocks are irregular and the supply is limited. If you are not trying to buy a next-gen console during Black Friday or Cyber Monday, you can save a ton of cash on many games released for the PS4, Switch, and Xbox One, this includes some of the most popular games released this year, such as &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ghosts of Tsushima, The Last of Us Part II, Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rGB7RG"&gt;Let’s be honest: gaming is expensive, but the holiday season is a good time to take advantage of deals and sales and buy more than one game. Whether you are adding games to your personal library for your backlog, or you are planning to buy some games for a friend or family member, retailers like Amazon, GameStop, and Target have various discounts on titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0KAAJ"&gt;If you are planning to buy a PS5 or an Xbox Series X / S during this time, please keep in mind that both are in high demand, limited supply, and are receiving irregular restocks at retailers. But if you are looking for games on PS4, Xbox One, and Switch, there are many deals available right now. If you own a next-gen console, several of these games on PS4 and Xbox One are either...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai will step down on January 20th</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iVdXbj"&gt;FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has announced plans to depart the commission when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated on January 20th. Pai has served on the FCC since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdwPgp"&gt;“It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve at the Federal Communications Commission, including as Chairman of the FCC over the past four years,” Pai said in a statement. “To be the first Asian-American to chair the FCC has been a particular privilege. As I often say: only in America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EiFFND"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As I often say: only in America”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qrPVOY"&gt;Pai was appointed chairman in 2017 and served for the duration of the Trump administration, overseeing an unusually active period in federal telecom policy. He began his term with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16777626/ajit-pai-net-neutrality-speech"&gt;the controversial decision to roll back Title II classification&lt;/a&gt;, undoing the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moderna to ask FDA for COVID-19 vaccine authorization</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Moderna Therapeutics..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8eGtPYd0HQmA5n8p588TwOECci8=/311x0:3686x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68000035/1214038360.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Blake Nissen for The Boston Globe via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tOYR6s"&gt;Moderna plans to file for authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine today, after the final analysis of its clinical trial data confirmed that it is safe and 94 percent effective. It is the second company to submit COVID-19 vaccine data to the Food and Drug Administration, after Pfizer and BioNTech submitted their data earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6L6EaY"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-primary-efficacy-analysis-phase-3-cove-study"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, Moderna said that there were 196 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 reported in the 30,000-person trial. Of those cases, 185 developed in people who received a placebo, and 11 cases developed in people who took the vaccine.
