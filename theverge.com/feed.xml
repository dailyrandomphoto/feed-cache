    <title>Smartwatch-induced health anxiety led one woman to run 916 ECGs in a year</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uno6Cg"&gt;One year after getting diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, a heart condition that causes an irregular heartbeat, a 70-year-old woman was back for another diagnosis: new-onset health anxiety triggered by her smartwatch. Despite not having concerning symptoms, the patient became more and more preoccupied with and worried about notifications from her watch. Over the one-year period, she took 916 ECG recordings through her device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmMqlq"&gt;That patient isn’t an outlier, says Lindsey Rosman, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, who wrote about the case in a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8357265/pdf/nihms-1705938.pdf"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;. She was just one example of a pattern seen in cardiology clinics. “Patients with underlying...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steve Jobs email confirms Apple was working on an ‘iPhone nano’ </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zEvBRi"&gt;In 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/81768/more-detail-on-apples-iphone-nano-exclusive/"&gt;rumors swirled&lt;/a&gt; that Apple was working on a so-called “iPhone nano,” a new iPhone that would be smaller and cheaper than the top-of-the-line model at the time, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-06-22-iphone-4-review.html"&gt;the iPhone 4&lt;/a&gt;. While Apple never did release that rumored super-small phone, a Steve Jobs email we spotted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"&gt;while collecting the very best emails from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; confirms the company was indeed working on an iPhone nano at one point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Py0fBN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oZ53Yd"&gt;Unfortunately, Jobs’ October 2010 email, which is an agenda for a strategy meeting, doesn’t reveal much about the device. There’s a bullet for an “iPhone nano plan,” a sub-bullet for its “cost goal,” and another sub-bullet indicating that “Jony,” presumably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761736/jony-ive-apple-leave-iphone-chief-design-officer-lovefrom-company-quit"&gt;Apple’s former design chief Jony Ive&lt;/a&gt;, would “show model (and/or...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YF5wgo"&gt;In May, the world watched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;as Epic Games dragged Apple to court&lt;/a&gt;, challenging the most profitable company in the world in the name of app fairness (and securing more &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; profits for itself). We’re still waiting for a verdict in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, but we haven’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; been sitting around. We’ve also been digging through these companies’ dirty laundry, reading scores of internal emails and confidential presentations unearthed during the legal discovery process. It’s fascinating stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6E73m"&gt;In fact, we found dirt on a variety of other companies as well: Microsoft, Sony, Google, Nintendo, Valve, Netflix, Hulu, and many others were caught up in discovery, and many details of their businesses, strategies, and conversations with Apple and Epic are...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge staff talks about their favorite laptop bags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="man crossing street with messenger bag" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ArcCnWWzzS3AVfwXJU5TmbhNys0=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747141/missionworkshop2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Mission Workshop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t8JEd2"&gt;It’s surprisingly how attached you can get to a bag — especially the bag that you use to carry your laptop, your sweater, your lunch, your notebook, your exercise shoes, and all the other stuff you need. Whether you’re heading to the office, visiting a friend, hanging in a coffee shop, going on a hike, or just sitting outdoors to read or work, having a bag that can accommodate everything on your “gotta have this” list can help you avoid a lot of aggravation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NiKVEC"&gt;We asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to tell us about their go-to laptop bags. We got a variety of answers, including messenger bags, camera bags, backpacks, well-worn bags that have lasted for years, and leather bags with lots of style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rL7kof"&gt;So here are some stories about why we like our...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces new wired Xbox stereo headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HiJcuRZQO_lmP5JU5dZIDld1WvM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747091/E9J5XTTUcAIZ4nL.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6V96gj"&gt;Microsoft has unveiled a refreshed Xbox stereo headset, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fheadsets%2Fxbox-stereo-headset" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a $59.99 wired model&lt;/a&gt; that’s more affordable than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;its stellar $100 wireless headset&lt;/a&gt; that launched earlier in 2021. It’s launching on September 21st, and as is to be expected, it’s missing a few features. But much of its design is intact. You can twist the dial on the outside of the right ear cup to adjust the volume, and there’s a mute button on the back side of the flexible microphone — mirroring what you get with the wireless version. The stereo headset doesn’t appear to have the chat / game audio mixing dial on the left ear cup as the pricier model does, but that’s not a horrible loss given the price difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PknieG"&gt;This headset connects through your Xbox controller via its bold green...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon reportedly plans to open department stores, starting in California and Ohio</title>

  &lt;p id="APVQid"&gt;A year after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-and-giant-mall-operator-look-at-turning-sears-j-c-penney-stores-into-fulfillment-centers-11596992863"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported Amazon had an interest in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21361004/amazon-simon-mall-fulfillment-warehouse-retail-ecommerce"&gt;using empty mall spaces as fulfillment centers&lt;/a&gt;, the business paper is back with a rumor that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-retail-department-stores-11629330842"&gt;Amazon is planning to open department store-style locations&lt;/a&gt; of its own. The reported plan is for stores that are smaller than your average 100,000-square-foot Macy’s or JC Penney location, with a footprint that’s only about 30,000 square feet, which is closer to the size of Kohl’s stores that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513036/kohls-amazon-returns-all-stores"&gt;already handle Amazon returns&lt;/a&gt;. Without specific information on what they might sell, they could stock clothing, electronics, and household items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxfAVI"&gt;While private equity firms &lt;a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/01/private-equity-retail-fairway-why.html"&gt;did their part&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon is now in the odd position of replacing stores that it helped kill off. If the plans turn...&lt;/p&gt;

Walmart has it on sale today for $100 off, clocking in at $299 and matching the lowest price we’ve seen for one of the most powerful small-format tablets on the market. The 64GB Wi-Fi model is perfect for casual reading, consuming content, controlling smart home functions, or just browsing the web on the couch on a nice 7.9-inch screen. Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;expected to release a new model&lt;/a&gt; this fall, but here’s a prime opportunity to save on the current version right now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Corsair’s latest headset has improved comfort, but it backpedaled on sound</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Corsair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eYYQNi"&gt;Corsair impressed me last year with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525271/corsair-hs75-xb-wireless-review-pc-xbox-specs-features-price"&gt;$150 HS75 XB Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, an Xbox-exclusive wireless headset that looked and felt more like a high-end set of headphones than a gaming accessory. They also had great sound quality and an easy-to-learn button layout with the right amount of features. It wasn’t necessarily a flaw that they only worked with Xbox consoles, but no one likes to be excluded. The company has now released the HS80 RGB Wireless for the same $150 price &lt;em&gt;with &lt;/em&gt;PlayStation compatibility, but these aren’t quite the successor that I was expecting or hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQpi7W"&gt;This one works with the PS4, PS5, as well as PC with its USB-A wireless transmitter. Unlike most wireless headsets that use a dongle like this, I couldn’t get it to work with...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s first portable monitor looks like it was yanked off an XPS laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dell portable monitor" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KF5r3VRNpZrcB-3gaP3zD0LTgrk=/0x1:843x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746874/dellportablemonitor1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LvOX4H"&gt;Dell has announced a 14-inch portable USB-C monitor that’s priced at $349.99 and will be released globally on August 31st. It has a 1080p LED-backlit IPS panel (60Hz refresh rate, 6ms response time) and you can use it as a secondary display for your USB-C laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mM02qc"&gt;The monitor, which Dell refers to as the C1422H, has narrow bezels and a minimalist design that makes it look as if it came off an XPS laptop.

  &lt;p id="sB5Wie"&gt;Intel has spent much of 2021 announcing plans for its future: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;a new IDM 2.0 strategy&lt;/a&gt;, new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;naming schemes for its process nodes&lt;/a&gt;, and new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626912/intel-arc-gpu-brand-alchemist-codename-release-date"&gt;desktop GPUs&lt;/a&gt;. At Intel’s Architecture Day 2021, we finally got a preview of how some of those changes are coming together in new chips, starting with the upcoming Alder Lake lineup later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVi8wD"&gt;As the company has been teasing since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/13/21365544/intel-tiger-lake-11th-gen-xe-graphics-gpu-preview-first-look-architecture-day-2020"&gt;last year’s Architecture Day&lt;/a&gt;, Alder Lake will feature Intel’s latest hybrid architecture: instead of simply offering the next generation of powerful Intel CPU cores, it’ll offer a mix of both performance and efficiency x86 cores, both of which Intel previewed as part of its announcements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15o7Rb"&gt;Additionally, Alder Lake will be the first chip released on Intel’s newly renamed...&lt;/p&gt;
