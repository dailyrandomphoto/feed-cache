    <title>Roblox has been down for days and it’s not because of Chipotle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="akdtjY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has been down for more than two days, with the game and its related website offline for millions of players. The hugely popular game-creating platform first started having issues at around 7PM ET on October 28th. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; initially said it was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454105518197280770"&gt;working hard to get things back to normal&lt;/a&gt;,” and that it had identified “the root cause as [an] internal system issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HMNFn"&gt;On Sunday, the company said in a tweet that it had identified the root cause of the issue and a solution, but didn’t elaborate on what they were, and didn’t provide an estimate for when the site would be functional again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2NWK95"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have identified root cause and solution. We are working on getting things back online and we will keep you updated throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;— Roblox...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Google Home app gets new Photo Frame settings and possible Weather Frog display option</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdPIIq"&gt;Google Home, the companion app for Google’s smart home products, is changing the way users interact with photos on the app and on Nest Hub devices. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/31/google-home-photo-frame/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first noticed the changes, which include a revamped Photo Frame settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ht3VAI"&gt;Now, when you use Google Home to change the displayed album while your Nest Hub is idle, you’ll see a carousel-style UI that gives you the option to choose from curated groups of photos, categorized as “Select family &amp;amp; friends,” “Recent highlights,” and “Favorites,” &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports. Scroll past that, and you’ll be able to see all the albums that you’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlov80"&gt;A preview window appears at the bottom of the page, and you can swipe through the preview carousel to see how your pictures will look when...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about how online orders are burning out Chipotle workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="chipotle essays" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pNjEfH-yygCiFVw-5rG6trFyIXk=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70070687/Bags_All.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;To go bags, to go bags everywhere.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoIGEk"&gt;Chipotle is a pioneer of the fast assembly-line restaurant format, where you get in line and guide a human worker through the process to build your meal while you watch. It’s a foolproof system, or so I thought before I &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-like-being-ripped-into-two-chipotle-workers-overwhelmed-by-online-orders-and-furious-customers-11635422149"&gt;checked out this investigative story by &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; revealing how Chipotle is handling the growth of online orders in a pandemic world. Once I read the accounts of various Chipotle employees interviewed in the MarketWatch article, I was stunned by what they really go through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mL8JV"&gt;One employee detailed the struggle with the onslaught of online orders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8HbvAN"&gt;“People would just stare at us, angry,” he said. “Orders were coming in faster than they could be made. We would frequently see orders of 75, 80, 90 items within a 15-minute...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly discontinues the 21.5-inch Intel-powered iMac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple iMac Hardware Shoot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mGhr4ZKcZLQ1TaMzQ6tvZW3Xtp4=/0x3:7345x4900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70070602/1065384720.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Olly Curtis/MacFormat Magazine/Future via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EEA47d"&gt;Apple has apparently pulled its 21.5-inch Intel-based iMac from shelves (via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/30/apple-discontinues-intel-based-21-5-inch-imac/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Its discontinuation doesn’t come as much of a surprise, now that Apple is transitioning from using Intel processors to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;in-house M1 chip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aha88K"&gt;The 21.5-inch iMac was still available after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max"&gt;Apple’s October 18th Unleashed event&lt;/a&gt; — it didn’t appear to go missing until sometime this week, according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;. The $1,099 21.5-inch iMac, which came with a 2.3GHz dual-core 7th-Gen Intel Core i5 and an Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, is no longer found on the list of available iMacs on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac-imac"&gt;Apple’s online store&lt;/a&gt;. A “Buy” button also doesn’t appear for the 21.5-inch iMac on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/"&gt;Apple’s product comparison&lt;/a&gt; page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kq2X6M"&gt;We reached out to Apple to confirm the changes, but didn’t...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mac-shaped pillow makers are back so you can cover your couch in computers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MbSbzA"&gt;A company called Throwboy is &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/throwboy/the-iconic-pillow-collection-2-by-throwboy/description"&gt;back with another Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; for a collection of pillows shaped like classic Macs, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/18/17715884/throwboy-pillow-retro-macintosh-imac-iphone-ipod-nostalgia"&gt;its 2018 line of Apple-inspired plushes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s fittingly called The Iconic Pillow Collection 2, and features pillows shaped like soft versions of Apple’s Lisa, iBook, and both the cheese grater and cube flavors of Power Mac. For Apple history buffs who want to spruce up their living or bedrooms, it may be a campaign worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xB3tvA"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/throwboy/the-iconic-pillow-collection-by-throwboy/description"&gt;its original collection&lt;/a&gt; (which featured pillows shaped like the Finder icon, original Macintosh, and iPods), Throwboy tactfully didn’t mention specific computer names, and it refrained from doing so this time around as well. The Lisa-shaped pillow is called the 1983, the iMac...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Listen to Device Orchestra cover the Ghostbusters theme using electric toothbrushes and a steam iron</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ghostbusters device orchestra" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VYcjQ_aDq2-lLXhnhcRqdjFLB8Q=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70068158/device_orchestra_ghostbusters.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5DHGtI"&gt;An inspired musician can use pretty much anything as an instrument, but this just-in-time for Halloween cover of the &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; theme song goes in an unexpected direction. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDwMh0pu1iSXeKx7qmqjIQA"&gt;Device Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to posting music videos recorded solely with the sounds of common household devices. It’s the work of a Finnish YouTuber who’s been creating gadget-powered covers since 2014 (via &lt;a href="https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Device_Orchestra"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wikitubia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This time, Device Orchestra busted out 14 gadgets for its composition — including electric toothbrushes adorned with googly eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjHgYQ"&gt;One electric toothbrush with pipe cleaners for arms stands front and center, belting out the familiar chorus in a tone comparable to a musically-inclined bumblebee. It might be the star of the show, but it has plenty of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nikon Z9’s new sensor could be the start of a big shift in photography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/na8o3ezZK2iyEyZun5OTW9ohOI0=/27x0:1143x744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70067206/nikon_z9_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikon’s Z9 pro mirrorless camera has no mechanical shutter, relying solely on an electronic shutter.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nikon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Manxm0"&gt;Nikon recently &lt;a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/about-nikon/press-room/press-release/kv76k47t/THE-NIKON-Z-9%3A-UNSTOPPABLE-PERFORMANCE,-REVOLUTIONARY-INNOVATION.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its new flagship camera, the &lt;a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/mirrorless-cameras/z-9.html#tab-ProductDetail-ProductTabs-Overview"&gt;Z9&lt;/a&gt;. This camera represents Nikon’s first mirrorless camera fully geared towards professional photographers and hybrid shooters, with &lt;a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/mirrorless-cameras/z-9.html#tab-ProductDetail-ProductTabs-TechSpecs"&gt;a huge spec list&lt;/a&gt; designed for use in the demanding fields of photojournalism, sports, nature, birding, and any other use-cases that call for a camera that shoots incredibly fast at high resolution. The $5,500 Z9 is also Nikon’s first camera to omit a traditional mechanical shutter, allowing it to achieve new levels of speed and autofocus performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBvwh0"&gt;Faster speed is great, especially for sports photographers. But it’s interesting to think about where this technology could be used to take traditional-style cameras in the future. This might be the first...&lt;/p&gt;

The platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;previously put restrictions on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt; in late 2020, but didn’t have policies specific to kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmqQSZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/supporting-covid-19-vaccine-children/"&gt;Meta says in a new blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it’s partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to take down harmful content related to children and the COVID-19 vaccine.

    <title>Global climate talks in Glasgow aren’t very global</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Climate activists “set fire” to George Square, Glasgow, with an art installation of faux flames, smoke, and banners, and giant fire extinguishers, creating a field of climate fire to welcome world leaders to Glasgow for the Cop26 conference.
