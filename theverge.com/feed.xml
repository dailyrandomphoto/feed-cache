    <title>As Epic v. Apple approaches the courtroom, Valve is getting sued over Steam too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Steam Box Header alt 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b0N3Bi3b0ocvgPZlxBIRwhd7o98=/8x0:1013x670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69220436/steam_box_header_alt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrKVAp"&gt;Just two days before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Apple gets dragged into a California court&lt;/a&gt; to justify its 30 percent App Store fee — and two days after Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;axed its 30 percent cut on PC&lt;/a&gt; — we’re learning that gaming giant Valve is now facing down lawsuits against its own 30 percent cut and alleged anticompetitive practices with its PC gaming platform Steam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PA9iFx"&gt;“Valve abuses its market power to ensure game publishers have no choice but to sell most of their games through the Steam Store, where they are subject to Valve’s 30% toll,” argues indie game developer and &lt;a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33272/GDC_2011_Humble_Indie_Bundle_Creators_Talk_Inspiration_Execution.php"&gt;Humble Bundle creator&lt;/a&gt; Wolfire Games, in a lawsuit filed Tuesday (via &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/humble-bundle-creator-brings-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-over-steam/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="okv3S3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clear parallels to Epic v. Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t5SABB"&gt;Much like Epic v. Apple, the new suit argues that a platform owner is using an...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Newsmax apologizes to employee of Dominion Voting Systems over false election accusations</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fnBX7N"&gt;Conservative news channel Newsmax has posted an apology to an employee of Dominion Voting Systems, after it reported without evidence that he was involved in manipulating results of the 2020 US presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lcIks"&gt;“On behalf of Newsmax, we would like to apologize for any harm that our reporting of the allegations against Dr. Coomer may have caused to Dr. Coomer and his family,” &lt;a href="https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/eric-coomer-dominion-voting-systems/2021/04/30/id/1019671/"&gt;a statement posted to Newsmax’s website states&lt;/a&gt;. According to the statement, there was no substance to the allegations made about Eric Coomer, Dominion’s director of product strategy and security:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bcWHOe"&gt;“Newsmax would like to clarify its coverage of Dr. Coomer and note that while Newsmax initially covered claims by President Trump’s lawyers, supporters and others...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Epic-backed expert says Apple’s app store profit is as high as 78 percent</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9a9cP"&gt;An expert witness for Epic Games testified that Apple’s App Store had operating margins above 70 percent in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22484513/ned_barnes_testimony.pdf"&gt;new court documents show.&lt;/a&gt;  Ned Barnes testified that information from Apple’s Corporate Financial Planning and Analysis group show the App Store had a 77.8 percent operating margin in 2019, and 74.9 percent in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rPK8V"&gt;The figures are close to Barnes’ calculations of the App Store’s profits, he testified, and “also refute criticisms of my report proffered by certain Apple expert witnesses that it is not possible to calculate reliably or usefully the operating margins of the App Store.” Barnes also testified that Apple has been tracking its App Store profits for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chGe68"&gt;Apple has hotly contested that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California appeals court finds Amazon responsible for third party sellers’ products</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9PXCby"&gt;An appeals court in California has ruled that Amazon can be held liable for products sold through its marketplace by a third-party seller, the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-04-29/column-amazon-product-safety-ruling"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367966/amazon-liable-defective-products-california-marketplace-third-party"&gt;second major case in California&lt;/a&gt; where an appeals court has rejected Amazon’s long-held position that it is merely an intermediary between buyers and its third-party sellers. Amazon collectively refers to these sellers as its “Amazon Marketplace” even though it’s not a separate or distinct part of Amazon’s website. Third-party sellers’ products typically appear in Amazon listings, with a small line of text to indicate that Amazon itself is not the actual seller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1iZvC"&gt;At issue was the case of a woman who suffered burn injuries after a hoverboard she purchased on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Netflix executive convicted of money laundering</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HzYZzt"&gt;A former Netflix executive was convicted of taking bribes and kickbacks from vendors doing business with the company, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-netflix-executive-convicted-receiving-bribes-and-kickbacks-companies-contracting"&gt;according to the US Department of Justice. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uh8mBU"&gt;Michael Kail, who was Netflix’s vice president of information technology operations from 2011 to 2014, was found guilty by a jury of money laundering, and wire and mail fraud. According to the DOJ, Kail used his position at the company to “unlock a stream of cash and stock kickbacks” for himself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHHx84"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-26/netflix-claims-former-executive-took-kickbacks-on-sales"&gt;Netflix sued Kail in 2014&lt;/a&gt; claiming he hid payments from vendors by directing them to his personal consulting company. According to the DOJ, Kail accepted bribes totaling more than $500,000, as well as stock options from nine tech companies that provided products or services to Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is like an epic yet enigmatic novel</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="12nuhP"&gt;At some point during my time with &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium: The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;, after I read yet another minutes-long dialogue sequence to try and learn more information about the game’s murder mystery, I realized I felt like I was slowly working my way through a long novel — one that went just a little bit over my head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kvtgct"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;, an enhanced version of the 2019 cult hit role-playing game that made its console debut on PlayStation in March, you play as a cop with amnesia investigating a murder case about a hanged man. You’ll explore a fictional place called Revachol and talk to a huge cast of characters to piece together clues about the hanged man’s killer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cb1L8i"&gt;Almost every conversation or interaction has an extensive dialogue tree, allowing you...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Florida bill would fine social media platforms for banning politicians— with exemption for Disney</title>

  &lt;p id="AcOSH8"&gt;Florida is on the verge of passing &lt;a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/7072/BillText/e1/HTML"&gt;legislation that would fine&lt;/a&gt; social media companies like Twitter and Facebook that “knowingly de-platform” political candidates. The bill was first &lt;a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/gov-desantis-holds-press-conference-from-florida-state-capitol/"&gt;proposed in February by Gov. Ron DeSantis&lt;/a&gt;, a supporter of former President Trump, although &lt;a href="https://www.cltampa.com/news-views/florida-news/article/21151908/floridas-big-tech-crackdown-bill-goes-to-desantis-but-with-a-special-exemption-for-disney"&gt;Florida Republicans insist&lt;/a&gt; the bill has nothing to do with the former president, a famous denizen of social media who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; by major platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQC0gc"&gt;The Florida House of Representatives passed &lt;a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/7072"&gt;SB 7072 by a vote of 77 to 38&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, after the state Senate voted Monday to pass the measure.

    <title>New vaccine perks: halftime shots and savings bonds  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rTXg8F"&gt;If you’re one of the few thousand people heading to see the Milwaukee Bucks play the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday, May 2nd, you have a chance to get a very special souvenir during the game — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407753/covid-vaccine-milwaukee-bucks-arena-nba"&gt;your first dose of a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. The unusual vaccination drive is part of a host of new efforts across the US to get people their shots, whether that’s by bribing them with savings bonds in West Virginia or hosting vaccine clinics at professional basketball games in Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qL6fUl"&gt;In the US, vaccine supplies are high, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22399889/vaccine-supply-demand-antivirus-newsletter-covid"&gt;demand is starting to taper off&lt;/a&gt;, as my colleague Nicole Wetsman wrote last week. That means that people are getting a lot more creative about ways to convince people to get their shots. You know, in case the &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/news/free-beer-for-getting-covid-vaccine-budweiser-samuel-adams"&gt;free beer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2021/03/22/covid-vaccine-free-donuts-krispy-kreme-vaccination-card-freebie/4750302001/"&gt;free...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvskRD"&gt;We’ve reached the weekend, and the start of another month. Sayonara, April, and hello to May. The past few days at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have been some of the best tech deals so far this year, like the now-expired deal that knocked $150 off the Apple Watch Series 6, putting it lower in price than even the Apple Watch SE. That one sold out in just a few hours, though I wouldn’t be surprised to see it come again soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkJFs3"&gt;Not all of the best sales of the week have ended. You can save on PC games in celebration of Golden Week in Japan, and get $80 off a Google Nest Wifi bundle, to name a couple of examples. Find even more below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VFw4lY"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qEG4do"&gt;Save up to $147 on a preorder of a new M1 iPad Pro or iMac&lt;/h2&gt;
