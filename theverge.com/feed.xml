    <title>Hackers stole NFTs from Nifty Gateway users</title>

  &lt;p id="GZFANk"&gt;Over the weekend, some users of NFT marketplace &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/"&gt;Nifty Gateway&lt;/a&gt; said hackers stole digital artwork worth thousands of dollars from their accounts. Some people who were hacked also said their credit cards on file were used to purchase additional NFTs, also costing thousands of dollars, which were then transferred away to a hacker’s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skTgm8"&gt;Nifty Gateway confirmed in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that some accounts without two-factor authentication had been hacked and that it has been in touch with those affected, but it said it has not seen evidence that its platform was breached. Nifty Giveaway suggests the hackers may have successfully reused login credentials that leaked from other services.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO’s QAnon documentary is a megaphone for extremists — and it’s unbelievably boring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;HBO&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZtkmY3"&gt;QAnon has become a nearly inescapable part of politics. The conspiracy is organized around an anonymous figure called Q, who was supposedly operating inside the Trump administration. Using anonymous online message boards, Q has sent a string of cryptic messages about a plan to mass-arrest Democratic politicians and celebrities, who are supposedly kidnapping and murdering huge numbers of children. (They are not.) Q has now spent three years promising imminent arrests, while the QAnon group has become a kind of super-conspiracy theory attracting people from across the world, built around cheering for mass executions and martial law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBw5hI"&gt;On paper, then, unmasking the person (or people) behind Q sounds like a big deal. And that’s the goal of &lt;em&gt;Q:...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The trailer for Netflix’s The Irregulars paints a supernatural picture of Sherlock Holmes’ London</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F4mq-5uBLtSR6ps0_S9ammeq2ok=/240x0:1500x840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68968736/irregulars.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTE5MAGpflw&amp;amp;t=1s&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3sas8A"&gt;After dropping an ominous teaser for it in February, Netflix has now released a full trailer for its upcoming series &lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt;. It’s part of the streaming channel’s Sherlock Holmes cinematic universe (no that’s not a thing, but it could be!) after last year’s charming &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; series, which told the story of Sherlock’s younger sister, based on the novels by Nancy Springer (although Arthur Conan Doyle’s estate has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302942/netflix-enola-holmes-sherlock-arthur-conan-doyle-estate-lawsuit-copyright-infringement"&gt;sued Netflix&lt;/a&gt; for that series’ portrayal of Sherlock as too emotional).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtxbdI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt; is loosely based on the street urchin gang called the Baker Street Irregulars, who appeared in several of Arthur Conan Doyle’s &lt;em&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/em&gt; stories. In the books, the Irregulars are sort of like confidential informants for Holmes...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some Bethesda games now on Xbox Game Pass get frame rate boosts on Xbox Series X / S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox logo (a white sphere with an X through it) against a dark green background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4FQiXBZhmiC2FLvEWKeMGoiAaPA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68958201/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ea9XbM"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass platform received a huge boost with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325044/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-bethesda-games-list"&gt;addition of 20 new Bethesda Softworks titles&lt;/a&gt; across Xbox consoles, PC, and xCloud last week. And now, a quarter of those games are getting performance boosts on the next-gen Xbox consoles in a new update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89aA1D"&gt;The performance gains are in frame rate, thanks to an appropriately named &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287001/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-fps-boost-feature-games"&gt;new feature Microsoft revealed last month called FPS Boost&lt;/a&gt;, which can roughly double frame rates of older games using new Xbox hardware without requiring developers to do any manual work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqMm8P"&gt;The games seeing performance boosts with frame rate jumps up to 60 frames per second include Arkane Studios’ &lt;em&gt;Dishonored: Definitive Edition &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Prey&lt;/em&gt; and Bethesda Game Studios’ &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o0XjSE"&gt;Had enough Zoom meetings? Can’t bear another soul-numbing day of sitting on video calls, the only distraction your rapidly aging face, pinned in one corner of the screen like a dying bug? Well, if so, then boy do we have the app for you. Meet &lt;a href="https://zoomescaper.com/"&gt;Zoom Escaper&lt;/a&gt;: a free web widget that lets you add an array of fake audio effects to your next Zoom Call, gifting you with numerous reasons to end the meeting and escape, &lt;em&gt;while you still can&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uERXZE"&gt;You can choose from barking dogs, construction noises, crying babies, or even subtler effects like choppy audio and unwanted echoes. Created by artist &lt;a href="https://lav.io/"&gt;Sam Lavigne&lt;/a&gt;, Zoom Escaper is fantastically simple to use. All you need do is download a free bit of audio software called &lt;a href="https://vb-audio.com/Cable/"&gt;VB-Audio&lt;/a&gt; that routes your audio through...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some new GM trucks will pollute more thanks to microchip shortage </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="General Motors Vehicles At A Car Dealership Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O8nKAyVLovHVZ6kP-9ErFiA6IsI=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68968464/1231061209.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MFuvX4"&gt;General Motors has decided to make some 2021 full-size pickups without a certain fuel management module because of the ongoing microchip shortage. As a result, those trucks will get around one fewer mile per gallon of gas, meaning they’ll burn more fuel to go the same distance, releasing more carbon emissions into the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKU8NJ"&gt;The trucks affected are models that use GM’s 5.3-liter EcoTec3 V8 engine (including versions with six-speed or eight-speed automatic transmissions), according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-semiconductors/gm-builds-some-2021-pickups-without-certain-modules-due-to-global-chip-shortage-idUSKBN2B71P5"&gt;first reported the decision&lt;/a&gt;. That includes the popular Chevy Silverado and GMC’s Sierra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dk5Xfy"&gt;The module is what powers the trademarked “Active Fuel Management” or “Dynamic Fuel Management” systems GM promotes on these trucks, which...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch and Facebook Gaming exploded during the pandemic — and they’re even bigger a year later</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M2n8nt8vg6n-tsRBhdHG4BRhtbE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68968458/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r9m5uw"&gt;Today, StreamElements and its partner, analytics company Rainmaker.gg, have put out the February issue of their “State of the Stream” report. It’s something of a fascinating document because, as the end of the pandemic draws near, it’s another piece of evidence that live-streaming platforms were one of the winners of the crisis. (You know, assuming there can be winners to a global mass death event.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXU8bj"&gt;The biggest finding in this month’s report is that, in terms of hours watched, both Twitch and Facebook Gaming are up around 80 percent year over year. To be slightly more specific: Twitch has grown by 82 percent, while Facebook Gaming grew by 79 percent. For Twitch, that translates to more than 1.8 billion hours of watch time in February;...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People aren’t missing their second COVID-19 vaccine dose, CDC data says</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="beB7vy"&gt;Nearly everyone who got their first dose of a two-shot COVID-19 vaccine got their second dose within the recommended window, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7011e2.htm?s_cid=mm7011e2_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM51989&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20March%2015%2C%202021&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM51989"&gt;new data&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOoAbx"&gt;During the first two months of the United States COVID-19 vaccination campaign, around 12 million people got their first dose and were also scheduled for their second dose. The second dose is supposed to be given three weeks after the first for the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine and four weeks for the Moderna vaccine (with a few days’ buffer on each side). In that group, 88 percent of people had their second shot on schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCqsHn"&gt;Around 9 percent of people who had their first shot between December 14th and February 14th had not yet received their...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cruise acquires Voyage in another autonomous vehicle merger</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PfPYz0"&gt;Cruise, a majority-owned subsidiary of General Motors, will acquire self-driving startup Voyage in another major autonomous vehicle merger. The announcement came less than a week after news first surfaced that the two companies were in talks about an acquisition. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4F2u5v"&gt;Cruise mainly operates its autonomous vehicles in dense, urban settings like downtown San Francisco, while Voyage oversees a fleet of low-speed autonomous vehicles providing trips to residents of several &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/10/16874410/voyage-self-driving-cars-villages-florida-retirement-communities"&gt;retirement communities&lt;/a&gt;. Both companies have tested their vehicles without a safety driver behind the wheel and aspire to launch full-fledged commercial robot taxi services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5NMOjP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The self-driving industry is consolidating”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
