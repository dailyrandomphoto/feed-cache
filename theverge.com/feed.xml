    <title>Burn-in isn’t a huge risk for Nintendo’s Switch OLED, but you can still take precautions</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gKkOC3"&gt;Nintendo’s Switch OLED Model is now available, and even if it’s no Switch Pro, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;a lot to like about it&lt;/a&gt;. But as new owners of the console start enjoying its larger, more vibrant screen, some might also wonder whether they should pay any mind to the classic “risk” of OLED technology: burn-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGgn1t"&gt;In the early days of OLED smartphones, it wasn’t uncommon to find a mistreated demo phone at a carrier or Best Buy that had a ghastly display with home screen icons or a status bar left permanently visible whenever the screen was on. Burn-in could also befall OLED TVs if they were carelessly left on a news channel (with a ticker at the bottom) for many hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIPUn1"&gt;But we’ve come a long way since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Cz22A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-04/nintendo-plans-switch-model-with-bigger-samsung-oled-display"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung Display is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo won’t make Europeans play worse versions of N64 games on Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GfQ838-YOAFudQ6gL5ipxTRIjh0=/0x0:920x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69979985/image.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The release also includes Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis controllers for Switch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="82bUHf"&gt;The Nintendo 64 games being re-released as part of the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688780/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-64-sega-genesis-controllers"&gt;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription&lt;/a&gt; will run at 60Hz, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1447552226830991361"&gt;Nintendo of Europe&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed. The news follows concerns &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-09-24-nintendo-fans-fear-european-switch-online-n64-games-will-be-50hz"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the re-released games, which include classic titles like &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt;, would run at a reduced 50Hz in European PAL regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="da8NEK"&gt;The disparity is a holdover from the days of standard definition TVs which typically used the 50Hz PAL standard in Europe, but the 60Hz NTSC standard in the US. It meant that footage shown on European TVs would refresh 50 times per second, rather than 60 as in the US. This wasn’t a major issue for regular TV content (which typically ran at 30fps in the US...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Astronaut Sally Ride will be one of the women featured on a 2022 US quarter</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sally Ride, the first American woman to go to space, will be memorialized on a 2022 quarter.  | US Mint&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G0hrfG"&gt;Sally Ride, the first American woman to travel to space, will be featured on one of the first five coins in the US Mint’s &lt;a href="https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/united-states-mint-announces-designs-for-2022-american-women-quarters-program-coins"&gt;American Women Quarters Program&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning next year and continuing through 2025, the Mint will issue five quarters each year with tails-side designs featuring trailblazing American women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snkcKf"&gt;Ride, who died in 2012 at age 61, flew aboard the space shuttle Challenger in 1983, and again in 1984. She was slated to go on a third shuttle mission, but after the Challenger blew up in 1986, NASA suspended the shuttle program, and Ride retired a year later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aM4C9N"&gt;She continued to advise NASA, as part of the panel that investigated the Challenger accident and a study team that wrote a report recommending the agency work on an outpost...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s plans for Fuchsia OS teased in job listings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3vzC8mDnkoD2XRVgqaHjY0bWBrU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69979047/dseifert_181018_3039_1192.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first generation Nest Hub, which was updated to run Fuchsia earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fg2p03"&gt;Google says “it’s time” to now bring its mysterious Fuchsia operating system to “additional smart devices and other form factors” beyond smart displays, according to a number of job listings first &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/08/google-fuchsia-expanding-additional-smart-devices/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Fuchsia is Google’s newest operating system which was released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630245/google-fuchsia-os-nest-hub-rollout-release-date"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for the company’s first-generation Nest Hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytSHOJ"&gt;There’s been a lot of speculation about Google’s plans for Fuchsia, which unlike Android and Chrome OS doesn’t use a Linux kernel (it uses a microkernel called Zircon instead), and whose purpose is still fairly vague despite having been public for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/15/12480566/google-fuchsia-new-operating-system"&gt;over five years&lt;/a&gt;. When it arrived on the Nest Hub it was more or less functionally identical to the software that preceded it. The new job listings offer...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Pixel Pass’ is Google’s rumored response to Apple One</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EBXqdiCLLPocryObgqyRZkBLflo=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69978928/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CzuRZB"&gt;Google seems poised to announce a new subscription bundle called “Pixel Pass,” which would combine a new Pixel device with an extended warranty and premium subscriptions for several Google services. The unconfirmed bundle has been detailed in a leaked image &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1447248490321514500/photo/1"&gt;published by Brandon Lee&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear how much Pixel Pass would cost, but the documents suggest it will be sold via Google Fi and the Google Store alongside the purchase of a Pixel device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbOwjS"&gt;As Lee notes, Pixel Pass appears to combine elements of Apple’s iPhone Upgrade program (which offers an iPhone via monthly subscription payments alongside an extended warranty) and its Apple One subscription services bundle. Pixel Pass could be pitched as a way to simplify access to all these...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram to introduce new features to nudge teams away from harmful content | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qiXWV4"&gt;Instagram will introduce new measures to nudge teenagers away from harmful content and encourage them to “take a break,” from the platform, Facebook vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg said on Sunday. Clegg made the remarks on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/10/10/dana-bash-presses-nick-clegg-is-that-acceptable.cnn"&gt;CNN’s State of the Union&lt;/a&gt; show less than a week after whistleblower Frances Haugen testified before Congress about internal research that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;showed Instagram can have a negative effect on the mental health of young people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50IxCc"&gt;“We’re going to introduce something which I think will make a considerable difference, which is where our systems see that a teenagers is looking at the same content over and over again, and it’s content which may not be conducive to their well being, we will nudge them to look at other...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin postpones William Shatner’s space flight by a day</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;William Shatner is heading to space on October 13th | Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fEIWgA"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight company Blue Origin said Sunday it will postpone the flight that is slated to fly William Shatner to space due to forecasted high winds at its launch site. The flight of the company’s New Shepard spacecraft is now scheduled for 9:30AM ET on October 13th, a day later than originally planned. It’s targeted to lift off from Blue Origin’s Launch Site One in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRwFsp"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-shepard-ns-18-mission-updates"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on Blue Origin’s website said New Shepard NS-18 has met all mission requirements, and the astronauts have started their training. “Weather is the only gating factor for the launch window,” according to the statement, which is signed with the company motto “Gradatim Ferociter” (Latin for “step by step, ferociously”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teKdip"&gt;The company officially...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Star Trek: Discovery, Doctor Who: Flux, Blade Runner: Black Lotus, and more</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C6WMUo"&gt;Before it premiered, Jason Sudeikis &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2021/07/22/jason-sudeikis-ted-lasso-season-2-star-wars-fans/7979429002/"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; season two of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; as the show’s &lt;em&gt;Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt; season, and sure enough, the entire season focused on fathers and sons, and after the season finale we have a pretty clear “enemy” all set up for season three. I know season two was not as universally liked as its freshman season, but &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; dug into some thorny issues about men and sports and mental health that few other shows attempt, and still managed to make me smile pretty much every week. I’ll miss this show until its return next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyMPUM"&gt;I’ve also managed to binge-watch &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; on Netflix— an interesting if not quite fully-baked examination of organized religion— and am still hanging in there with &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; which...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change your default browser in Windows 11</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cb5cUv"&gt;If you’ve updated your PC from Windows 10 to Windows 11, you may have noticed that when you click on a link for a website, a PDF document, or a variety of other file types, you will now be sent to Microsoft’s Edge browser. In its new version of Windows, Microsoft seems to have become especially aggressive in pushing its own apps over the apps that had been installed as defaults before the upgrade.
