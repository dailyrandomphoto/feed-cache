    <title>Samsung announces a cheaper entry-level Galaxy Book with no OLED</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Book comes in silver or this sleek blue color&lt;/em&gt; | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZXPBjX"&gt;Samsung announced two entry-level Galaxy Book laptops at its Unpacked event: the Galaxy Book and the Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha. The former will start at around $800 (according to Samsung, that price is subject to change) and will launch in the second half of 2021, whereas the Flex2 Alpha starts at $849 and is available for preorder now, shipping in mid-May. These round out the fleet of premium models announced today, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;the Galaxy Book Pro and Pro 360&lt;/a&gt; with OLED screens that start at $999, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407647/samsungs-galaxy-book-odyssey-nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-gpu"&gt;$1,399 Galaxy Book Odyssey gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; that’s the first to sport Nvidia’s new RTX 3050 Ti graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7iI7N"&gt;Starting with the Galaxy Book, it has a 15.6-inch 1080p TFT LCD display, and it supports up to two fast NVMe SSDs. It has two USB-C...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The UAW wants to unionize EV startup factory workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7a-fzntkO1szOZiAz5oFNF4dZEU=/0x89:3708x2561/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199762/2019_03_normal.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZHS9IN"&gt;The United Auto Workers union is “laying the groundwork” to organize factory workers that will build electric vehicles for startups like Rivian and Lucid Motors, president Rory Gamble told &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/26/with-biden-as-an-ally-uaw-union-prepares-to-battle-for-ev-jobs.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGzTkz"&gt;“That’s a given. We are formulating plans to go out to all these start-ups to give these workers a voice,” he said. “In today’s world, you have to think out of the box in how you reach people. We really have to drive home the benefits of belonging to the union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9JtCF"&gt;Gamble declined to say what those plans involve, according to CNBC. The UAW did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Representatives for Rivian, Lucid Motors, Faraday Future, and Lordstown Motors did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 vaccinations are keeping older Americans out of hospitals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ojS5Tefn4W87NmjSjAybaZE6MYE=/64x0:5739x3783/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199750/1232342354.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wKZS8Y"&gt;Two shots of a COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization by 94 percent for people over 65, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7018e1.htm?s_cid=mm7018e1_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=usCDC_921-DM55819&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20April%2028%2C%202021&amp;amp;deliveryName=usCDC_921-DM55819"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4H0nv"&gt;That age group is at the highest risk of severe cases of COVID-19 — that’s why it was prioritized for the early waves of vaccination in the United States. Keeping that age group out of the hospital would go a long way to drive down the hospitalization rates from the disease overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2SAqj"&gt;The analysis looked at people hospitalized at 24 hospitals in 14 states during January, February, and March. It included 417 hospitalized patients, 187 of whom tested positive for COVID-19 and 230 who did not. Partial vaccination, defined in this case as having a first dose two...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile launches LTE-based SyncUp Tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-W8JVbG76a6O-mdfEZJsOyqHfqI=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199710/SyncUP_TRACKER_Black_Front_Left_Laynard_RGB_2020_10_01_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SyncUp uses LTE rather than Bluetooth or UWB so it doesn’t need to be within range of your phone (or someone else’s) to be located.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfl65d"&gt;It seems that 2021 is the year of the tracker, with new options from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and now T-Mobile in the form of its SyncUp Tracker. But unlike those other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20901686/tile-tracker-mate-pro-slim-sticker-release-date-news-features"&gt;Tile-type&lt;/a&gt; tracking devices, SyncUp uses LTE rather than Bluetooth or Ultra Wideband for real-time location information, a la &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/10/17841570/samsung-smartthings-tracker-gps-lte-m"&gt;Samsung’s SmartThings&lt;/a&gt; tracker. That means it doesn’t rely on being within a certain range of your phone (or other phones) to tell you where it is — but it does come with a $5 per month data charge on your T-Mobile phone plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAxx6S"&gt;The SyncUp offers some nice tracking features: you can make the device ring to help locate it when it’s out of sight, for example, and it offers geofencing to send you an alert when it leaves a predetermined area. It’s also IP67 dust...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Uber will let you book a vaccine appointment through its app</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SMZwXz"&gt;You can now book a vaccine appointment — and a ride to that appointment — in the Uber app.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRDJBI"&gt;The new feature is part of a host of product news that Uber announced today under the rubric “go anywhere, get anything.” With more people getting vaccinated, the company is banking on a big comeback to help make up for the steep losses it suffered during 2020. And it’s rolling out a series of new features aimed at enticing lockdown-weary customers back to its platform — whether to travel somewhere or to get something delivered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ed0zYK"&gt;The vaccine appointments are being offered nationwide through the company’s previously announced partnership with Walgreens. Since February, Uber has been offering free rides to Walgreens stores for people who book a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Book Odyssey introduces Nvidia’s new RTX 3050 Ti</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Book Odyssey.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mTOPbR"&gt;Samsung is announcing its new Galaxy Book Odyssey gaming laptop today, complete with Nvidia’s unannounced GeForce RTX 3050 Ti and 3050 graphics cards. The 15.6-inch (1080p) gaming laptop starts at $1,399 and will ship with Intel’s 11th Gen Core H i5 or i7 processors, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of SSD storage. The big new addition is a choice between Nvidia’s RTX 3050 or RTX 3050 Ti GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95Dfeo"&gt;Samsung hasn’t provided many details on the RTX 3050 or RTX 3050 Ti, and Nvidia hasn’t even announced the GPU yet, so details are slim. The RTX 3050 Ti name &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315175/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-gpu-asus-leak-rumor"&gt;appeared in March on an Asus website&lt;/a&gt; that mentioned it would have 4GB of memory. Combined with the numbering scheme and 135-watt charger, this suggests this is more of an entry-level gaming...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moped-sharing startup Revel plans to launch a Tesla-only ride-hailing service in NYC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PcvBBuHvudFGcunD2kdBEHxbMHI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198944/revel_pressimage.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VdBjRF"&gt;Electric moped-sharing startup Revel is adding a new vehicle to its fleet — this time with four wheels instead of two. The Brooklyn-based company is launching its own Uber-esque ride-hailing service in New York City using only electric vehicles from Tesla. And true to its Uber-imitating ways, the company is announcing its intention to launch the service before obtaining its license to legally to operate in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OJcCM"&gt;It’s an interesting — and potentially risky — move for the three-year-old startup with thousands of shared electric mopeds in cities across the US. As it grows in size, Revel has also gotten more ambitious, launching an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22279921/revel-ebike-subscription-nyc-price-specs"&gt;e-bike subscription service&lt;/a&gt; and unveiling plans to build &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/electric-moped-startup-revel-launches-an-ev-charging-business/"&gt;the largest EV charging station in New York City&lt;/a&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beefing over beef is a distraction the climate movement can’t afford </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ldpaj9"&gt;Lately, it seems like forgoing red meat has become an unfortunate proxy for environmental credentials. &lt;em&gt;Epicurious&lt;/em&gt;, for example, just &lt;a href="https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/why-epicurious-left-beef-behind-article"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will no longer publish articles or recipes with beef in a decision it calls, “not anti-beef but rather pro-planet.” And then there are headlines like “&lt;a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/why-do-some-green-activists-eat-meat/"&gt;Why do some green activists eat meat&lt;/a&gt;?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUhXmQ"&gt;Meat-eating, meanwhile, has become a sort of symbol for climate denial. There are Twitter wars swirling around whether Biden’s climate ambitions will infringe on Americans’ right to eat burgers (his actual climate proposals would not).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TjCkG1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Diet shouldn’t be a political scorecard for how down you are for the planet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yAGA0K"&gt;But diet shouldn’t be a political scorecard for how down you are for the planet. Shaming...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Late last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price...&lt;/p&gt;
