    <title>The Google Store is open again, and Pixel 6 delivery dates are all over the place</title>

  &lt;p id="DqywpW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734748/google-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;Pre-orders for Google’s new line of phones&lt;/a&gt; started at the same time as their launch event, but for most of us, trying to buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; has meant seeing nothing but error screens. Some unsteadiness is to be expected given the sudden demand, but at 1PM ET, the doors opened, and Google’s store seemed to fall flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGyn0z"&gt;As of 5:40PM ET, Google says the store is operational again, and many of us have been able to put orders through. According to a spokesperson, “The Google Store was temporarily down but is now back up. We apologize for the inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zzX7D"&gt;However, as &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/19/pixel-6-shipping-date-flux/#more-461552"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out, being able to submit an order is only part of it. Availability of different devices and projected delivery dates have continued to move around,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spec showdown: Google’s new Pixel 6 vs. Samsung, Apple, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3dW1tEyzjUOCkXkveTllSgei3S4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018000/cwelch_211015_4802_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="gqqDWH"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;its fall event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, Google announced the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, which feature its custom Tensor processor and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;the first big camera upgrade for Google’s phones&lt;/a&gt; since the Pixel 3. Since the Pixel 6s are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734748/google-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;available to preorder now&lt;/a&gt;, let’s take a look at how Google’s new phones compare on paper to their Android and iPhone competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8OO9p"&gt;At this point, how Google’s Tensor custom chip will perform is the biggest question mark — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; it’s comparable to the Snapdragon 888, but that’s not even Qualcomm’s most powerful chip today, and Qualcomm is &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-tech-summit"&gt;holding an event in November&lt;/a&gt;, potentially to show off &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-tech-summit"&gt;even newer chips&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, though, as we’re working on putting the Tensor through its paces to see how it performs in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox will soon automatically mute your speakers when you plug in headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUwkVmkFKb8cr-7jjvFTV1nrT_s=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017902/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o3eqym"&gt;Microsoft is testing a feature that automatically mutes your speakers when you plug in headphones, fixing one of my biggest pet peeves with playing games on Xbox. The feature is rolling out &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/19/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-skip-ahead-2111-211017-2200/"&gt;to Xbox Insiders on the Alpha Skip-Ahead ring&lt;/a&gt;, which means it will very likely be available more broadly in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8AXc6F"&gt;Right now, when you plug in headphones to your controller on Xbox, your speakers stay on, too, which means if you want to have the audio just play in your headphones, you have to separately turn down the volume on your speakers. The PS5, on the other hand, handily mutes speaker audio when you plug in headphones, and I’m glad Microsoft is following suit by working on a similar feature for Xbox. The option to atuomatically mute...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is shifting the way it ranks its most popular titles </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/re4cATA64_ZbkC5VqIfaVWbx6ME=/563x0:3443x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017846/SquidGame_Season1_Episode1_00_44_44_16.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An image from Netflix’s popular title &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;. | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8lJc8j"&gt;Netflix will change the public-facing metrics it uses to rank the most popular titles on its streaming service, the company announced Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PGuLq"&gt;In the past, the company has ranked titles based on the completion of at least the first two minutes of a film or TV show in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723452/netflix-squid-game-biggest-ever-show-at-launch"&gt;first 28 days&lt;/a&gt; on the service. More recently, however, the company has released rankings based on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;total number of hours&lt;/a&gt; a movie or series is viewed — a metric it will shift to moving forward beginning later this year, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/FINAL-Q3-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;letter to shareholders&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzeZBK"&gt;“There is some difference in rankings [...] but we think engagement as measured by hours viewed is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of our titles and member satisfaction,” the company...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>How corrosive valves may have delayed the launch of Boeing’s Starliner</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Boeing Orbital Flight Test-2 Prelaunch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7V4AX1V94hJ6eqCcUDo4SeWtRw=/0x0:4459x2973/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017823/1234402998.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boeing’s Starliner seen rolling out to its launchpad, ahead of the August delay&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by /NASA via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MuRDpK"&gt;Boeing says it is narrowing down the source of the issue that delayed the launch of its new Starliner spacecraft this summer, blaming the problem on excess water and humidity causing the vehicle’s valves to stick ahead of the flight. The company plans to extensively study the problematic valves over the months ahead and implement design changes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718002/boeing-starliner-test-flight-delayed-nasa-2022"&gt;with the hope of launching Starliner again in mid-2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYQrEh"&gt;Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner is a new passenger spacecraft, designed to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. Before Starliner can carry a crew, however, NASA wants Boeing to launch a successful flight of the vehicle without people on board, to prove the spacecraft can safely go...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite adds some melange with new Dune crossover</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lo8Ia7"&gt;Epic Games is once again proving that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;no brand is safe from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by adding two playable characters from &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; to its hit battle royale shooter. Starting Tuesday at 8PM ET, you’ll be able to buy &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/paul-atreides-and-chani-travel-from-planet-dune-to-the-fortnite-item-shop"&gt;virtual &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; avatars of Paul Atreides and Chani&lt;/a&gt; modeled after Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, the actors who play them in the upcoming movie. There are a handful of other &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;-themed items you can pick up as well, including an ornithopter glider and a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KohxK0_agqg"&gt;Sand Walk emote&lt;/a&gt; that mimics how the characters walk to avoid detection by gigantic sandworms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8VhuX"&gt;The tie-up arrives just a few days before &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;’s premiere &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551728/dune-movie-release-date-delayed-again-warner-bros"&gt;in theaters and on HBO Max on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Apple is ready to admit it was wrong about the future of laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m12jFAfSID_WEfiedS0EpLEa7mE=/1x0:1911x1273/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017538/Apple_MacBook_Pro_Ports_10182021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ports, ports, glorious ports.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3hjCdN"&gt;There’s plenty to be excited about when it comes to Apple’s new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros. As well as souped-up Pro and Max versions of the already capable M1 chip that Apple debuted last year, they also include numerous quality of life improvements like the return of MagSafe, a row of function keys rather than an OLED Touch Bar, and of course, a full selection of ports that won’t have users reaching for a dongle if they just want to import some photos from an SD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYTmsh"&gt;In fact, Apple was so enthusiastic about these “new” features, you’d be forgiven for forgetting that it was the one that killed most of them off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13490774/apple-macbook-pro-review-2016-13-inch-laptop"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="zz3GG9"&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;new MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; on October 18th, Apple finally also introduced its&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22435385"&gt; third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, which are set to ship on October 26th for $179 and are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22429684"&gt;available for preorder now&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733184/apple-second-generation-airpods-wired-charging-case-price-cut-129"&gt;lowered the cost&lt;/a&gt; of the now-entry-level AirPods 2 from $159 to $129 and will now only sell the version that comes with a wired charging case. As a result, the AirPods lineup now consists of four models of AirPods: the $129 AirPods 2, the $179 AirPods 3, the $249 AirPods Pro, and the $549 AirPods Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVI0Qf"&gt;With such a wide range of AirPods available at various price points, it can be overwhelming to try to figure out which one you should purchase. That’s why we’ve put together this guide comparing the models to each other — so you can find the...&lt;/p&gt;
