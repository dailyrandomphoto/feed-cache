    <title>Destruction AllStars no longer turns on voice chat by default, thanks to new hotfix</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EsgIxC"&gt;Sony released the car-smashing game &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; exclusively for the PlayStation 5 on Tuesday, but it shipped with one very annoying feature: voice chat in multiplayer matches was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264461/destruction-allstars-voice-chat-default-turn-off-dualsense"&gt;turned on by default&lt;/a&gt;, meaning you could be subject to the unfiltered comments and background noise from your opponents. And worse, it wasn’t immediately obvious how to turn voice chat off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpM0T2"&gt;On Friday, however, developer Lucid Games addressed the issue by releasing a hotfix for the game that disables voice chat in multiplayer lobbies by default (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/you-no-longer-have-to-hear-hate-speech-while-playing-de-1846205888"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCYZ7J"&gt;I jumped into a couple of matches with the hotfix installed to test things out, and I was greeted with glorious silence from my fellow players. However, it seems there’s no option for public voice...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Patient names and colonoscopy results from US hospitals posted by hackers to the dark web</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zEa8xz"&gt;Patients of two US hospital chains had their names, birthdays, and colonoscopy results posted on the dark web after a hack, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hackers-post-detailed-patient-medical-records-two-hospitals-dark-web-n1256887"&gt;reported NBC News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The tens of thousands of files released were from patients at Leon Medical Centers in Miami and Nocona General Hospital in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLwxyn"&gt;The patient records posted in this hack also include letters to insurers. There does not appear to be ransomware locking up the systems at Nocona, and the organization did not open a ransomware demand, an attorney for the organization told NBC News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zajmvv"&gt;Cyberattacks on hospitals and health care organizations are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21551050/cyberattacks-hospitals-coronavirus-deadly-tactics"&gt;increasingly common&lt;/a&gt;. These attacks doubled in the second half of 2020 compared to the first half. Two major attacks targeted US health care facilities in the fall....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Justice Department closes criminal probe of Ford emissions testing</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JWLfQt"&gt;The Department of Justice (DOJ) has closed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18517991/ford-criminal-investigation-emissions-testing-problems-dieselgate"&gt;nearly two-year investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the process Ford uses to evaluate the emissions of its vehicles, the automaker disclosed in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000003799621000012/f-20201231.htm"&gt;a new filing&lt;/a&gt; with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ford says it “cooperated fully” with the probe, but no action was taken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDaInW"&gt;Ford originally disclosed the investigation in April 2019, just a few months after it &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/ford-emissions.html"&gt;announced its own internal probe&lt;/a&gt; into concerns over the process. Those concerns, first raised by Ford employees, had nothing to do with the kind of deceitful “defeat devices” at the center of Volkswagen’s Dieselgate scandal. Rather, the employees believed there were problems with some of the analytical models Ford was using to calculate things like...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this New York Times investigation of the location tracking data of the Capitol rioters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RbyQDmfPogvfcC6Exv__c2w12qk=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68776428/acastro_170711_1777_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3AVlXF"&gt;You’re being tracked — around the web, sure, but also in real life: the apps on your smartphone are constantly feeding data into the digital advertising market, where it’s bought and sold by hedge funds, financial institutions, and marketers. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/opinion/capitol-attack-cellphone-data.html"&gt;A new report in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; underscores the horrifying implications of the system&lt;/a&gt;, featuring location data mined from the rioters who sacked the US Capitol on January 6th, leaked by an anonymous source in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JKxzT"&gt;“This new data included a remarkable piece of information: a unique ID for each user that is tied to a smartphone,” they write. “This made it even easier to find people, since the supposedly anonymous ID could be matched with other databases containing the same ID, allowing us...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A cappella group covers iPhone tones after nailing Windows sound effects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Maytree&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bcS9sP"&gt;In January, South Korean a cappella group Maytree &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252590/maytree-a-cappella-group-windows-10-singing"&gt;wowed us&lt;/a&gt; with their spot-on vocal interpretations of Windows sound effects, and on Friday, the group released a video of their next impressive showcase: interpretations of sounds from iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxN6cO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1cMdXs6wG0"&gt;The video&lt;/a&gt; is a little over a minute long, and I recommend watching the whole thing, which you can do at the top of this post. They cover a lot of ringtones, including the familiar &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8rew3w8AbA"&gt;“Opening” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;, the classic &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTcXZqIZxbA"&gt;“Marimba” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;, and even the twangy &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/03YxoOwKxn0"&gt;“Strum” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;. (I should warn you that they also re-create the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48qVYSDur-k"&gt;blaring “Alarm” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;, so be prepared to experience that brief moment of terror.) They even tackle some system noises, including the sounds of text messages being sent and received...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft suspends donations for politicians who attempted to overturn the 2020 election</title>

  &lt;p id="vxQD4m"&gt;Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/02/05/changes-to-political-giving/"&gt;announced that it will suspend all donations&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming 2022 election cycle for any members of Congress, state officials, and organizations that voted to object to the certification of electors in the 2020 election or supported attempting to overturn the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNMp1R"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225096/facebook-pause-freeze-political-spending-microsoft"&gt;temporarily suspended&lt;/a&gt; all political contributions after the January 6th attack on the Capitol, with Microsoft taking the time to decide “whether to suspend further donations to individuals who voted against certification of the Electoral College.” Today’s announcement makes that decision a permanent one for the coming election cycle, but only for politicians who attempted to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.

    <title>Three countries are due to reach Mars in the next two weeks</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A fleet of spacecraft from three countries will reach Mars in February.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rsxeiv"&gt;A small fleet of spacecraft from the United Arab Emirates, China, and the United States will reach Mars this month after launching from Earth last year. The march to the Red Planet marks a marathon of firsts: it’s the UAE’s first foray into deep space, China’s first independent attempt to land on Mars, and NASA’s first shot at deploying a Martian helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sF0B1O"&gt;The rare convoy of Mars-bound spacecraft launched off Earth in a slim, roughly two-month window last summer when Earth and Mars lined up just right in their orbits around the Sun. This planetary alignment only happens once every two years, and three countries took advantage of it in 2020, just as outer space reemerged as a playground for scientific discovery and displays of national...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install Apple’s watchOS 7 and iOS 14 betas so you can unlock your phone with your watch</title>

If you really want this feature right now, you’ll have to download the latest iOS and watchOS betas — something that does come with at least a little risk, as it’s unfinished software. There are bugs, and features might change between updates. There have been reports in the past of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/81275"&gt;watches being bricked by betas&lt;/a&gt; (though I didn’t find any for this release). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeASH7"&gt;With all that said, I’ve been using the betas since they came out, and I haven’t noticed anything acting particularly buggy. So if you’re willing to throw caution to the wind to get access to the new Apple Watch unlock feature,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood has stopped limiting GameStop shares</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s39ore"&gt;Robinhood has finally lifted all the restrictions on WallStreetBets-fueled stocks like GameStop and AMC, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-idUSKBN2A51QV?taid=601d5c573cb4af0001e7e97c&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;report on Friday from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company currently lists no limits on its support document entitled “Changes due to ongoing market volatility,” whereas last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;there were 50-plus companies included on the list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObFw8p"&gt;Robinhood’s decision to restrict buying certain stocks caused a firestorm of controversy, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;harsh condemnations from major public figures and politicians&lt;/a&gt; and the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;being review-bombed&lt;/a&gt; on both Android and iOS. For its part, Robinhood said it wasn’t shutting trades down on a matter of principle or due to any shady deals with hedge funds, &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week"&gt;but because it simply didn’t have enough cash&lt;/a&gt; to meet its...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5uNgPx"&gt;We already knew &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21429389/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-xbox-one-ps4-announcement-ubisoft"&gt;a remake for &lt;em&gt;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was in the works, and it was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/8/22163944/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-date-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;supposed to come out next month&lt;/a&gt;. But if you are waiting to play this long-awaited remake, you will have to wait a little while longer as the game has been delayed indefinitely, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/princeofpersia/status/1357735744463278083"&gt;Ubisoft announced on Twitter today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOlYtT"&gt;Ubisoft Pune, the India-based studio tasked with remaking one of the most popular entries in the series, said the reason for delaying the game again was to ensure it receives extra development time that will allow the team to “deliver a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original.” &lt;/p&gt;
