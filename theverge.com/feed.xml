    <title>Apple Music is adding more DJ mixes with new features powered by Shazam</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="quFQc3"&gt;Last year Apple showed how it could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444506/apple-ios-14-2-beta-shazam-identify-music-phone-apps-headphones"&gt;embed Shazam’s music identification features even more deeply within iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s taking things another step forward within Apple Music. Apple Music initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11235428/apple-music-stream-remixes-dj-mixes-dubset"&gt;introduced DJ mixes and mash-ups in 2016 through a partnership with Dubset Media Holdings&lt;/a&gt; to identify and pay for licensed music within mixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uj1TvW"&gt;Now Apple says that by building upon the Shazam tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896350/apple-shazam-app-acquisition-complete-free"&gt;acquired in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and partnering with various labels, Apple Music has the tools to identify and compensate individual creators, event promoters, labels, etc. It also allows subscribers to see the names of individual tracks, skip songs within the mix, listen with lossless audio on “most mixes,” and save them to their library for viewing offline. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple won’t let Epic bring Fortnite back to South Korea’s App Store</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLYuio"&gt;Apple says it won’t let Epic Games back in the App Store until they agree to “play by the same rules as everyone else.” Earlier today &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665826/epic-games-apple-reinstate-fortnite-ios-korea-app-store-payment"&gt;Epic asked Apple&lt;/a&gt; to reinstate its developer account so that it could re-release the iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in South Korea, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; forcing Apple and Google to allow alternate in-app payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BVTLT"&gt;Apple, however, maintains it’s under no obligation to let Epic in the App Store at all. “As we’ve said all along, we would welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else,” an Apple spokesperson says in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Epic has admitted to breach of contract and as of now, there’s no legitimate basis for the reinstatement of their...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vivo finally adopts wireless charging with new X70 Pro Plus flagship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1f8OIT"&gt;Vivo has announced the X70 series, its latest line of flagship phones. It sees the company further extend its camera partnership with renowned lens company Zeiss while refining the blueprint laid down by the X50 and X60 phones from the past year-plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfwdW3"&gt;The X70 Pro Plus is the top-of-the-line device, featuring a Snapdragon 888 Plus processor, a 6.783-inch (yes that’s the stated spec) 1440p OLED screen, and a 4,500mAh battery that uses Vivo’s 55W FlashCharge technology. More importantly, it has 50W wireless fast charging that also works with Qi. This is Vivo’s first ever phone to support wireless charging, which should make it a more viable switching option for anyone who’s already put Qi chargers all over their house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9QWaP"&gt;The X70 Pro Plus’...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xfqpAL"&gt;Apple has fired senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly violating the company’s rules against leaking confidential information. For months, Gjøvik has been tweeting openly about allegations of harassment, surveillance, and workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fO2x3"&gt;“When I began raising workplace safety concerns in March, and nearly immediately faced retaliation and intimidation, I started preparing myself for something exactly like this to happen,” she says. “I’m disappointed that a company I have loved since I was a little girl would treat their employees this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0K58X"&gt;Gjøvik has raised concerns that her office is in an Apple building located on a superfund site, meaning it requires special oversight due to historical waste contamination....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vape receipts help DOJ nab man who allegedly botnetted thousands of passwords</title>

  &lt;p id="YEfHY3"&gt;28-year-old Ukrainian national Glib Oleksandr Ivanov-Tolpintsev has been &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/pr/ukrainian-cyber-criminal-extradited-decrypting-credentials-thousands-computers-across"&gt;indicted by the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly using a botnet to brute force people’s passwords, and then selling the credentials on a dark web store ominously called The Marketplace. According to the DOJ, Ivanov-Tolpintsev bragged that he was able to get at least 2,000 logins a week, and he allegedly told one of The Marketplace’s admins that he had cracked over 20,000 passwords. The DOJ’s description of the alleged methods and victims serve as a reminder of how much stolen information is out there, and the importance of implementing basic security principles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="oFeu31"&gt;Google’s Stadia cloud gaming service appears to have lost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334101/jade-raymond-haven-game-studio-playstation"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; top video game industry veteran — kind of. Jack Buser, Stadia’s Director for Games and a former PlayStation exec, is moving to the company’s Google Cloud division to head up “Gaming Solutions,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-cloud-zeroes-in-on-gaming-taps-stadia-exec-jack-buser-to-lead-the-way/"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w79TN2"&gt;Google confirms Buser is leaving the Stadia group for Google Cloud, providing this statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rqS3dp"&gt;Gaming is an incredibly important vertical at Google and we’re seeing huge momentum across all products and services. Jack’s new role will allow us to better bring customers the best of Google across our Cloud services, Stadia, YouTube, and more.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cb2VMR"&gt;Twitter is beginning to roll out labels for automated accounts (or bot accounts), the company announced Thursday. “Examples of automated accounts you might see on Twitter include bots that help you find vaccine appointments and disaster early warning systems,” &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/automated-account-labels"&gt;Twitter said in an FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. “When these accounts let you know they’re automated, you get a better understanding of their purpose when you’re interacting with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLqckn"&gt;Initially, in what Twitter is calling a test, a small number of developers will be invited to be able to apply the labels to their accounts. For accounts in the test that have activated the labels, an “Automated” label will appear on profile pages and on tweets themselves for accounts. Twitter says all developers will be...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Refusing to wear a mask on an airplane could now cost you up to $3,000 in fines</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRMsvv"&gt;Refusing to wear a mask on an airplane is about to get really expensive. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced that it was doubling civil penalties for those who refuse to comply with federal mask mandates on commercial airlines, at airports, or on certain forms of public transportation like passenger rail or intercity buses. Repeat offenders could now face fines of up to $3,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8c1Mn8"&gt;First time offenders will be fined $500-$1,000, up from the previous amount of $250. Second offenders will be fined $1,000-$3,000. The new TSA penalties, which are separate from the fines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration for unsafe behavior, will take effect September 10th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G9oPOE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Wearing a mask protects the traveling public”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lUNMU9"&gt;“...&lt;/p&gt;
