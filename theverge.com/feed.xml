    <title>USPS unveils next-generation mail truck with electric drivetrain option</title>

  &lt;p id="Otto1P"&gt;The United States Postal Service (USPS) &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-postal-service-awards-contract-to-launch-multi-billion-dollar-modernization-of-postal-delivery-vehicle-fleet-301233896.html"&gt;has revealed&lt;/a&gt; its new mail truck after a years-long competition. The new truck will be built by Wisconsin-based defense contractor Oshkosh and can be fitted with both gasoline and electric drivetrains. But it won’t hit the road until 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AazfM0"&gt;Oshkosh winning the contract is a potentially major blow to commercial electric vehicle startup Workhorse, which was one of the three remaining bidders. The company’s stock price plummeted following the announcement, and trading was halted multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjbnuN"&gt;The USPS has been looking to replace its existing mail trucks for years now, and it started taking solicitations for new designs back in 2015. The need for new trucks is urgent. The ones currently on the road are...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Enkdac"&gt;Since the episode was released, the track has exploded in popularity to the point that Disney seems to have noticed by dropping the official soundtrack on services like Spotify and Apple Music a few days ahead of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/loudmouthjulia/status/1364329004573016067"&gt;planned release&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, February 26th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LinkedIn is back up after an outage</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gZ6ecW"&gt;LinkedIn is back up after a worldwide outage affecting users on both mobile and desktop. The Microsoft-owned social network first started experiencing issues around 2PM ET, and LinkedIn confirmed things were back to normal at 4:21PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djJPYL"&gt;The company didn’t give a specific reason for the outage, though did &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LinkedIn/status/1364324499383062529"&gt;jokingly suggest&lt;/a&gt; the issues may have been due to a &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFhyA6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pardon the interruption everyone. We're back on track now. Unconfirmed reports indicate it might have been Agatha all along.  &lt;/p&gt;— LinkedIn (@LinkedIn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LinkedIn/status/1364324499383062529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="044dPn"&gt;It’s rare for LinkedIn to experience outages. LinkedIn last experienced widespread issues in January last year, when users weren’t able to post to the service or make new connections. Today’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square goes even bigger on bitcoin with a new $170 million investment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PFcd3LQW2nk9OTv8ok8LwSSZMjM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864110/jbareham_180313_1777__bitcoin_cryptocurrency_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NjrdYk"&gt;Square has just made another colossal investment in bitcoin, more than tripling its last investment in the cryptocurrency with a $170 million purchase of tokens. The digital payments company, which is run by vocal bitcoin advocate and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, disclosed the investment in its &lt;a href="https://investors.squareup.com/news/news-details/2021/Square-Inc.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx"&gt;quarterly earnings report on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYhadu"&gt;The company purchased about 3,318 bitcoins at an average price of $51,236, which signals remarkable confidence in bitcoin as it reaches record heights and invites renewed skepticism about its stability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCq6AP"&gt;“Aligned with the company’s purpose, Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment, providing a way for individuals to participate in a global monetary system and secure their own...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung now lets you return a new Galaxy Z Fold 2 or Z Flip foldable after 100 days</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUiqDAVQreHNadozWuHKui33ck4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68863967/vpavic_200907_4181_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gtd5Xt"&gt;Samsung is extending the return period for its newest foldable phones to 100 days, the company announced on Tuesday. That means buyers of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G and Z Flip 5G can purchase either device, use it for more than three months, and return it for a full refund. Samsung is calling this new program “Buy and Try,” and it’s the first time the company has launched a return initiative as generous as this for its mobile phones. The prior return window was 15 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJTHTD"&gt;“This new initiative will help consumers try and see if a foldable device is right for them, as part of Samsung’s commitment to making foldable devices more accessible for everyone,” a Samsung spokesperson said in a statement. Samsung says the program is launching today for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s Michael Bolton singing about payment for order flow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Michael Bolton’s Symphony Sessions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fL-JMgBusLmudW68HTsa31GxDfY=/0x0:2776x1851/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68863323/1186708925.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Bobby Bank/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i6S0ju"&gt;You know, when I think about the stock market, I don’t really think about Michael Bolton. But I guess Public — which refers to itself as “the investing social network” — was envious that Robinhood was getting all the press attention, so it hired Bolton to revamp his 1989 hit “How Am I Supposed to Live Without You.” The new version is a lament about payment for order flow, which was recently the subject of Reddit outrage and a point of inquiry in a House hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f364CJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Make no mistake, Public is taking aim at Robinhood&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cGOa34"&gt;Bolton is absolutely solemn in the beginning — almost to the point of convincing me that this is a hostage proof-of-life video. But his voice is as lovely as ever as he launches into song. It’s not the first time he’s lampooned...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>The thylacine remains extinct, but we still have pademelons</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c3dCbH"&gt;There was some excitement online yesterday as word spread that a family of thylacines was potentially caught on camera. The thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger, was declared extinct decades ago, so a confirmed sighting would certainly be cause for celebration. Unfortunately, wildlife biologist Nick Mooney at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG) reviewed the photos and determined “the animals are very unlikely to be thylacines, and are most likely Tasmanian pademelons,” according to a spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVrlSo"&gt;This isn’t the first time a possible thylacine has turned out to be a pademelon or &lt;a href="https://www.earthtouchnews.com/wtf/wtf/has-a-living-thylacine-finally-been-spotted-probably-not/"&gt;a mangy fox&lt;/a&gt;. While there have been &lt;a href="https://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/Documents/RTI%20025%20-%202019-20.pdf"&gt;reported sightings&lt;/a&gt; of thylacines, none have been confirmed since 1936. According to TMAG, the museum...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report about the struggles of Dying Light 2 developer Techland</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Techland&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4kWzOv"&gt;In 2018, game development studio Techland &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/10/17446380/dying-light-2-e3-2018"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be developing a sequel to its survival horror hit &lt;em&gt;Dying Light&lt;/em&gt;. The game was previously slated to release in the spring of last year, but it would go on to be &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/20/21073985/dying-light-2-delay-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;delayed indefinitely&lt;/a&gt;, with no clear release date or launch window yet announced as of January 2020. With the silence surrounding &lt;em&gt;Dying Light 2&lt;/em&gt; for over a year now, a pressing question is what might be causing the game to endure such a troubled development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyfY7t"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/techland-report-bleeding-talent-autocratic-management-bad-feedback/"&gt;recent report by &lt;em&gt;TheGamer&lt;/em&gt;’s editor-in-chief Kirk McKeand&lt;/a&gt; gives us some long-awaited answers, detailing the struggling state of the studio’s work environment and shining a light on many issues likely impacting the development of the &lt;em&gt;Dying Light &lt;/em&gt;sequel. The report...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s MagSafe-compatible battery pack will stick to your iPhone on March 3rd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="On60Zk"&gt;Anker has released a new MagSafe-compatible battery pack that can attach directly to your iPhone to offer charging without the need for a cable, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/23/anker-magsafe-compatible-iphone-12-battery/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The Anker PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless Power Bank will launch on March 3rd for $39.99, beating Apple’s own rumored MagSafe battery product to market — with one big caveat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJlmtf"&gt;The PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless Power Bank sports a 5,000mAh battery and Anker’s usual power bank design, including an LED indicator light to let you know how much power is left in the device. The device also features USB-C output for charging with a cable as well. An extra 5,000mAh is a meaningful boost, especially for the smaller iPhone 12 mini, but it’s limited by the device’s lack of MagSafe...&lt;/p&gt;
