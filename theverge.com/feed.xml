    <title>Chipotle hides the assembly line, testing new online-order-only ‘Digital Kitchen’</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chipotle’s Digital Kitchen for Pickup &amp;amp; Delivery kind of looks like a regular Chipotle&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Chipotle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzjKNI"&gt;Chipotle &lt;a href="https://ir.chipotle.com/2021-12-16-CHIPOTLE-TO-OPEN-FIRST-CHIPOTLANE-DIGITAL-KITCHEN#assets_all"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s opening a new “Digital Kitchen” restaurant this month in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio (about 40 miles south of Cleveland) — which will exclusively accept online orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="1rfLlw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hungry customers should avoid knocking on that pickup window expecting to have their order taken&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n539OS"&gt;The prototype location will offer its pickup-only drive-thru “Chipotlane,” some outdoor seats and tables for eating (no dining room), and a walk-up window. Hungry customers should avoid knocking on that pickup window expecting to have their order taken. Instead, order online or on the Chipotle app and then check back at the window or roll up to the drive-thru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Verizon tries to defend collecting browsing data on its network</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPknxr"&gt;Verizon has sent an email to customers to let them know they’re getting opted in to its Custom Experience data collection scheme after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22818783/verizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history"&gt;reports came out&lt;/a&gt; about it being turned on by default for some users. If you (understandably) trashed the email without reading it, the TL;DR is that Verizon’s program collects data about your apps and web browsing activity to help “provide you more personalized experiences with Verizon.” But of course, Verizon says, you have a choice — you can turn it off anytime because your privacy is important to it (though not important enough to make the program opt-in instead of opt-out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6pi66"&gt;Custom Experience is a sort of spin-off / successor / rebrand of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/2/16085062/verizon-up-rewards-program-track-browsing-history-data-select-oath"&gt;Verizon Selects&lt;/a&gt;, which people were enrolled into when they used...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;TikTok says it has not found any videos threatening school violence on December 17th | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rx8qKK"&gt;TikTok said Friday that it’s working to remove “alarmist warnings” about a supposed day of school violence that was rumored to take place on Friday, December 17th. A supposed threat of a nationwide day of violence at schools across the country, that allegedly started as a TikTok challenge, prompted some districts to cancel classes Friday even as law enforcement mostly determined that the threats were not credible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3sRcME"&gt;TikTok said on Twitter that the warnings &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/helping-our-community-stay-safe-while-having-fun-on-tiktok"&gt;violated its misinformation policy&lt;/a&gt;, which prohibits the spread of hoaxes or warnings about hoaxes that treat them as real. After searching “exhaustively,” Tiktok said it had not found content on its platform promoting violence at US schools on Friday, despite the widespread but...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tencent is acquiring Back 4 Blood developer Turtle Rock Studios</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tencent is acquiring Turtle Rock Studios.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Turtle Rock Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="96iHTI"&gt;Tencent is adding to its already large roster of video game studios by &lt;a href="https://turtlerockstudios.com/news/trsandtencent"&gt;acquiring Slamfire&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; developer Turtle Rock Studios. Turtle Rock will be “retaining its independent operations” in California and the current leadership team will still run the studio, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211217005008/en/"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxbR6D"&gt;Tencent is behind some of the biggest games on the planet. It owns the studio behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/17/10410952/riot-games-league-of-legends-acquired-tencent"&gt;the hugely popular MOBA &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; the developer of the mobile hits &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings, and Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;; and has a 40 percent stake &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/21/4131702/tencents-epic-games-stock-acquisition"&gt;in Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, the developer of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and Unreal Engine. And the company has made many significant investments just this year, including acquiring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583186/tencent-sumo-digital-buyout-announced-price-acquisition"&gt;British game studio Sumo&lt;/a&gt;, buying...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s large 70-inch MQ7 TV is $350 off at Best Buy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZgvUID"&gt;The Christmas holiday is just one week away. I repeat: seven days from now is Christmas Eve. Let that sink in for a moment, but don’t panic just yet. There is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22833986/ups-usps-fedex-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target-shipping-deadlines-2021"&gt;still time to get gifts in time for the holidays&lt;/a&gt; before we reach cutoff times for shipments, though we’re getting a little tight on time. Just because you’re cutting it close doesn’t mean you have to overspend. Today, we have a bunch of great deals at a variety of price points — many of which can make exceptional gifts for a friend, family member, or yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JL2VfT"&gt;Starting off, Vizio’s midrange 70-inch MQ7 4K LED TV (M70Q7-J03) with voice controls and HDR is just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgd341IQaDG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$749.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a $350 discount on quite a large TV. You may ask, “How can I gift a 70-inch TV to just one...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clockwork Aquario brings a long-lost arcade game back to life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NHu4gwp39Xin4W0HHa-4TBoc2Ek=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286522/CWA_Screenshot_3.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bu4Viz"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Clockwork Aquario&lt;/em&gt; had come out in the early ’90s, it would have cost me &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of quarters. It’s the kind of arcade game that lures you in: big sprites, bright colors, inventive worlds, a bubbly soundtrack. You see it, and you want to play it. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to experience it in an arcade because it was never actually released. But a few decades later, it’s finally available in a new format — you can now play it on both the PS4 and Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IavSuV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clockwork Aquario&lt;/em&gt; was initially a victim of the game industry’s shift to 3D games. Development started in 1992 at Westone Bit Entertainment, a now-defunct studio best-known for the &lt;em&gt;Wonder Boy&lt;/em&gt; series. The game was completed after two years, but by that time, arcades had...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>H&amp;R Block is suing Block, formerly Square, over its new name</title>

  &lt;p id="ejWGQN"&gt;Tax preparation service H&amp;amp;R Block &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrblock.com%2Ftax-center%2Fnewsroom%2Faround-block%2Fabout-us%2Ftrademark-infringement-lawsuit%2F%3Fcid%3Dsf252192484%26amp%3Bsf252192484%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F17%2F22841182%2Fsquare-block-hr-block-trademark-lawsuit-jack-dorsey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Block, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.) for trademark infringement on Thursday, CNBC &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/16/hr-block-sues-over-squares-new-name-block.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIYMvH"&gt;“Today’s filing is an important effort to prevent consumer confusion and ensure a competitor cannot leverage the reputation and trust we built over more than six decades,”  said H&amp;amp;R Block president and CEO Jeff Jones in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1JB7q"&gt;H&amp;amp;R Block claims that Square’s new name competes directly with Block in several areas of financial services, including a recently purchased tax service named &lt;a href="https://cash.app/taxes"&gt;Cash App Taxes&lt;/a&gt; — previously Credit Karma Tax — a $0 tax filing service similar to H&amp;amp;R Block. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RaRYTM"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories. On the final Vergecast of 2021, Nilay and Dieter invite &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Alex Cranz and senior space reporter Loren Grush to the show to cover the last bits of news before the holiday break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cDmYt"&gt;Next week on Christmas Eve, we will see the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722559/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-arrives-kourou-french-guiana-launch"&gt;James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; — successor to NASA’s famed Hubble telescope — finally launch into space. Loren explains what the JWST will be used for, how the telescope will launch, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663027/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date"&gt;the complications with its launch&lt;/a&gt; along the way. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="oOWJzZ"&gt;The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) is looking into how Google treats its Black female employees, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/exclusive-california-probes-googles-treatment-black-female-workers-2021-12-17/"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report says that the regulator has been asking employees questions about harassment and discrimination, after receiving formal complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJ3Fub"&gt;The report doesn’t make any mention of the DFEH bringing charges against Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;as it did with Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; and says that the interviews being conducted don’t necessarily mean that Google could face charges.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horseshoe crabs are in danger because everyone wants their blood </title>
