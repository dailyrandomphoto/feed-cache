    <title>Here are the devices that can run iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Monterey, and watchOS 8</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll get some fancy, new features, if you have the right devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YGREFX"&gt;Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; software at WWDC 2021. The public beta period will begin in July, and whether you’re curious to download them then, or just waiting for the final release, you’ll need to have the right hardware to do it. Apple usually eliminates support for a few devices each year as it leaps ahead with major software releases, so you’ll want to check below to see if your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or computer makes the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oph3LR"&gt;For iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, Apple is extending support for all iPhone models that currently have iOS 14, along with the seventh-generation iPod Touch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MoviePass settles with FTC over fraud and data security failures</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="MoviePass App As Company Makes It Harder To See Movies" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkVFQQsoGvAfoQyXJUdr5SfSbgo=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418846/1018277694.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpSucC"&gt;On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission charged the executives of the long-defunct MoviePass app over allegations that they fraudulently blocked customers from using the service as advertised while failing to protect their data privacy. The FTC also announced that it had reached a settlement with MoviePass and its executives as a result of the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyql0H"&gt;Under the proposed settlement, MoviePass, its parent company Helios and Matheson Analytics, its CEO Mitch Lowe, and chairman Ted Farnsworth are forbidden from falsely representing their business and data security practices to customers. Any businesses controlled by these entities are also required to roll out comprehensive information security programs to protect consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="viUgh4"&gt;Apple just wrapped up its WWDC 2021 keynote, and it was jam-packed with news and announcements, including our first looks at iOS 15, the new macOS Monterey, big improvements to FaceTime, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vamod1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22465927/apple-wwdc-keynote-2021-live-blog-updates-news"&gt;Our live blog&lt;/a&gt; has moment-by-moment commentary on what Apple announced from Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn.

&lt;p id="h4SY4o"&gt;Apple announced iOS 15, which brings improvements to FaceTime such as spatial audio, a new “SharePlay” feature that lets you share media with people on FaceTime virtually, updates to Messages, a new look for notifications, the ability to set different...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple introduces Siri for third-party devices</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfREqO"&gt;Siri is finally coming to third-party devices. Apple announced at its WWDC keynote that HomeKit accessory makers will be able to integrate Siri voice control into their products starting later this year. The voice assistant will be routed through a HomePod if the devices are connected to your network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EfaW1"&gt;Apple hasn’t released a comprehensive list of devices and brands that will support Siri. The company demoed it on an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%2Fecobee-smart-thermostat-apple-siri%2F%3Futm_source%3Dorganic_twitter%26utm_medium%3Dorganicsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartthermostat_siri_announcement&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22523045%2Fapple-wwdc-siri-third-party-devices-ecobee-watch-tvos-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ecobee&lt;/a&gt; thermostat during its WWDC keynote presentation.

    <title>Apple lets users see family members’ Health data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e5CY5t2zUbaXFVslJ_h3STUGkC0=/5x256:806x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418399/image__3_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PvtRRE"&gt;Apple will let people share the data from their Health app with family members or others, the company announced. It’s one of a new slate of health features for iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPLlL9"&gt;With permission, someone can share access to their overall heart rate and movement data. They’ll also be able to share access to alerts, which will ping authorized users when the feature notices things like a high heart rate or change in mobility. The person they’re sharing the data with can message them directly about any changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMdbCC"&gt;“Many people around the world are caring for someone, and we want to provide a secure and private way for users to have a trusted partner on their health journey,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-personal-health-by-introducing-secure-sharing-and-new-insights%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22522872%2Fhealth-app-family-mobility-fall-risk-wwdc-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS Monterey lets you run Shortcuts and share input and files between Macs and iPads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cSXpW2"&gt;Apple has announced the next version of macOS at its WWDC keynote, after showing off iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8Ih2W"&gt;The company is promising even more interoperability with iOS, including the ability to share a keyboard and mouse between a Mac and an iPad. The feature is similar to the one found on Logitech keyboards and mice, letting you seemingly move your cursor and files between a Mac and iPad. Macs are also getting the ability to act as an AirPlay target, allowing you to use your Mac’s screen and sound to play content from your iPhone and iPad (or even other Macs if you’re feeling spicy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shoSvl"&gt;Apple has also announced that Macs would be getting its Shortcuts automation application.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lnGUo5"&gt;Apple has just announced watchOS 8, the latest version of the company’s smartwatch platform for the Apple Watch. The new software succeeds last year’s watchOS 7 and is going to be first available for developers to test their apps with starting today, with a public beta coming in July. A final public release is expected later this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBSX64"&gt;Apple is debuting a new Mindfulness app, an extension of the Breathe app that nags you to breathe throughout the day. It’s adding new animations and other features to help you relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLsMth"&gt;The Fitness app is getting more workout types for tai chi and pilates. The Apple Watch’s Health app will explicitly track your respiratory rate while sleeping and notify you if it’s outside of your normal patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Apple adds welcome privacy features to Mail, Safari</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6NgMr4"&gt;Apple has always stressed user privacy as part of its core mission. At its WWDC 2021 event, it announced it would be adding a spate of powerful new functions to Mail and Safari, as well as giving users broader insight into what their installed apps are doing with their information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eY8N9Y"&gt;First, Apple’s Mail appears to have declared war on tracking pixels, which can be included in some emails to give third parties insight into if or when their messages were opened — though it didn’t provide much detail on how it will win said war. According to Apple’s manager of user privacy software Katie Skinner, Mail will also now hide user IP addresses by default. Safari, likewise, will hide IPs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjyDso"&gt;More surprisingly, Apple announced it’s adding an App...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iCloud Plus bundles a VPN, private email, and HomeKit camera storage</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WuFNaz"&gt;Apple is amping up iCloud with a new set of features called iCloud Plus. The cloud storage service will now come with access to a VPN, burner email addresses, and unlimited storage for HomeKit-enabled home security cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ng1oBX"&gt;The VPN, called Private Relay, will route your internet traffic through two relays in order to mask who’s browsing and where that data is coming from. The burner email feature, called Hide My Email, lets you create single-use email addresses that will forward to your actual account; that way, you can provide a junk email to a service you don’t trust in case it starts spamming you. Apple already offers a similar feature through Sign In With Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOfF98"&gt;Apple will also include unlimited storage for video from HomeKit-enabled...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="t9Cvuf"&gt;Apple’s digital assistant Siri will process audio on-device by default in iOS 15, meaning you will be able to use the feature without an active internet connection. Apple says the upgrade will also make Siri faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6WPQc"&gt;Processing audio on-device will make using Siri more private, says Apple. This follows the company’s well-established preference for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/13/16300464/apple-iphone-x-ai-neural-engine"&gt;implementing machine learning features on-device&lt;/a&gt;, rather than sending data away to the cloud to be processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0a4j3"&gt;“This addresses one of the biggest privacy concerns for voice assistants, which is unwanted audio recording,” said Apple in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22522993%2Fapple-siri-on-device-speech-recognition-no-internet-wwdc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vFORhs"&gt;Obviously, if you don’t have an internet connection, then you won’t be able to carry out certain Siri functions like &lt;em&gt;searching...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
