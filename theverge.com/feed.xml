    <title>After a wild week of stocks, you can’t stream most of the biggest Wall Street films</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="wolf of wall street" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5DzEn663R0o6_rCz7dJ-zEHlioQ=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68745094/wolfofwallstreet7_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JXkCY7"&gt;It has been a wild week for the stock market, with amateur traders from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets subreddit&lt;/a&gt; battling traditional investors. The past several days have been full of massive swings in stocks like GameStop and AMC and app-fueled drama that’s sparked a larger debate over the nature of Wall Street as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VgOhhO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6CwwXn"&gt;But if you were hoping to kick back this weekend, relax, and enjoy a classic business movie about shark-like investors and over-confident Wall Street executives, you’re probably out of luck. Nearly every major finance film isn’t available to stream right now in the US (at least, not at the time of publication of this article), thanks to the capricious nature of the streaming marketplace, the increasingly fragmented...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp is using Status messages—its version of Stories— to try to reassure users about privacy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9i6u0dKqiQO_O6JEQO2njq358o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744939/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WbyrdH"&gt;Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp has started posting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/3/15537000/whatsapp-stories-status-users-175-million"&gt;Status&lt;/a&gt; messages to users about its “commitment to your privacy.” The in-app messages were appearing for members of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff in the US and UK on Saturday, and some users reported the Status messages — WhatsApp’s version of Snapchat Stories or Twitter Fleets—have been appearing in India for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrCXp0"&gt;“There’s been a lot of misinformation and confusion around our recent update and we want to help everyone understand the facts behind how WhatsApp protects people’s privacy and security,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Going forward, we’re going to provide updates to people in the Status tab so people hear from WhatsApp directly. Our first update...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chromebooks just had their best year ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chromebook 14" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVob3n7NLqhdsrzDUOeGtfxMWLI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744613/acerwm2_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7gi0GK"&gt;According to analysts, Chromebooks had an incredible 2020, with the last quarter being the strongest ever for Google’s laptops (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/29/chromebook-covid-19-demand-market-growth/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to research firms Gartner and Canalys, over 30 million of the devices shipped last year, with somewhere between 11 and 11.7 million shipping in Q4 alone. Canalys says &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/tablets-chromebooks-q4-2020"&gt;that’s a staggering 287 percent&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; than were shipped in Q4 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bh5wt8"&gt;The firms disagree on how much growth this is when compared to 2019, but both estimate that it’s a lot: Gartner estimates that Chromebooks are up 80 percent, while Canalys says it’s 109 percent. For comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;PC sales were up by 11 percent this year&lt;/a&gt;, which is the biggest growth the category had seen in a decade. This isn’t to give the impression that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Subscribers of Apple TV Plus will continue to get credit refunds until June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tqsWxjsHFChML6wk9CwJdtIgMlY=/128x0:1505x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744478/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RUJvIq"&gt;Apple has notified subscribers of its Apple TV Plus streaming service that they’ll continue to get refund credits on their accounts until June, following a second extension of its free trial program earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/30/apple-tv-subscribers-will-continue-receiving-credit-refunds-until-june"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9 to 5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl2Iwp"&gt;Apple extended the free year-long trials of Apple TV Plus to customers until July 2021. The trials were included with the purchase of any Apple device (an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV) and were initially set to last until November 1st, 2020. This was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508148/apple-tv-plus-free-period-extended-february-2021-streaming"&gt;the second extension&lt;/a&gt;; an earlier extension had pushed back the free trial end date to February, allowing users who started a free trial between November 2019 and June 2020 to get up to five months of additional access for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XACfxV"&gt;But before Apple issued...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A good COVID-19 vaccine is good enough </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Eastern Colorado VA Receives Shipments Of Covid-19 Vaccines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gx1IRkC0DwmKrbqVk_8wUgewcqQ=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744474/1230141900.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OS3R3M"&gt;Experts have been looking forward to seeing results from Johnson and Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine trials for months. The vaccine is a logistical dream compared to the other two authorized in the US. It’s much easier to store, and it requires only one shot instead of the two required by its competitors. The only outstanding question was how well it actually worked. On Friday, they got their answer — it works pretty well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="aATmbJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sg4vpd"&gt;In a 43,783 person trial that spanned the globe, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255968/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-single-shot-coronavirus"&gt;the vaccine was 66 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing moderate to severe COVID-19. Now, 66 percent might seem like a let down compared to the 90-plus percent efficacy from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556286/coronavirus-vaccine-effective-pfizer-fda-safety"&gt;Pfizer/BioNTech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s a matter of perspective. Before results of those vaccine trials...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Escape from GameStop stock drama with these deals</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MvrKbG"&gt;January 2021 has been full of important news, but it’s been a bit lousy when it comes to deals. Still, we’ve done our part in scouring all of the major retailers for discounts on products we care about (and we think you care about, too). There aren’t many brand-new deals to be found in this week’s dispatch, but go ahead and take a look if you haven’t been following them closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfvWLq"&gt;If you feel caught up on deals, here’s a reminder that you can hang out here to have a quiet moment from all of the ongoing GameStop and AMC stock drama. Then again, if this is the first time you’re hearing about all of that and want to hear more, check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL2p85ltIvg"&gt;my colleague Liz Lopatto’s Big Picture video that’s all about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After aborted SLS hot-fire test, NASA and Boeing will try, try again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9EUARI"&gt;NASA will make another attempt next month to test-fire its massive Space Launch System rocket after its first try was cut short, the agency said Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Sq6Mk"&gt;The rocket’s 212-foot-tall core stage will try to fire its four engines for eight minutes at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The attempt is the last milestone “Green Run” test before the behemoth rocket gets shipped to Florida for its debut launch toward the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HP0d7p"&gt;All four of the rocket’s Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-25 engines ignited together for the first time earlier this month. But what was intended to be an eight minute test only lasted a little over a minute — a much shorter runtime than what engineers needed to proceed to Florida. The SLS core has been in development...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GeForce Now comes to Chrome browsers and M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j2PY2a"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now game streaming service has launched for the Chrome web browser and M1 Macs in beta (via &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/play-nvidia-geforce-now-games-chrome-windows-macos/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), bringing resource intensive games to laptops and other devices that might not have been powerful to run them on their own. We just tested out &lt;a href="https://play.geforcenow.com/"&gt;the Chrome browser version&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac and a Windows 10 PC, and it seems to be running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcKoiP"&gt;GeForce Now already had applications for Windows 10 and Android devices, but expanded to an even wider audience with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;beta launch for Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; in August of 2020, and followed it up by beating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;Stadia to iOS devices&lt;/a&gt; with a web app workaround that lets you stream games through the Safari web browser there. &lt;/p&gt;
