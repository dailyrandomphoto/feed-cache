    <title>Anker’s new Nano II 100W USB-C charger is the smallest 100W GaN charger yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LaNOTmCNF-EbpnCbuXpRoPvAVoM=/20x0:797x518/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346779/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_1.14.13_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7hUU38"&gt;Anker has a new GaN charger that the company announced at CES 2022, the $79 Anker Nano II 100W (also known as the Anker 736 charger), which the company says is “the world’s smallest 100W gallium nitride wall charger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neTb2W"&gt;The new Nano II 100W charger offers a pair of USB-C ports and a single USB-A port, and it uses Anker’s second-generation GaN II technology that the company debuted earlier this year on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22450999/anker-second-generation-nano-ii-gan-chargers-smaller"&gt;its other Nano II chargers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1p77cc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More power in a smaller package&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S4v4Ij"&gt;It’s also worth noting that the 100W output is only for a single device at once — if more than one gadget is plugged in, the Nano II 100W will divvy up wattage according. But the 100W output here is enough to charge most laptops at full speed, which is a nice improvement over...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s new Video Bar is an all-in-one speaker, light, and webcam for your PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Anker Video Bar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ITSUZWRgTYxyX0pfjYUNXvJe1g=/0x0:900x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346773/videobar.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9MFcsV"&gt;Anker has announced the B600 Video Bar, a nifty video conferencing toolkit that houses everything that meeting-goers need. It rests upon your monitor (or TV), and the webcam portion of the Video Bar features a 2K sensor capable of 30 frames per second capture. It offers field-of-view adjustment, autofocus, and like most fancy webcams these days, it supports an AI-powered zoom feature and image enhancement. Within the device, there’s also a microphone array. It uses an AI algorithm to make noisy environments sound quiet on the other end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8WRyk"&gt;The Video Bar also packs two features that aren’t commonly included with a webcam: a key light and speakers. I’d assume that a large percentage of people who work from home don’t have ideal lighting...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s latest Nitro 5 gaming laptop continues the tradition of great value</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MlSmYm"&gt;Acer’s Nitro 5 gaming laptop lineup has become more refined and feature-packed over time, and the new versions announced at CES 2022 make it even more appealing. Like before, the Nitro 5 for 2022 comes in two sizes, 15.6 inches and 17.3 inches, and you can choose between a 1080p or a QHD display. What’s new for this year is that its chassis design ditched those angular corners and added some extra pizazz to its lid. Also of note is that you can get one with either the latest 12th-Gen Intel processors (starting with a Core i5 12700H and going up to an Core i7 12700H) or one of AMD’s Ryzen 6000-series processors (starting with the Ryzen 5 6600H, going up to the Ryzen 7 6800H). Both versions can stock up to Nvidia’s new RTX 3070 Ti graphics...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer updates its Swift X laptops, and the 16-inch model has an Intel Arc GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0XP-_HfkxDscwdpfolutuHOKMgw=/0x60:1440x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346748/Swift_X_SFX14_51G_07.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LY09iX"&gt;Acer is announcing updates to its Swift X line of ultraportable laptops at CES 2022, each sporting 12th Gen Intel Core processors and, on the 16-inch model, a discrete &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626912/intel-arc-gpu-brand-alchemist-codename-release-date"&gt;Intel Arc GPU&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHaRF5"&gt;The 2022 versions of the laptops come in two screen sizes (and both have a 16:10 aspect ratio): a 14-inch model with a 2240 x 1400 resolution and a 16-inch model with an up to 2560 x 1600 resolution. While the 16-inch version has the Intel Arc GPU, the 14-inch model is available with Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPU or integrated graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frMte1"&gt;Both models run Windows 11 and are equipped with two Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-A ports, an HDMI 2.0 port, and a fingerprint reader. And both sound like they’ll be relatively light — Acer says the 14-inch model...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="UxSPJ1"&gt;Intel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626912/intel-arc-gpu-brand-alchemist-codename-release-date"&gt;highly anticipated Arc GPUs&lt;/a&gt; have gotten a step closer to gamers’ hands: the company announced at CES 2022 that it’s already started shipping its first-generation Alchemist GPUs to OEM customers for desktop and laptop systems, including Acer, Asus, Clevo, Dell, Gigabyte, Haier, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, MSI, and NEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5UbCy"&gt;The Arc GPUs are a big deal for Intel, set to package the company’s new Xe graphics architecture into discrete laptop and desktop GPUs, marking the biggest foray yet for Intel (which is best known for its CPUs) into the graphics world. Arc GPUs promise support for high-level gaming and creative features, too, including hardware-accelerated ray tracing and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22631061/intel-arc-gpu-alchemist-xe-ss-super-sampling-ai-architecture-day-preview"&gt;XeSS, Intel’s AI-accelerated supersampling&lt;/a&gt;. In short, Arc is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mobileye and Geely team up to build a self-driving car you can buy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XkapL2"&gt;Mobileye, the autonomous vehicle company owned by Intel, and Geely, China’s largest automaker, are joining forces to develop a consumer-ready autonomous vehicle that they claim will be ready by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLQ9ao"&gt;The self-driving car, which will also be battery-electric, will be produced under Geely’s Zeekr brand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346358/geely-electric-vehicle-brand-zeekr-china"&gt;which was unveiled last year&lt;/a&gt; as the automaker’s “new electric mobility technology and solutions company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITK6cL"&gt;The new car will be equipped with Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, meaning it will handle 100 percent of the driving tasks under certain conditions, like favorable weather or within certain geographic limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI2k4G"&gt;The vehicle will operate with a number of Mobileye’s branded AV systems, including six of the company’s EyeQ5...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel updates its Evo laptop standard for better video calls and foldable laptops</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wh2a8s"&gt;Intel has announced its third-generation update for its “Intel Evo” certification program at CES 2022, adding new requirements for better video calls for future devices, expanding the certification to include larger and more powerful laptops, and new foldable designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4aUBA"&gt;The Evo branding (itself an extension of Intel’s original Project Athena program) was introduced in 2020 alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"&gt;Intel’s 11th Gen Tiger Lake chips&lt;/a&gt; as a simple and easy way for customers to know that they’d be getting a laptop that checked certain basic performance and experiential metrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7uFDp"&gt;Specifically, in addition to offering one of Intel’s 11th Gen U-series or Y-series chips, Evo-branded laptops had to get over nine hours of “real-world” battery life, wake from sleep...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ix9QmF"&gt;HP debuted its new commercial laptops at CES 2022, including its convertible Elite x360 devices, EliteBook 800 and 600 lineups, as well as its ProBook 400 G9 series laptops. Each Windows 11 laptop comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747271/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-hybrid-architecture-price-release-date-i9-12900k"&gt;Intel’s 12th Gen processor, which was just introduced&lt;/a&gt; last October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewtkbg"&gt;The HP Elite x360 1040 G9 and HP EliteBook 1040 G9 have almost the same internals; one of the main differences is that the Elite x360 is a convertible device with a touchscreen, while the latter is just your typical clamshell laptop. Each device has a 14-inch 16:10 IPS display, supports up to 2TB of storage, and comes with optional 5G connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwtsKA"&gt;While the Elite x360 supports up to 16GB of DDR5 SODIMM memory and 2TB of storage, the EliteBook 1040 G9 comes with up...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips arrive at CES 2022 for its most powerful laptops ever</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hE1ibE"&gt;Intel has announced its latest 12th Gen Alder Lake featuring the company’s new hybrid architecture at CES 2022 with its first laptop chip using the new design, led by the Core i9-12900HK, which Intel boldly claims is “the fastest mobile processor. Ever.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RHbZ8"&gt;Intel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747271/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-hybrid-architecture-price-release-date-i9-12900k"&gt;first wave of 12th Gen Alder Lake&lt;/a&gt; chips on desktop last fall were one of its biggest successes in years, allowing the company to offer a chip that could beat or compete with AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X flagship across productivity and gaming. And now, Intel is bringing that same new approach to chip design — with its Arm-esque performance and efficiency cores — to laptops, starting with its most powerful 45W H-series models of chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="M6MEGN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips usher in a new generation of x86 processors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747271/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-hybrid-architecture-price-release-date-i9-12900k"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QZt1vX"&gt;But the laptop world also has gotten a lot more...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="A76KBe"&gt;HP will release business laptops of all shapes and sizes this year, but the ones the C-suite will likely have their eyes on are members of the Elite Dragonfly line. If &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675550/hp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;its predecessors&lt;/a&gt; are anything to go by, the Elite Dragonfly G3 will be a light, powerful, beautiful, and undoubtedly expensive Windows PC. The HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, more intriguingly, will bring a Chrome OS platform to the line for the first time. That could be the premium, well-built device for which Chrome OS fans in the business sphere have been waiting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFZiFt"&gt;The HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook features a haptic trackpad (the first one we’ve seen on a Chromebook to date), a fingerprint sensor, and a Sure View Reflect privacy screen. For a better conference call...&lt;/p&gt;
