    <title>You will watch the Snyder Cut in 4:3 aspect ratio because HBO Max respects cinema</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nnbEPeTGQFT9_zzccR8pcA6E0_s=/228x0:2943x1810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986833/snyderwarning.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7MYsyZ"&gt;Lest anyone worry that &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=SnyderCut031821"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; would tarnish Zack Snyder’s auteur work &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;, for which the company &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/02/the-true-story-of-justice-league-snyder-cut"&gt;spent $70 million&lt;/a&gt; on reshoots and new digital effects in order to meet the director’s requirements and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22334362/zack-snyder-justice-league-fandom-release-cut-star-wars-twitter"&gt;satisfy years of fan demand&lt;/a&gt; for a better cut of the widely panned movie, the service is prefacing all streams of the film with a short disclosure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="815KjL"&gt;“This film is presented in a 4:3 format to preserve the integrity of Zack Snyder’s creative vision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9DaXXJ"&gt;That’s right. HBO will not artificially crop the image just to satisfy your natural demand for widescreen viewing. Nor would it tell Snyder that, hey, &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/03/zack-snyder-explains-justice-leagues-first-cow-connection.html"&gt;maybe &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;isn’t &lt;em&gt;First Cow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and doesn’t need to be presented in a tight boxy format in which it’s unclear if the entire film...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to file and pay your 2020 taxes online </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="irs (ray tsang flickr)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP0xxiL-v-HhVA274y3XwS_qa2o=/0x3:1100x736/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68687934/irs.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSUmXj"&gt;In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic took everyone, including the IRS, by surprise. Because of the issues people were dealing with last spring, the filing deadline for federal tax payments was moved from the usual mid-April date to July 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NH5z8m"&gt;This year, it looked look like we weren’t going to get the same tax vacation — until &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-day-for-individuals-extended-to-may-17-treasury-irs-extend-filing-and-payment-deadline"&gt;the IRS announced on March 17th&lt;/a&gt; that tax day has been pushed back a month. As a result, the new due date for your 2020 taxes is May 17th, 2021.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1IHJ6"&gt;Meanwhile, the IRS has also made it known that the &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-operations-during-covid-19-mission-critical-functions-continue"&gt;pandemic is slowing down some operations&lt;/a&gt;, such as processing returns filed on paper. As a result, it might not be a bad idea to start working on those taxes as soon as possible — and to submit them online. In fact, whether...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia is doubling the price of its GeForce Now cloud gaming service for new users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pd0DnHL34VOPeEmsbnagVbDH3aA=/154x0:1174x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986494/GFN.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bID7w7"&gt;Nvidia on Thursday announced a &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/03/18/geforce-now-priority/"&gt;new subscription tier for its GeForce Now cloud gaming service&lt;/a&gt; called Priority that will replace its existing paid Founders tier and contain the same perks like extended session length and RTX support. The catch: the change will come with a price increase, from what used to be a $4.99-per-month subscription to what will now be a $9.99-per-month one for new subscribers. Nvidia will also start offering a $99.99-per-year Priority subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfeFDZ"&gt;However, those who had active memberships as of yesterday, March 17th, will be eligible for the Founders pricing for life, Nvidia says, which comes out to a little less than $60 per year. The company still plans to offer a free tier of GeForce Now, too, but that tier...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s everything we know about the new OnePlus phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3I8qce"&gt;OnePlus has an upcoming event on March 23rd, where it’ll be formally announcing the OnePlus 9, and OnePlus 9 Pro. As with any smartphone event these days, there’s a ton of information about what will be revealed at the event, thanks in no small part to OnePlus itself doling out pieces of news over the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VbxpkT"&gt;Confirmed by OnePlus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WmyBTC"&gt;OnePlus has been in the habit lately of trying to build up suspense for its events, which is why you see it and its executives just tweeting out information about the phones. Here’s what we’ve learned from them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8N3qvy"&gt;Chargers? In the box&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kgVwo9"&gt;OnePlus’s CEO, Pete Lau, has confirmed on a forum post that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319657/oneplus-9-charger-in-box-pete-lau-announcement"&gt;will be including a charger in the box&lt;/a&gt; with the 9-series phones, instead of going the route that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware’s latest gaming laptops can now be configured with Cherry MX switches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_0zYZDwXDjIK0ppak_gDbITOyA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986482/cfaulkner_200826_4165_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M15 R3 is pictured here, though the switches can only be configured on the latest R4.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5lrIud"&gt;Alienware and Cherry have worked together to cram what both companies are calling the “first true” mechanical keyboard into a gaming laptop. Starting March 18th, you’ll be able to purchase Alienware’s M15 R4 or M17 R4 laptops and upgrade them to a Cherry MX mechanical keyboard for an extra $150 at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZSGfR"&gt;The laptops will house a new kind of Cherry switch called the MX Ultra Low Profile, which is 3.5mm thick (compared to the 11.9mm-sized MX Low Profile switch). The switch is built with stainless steel wings that swing open and push down — picture the way a DeLorean’s car doors open and close. (Cherry not-so-subtly teased these new switches with a picture of the famously heavy car that’s built with stainless steel). The rest of the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Shorts arrives in the US to take on TikTok, but the beta is still half-baked</title>

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three screenshots showing the interface of YouTube Shorts in beta.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRwCZZ"&gt;YouTube Shorts, the company’s short-form answer to TikTok, is launching in beta in the United States starting today. The short video format has already been available for several months in India, but today marks its debut stateside (along with the addition of several new features).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ILMCqB"&gt;For the beta launch, YouTube Shorts will feature all the basics of any TikTok clone: a multi-segment camera that makes it easy for creators to quickly string together clips, a wide selection of music tracks (with catalogs from “over 250 labels and publishers”), and a robust-looking captioning tool, the last of which is debuting alongside the US launch. “We really want to create a playground of creativity here where we give creators the raw materials to produce...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify says over 13,000 artists’ catalogs earned at least $50K in royalties last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8epCtJAbMrnabV7a9zaExY7ZORk=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986490/spotrev.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wfB3yD"&gt;Musicians aren’t thrilled with Spotify — they say the streaming platform undervalues their work and they deserve to be paid more per stream. So today, Spotify’s trying to address those concerns with &lt;a href="https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/"&gt;a new website&lt;/a&gt; called Loud &amp;amp; Clear, which offers more insight into how much the platform pays artists and how that money is distributed. The site also includes a calculator so artists can see where their work ranks on Spotify, like how a song with 100,000 all-time streams would only be in the top 2,710,000 tracks on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfzrGo"&gt;Notably, the company says it’s paid over $23 billion in royalties to rights holders, including over $5 billion in 2020, which is up from $3.3 billion in 2017. It also notes that there are 1.2 million artists with over...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where to buy AMD’s Radeon RX 6700 XT graphics card </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UwbfPEKP6O0W2W1x6P6kJ1_PeuQ=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986439/twarren_210315_4475_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zVPNQ3"&gt;AMD’s new Radeon RX 6700 XT GPU will be available to purchase today starting at 6AM PT / 9AM ET, with a retail price of $479.99. Like other GPUs released within the last few months, AMD’s latest Radeon RX graphics card will likely sell out quickly, though AMD tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to buy this graphics card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJPSYV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/3/17/22334662/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"&gt;reviewed the RX 6700 XT&lt;/a&gt; and noted in his review that the GPU is a solid performer that delivers a 1440p experience for most games, but the performance is not quite as good when compared to Nvidia's 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2iQMu"&gt;So far, only Micro Center has listings up for various iterations of AMD’s Radeon RX 6700 XT GPU. We will continue to update the list of cards and retailers selling...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WallStreetBets donates more than $350,000 to gorilla charity to prove ‘apes together strong’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Congo Battles To Save Wildlife After Years Of War And Poaching" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J6rACJbevgH9H1oRzohQ11n6_5o=/0x3:3000x2003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986413/71495571.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nj78JL"&gt;“Apes together strong” is one of the mottoes of Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community. Now, members of the financial subreddit are making good on one of their favorite memes by donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to charities supporting gorillas in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HZHVb"&gt;The most prominent recipient of the redditors’ generosity is the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, whose president and CEO Tara Stoinski describes it as “the world’s largest and longest running organization that is fully dedicated to gorilla conservation.” &lt;/p&gt;
