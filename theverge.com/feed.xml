    <title>The Pavilion Aero 13 is HP’s lightest consumer laptop ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HP Pavilion Aero 13 open on a desk. The screen displays a large wave. To the right is a cup of pencils, pens, and scissors. Above is a shelf with notebooks and a protractor." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQTqa8274Grly41vMQOz5RWJAeE=/0x298:1000x965/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517882/HP_Pavilion_Aero_13_Laptop_PC_NaturalSilver.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the HP Pavilion Aero 13.&lt;/em&gt; | HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xk5yit"&gt;HP has announced the Pavilion Aero 13, the lightest consumer laptop yet. It has a maximum weight of 2.18 pounds (0.987 kg), making it one of the most portable laptops you can buy of any type or size. It’s also powered by AMD’s Ryzen 5000 mobile processors, up to a Ryzen 7 5800U. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pl8jF0"&gt;On the outside, the Aero is available in four colors: pale rose gold, warm gold, ceramic white, and natural silver. Weight isn’t the only thing getting slimmed down, as this is the first Pavilion with a 90 percent screen-to-body ratio. The Pavilion has traditionally been HP’s budget line, with a bigger and clunkier design than the company’s pricier lines, but HP has been shrinking the bezels and chassis footprints on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276459/hps-pavilion-x360-convertible-laptops-streaming"&gt;a number of its models&lt;/a&gt; this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony acquires Returnal developer Housemarque, hints Bluepoint is next</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4SQN47"&gt;Sony has acquired Housemarque, the Finnish studio behind recent PS5 exclusive &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/29/welcoming-housemarque-to-the-playstation-studios-family/"&gt;the company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. It was announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nibellion/status/1409822833631502338?s=21"&gt;with a tweet&lt;/a&gt; which suggests Sony might also be about to acquire Bluepoint Games, the studio behind the recent &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; remaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o40aks"&gt;In a blog post announcing the acquisition, PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst said that the studio “is one with incredible vision, capable of creating memorable new games that resonate with our community.” Although Housemarque has produced games across multiple platforms including PC, iOS, and the Xbox 360, the majority of its recent titles have been exclusive to Sony’s platforms. Prior to &lt;em&gt;Returnal &lt;/em&gt;it was best known for the &lt;em&gt;Super Stardust &lt;/em&gt;games, which have appeared on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s versatile UltraSharp 4K webcam uses AI to keep you in the frame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQG3mCMs6JjEWjaENsSJ3h-o_IM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517763/dellultrasharphero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UltraSharp shown on its two included mounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qsr9Lw"&gt;Dell has launched the high-end UltraSharp webcam that costs $199.99 and is available now worldwide. Its cylindrical design is reminiscent of Apple’s old but iconic iSight external webcam, but its features are aimed to compete with Logitech’s Brio and other modern 4K-ready webcams. In addition, it aims to serve as a more affordable and easier-to-set up alternative to mounting a DSLR camera behind your monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzfRRQ"&gt;The UltraSharp is a USB-C webcam that houses a Sony STARVIS CMOS 8.3-megapixel sensor. It’s capable of recording or streaming in 4K at 30 or 24 frames per second and in 1080p or 720p at 24, 30, or 60 frames per second. You can tweak the field of view (FOV) between 65 degrees for a close crop, 78 degrees, or 90 degrees for the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing’s debut wireless earbuds will be announced on July 27</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gvv9DZU-lRuRSurGMinVg49rpEo=/151x0:1771x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517591/Global_Landscape.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4IDnYd"&gt;Tech startup Nothing will announce its debut pair of true wireless earbuds, the Nothing Ear (1), at 9AM ET on July 27th, the company’s founder &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1409829386308624388"&gt;Carl Pei announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The launch comes around a month later than the June launch window &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22428397/nothing-ear-1-true-wireless-earbuds-launch-carl-pei"&gt;Nothing previously announced&lt;/a&gt;, after Pei &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1405911656929054730"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the company was delaying the launch because it had “a few things left to finalize.” Carl Pei is best known as one of the co-founders of OnePlus, a company he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519785/oneplus-carl-pei-departure"&gt;parted ways with last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KhkhK"&gt;Details about the Nothing Ear (1) are thin, but the company has teased several details about them over the past few months. We know they’ll have a “stripped-down aesthetic” featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320915/nothing-true-wireless-earbuds-teenage-engineering-concept-1"&gt;transparent materials&lt;/a&gt; in their construction, and that they’ve been designed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298802/nothing-teenage-engineering-swedish-design-founding-partner-audio-headphones"&gt;in...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Messages will auto-delete OTPs and sort like Gmail, but only in India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/onctS4v3GwU4qQE6IDRPcAeu6Zg=/0x0:2100x1400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517507/messages_otp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OTPs can be set to delete automatically after 24 hours.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YeUvXY"&gt;Google is updating its Messages app in India to allow it to delete one-time passwords (OTPs) automatically, to stop the single-use codes from clogging up your inbox, &lt;a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/06/messages-makes-it-easier-to-help-you.html"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside it, Google also says the app will be able to sort messages into categories, keeping your personal correspondence away from notifications about bank transactions and special offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLi3vj"&gt;As someone that &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; exclusively uses WhatsApp for personal communication, my phone’s default texting app is typically a graveyard of six-digit codes, which by design become useless mere minutes after they’re received. Having the ability to automatically delete them after 24 hours should make Messages less cluttered and more usable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches new search tool to help combat food insecurity</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google is working with non-profits to aggregate 90,000 locations with free food support across all 50 states .&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bUA5vq"&gt;Google announced a new website designed to be a “one-stop shop” for people with food insecurity. The &lt;a href="http://g.co/findfoodsupport"&gt;“Find Food Support” site&lt;/a&gt; includes a food locator tool powered by Google Maps which people can use to search for their nearest food bank, food pantry, or school lunch program pickup site in their community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rGbnt"&gt;Google is working with non-profit groups like No Kid Hungry and FoodFinder, as well as the US Department of Agriculture, to aggregate 90,000 locations with free food support across all 50 states — with more locations to come. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CIJGK1"&gt;The new site is a product of Google’s newly formed &lt;a href="https://blog.x.company/a-new-home-for-project-delta-a39f8286b6d7"&gt;Food for Good team&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known as Project Delta when it was headquartered at Alphabet’s X moonshot division.

    <title>Windows 11 includes new Dynamic Refresh Rate feature to save laptop battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xHlDGHI5iDWeXov8lB6NJgCM9g=/116x0:1370x836/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517393/Windows_11_Generic_Laptop_Device_Render.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9wRVy"&gt;Microsoft is introducing a new Dynamic Refresh Rate (DRR) feature in Windows 11 that’s designed to save laptop battery life and boost refresh rates when they’re really needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3j9An"&gt;A number of laptops now ship with 120Hz and beyond displays, which make Windows feel a lot smoother across scrolling, animations, and inking. While the added smoothness feels great, running at higher refresh rates takes its toll on battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XSRSk"&gt;In Windows 10 you have to decide between 60Hz and 120Hz on a laptop, and it’s a static choice. Microsoft is now building DRR into Windows 11, which will allow a laptop to dynamically adjust its refresh rate. “This means that Windows 11 will seamlessly switch between a lower refresh rate and a higher refresh rate based on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google beefs up Play Store developer verification in response to scams</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5MaO2a"&gt;Google is working to enhance the integrity of the Play Store by adding new restrictions and safeguards to developer accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLVzyr"&gt;Google Play Store developers will soon have to verify their email address and phone number and provide extra details like a physical address in an attempt to increase security and ensure that accounts are being created by ‘real people,’ &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/play-dev-id-requirements-2-step.html"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Developers will also be required to use two-step verification. The search giant says it’s making the changes “to keep Google Play safe and secure and to better serve our developer community,” and to “make sure that every account is created by a real person with real contact details.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrGIDd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/google-to-require-2fa-and-a-physical-address-from-android-app-devs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the announcement coincides with the emergence...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikon’s Z FC is a film camera revival in mirrorless form</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2gUF5w0d2VNqtK1-vbm6_hfPqyU=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517035/Zfc_USDD_TO_6573.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
