    <title>Twitter having a partial outage Saturday morning</title>

  &lt;p id="tAkjEl"&gt;It looks like problems on Twitter that began Friday night are persisting Saturday morning. People on the east coast of the US were reporting that while the page would load, they were unable to send tweets and DMs. As of 11 AM ET Saturday, the site was still experiencing issues for many users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rG6yl0"&gt;There’s no official word on how widespread the outage is, but Twitter said Saturday it was “fixing an issue with it servers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ylVPU"&gt;Twitter Support posted a brief message Friday night that it was looking into the matter, and updated it Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BV6AwV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We know that parts of Twitter still aren’t working for some of you. We’re fixing an issue with our servers to get things back to normal soon. Thanks for sticking with us.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Peloton is fighting a recall request on its treadmill after a child died last month</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1AV52L"&gt;Peloton is resisting a request from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to recall its Tread Plus treadmill, which was &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;involved with the death of a child last month&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/16/peloton-treadmill-injuries-death-cpsc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; is reporting tonight&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the incident, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Finvesting%2Fus-consumer-agency-to-investigate-peloton-treadmill-death&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F16%2F22388707%2Fpeloton-fighting-recall-treadmill-child-death" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CPSC issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it was investigating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWjp6m"&gt;The agency is reportedly planning on issuing a consumer alert about the Tread Plus and may do so as early as Saturday, according to officials who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;Post. &lt;/em&gt;One official added that “this doesn’t happen with other treadmills.” The &lt;em&gt;Post’s&lt;/em&gt; sources tell the paper that the CPSC is aware of “‘dozens’ of incidents involving Peloton’s treadmills, some involving pets or exercise balls and many of them resulting in serious injuries.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge in Australia finds Google misled Android users about location data collection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bNd4ChOTFBb4tPlYnL2n_1bWB6U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69142463/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q2t5kR"&gt;A judge in Australia found Google misled users about personal location data the company collected via Android devices,  a violation of Australian law, the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/australia-canberra-court-decisions-courts-laws-c6a7b75ac7cbfabc6ff2bc4069e3911c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6MLDP9"&gt;According to Federal Court Judge Thomas Thawley, the violations occurred between January 2017 and December 2018. Users creating a new Google account while setting up a new Android device were led to believe that the “Location History” setting was the only Google account setting that would determine if the company collected identifiable data about the user’s location. In fact, another Google account setting that was turned on by default — the “Web &amp;amp; App Activity” setting— allowed Google to collect and store personally identifiable location information when it...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Project Zero will give a 30-day grace period before disclosing security issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fCh9NZ"&gt;Google’s Project Zero, a team of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/15/5902061/google-project-zero-security-team"&gt;dedicated security engineers&lt;/a&gt; tasked with reducing the number of “zero day” vulnerabilities around the entire internet, says it will &lt;a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/04/policy-and-disclosure-2021-edition.html"&gt;give developers an extra 30 days&lt;/a&gt; before disclosing vulnerability issues, in order to give end-users time to patch their software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qumkuq"&gt;Developers will still have 90 days to fix bugs, but Project Zero will wait another 30 days before it discloses the details of the bug publicly. If a flaw is being actively exploited in the wild, a company will have seven days to issue a patch, and a three-day grace period if requested. But Google Project Zero will wait 30 days before it discloses technical details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3m88I"&gt;In 2020, Google announced a trial to allow developers 90 days to work on patch...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Washington state lawmakers vote to phase out gasoline cars by 2030</title>

  &lt;p id="yojoZs"&gt;Washington state lawmakers have &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22450947/clean_cars_2030.pdf"&gt;passed a measure&lt;/a&gt; that would phase out the sale of gas-powered vehicles starting in 2030. The Clean Cars 2030 initiative passed Thursday as an amendment &lt;a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/1287-S2.E%20AMS%20ENGR%20S2584.E.pdf"&gt;to a bill&lt;/a&gt; that requires state utilities prepare for an electric-vehicle future. The bill now awaits Gov. Jay Inslee’s signature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G60dDl"&gt;That’s five years earlier than planned gas vehicle bans in California and Massachusetts, and the first ban on gas cars passed by legislators, rather than by an executive order. The bill passed Washington’s Senate by a vote of 25-23 and a vote of 54-43 in the House. The bill bans the sale, purchase, or registration of non-EVs from model year 2030 and later, and would include vehicles bought in another state and brought into...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Camera footage from wolf’s collar reveals a very good boy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XdBpoK"&gt;Have you ever wanted to watch a wolf hunt freshwater fish? Thanks to the Voyageurs Wolf Project from the University of Minnesota, you can see it on YouTube any time you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKdqn3"&gt;The researchers with the project trapped V089, a lone wolf, sedated him, and then strapped on the Vectronic-Aerospace camera collar. The collar recorded video in 30 second bursts during daylight hours, for a total of 7 minutes a day. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The wolf is a regular neckbeard, it turns out&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SbK97l"&gt;The footage is &lt;em&gt;very cool&lt;/em&gt;, though some of it is obscured by V089’s fur. (“The wolf’s beard needed a little trim... lesson learned,” one video caption says.) They found that V089 was clever enough to hunt near a beaver dam, going after fish that were trapped by the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Edward Snowden NFT sells for more than $5.4 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sarah Stacke / NYPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CZyzIz"&gt;Today, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden’s NFT &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/Snowden/stay-free-edward-snowden-2021-24437"&gt;sold for about $5.4 million&lt;/a&gt;, or 2,224 ETH. The NFT is of an artwork that shows an image of Snowden’s face made from pages of a US appeals court decision that ruled the mass surveillance program Snowden exposed had violated US law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZQZ7V"&gt;The image is called “Stay Free.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ovZqc"&gt;The profits won’t go to America’s most famous exiled whistleblower, however. Instead, the sale is meant to benefit the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where Snowden is the president. &lt;a href="https://freedom.press/about/board/"&gt;Its board&lt;/a&gt; includes actor John Cusack, whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, and the writer Glenn Greenwald.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood can’t handle the Dogecoin rally</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LWI7tJ"&gt;Yesterday and today, the enthusiasm for joke cryptocurrency Dogecoin overwhelmed Robinhood, leading to “sporadic crypto order failures and delayed notifications for some customers,” &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/4/16/a-new-generation-of-investors-crypto-and-robinhood"&gt;Robinhood wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yr2uD8"&gt;“These interruptions aren’t acceptable to us,” Robinhood wrote in its post. “We believe we’re the most intuitive crypto platform for Dogecoin traders and we’re proud to be a top choice for this community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3avk3"&gt;Robinhood has a history of exactly this kind of whoopsie. In March 2020, there were&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt; three huge outages&lt;/a&gt; which Robinhood has said were due to “&lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/3/3/an-update-from-robinhoods-founders"&gt;stress on our infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;.” And infamously, in January, Robinhood limited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22254656/robinhood-gamestop-stonks-trade-freeze-class-action-lawsuits"&gt;trades on GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, pissing off the entire internet and getting itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;hauled in front of Congress&lt;/a&gt; in the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You ever think about how Asus put out like 40 models of a laptop called the “Eee PC”</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="pile of netbooks" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MqkYvDCpI9jjjGTV_Mp-ThmXpes=/1x0:1020x679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69140173/pile_o_netbooks.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="1JwOdb"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;an Apple event next week&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s looking fairly likely that we’ll see updated models of the iPad Pro and perhaps the iPad Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxpS38"&gt;Which is great, because it made me think about the Eee PC, which was either one of the greatest short-lived success stories in tech history or a collective delusion shared by a handful of late 2000s tech bloggers that never actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Eee PC 701SDX. It had an SD card slot, and an X.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jw4TJi"&gt;There were two products that arrived in 2007 that fundamentally changed computing: one, of course, was the iPhone. The second, obviously more important product was the $399 Eee PC 701. It originally ran a custom Linux operating system that reviewers loved (&lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/asus-eee-pc-701"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laptop Mag&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Spoonauer said&lt;/a&gt; it...&lt;/p&gt;
