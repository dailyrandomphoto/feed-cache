    <title>JPMorgan says Tesla owes the bank $162 million</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YKoeUc"&gt;JPMorgan has sued Tesla, claiming that the electric car company owes the bank $162 million related to a 2014 stock warrant agreement. The dispute centers around adjustments the companies made to the agreement following Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 “[f]unding secured” tweet and the resulting fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XO2MqN"&gt;The lawsuit was filed late Monday &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.569891/gov.uscourts.nysd.569891.1.0.pdf"&gt;in the Southern District of New York&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and has disbanded its US press team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUbC4a"&gt;According to the suit, which was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/jpmorgan-sues-tesla-162-mln-related-warrants-2021-11-15/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, JPMorgan purchased a number of warrants from Tesla in 2014 — back when the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-28/tesla-raises-2-billion-with-convertible-debt-to-finance-factory"&gt;was still trying to fund the construction of the original Gigafactory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmXzLm"&gt;Stock warrants give the buyer (JPMorgan, in this case) a right...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>IATSE members vote to ratify contracts that include better streaming pay</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UNMnqt"&gt;A major Hollywood union has voted to ratify a pair of contracts to improve labor conditions for production workers — though narrowly — after previously voting to authorize a strike over stalled negotiations with major studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Evis"&gt;The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) &lt;a href="https://iatse.net/iatse-members-ratify-contracts-with-producers-studios-and-streaming-services/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; its members narrowly voted to ratify both the Basic Agreement and the Area Standards Agreement, three-year contracts that included provisions for things like meal times and breaks, increased base pay for the union’s lowest-paid members, and better terms for productions from streaming services. Both votes were extraordinarily close, and the vote around the Basic Agreement, in particular, is contentious.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton is suing its rivals over its on-demand classes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="View of Peloton Tread’s touchscreen with a list of classes " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QiMCP69VGzK4tBs-71UQhPsRDJ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146912/akrales_190328_3240_0103.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peloton’s on-demand classes and leaderboard are at the heart of both lawsuits.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CdlGa6"&gt;Peloton isn’t too happy with its rivals. The company has filed lawsuits against Echelon and iFit, claiming each company violated patents related to Peloton’s on-demand classes, &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/peloton-sues-ifit-echelon-over-new-patent-for-on-demand-classes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aI2w24"&gt;The issue at hand is that Peloton says Echelon and iFit are gaining “free rides” from its technology. In court documents, the company specifically pointed to its leaderboards and the ability to participate in live classes with other users. In its case against iFit, Peloton says that before it came along, iFit “only allowed subscribers to follow along with pre-recorded exercise classes on their machines, without any sort of community engagement.” It also takes issue with iFit’s ActivePulse and SmartAdjust features, which automatically adjust...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The soundtrack for Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop hits streaming platforms on November 19th</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e10FEI"&gt;The early reaction to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776962/cowboy-bebop-review-netflix"&gt;Netflix’s live-action adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22778708/cowboy-bebop-review-season-1-netflix-2021"&gt;has been mixed&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s one thing that everyone seems to agree on: the soundtrack is killer. Yoko Kanno, who gave the original anime its distinctive jazzy songs, returned as composer on the Netflix series, while her band the Seatbelts performed the tracks. The soundtrack includes a few original songs along with rerecorded classics. Thankfully, it’ll also be available to listen to outside of the show very soon. Netflix revealed that the soundtrack will be on streaming services — that includes Apple Music, Spotify, Deezer, Amazon, and Tidal — starting November 19th, the same day the 10-episode series lands on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="UB11xx"&gt;EV startup Canoo is &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/70/canoo-inc-announces-third-quarter-2021-results"&gt;moving its headquarters&lt;/a&gt; from California to Walmart’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas — though it didn’t announce any deal with the retail giant. Canoo said it will open a new manufacturing facility in Bentonville but didn’t say much about what will be done there or who will build it. The startup also said Monday that it is moving up its timeline for making its first electric vehicles to “before Q4 2022.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Eq5HW"&gt;Canoo CEO Tony Aquila said it will use the Arkansas facility to make “vehicles for unique use cases” and accelerate its pre-production testing program. It still plans to build a factory outside Tulsa, Oklahoma, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar"&gt;announced in June&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s text-to-speech TikTok voices censored words like “gay” and “lesbian”</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9GUSXSKf29drpIixxZKi3206z4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146807/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="caAqlz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kbwild_/video/7030602779139919109"&gt;TikTokers have demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778092/disney-plus-day-tiktok-text-to-speech-voices-characters-marvel"&gt;Disney’s text-to-speech TikTok voice&lt;/a&gt;, meant to sound like Rocket the Raccoon, would refuse to read words like “gay,” “lesbian,” or “queer” out loud. This decision seems to have been reverted — you can now get the voice to read out those words, but it’s unclear why it was happening. The change, however, is very recent — &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed that the voice wouldn’t say the words, but it started to do so in a subsequent test minutes later on Monday afternoon. TikTok hasn’t commented on why this happened, but videos posted to highlight the issue still have the words blanked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIsBxe"&gt;Rocket’s voice was introduced to TikTok’s text-to-speech feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778092/disney-plus-day-tiktok-text-to-speech-voices-characters-marvel"&gt;as part of a Disney Plus Day promotion&lt;/a&gt; last week.

    <title>Amazon fined $500,000 for failing to notify California workers about COVID-19 cases</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xRSHea"&gt;Amazon has been ordered to pay a fine of $500,000 for hiding the number of COVID-19 cases at its California workplaces from employees. First reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-15/amazon-covid-outbreak-workplace-safety-right-to-know-penalty"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company agreed to pay the fine and improve the way it tracks cases and notifies workers and local health agencies. Amazon must also inform its warehouse workers in California of the “exact number of new COVID-19 cases in their workplaces” when cases arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K7RPpJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the first fine related to California’s COVID “right to know” legislation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
