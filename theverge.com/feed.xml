    <title>Virgin Galactic to send its first sweepstakes winner to space</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wTBMgF"&gt;On Wednesday, Virgin Galactic announced its first sweepstakes winner that the space tourism company is sending to space. The winner, Keisha S. (her last name is being withheld by the company), is a health coach from Antigua and Barbuda. She will be the first person from the Caribbean islands to visit space and hopes to bring her daughter, who studies astrophysics, on the spacecraft with her as her guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nKrTIb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve always had a lifelong love of flying and a fascination with space.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ElMnz"&gt;“I’ve always had a lifelong love of flying and a fascination with space,” Keisha said in a press release. “This is truly a dream come true for me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i98Bto"&gt;The sweepstakes was done in partnership with Omaze, a fundraising company, and Space for Humanity, a nonprofit that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals on cameras and lenses </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oXH12Ee5aR1W8qYLN8CQLnp-lfg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70188516/akrales_190117_3163_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CTXPBN"&gt;Cameras and lenses can be a tricky thing to shop for around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. They are no small investment, though if you’re shopping for that lucky someone — or for yourself — there are some deals to be had that can save you a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cd0NVO"&gt;We have vetted and rounded up the most notable deals from the major camera manufacturers, focusing on the latest mirrorless systems. It’s hard to justify spending big money on a new DSLR in 2021, as it may be better to look to the secondhand market for those older systems. Another hard truth is that some camera manufacturers have been plagued by the chip shortages on the latest models, and the deals on tap show that — many of the deeper discounts are on slightly older cameras, and some newer releases...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku’s cheapest streaming box is this $15 Black Friday special for Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Roku LE, or is it SE?" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CpcvxpdFtn4bxM-XOamn33z4FvI=/89x0:1412x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70188293/Roku_LE.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Roku LE, or is it SE? | Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZwBnDJ"&gt;Ever since it appeared as the original Netflix streaming box, Roku has delivered internet video via box, stick, or embedded TV software. However, for Black Friday this year, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2021/11/roku-announces-15-roku-le-streaming-player-exclusively-at/b0zwbcpp-1637005128"&gt;Roku is releasing its cheapest device&lt;/a&gt; that I can remember seeing, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRoku-LE-HD-Streaming-Media-Player-with-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-and-Simple-Remote%2F982679870&amp;amp;subid1=VergeRokuBF112421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$15 Roku LE Streaming Player&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BgXGIK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Buying the remote by itself costs $15&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4AVerZ"&gt;It’s a 1080p-only box that does exactly what you’d expect from a Roku player, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRoku-LE-HD-Streaming-Media-Player-with-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-and-Simple-Remote%2F982679870&amp;amp;subid1=VergeRokuBF112421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it will only be available from Walmart.com today&lt;/a&gt; and in Walmart stores on the 26th. We don’t have detailed specs, but it’s the same box Roku &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201117005405/en/Roku-Announces-Limited-Edition-17-Roku-SE-Streaming-Player"&gt;offered last year on Black Friday for $17&lt;/a&gt;, which has been selling at Walmart for $30 or so ever since as the Roku SE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uQAi4O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals at Walmart","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1Op0pD"&gt;For Roku and Walmart, it doesn’t really matter where this box came from. Walmart gets a cheap...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new app helps get more out of the S21 Ultra’s telephoto cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Galaxy S21 Ultra, in Phantom Black" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qJnyCSn5m3S7Ijidglwvoi5Oymo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70188200/vpavic_210119_4377_0170.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Azrgn"&gt;Samsung has released a new camera app in beta that lets you use Pro Mode across all four of the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s rear cameras. That means it’s supported on both telephoto cameras, rather than being limited to just its main and ultrawide sensors. The new &lt;a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s/s21-ultra-%EC%B9%B4%EB%A9%94%EB%9D%BC-expert-raw-%EC%95%B1%EC%9D%98-%EB%B2%A0%ED%83%80%EC%84%9C%EB%B9%84%EC%8A%A4%EB%A5%BC-%EC%86%8C%EA%B0%9C%ED%95%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/td-p/14005849"&gt;Expert RAW app&lt;/a&gt; has been released in the South Korean Galaxy Store, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrontTron/status/1463337169548832771?s=20"&gt;tipster FrontTron&lt;/a&gt; has an APK available to download if you’d like to sideload it. It only seems to be available for the S21 Ultra for now, on devices running Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCQS4w"&gt;The new app overcomes a limitation of the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which is that its stock camera’s Pro Mode is only available with two out of its four rear cameras (aka the 108-megapixel main camera and 12-megapixel ultrawide, but not the 10-megapixel 10x...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on Apple devices</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvAANe"&gt;Ironically, if you’re looking for a great Apple deal this Black Friday season, you shouldn’t shop at Apple. That’s because Apple doesn’t typically offer discounts on its new products in-store or on its website, at least outside of the occasional educational discount. Don’t fear, however, as there are plenty of reliable third-party retailers like Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Best Buy that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwzsMr"&gt;Even better, these retailers have already started discounting some of the most popular Apple products ahead of Black Friday, dropping prices on everything from the latest MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch Series 7.  Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals we’ve found by category, and we’ll continue to update this piece as more deals are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nunE44"&gt;Also, if...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Early Black Friday 2021 gaming deals: games, accessories, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFrXc3sP8_vwc7o4sWbDhd2npr4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70188076/acastro_210113_1777_gamingstock_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EIiXqs"&gt;Gamers are served up all kinds of great deals throughout the year. It’s not uncommon for recently released games to drop as much as 20 percent off in the first few months of release or to snag the occasional one-off deal on a controller or headset. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are something special — a chance to get in on the year’s best offers all at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lUgdw"&gt;Like 2020, the holidays in 2021 are a bit peculiar, what with the ongoing pandemic and chip shortage. There’s no shortage of games and accessories, but fewer consoles are available for first-time buyers to gift, which means the opportunities to get one are very rare and very popular. Some retailers have even taken to charging subscription fees that offer you a boosted chance of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox sues YouTuber for temporarily shutting down conference with fake terrorist threat</title>
