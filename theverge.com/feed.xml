    <title>Google’s Entertainment Space for Android tablets puts videos, games, and books in one place</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dUsgdfGxfW_z4j4mrcuaINoPsuQ=/0x83:1987x1408/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69240715/entspace1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pdFckA"&gt;Google is today announcing a new feature on Android tablets that plays to one of their greatest strengths: media consumption. The simply named “Entertainment Space” will be a new section to the left of the home screen on tablets from Walmart starting this month, and it’ll expand globally to devices from Lenovo, Sharp, and others later in the year. It’s an all-encompassing hub that brings together video (TV shows, movies, and YouTube), games, and books. Entertainment Space is something Google has been building for a couple years, and it’s one of the more significant changes to the Android tablet experience in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JXixY"&gt;“You’ll save time and avoid having to hop between apps to try to figure out what to do, whether it’s to watch, play or...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>College student sues Proctorio after source code copyright claim</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QEg3w5"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has filed a &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/document/johnson-v-proctorio-complaint"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the remote testing company Proctorio on behalf of Miami University student Erik Johnson. The lawsuit is intended to “quash a campaign of harassment designed to undermine important concerns” about the company’s remote test-proctoring software, according to the EFF. It’s the latest legal battle for the software company, which has publicly sparred with online critics throughout the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzQ9k6"&gt;The lawsuit intends to address the company’s behavior toward Johnson in September of last year. After Johnson found out that he’d need to use the software for two of his classes, Johnson dug into the source code of Proctorio’s Chrome extension and made a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ejohnson99/status/1303121786637373443"&gt;lengthy Twitter thread...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s Labor Department reverses Trump-era gig worker rule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Transportation Union And Rideshare Drivers United Members Hold Rolling Vehicle Protest Calling On State To Enforce AB5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1pSc4ZRa3L3NLokeI6vNkCJVGs4=/0x4:5317x3549/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69240336/1219237615.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XabTnL"&gt;The US Department of Labor withdrew a Trump-era rule that would have made it easier for “gig economy” companies like Uber and Lyft to classify their workers as independent contractors. The reversal doesn’t change any gig workers’ current employment status, but it does signal that the Biden administration is taking a less friendly stance toward this sector of the economy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uvUGx"&gt;The rule was finalized in early January, before Biden took office, and would have made it more difficult for gig workers to be reclassified as employees under federal law. Over the years, some gig workers have fought to be classified as employees so they could qualify for benefits like paid sick leave, health insurance, and minimum wage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qfEk8z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Stop the erosion of worker...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Peloton recalls its treadmills following series of accidents</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJCBbN"&gt;Peloton is issuing a voluntary recall for all of its treadmill products — including both the Peloton Tread and Tread Plus — following a series of accidents that have resulted in multiple injuries and at least one death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsMrLn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Peloton-Recalls-Tread-Plus-Treadmills-After-One-Child-Died-and-More-than-70-Incidents-Reported"&gt;In the recall announcement today&lt;/a&gt; for the Tread Plus, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) elaborates that it’s received “72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTXh1g"&gt;The two products are being recalled for different reasons: while there are concerns with the Tread Plus that people may be pulled underneath the treadmill, &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Peloton-Recalls-Tread-Treadmills-Due-to-Risk-of-Injury"&gt;the regular Tread...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap can be sued for fueling a fatal car crash with its speed filter, court rules</title>

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EjsEv3"&gt;Snap can be sued over a Snapchat speed filter that allegedly encouraged reckless driving, despite the generally broad legal protections for social networks. The Ninth Circuit Appeals Court &lt;a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2021/05/04/20-55295.pdf"&gt;revived a case&lt;/a&gt; that was dismissed in 2020, reversing an earlier ruling that favored Snap. It concluded that even if users were populating the filter with their own high driving speeds, Snap could still be liable for implicitly rewarding that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTwwcU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lemmon v. Snap&lt;/em&gt; was filed after a 20-year-old Snapchat user crashed his car while using the filter, at one point driving over 120 miles per hour. The 2017 crash killed the driver and two teenage passengers. Two of the victims’ parents sued Snap for wrongful death, saying its combination of an opaque...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best video game subscription deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ve6XpF"&gt;Online game subscriptions are quite common in the gaming industry. Whether it's a subscription for an online service for multiplayer gaming or Netflix-like services that provide access to a massive library of games to play, gaming subscriptions provide good incentives and a lot of value for many gamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAgFMs"&gt;While sales tend to stay steady throughout the year, these subscription services will hold promotions or discounts now and then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="75ZAPD"&gt;PlayStation subscription deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2CYtx"&gt;PlayStation Plus is arguably the most popular subscription service available on PlayStation consoles. Subscribing comes with a few perks outside of occasional discounts on the PlayStation Store and playing (most) games online. Each month, Sony provides a rotation of games you...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get two years of PS Plus for less than the cost of one</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1CKVGH"&gt;Whether you own a PS4 or PS5, you probably want to have PS Plus service to be able to play games online and to get complimentary offerings from Sony in the form of games each month. Through Sony, one year of PS Plus costs $60, but Eneba is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers a special discount that’ll double it to two years’ worth of service for just $54. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar2HiJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals04062021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Go here and hit “Buy Now”&lt;/a&gt; near the top of the page. Then at checkout, make sure to double your quantity to two instead of one, then enter the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEMAYPROMO &lt;/strong&gt;to knock the price from around $60 down to $54. You’ll get two codes, and you can redeem each one into your console as needed when it comes time to replenish your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hi5hhp"&gt;With PS Plus on PS5, you’ll gain access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best free apps for video calling</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jz5xAw"&gt;Things may be starting to open up, but for now, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to limit face-to-face association and most of us are still relying on video calls to keep in touch with work colleagues, family, and friends. And for most of us — especially those who are facing financial difficulties — free is best. Zoom continues to top the list of videoconferencing apps, but there are a bunch of applications out there that will allow you to meet others online for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBifoi"&gt;We’ve listed a few of the best known videoconferencing apps, along with a couple of popular text chat apps that include video calling features. While most of these already have free versions, some are offering access to additional features for those who are currently...&lt;/p&gt;
