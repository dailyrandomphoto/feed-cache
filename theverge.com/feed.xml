        &lt;figcaption&gt;Here come the zombies in &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI1JGPhYBS8&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8XwaEA"&gt;I finished &lt;em&gt;This is a Robbery&lt;/em&gt;, and I won’t spoil the ending but if you’re thinking there will be a huge reveal at the end, well, you might be disappointed. What I found interesting throughout the four-part series was how the storyline relied on the voices of newspaper reporters who have covered the heist —and its aftermath —over the years. Considering the filmmakers are Colin and Nick Barnicle, sons of longtime &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; columnist and current MSNBC contributor Mike Barnicle, it makes sense they’d center journalists in the story. Go watch it, Boston looks absolutely beautiful and the Boston accents are more authentic than anything else you’ll watch this year. Plus, if you can figure out the central mystery of the series there’s a $10...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iOUhuo"&gt;Authorities in Texas say two people were killed when a Tesla with no one in the driver’s seat crashed into a tree and burst into flames, Houston television station &lt;a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2021/04/18/2-men-dead-after-fiery-tesla-crash-in-spring-officials-say/"&gt;KPRC 2 reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Q5kIV"&gt;The cause of the crash, which happened at about 9PM local time in Spring, Texas (near Houston), is under investigation. &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;According to KHOU&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, first responders had to use 30,000 gallons of water over four hours to put out the fire, as the Tesla’s battery kept reigniting. Authorities tried to contact Tesla for advice on putting out the fire; it’s not clear whether they received any response.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="VwiPcv"&gt;Charles “Chuck” Geschke, a co-founder of Adobe who helped develop the PDF, has died at age 81, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2021/Adobe-Co-Founder-Dr.-Geschke-Passes-at-81/default.aspx"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxfoFt"&gt;“This is a huge loss for the entire Adobe community and the technology industry, for whom he has been a guide and hero for decades,” Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said in an email to Adobe employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovBaB1"&gt;”As co-founders of Adobe, Chuck and John Warnock developed groundbreaking software that has revolutionized how people create and communicate,” Narayen said. “Chuck instilled a relentless drive for innovation in the company, resulting in some of the most transformative software inventions, including the ubiquitous PDF, Acrobat, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Photoshop.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal investigators looking into breach at software code testing company Codecov</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QHEMKO"&gt;Federal officials are investigating a security breach at software auditing company Codecov, which apparently went undetected for months, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-investigators-probing-breach-san-francisco-code-testing-company-firm-2021-04-16/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.  Codecov’s platform is used to test software code for vulnerabilities, and its 29,000 clients include Atlassian, Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, GoDaddy, and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpe8q3"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://about.codecov.io/security-update/"&gt;statement on the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;, Codecov CEO Jerrod Engelberg acknowledged the breach and the federal investigation, saying someone had gained access to its Bash Uploader script and modified it without the company’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abORal"&gt;“Our investigation has determined that beginning January 31, 2021, there were periodic, unauthorized alterations of our Bash Uploader script by a third party, which enabled them to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox to introduce content ratings for games to better restrict age-inappropriate content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Roblox logo on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oIiMf4Dx4vm3ChXjzIfSXT8sg7g=/0x0:4971x3314/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69143585/1232034013.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qohKIu"&gt;Virtual gaming platform Roblox is developing content ratings for games and easier-to-use parental controls, the company’s chief privacy officer Remy Malan told &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roblox-struggles-with-sexual-content-it-hopes-a-ratings-system-will-address-the-problem-11618660801"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjUe7F"&gt;Half of Roblox’s audience of more than 30 million daily users are kids under 13, but the platform has struggled at times to contain sexually explicit content. Age-inappropriate games sometimes surface up on kids’ “recommended for you” lists, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdybR0"&gt;The platform’s current system restricts kids to specific games, but under the new system, parents would have more information about what kids might find in a given game; until you play a game, it’s not always clear that it might have explicit or inappropriate content in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mWaEs"&gt;Malan did not...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google introducing a feature in Chrome 90 to create links to highlighted text on a webpage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cUclObS02E-f6lIvl6OO_Z-EiGE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69143488/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1h5rqm"&gt;An upcoming feature in Chrome 90 will allow users to create a link to a section of a website that they’ve highlighted. First &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295300/google-link-to-text-fragment-chrome-extension-chromium-highlight-scroll-down"&gt;launched as a browser extension&lt;/a&gt; called Link to Text Fragment last year, Google has now added the feature within Chrome itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDkFv7"&gt;The new feature is still rolling out to users; I wasn’t able to get it to work even after I updated to Chrome 90. But the feature works just like the browser extension did, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/more-helpful-chrome-throughout-your-workday/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Google product manager Kayce Hawkins: Visit a web page, highlight the text you want to create a link to, right click, and select “copy link to highlight.” A URL ending in a pound sign (#) is generated, which you can then share with others. When they open the link, they’ll be sent to the...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="OkE29Z"&gt;Amazon Game Studios has canceled a &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; online role-playing game, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-17/amazon-cancels-lord-of-the-rings-game-announced-two-years-ago?srnd=technology-vp&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="WsMYkR"&gt;The game was to be set “at a time long before the events of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, exploring lands, people and creatures never seen before by fans of the Tolkien universe,” according to an announcement from Athlon at the time. But &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-12-14-leyou-shareholders-approve-tencent-takeover"&gt;Leyou was acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Tencent Holdings in December, and an Amazon spokesperson said in an email to The Verge that the company was “unable to secure terms to proceed with this title at this time.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA reschedules Ingenuity helicopter’s first flight on Mars for Monday </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;An artists’ rendering of the Ingenuity and its parent rover Perseverance | NASA/JPL-Caltech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZarA9f"&gt;NASA has rescheduled the first flight of its Ingenuity Mars helicopter to April 19th at 3:30AM ET, the&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-to-attempt-first-controlled-flight-on-mars-as-soon-as-monday"&gt; agency announced&lt;/a&gt; Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY26kL"&gt;The four-pound helicopter that arrived on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Mars on February 18th with its parent rover Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; has seen its first flight delayed a few times. It touched the surface of Mars on April 4th, and has been undergoing tests and checkouts. It survived its first night alone on Mars’ frigid surface, passing a first test of its independence from Perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijL8wR"&gt;The craft was scheduled to take flight April 11th, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377299/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flight-delayed-wednesday"&gt;last weekend NASA said&lt;/a&gt; data from a high-speed rotor test showed the test sequence ended early, as Ingenuity’s computer tried to switch from pre-flight to flight mode The date was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381554/ingenuity-mars-first-flight-delayed-nasa-fixes-software-bug"&gt;pushed back again&lt;/a&gt; after...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CPSC urges people with children at home to stop using Peloton Tread Plus treadmill ‘immediately’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2qHhQF"&gt;The Consumer Product Safety Commission on Saturday &lt;a href="https://cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-Stop-Using-the-Peloton-Tread+"&gt;issued a warning&lt;/a&gt; about Peloton Tread Plus treadmills, saying the machines pose “serious risks to children for abrasions, fractures, and death.” In a March blog post by CEO John Foley, the company &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;said it was aware&lt;/a&gt; that a child had died in an accident on the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9yzbK"&gt;The agency says it is aware of 39 incidents with the Tread Plus, including one death. “In light of multiple reports of children becoming entrapped, pinned, and pulled under the rear roller of the product, CPSC urges consumers with children at home to stop using the product immediately,” the CPSC bulletin states.&lt;/p&gt;
