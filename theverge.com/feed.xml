    <title>How to preorder Apple’s third-gen AirPods</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2hB74cmpCY1wERDLyyuzjgpGmI=/150x0:1749x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012528/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_10.23.57_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s latest AirPods will be available on October 26th.&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vQRTjj"&gt;The tech world may be abuzz regarding the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22488779"&gt;14-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22491254"&gt;16-inch MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22435385"&gt;new AirPods&lt;/a&gt; — announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22488347"&gt;Apple’s “Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; today — have also conjured up a storm. Apple has finally announced a new pair of true wireless earbuds set to launch on October 26th for $179, while lowering the price of the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1019575/7613?subId1=Verge3rdGenAirpods101821&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMV7N2AM%2FA%2Fairpods-with-charging-case" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;entry-level AirPods 2 to $129&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZDatb"&gt;As expected, the third-generation AirPods mirror their sleeker sibling, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, mostly in its new design and in some functionality, barring the active noise cancellation. For the first time since 2016, the AirPods include a wider, Pro-like charging case and shorter steams. They also boast Pro features like Adaptive EQ, which customizes your audio experience, and an intuitive force sensor for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly added a MagSafe charging case to its AirPods Pro, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gEqvGhOvHFVtieZ5tn9_1SCciYE=/0x42:2124x1458/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012470/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_2.19.16_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N6gGM1"&gt;Apple just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;announced its third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; with a new charging case that works with its MagSafe magnetic charging system, but the company &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/introducing-the-next-generation-of-airpods/"&gt;also quietly announced&lt;/a&gt; that, starting today, it’ll also be including the new case with its pricier &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLWK3AM/A/airpods-pro"&gt;$250 AirPods Pro model&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Jbgpnx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple announces third-generation AirPods for $179","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jdpqCs"&gt;The new case doesn’t claim to charge Apple’s AirPod products any faster; it just has the magnets needed to attach to Apple’s MagSafe charging puck for easier alignment when charging. AirPods already worked with MagSafe, thanks to the broader Qi charging spec, so it’s more of a slight convenience than anything else, but it's good to see Apple expanding MagSafe to more products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcnnGc"&gt;Unfortunately, Apple also isn’t taking the opportunity here to add a reverse wireless...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new 14-inch MacBook Pro with a notch</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pzYFl7"&gt;Apple has announced a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-14-and-16/"&gt;redesigned MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which now includes a 14-inch screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;Apple’s new M1 Pro and Max chips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;a notch&lt;/a&gt;, squared-off design, and a wider selection of ports in addition to the standard Thunderbolt ones — it brings back the HDMI port and SD card reader and adds a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733119/apple-new-macbook-pro-magsafe-back"&gt;MagSafe 3 connector&lt;/a&gt; for charging (though you can also charge it with the Thunderbolt ports if your house is littered with USB-C power bricks). It starts at $1,999 and &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/2r5oMg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can be ordered “today.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDMM04"&gt;It has a 14.2-inch 120Hz ProMotion Mini LED display, which Apple is branding as “Liquid Retina Pro XDR.” It has slimmer bezels than the previous generation but also includes a notch, which houses a 1080p webcam but not Apple’s Face ID system. Resolution-wise, the 14-inch...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s second-gen AirPods got a permanent $30 price cut</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oYxNKn"&gt;Apple announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; during today’s big hardware event: a $179 set of earbuds that are much closer to the AirPods Pro in terms of features and design. Though, it’s not all bad news if you don’t want to spend that much on AirPods. As a result of this new set, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-2nd-generation/"&gt;Apple has permanently slashed the price of its second-gen AirPods that include a wired charging case from $159 to $129&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Igazhh"&gt;The model that includes a wireless charging case is no longer available for purchase (through Apple, at least). It does, however, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MR8U2AM/A/wireless-charging-case-for-airpods"&gt;still sell the wireless charging case separately for $79&lt;/a&gt;, but I really wouldn’t encourage buying that versus just getting the new, third-generation AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsbtCu"&gt;Apple currently has a lineup of AirPods that starts at...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix trans employees and allies release a list of demands ahead of the walkout</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TYddrX"&gt;The trans employee resource group at Netflix has released a list of demands for the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723592/netflix-trans-employees-walkout-statements-ceo"&gt;ahead of Wednesday’s walkout&lt;/a&gt;. “We want the company to adopt measures in the areas of content investment, employee relations and safety, and harm reduction, all of which are necessary to avoid future instances of platforming transphobia and hate speech,” employees wrote in a press release, which has not yet been made public but was supplied to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QL7YQ1"&gt;The news comes after weeks of controversy due to Netflix executives continuing to support Dave Chappelle and his comedy special &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which many LGBTQ people and allies have criticized as transphobic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dll4A6"&gt;Last week, Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle"&gt;fired a leader of the trans ERG&lt;/a&gt; who was helping to organize the walkout....&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="txvrRb"&gt;Apple has just finished its October 2021 event, which was full of news and announcements from the company — including the long-awaited M1-equipped MacBook Pros. There was a whole lot of news, so if you want to get caught up on the biggest updates from the show, you can catch up with our roundup right here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="oDUSLU"&gt;Apple announced two MacBook Pros with an all-new design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6PJZD2"&gt;Apple revealed a brand-new set of MacBook Pros, available in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; models. The Touch Bar is gone, replaced with a full-size function row. Many ports are back; there’s an HDMI port, three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card slot, a headphone jack, and the return of the MagSafe charger. The 14-inch model...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS Monterey is officially launching on October 25th</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LjQqvB"&gt;Following several beta releases, Apple announced that the next version of its macOS software, macOS Monterey, is about to release. It’ll be rolling out as an update starting on Monday, October 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Dr8m8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;My colleague Monica Chin previewed the public beta software&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, highlighting Monterey’s improvements to Facetime. The software will bring other exciting features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;SharePlay and Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, which will enable Mac and iPad users to move files seamlessly between devices, but perhaps not at launch. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-unveils-game-changing-macbook-pro/"&gt;In its press release for the new, redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, Apple says that those features are coming “later this fall.” Additionally, Apple made significant tweaks to Safari, its own web browser, for Monterey, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686070/apple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back"&gt;it has since...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new M1 MacBook Pros are the first with mini LED 120Hz refresh displays</title>

&lt;p id="ncpost-list-post-content-2857077"&gt;The larger 16-inch MacBook Pro has a 16.2-inch display with a 3456 x 2234 resolution, while the 14-inch model has a 14.2-inch panel at 3024 x 1964. Both sizes feature the same Mini LED technology that Apple debuted on the iPad Pro earlier this year, which offers local dimming on a level beyond traditional LED displays (although it’s still not quite on the level of OLED panels used by competitors like Samsung.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncpost-list-post-content-2857105"&gt;The new displays also feature Apple’s 120Hz “ProMotion” technology, which...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple brings MagSafe 3 to the new MacBook Pro</title>

  &lt;p id="52peMg"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;ditched MagSafe five years ago&lt;/a&gt; when it moved to USB-C charging on its new laptops, but MagSafe 3 brings the familiar quick-release connector back to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max"&gt;this latest lineup&lt;/a&gt; of MacBook Pro laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk4qTX"&gt;Other than their M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; computers ditch the much-hated Touch Bar in favor of physical keys and bring back the additional ports (HDMI, SDXC) power users love. A less familiar addition is the new notch atop those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733122/apple-macbook-pro-mini-led-display-120hz-promotion-refresh-rates"&gt;Mini LED-packed 120Hz displays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2Nebi"&gt;But for the clumsy people with cable-strewn desks, the return of MagSafe — what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;we’ve seen on iPhones&lt;/a&gt; just isn’t the same — might be the most important feature. According to Apple,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn reveals three ‘Foxtron’-branded electric vehicle prototypes</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jifjLR"&gt;iPhone assembler Foxconn has &lt;a href="https://www.foxconn.com/en-us/press-center/press-releases/latest-news/694"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; three prototype electric vehicles as part of its effort to become a major player in the automotive industry. The Taiwanese conglomerate showed off an SUV it calls the Model C, a sedan it calls the Model E, and a bus dubbed the Model T, all under a new “Foxtron” branding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ssilst"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/article/20140609/OEM02/306099974/why-ford-just-said-no-when-musk-tried-to-put-the-e-in-sex"&gt;Ford may take issue with the naming convention&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t seem that Foxconn plans to make these specific vehicles itself. Rather, it wants them to be seen as reference designs, examples of the types of vehicles that can be built on the EV platform it’s been developing, and advertisements for the automotive components and software it plans to sell.
