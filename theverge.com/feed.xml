    <title>How to back up your iPhone with or without iCloud</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f8J0AP"&gt;Yes, of course you want to back up your iPhone — as we all know, despite phone cases and Gorilla glass and careful engineering, disaster — in the form of cracked displays, lost devices, and three-year-olds who think it’s fun to sit on your latest phone — can happen. When that happens, you want to have all your data backed up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gdx7nE"&gt;The easiest way to go is to back up using iCloud, which is not only simple to set up, but makes it just as simple to set up a new phone if your old one is no longer available. (You can also back up to other services, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7070690?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;amp;oco=1"&gt;such as Google Drive&lt;/a&gt;, but it isn’t nearly as convenient.) Or, if you’re an iPhone user who is steadfast about retaining your privacy, you can back up your iPhone to your Mac or Windows computer and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to move all your data to your new iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7wBVftLLpYG13H9yLx0WkeJBIU=/0x131:1960x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69861410/Apple_iPhone_13_Pro_Colors_09142021.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ynDHQ5"&gt;If you’ve just upgraded — or are planning to upgrade — to Apple’s new iPhone 13, congratulations! You’re going to want to try out your snazzy new phone as soon as you open that box. But first, you need to get all of the apps and data from your old iPhone onto your new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXiQdD"&gt;It’s actually very easy — in fact, if you haven’t upgraded for a while, you’ll find it easier than ever. The process of moving your data used to require restoring it from an iCloud or iTunes backup. Now, you don’t have to bother with that backup (although backing up your stuff is always a good idea). You can move your apps, data, and ID over to the new phone directly with what Apple calls iPhone migration. (However, if you prefer, you can still restore it from iCloud.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Goodbye and good riddance to Apple’s 64GB iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nMRMjEAcBSFHCuSJYwW20BXaJCo=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69861346/lcimg_78e65da1_4e90_4b7e_a300_6bce2342e8ea.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fqkvv"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13 and 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt; mark the official end of the 64GB iPhone era: the company has effectively doubled the storage capacities for its 2021 models while keeping prices the same, so the new smartphones now start with 128GB of storage with options for 256GB and 512GB. (For those who require more space, the iPhone 13 Pro models offer up to 1TB.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k27fzt"&gt;While 64GB capacities will still stick around on the legacy iPhone 12, iPhone 11, and iPhone SE models, Apple’s newest hardware will come with a minimum of 128GB now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YrAKZ9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 and 13 Mini announced with redesigned camera array and smaller notch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Ldos8e"&gt;To which I say, goodbye and good riddance. This change was long overdue. Just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/29/16928386/smartphone-storage-memory-64gb-2018"&gt;64GB wasn’t enough to cut it in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and the issue has only grown as apps, photos, videos, and games continue to grow in size. Though Apple has...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is releasing its Pulse 3D Audio headset in midnight black</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fU8x14"&gt;The Pulse 3D Audio wireless headset that Sony made to take advantage of the PS5’s 3D Audio tech is getting a new color option. It’ll be available in midnight black in addition to white, just like its DualSense controller, for the same $99.99 price that it debuted at last year. Most of the white headset colorway was black already, but now there’s simply more of it, covering the headband in black detailing. &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/pulse-3d-wireless-headset-midnight-black.3006397"&gt;You can preorder it now through Sony’s site&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll be available on October 22nd, 2021, but more retailers will likely stock it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsOAXo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/15/pulse-3d-wireless-headset-in-midnight-black-launches-next-month/"&gt;In the PlayStation Blog&lt;/a&gt;, Sony says that this announcement coincides with a new PS5 update that gives Pulse 3D Audio headset owners some new settings to customize the sound. You’ll have three audio...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>App Annie will pay $10 million to settle a fraud investigation with the SEC</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DQ4PS"&gt;App Annie, a company that collects and sells information about the performance of mobile apps, has agreed to pay $10 million to settle a securities fraud investigation, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-176"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09uWKo"&gt;According to the SEC, App Annie used confidential information from app companies to generate its statistical models of app performance. It told the companies the data they provided would be aggregated and anonymized, and not disclosed to third parties. But the SEC alleged that between late 2014 and mid-2018, App Annie and its former CEO Bertrand Schmitt used data that had not been aggregated or anonymized to make its estimates more valuable to sell to trading firms. And, the SEC alleged, App Annie...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The HP Chromebook 14 is just over $230 at Amazon right now</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 32GB HP Chromebook 14 is no powerhouse, but it can nail the basics without breaking the bank.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="putUsp"&gt;The perfect laptop for the college-bound, this versatile 14-inch Chromebook from HP is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Chromebook-Processor-Lightweight-14a-na0021nr/dp/B08YKGZF7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for just $236&lt;/a&gt;, one of its better prices to date. This device packs a remarkable amount of versatility into a compact and lightweight package. At less than an inch thick and weighing in at less than 3.5 pounds, it's easy to tote around, without it turning into a third wheel. While the 13-hour battery may not provide all-day power, it's more than enough to ensure that it won’t die on you during a crucial lecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4LOm6q"&gt;The 32GB of onboard storage provides ample room to back up your documents, too, and the pair of USB-C and single USB-A ports can accommodate a variety of storage options. Equipped with a built-in wide-angle webcam and mic,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft accounts can now go fully passwordless</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sCEOoLR9sVNfDobZ7nswTLRikMw=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860887/microsoftauthenticator.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WI92GQ"&gt;Microsoft now lets you remove passwords from Microsoft accounts to embrace a passwordless future. Starting today, the software giant will let consumers sign into Microsoft accounts with its Microsoft Authenticator app, Windows Hello, a security key, or an SMS / email verification code instead of a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSb5ec"&gt;The new option arrives just months after Microsoft started rolling out passwordless authentication for commercial users in March to help people adjust to the realities of remote work. “When I think of security, I think you’ve got to protect your whole life,” says Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft security, compliance &amp;amp; identity, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s no longer enough just to think about work or home...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi announces 11T Pro with 120W fast charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhAPOCZbLCfCVQXtrGr5lsi7aIg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860918/DSCF7771.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uoaOXZ"&gt;Xiaomi has launched its 11T series, the headline of which is the 11T Pro and its previously announced 120W HyperCharge fast charging system. The phone has a 5,000mAh battery, and Xiaomi says the bundled 120W charger can fill it from zero to 100 percent in just 17 minutes. A 10-minute charge will get you to 72 percent, meanwhile. That’s even faster than the 120W Mi 10 Ultra Xiaomi released in China last year, and the 11T Pro is coming to Europe and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EtPTw"&gt;For more on the 11T Pro’s fast charging technology — like whether it’ll destroy the battery or burn down your house, for instance — you can read my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666347/xiaomi-11t-pro-120w-fast-charging-battery-interview"&gt;interview with Xiaomi’s Dan Desjarlais&lt;/a&gt; from last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IESXpq"&gt;The 11T Pro is an entirely different phone to the Mi 11 flagship released earlier...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi returns to Android tablets with the 11-inch Pad 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFCX15sCxdnvhxYg5CWMSNlisOk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860878/DSCF7769.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rrYNo5"&gt;Xiaomi has announced its first tablet in a few years, the Xiaomi Pad 5. (The last one was 2018’s 8-inch Mi Pad 4; Xiaomi recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639020/xiaomi-mi-brand-ending-mix-4-confirmed"&gt;phased out&lt;/a&gt; its Mi product branding.) It’s launching in the company’s European markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5d9y3k"&gt;The Xiaomi Pad 5 is an 11-inch tablet with a WQHD+ 120Hz display, quad speakers, 6GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon 860 processor — that’s the new speed-bumped version of the 855, Qualcomm’s flagship chip from 2019. Round the back there’s a 13-megapixel camera, and there’s a 8-megapixel sensor on the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHKx4k"&gt;The Pad 5 pretty inescapably looks like an iPad Pro, from the slim bezels and flat edges to the tablet-specific MIUI customizations like the apps dock. The build isn’t as solid, and the screen doesn’t quite sit as flush with...&lt;/p&gt;
