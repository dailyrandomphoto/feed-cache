    <title>Zoom may launch an email service and calendar app to compete with Google and Microsoft</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EXWZEp"&gt;Videoconferencing platform Zoom has had a blockbuster year, with its stock price rising more than 500 percent due to the unprecedented surge in remote work brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. But now the company is looking to expand beyond workplace video chat and into new territories, specifically email and calendar services, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/buoyed-by-video-success-zoom-explores-email-calendar-services"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEo54i"&gt;The company is already working on the email product, which the report states will be a web email service Zoom may begin testing as early as next year. The calendar app appears farther off and it’s unclear if development has even started. But both ideas are smart avenues for Zoom to explore, especially if companies start bringing employees back to the office and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The CDC says the top global health story of 2020 was mosquitoes</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iMnYNX"&gt;Like they do every December, websites across the internet are rounding up their best posts and stories from the year. That includes the website for the Center for Global Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which highlighted its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/newsletter/2020/december-21-2020.html"&gt;top five stories&lt;/a&gt; for 2020. And coming in at the number one spot, the health agency picked... mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGAFF8"&gt;Specifically, it picked its recognition of World Mosquito Day, where the center called attention to a mosquito species called &lt;em&gt;Anopheles stephensi&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which spreads malaria. It’s certainly an interesting choice, considering the CDC spent the year battling a global pandemic. Not to knock mosquitoes! They’re very important, and they’re very deadly. But COVID-19 didn’t even make the number two...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The government blacklisted DJI drones, but some drone companies are more confused than worried</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3gvZpD7rPkqUKZddwxa000Q-nyk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68571797/vpavic_042029_4003_0144.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ydf6LW"&gt;Last week, the US Department of Commerce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;put Chinese drone maker DJI&lt;/a&gt; on its Entity List, limiting how it can work with US companies. The news startled DJI’s huge American user base, including companies that rely on DJI for entire fleets of commercial drones. But it’s likely less onerous than it initially sounded — even if, like many Trump administration decisions, it comes with a dose of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78UycQ"&gt;The Trump administration has repeatedly used sanctions to crack down on Chinese tech giants, sometimes on nebulous or disputed grounds. It banned US companies from dealing with Huawei and ZTE, and it’s pursued confusing, legally ambiguous bans on the Chinese social apps WeChat and TikTok. While the Entity List is primarily meant for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra S Pen support confirmed by FCC</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The upcoming Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: WinFuture&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pJfOmO"&gt;An FCC listing confirms that Samsung’s S Pen stylus can be used with the company’s upcoming flagship Galaxy S21 Ultra phone. The confirmation, first &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-1186549/"&gt;discovered by &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, comes in &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/A3LSMG998B/Test-Report/Wireless-Charging-Test-Report-5034277"&gt;a test report&lt;/a&gt; for model number SMG998B. The discovery lends clarity to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;recent statements&lt;/a&gt; from Samsung mobile president TM Roh, who said that some of the “most well-loved features” of the Galaxy Note will be coming to other Samsung devices in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOmYqu"&gt;The FCC test report explicitly describes an EUT (Equipment Under Test) device that can be used with an S Pen in both hover and click modes. “The EUT can also used with a stylus device (S Pen). The EUT operates with the S Pen in two different inductive coupling modes of S Pen motion detection (Hover and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram gets Discord-like group voice chats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4pvzOc9Uq9mxhPeGNbbN8geZNVQ=/0x0:540x360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68571180/groupchats.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p9V7Ue"&gt;Telegram is adding a new group voice chats feature that’s similar to an always-on Discord room. Voice chats are now part of existing text chats, and operate as a persistent option to speak live with friends or family. As they’re always available, you can dip in and out of voice chats just like you would in a Discord room or call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LT4Gfu"&gt;Telegram is supporting “a few thousand participants,” so even bigger groups for things like live events will include voice chats. The feature appears at the top of an existing group chat, if enabled, allowing anyone to join the conversation freely. On the desktop versions of Telegram for Windows and Mac, you can also use a push-to-talk key for voice chats to control your microphone input.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nearly half a billion users played Among Us in November</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Among Us" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AMrVnjByV-VHm4Gi6ofI05026Sw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68570242/ss_a0f2416e11bf5b47788eaa3617e092b73962b145.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: InnerSloth&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qKHiUD"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/worldwide-digital-games-market"&gt;roughly half a billion people&lt;/a&gt; reportedly playing it in November, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; has had the most monthly players for a mobile game ever, beating giants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060877/pokemon-go-record-revenue-2019-niantic-labs-ar-growth"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon GO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt;. According to Nielsen’s SuperData, the game is “by far the most popular game ever in terms of monthly players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CS899C"&gt;The success is even more remarkable because InnerSloth — the company that makes Among Us — &lt;a href="http://www.innersloth.com/About.php"&gt;only has four employees&lt;/a&gt;. That’s roughly 125 million players per person who works on the game. It’s proven to be so popular that the studio decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;cancel a sequel that was in the works&lt;/a&gt; and just put all its effort into improving the original. It even caught the attention of sitting congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526164/aoc-among-us-twitch-debut-top-concurrent-viewers"&gt;who livestreamed herself...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roast your own Spotify listens with this snarky AI</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NdXN5hc2dG3WoIKkFKxPL3vS7mg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569959/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h9pJGW"&gt;The yearly Spotify Wrapped is a rather upbeat affair, which doesn’t doesn’t quite match everyone’s mood this year. For the more sullen among us, there’s another option: &lt;a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/"&gt;a bot from The Pudding&lt;/a&gt; that will judge us for our crimes of listening to terrible music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWfXOF"&gt;If you want to be judged, you open a page titled “How Bad is Your Spotify” and you log in with your Spotify account. (It might take a couple refreshes on the “Loading your music library” page.) This absolute jerk of an AI then drags you mercilessly while it pulls your playlists and top tracks. It asks you questions before it shows any results, in phrasing that gives the plain text the same aura as the girls who bullied me in middle school. &lt;em&gt;Did you really listen to Clementine by Sarah...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC says third-largest cryptocurrency was sold all wrong</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="vp9aWN"&gt;Ripple, its former CEO and founder Christian Larsen, and its current CEO Bradley Garlinghouse are being &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338"&gt;sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The SEC says that they raised more than $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XfLHO"&gt;The suit claims that Ripple violated securities laws by selling XRP, which &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ripple-to-face-sec-suit-over-xrp-cryptocurrency-11608598800"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; calls&lt;/a&gt; “the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value,” over a seven-year period starting in 2013. According to the complaint, the “illegal securities offering” created an information asymmetry that let Larsen and Garlinghouse sell XRP to investors who only knew what Larsen and Garlinghouse chose to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQ2a72"&gt;At the heart of the suit is a basic question about XRP: &lt;a href="https://www.iflr.com/article/b1m2pm9g4n65mk/cryptocurrencies-and-us-securities-laws-beyond-bitcoin-and-ether"&gt;is it a security or a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Substack says readers and writers are really in charge of moderation</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCZC4j"&gt;Substack plans to take a “hands-off approach” to determining who can use its newsletter platform and “resist public pressure” to remove writers seen by some as “unacceptable.” &lt;a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/substacks-view-of-content-moderation"&gt;In a blog post this afternoon&lt;/a&gt;, the company outlined a relatively lax content moderation policy designed to let writers know they won’t be removed from the platform as long as they comply with basic rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgKGu3"&gt;While it does have &lt;a href="https://substack.com/content"&gt;a short list of prohibitions&lt;/a&gt;, Substack says that “readers and writers are in charge.” The idea is that readers don’t have to pay for or subscribe to writers who they don’t agree with, and writers can leave — and take their mailing lists with them — if they don’t like the platform. “We just disagree with those who would seek to tightly constrain...&lt;/p&gt;
