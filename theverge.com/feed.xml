    <title>PSA: LastPass’ free offering is changing today</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4rzJsY"&gt;LastPass, the popular password manager, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;announced changes&lt;/a&gt; last month to the free version of its software designed to make its Premium paid version much more attractive — and the free one much less so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iddYPN"&gt;“LastPass offers access across two device types – computers (including all browsers running on desktops and laptops) or mobile&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;devices (including mobile phones, smart watches, and tablets),” the company wrote in a &lt;a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2021/02/changes-to-lastpass-free/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Starting March 16th, 2021” — that’s today — “LastPass Free will only include access on unlimited devices of one type.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OTFzY"&gt;What that means: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;if you’re a LastPass free user, you’ll have to choose&lt;/a&gt; whether you want to access your passwords on your computer — in browser or via desktop app — or on your mobile device. You won’t...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will reduce Play Store cut to 15 percent for a developer’s first $1M in annual revenue</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3q3rP0mZHdCqX8Bv3X0kNapHgA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68974840/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xe9ZA4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/boosting-dev-success.html"&gt;Google is reducing&lt;/a&gt; its long-standing 30 percent cut, which it takes from each Play Store digital purchase for all Android developers around the world, on the first $1 million they make on the digital storefront each year, starting on July 1st. According to Google, that change means the 99 percent of Android developers that make less than $1 million each year will see a 50 percent reduction in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="al4tx8"&gt;Google’s news follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;Apple’s announcement of a reduced 15 percent fee&lt;/a&gt; last year as part of a new small business program, with one critical difference: &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;Apple’s fee reduction&lt;/a&gt; only applies to developers that make under $1 million per year. But if an app maker goes over the $1 million threshold at any point in the year, they’ll be booted from...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s 11th Gen desktop chips are here with faster speeds but fewer cores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1VXr2aM1xMOheCdlRNphASMD4GA=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68974858/RKL_i9_with_Box.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W8j3Mp"&gt;Intel’s next-generation desktop chips are finally here: after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225541/intel-processor-11th-gen-ces-2021-chips-specs"&gt;brief preview at CES&lt;/a&gt;, the company is fully unveiling its 11th Gen Core desktop chips (better known by their codename, Rocket Lake-S.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVHayt"&gt;Leading the pack is Intel’s new flagship chip, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225541/intel-processor-11th-gen-ces-2021-chips-specs"&gt;Core i9-11900K&lt;/a&gt;, with eight cores, 16 threads, boosted clock speeds up to 5.3GHz, support for DDR4 RAM at 3,200MHz, a total of 20 PCIe 4.0 lanes, and backwards compatibility with Intel’s 400 Series chipsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHl4LY"&gt;Eagle-eyed Intel fans might notice that the new chip is, on paper, actually a downgrade from last year’s top model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/30/21242512/intel-10th-gen-desktop-lineup-offers-gaming-processor-speed"&gt;the Core i9-10900K&lt;/a&gt;, which offered 10 cores and 20 threads (and a similar boosted clock speed of 5.3GHz). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMrgTD"&gt;That’s because Intel is debuting a new desktop core architecture for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s experimental storytelling continues with a brief, thrilling single-player event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WAJHx7vAwjZi8SMNLhIfm_OCljk=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68974775/16BR_Gameplay_Screenshots_Cinematic_Still6_1920x1080_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iNWgWF"&gt;I woke up at 3AM this morning so I could help a glowing butterfly save all of reality. At least I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that’s what happened during the most recent mind-bending &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; event, which kicked off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;the game’s new season&lt;/a&gt; and served as a showcase for its narrative ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vW4tn9"&gt;Epic’s battle royale has become defined in part by its massive in-game events. There was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/30/17521122/fortnite-rocket-launch-epic-games-dimensional-rift"&gt;the original rocket launch in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701930/fortnite-epic-games-live-event-mecha-monster-battle-showdown-giant-robot"&gt;the sprawling mech vs. kaiju battle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"&gt;a black hole that erased the original &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;took the game down for several days&lt;/a&gt;. Last season ended with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;Marvel villain Galactus fighting millions of players&lt;/a&gt;, creating a rift that caused multiple realities to converge. These events have been exciting in part because they were shared, something...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get a one-year Paramount Plus subscription for half off</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ViacomCBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gNbBu6"&gt;Earlier this month, streaming service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299615/paramount-plus-launch-date-price-cbs-all-access-shows-movies"&gt;CBS All Access was rebranded as Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;, combining the franchises and assets from both Viacom and CBS. It offers a wide range of TV shows and movies available to stream from studios and networks such as CBS, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, and Paramount Pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqt494"&gt;If you are interested in &lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/1013037/3065?subId1=VergeDeals031621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F"&gt;subscribing to Paramount Plus and want to save some money&lt;/a&gt;, you can get a one-year subscription with ads for $30, or get a one-year subscription with no ads for only $50. There are a few steps you need to follow to apply the code, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCx2Y1"&gt;First, you will need to go to the Paramount Plus website, click “Try It Free,” and choose the plan you want; at the bottom of the subscription plans, check the box that reads...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will court independent writers to its Substack competitor with paid deals</title>

  &lt;p id="kDNMAO"&gt;Facebook wants to be a part of the newsletter business, and it’s willing to pay for it. &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-paying-writers-journalists-pages-0b96d3cd-e61b-4435-9f54-99aed136f932.html"&gt;reports today&lt;/a&gt; that the company will soon start testing its newsletter product, which will integrate with Pages. As part of that test, Facebook will also court writers, some of whom the company will pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Enshkz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t name any writers and says the product itself is still unnamed, but it also reports the initial user group will be composed of small and independent writers. This newsletter tool will also help writers set up a website outside Facebook. The idea is that writers can charge for subscriptions to their work and potentially create additional revenue streams while relying on Facebook to engage their community. Facebook will let them...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoPro relaunches its smartphone app as Quik, adds private feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CrwZ9aavuhr55J7xu3EqwqAify0=/154x0:2176x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68974451/Screen_Shot_2021_03_16_at_8.43.54_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X1771D"&gt;GoPro is releasing a new version of its main smartphone app that will now be called “Quik.” The new app will remain the main interface for connecting to and controlling GoPro cameras, but it is also getting new features, including one called “mural” that’s sort of like a private Instagram feed meant to help people organize their favorite images and videos — regardless of whether they were taken by a GoPro camera — and save them from the “abyss of your camera roll,” GoPro CEO Nick Woodman says in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcjzPV"&gt;Close followers of GoPro’s efforts in the software space know that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/3/11571528/gopro-mobile-video-editing-apps-quik-splice"&gt;already once launched an app called Quik way back in 2016&lt;/a&gt; that was all about auto-editing footage to a beat. But that app has not been supported for a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Corsair’s K65 RGB Mini gaming keyboard is for people who think less is more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Corsair K65 RGB Mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CGabiSy4wE3nn1pdZa8U_LEImFQ=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973934/k65rgbminilede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Corsair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mj6MdJ"&gt;Corsair is the latest company to introduce a 60-percent wired mechanical keyboard of its own, lopping off the arrow keys and other functions for a more compact design. The K65 RGB Mini costs $110 and has a design that is about as subtle as Corsair has ever produced. It connects via its included, detachable USB-C-to-USB-A braided cable to your PC, macOS computer, or Xbox One.
