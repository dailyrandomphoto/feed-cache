    <title>Climate tech is about to fly commercial</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hiring private contractors to sample greenhouse gases from the air is an important aspect of NOAA’s climate research. Here, Paolo Wilczak pilots a sampling flight over southeastern Connecticut on April 25, 2020, as part of the East Coast Outflow field mission. The Global Monitoring Laboratory hopes to add civilian airliners to its sampling fleet.&amp;nbsp; | Paolo Wilczak, Scientific Aviation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7IXYA"&gt;A greenhouse gas-tracking technology is about to go commercial. Greenhouse gas detectors will soon take flight on an Alaska Airlines-run Boeing 737-9, in an effort to help federal scientists get even more information about how we’re changing the climate. The tools would measure concentrations of planet-heating pollution in the air, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwQyHa"&gt;They’re calling the plane, which won’t have any passengers, an “&lt;a href="http://www.boeing.com/principles/environment/ecodemonstrator"&gt;ecoDemonstrator&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s testing a number of contraptions along with the greenhouse-gas detector — including features that might make the plane more fuel-efficient or less noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bR1OzA"&gt;Over several test flights this year, NOAA will figure out the best place to install their...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google confirms diversity exec no longer in role after problematic post</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="laUksJ"&gt;One of Google’s top executives in diversity strategy and research has left his post after a 2007 blog post slamming the state of Israel resurfaced on June 1st. In the post, Kamau Bobb used antisemitic language, insinuating Jews have an “insatiable appetite for war and killing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z37YRi"&gt;The post was quickly picked up by the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt;. “While Google has been a vocal supporter of diversity initiatives... it has not commented on the recent spike in anti-Semitic hate crimes,” &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/google-diversity-head-said-jews-have-insatiable-appetite-for-war/"&gt;read a &lt;em&gt;Washington Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article on the subject&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qvq8H6"&gt;But the controversy likely didn’t start with the right-wing press. It seems to have initiated internally, with an email from a member of Google’s Jewish employee resource group. On June...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook to end special treatment for politicians after Trump ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s8ob2M-0BqMSQNF9E8FC2boLdsc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69402015/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SY6tpr"&gt;Facebook plans to end its controversial policy that mostly shields politicians from the content moderation rules that apply to other users, a sharp reversal that could have global ramifications for how elected officials use the social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1TpWJ"&gt;The change, which Facebook is set to announce as soon as Friday, comes after the Oversight Board — an independent group funded by Facebook to review its thorniest content rulings — affirmed its decision to suspend former President Donald Trump but critiqued the special treatment it gives politicians, stating that the “same rules should apply to all users.” The board gave Facebook till June 5th to respond to its policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is updating AirTags to make them less creepy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oQ4Ki1"&gt;Apple is distributing an AirTags software update that makes it harder for people to use them for surreptitious tracking, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-bolsters-airtag-privacy-measures-to-offer-android-detector-app-later-this-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. According to a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Apple is also working on an app for Android users which will let them detect potentially unwanted trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoHH1q"&gt;AirTags were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as Apple’s solution for helping people keep track of everyday objects. In its marketing, Apple shows people finding their lost keys or bags that have the trackers attached. However, there have been concerns the tiny devices are being used to secretly track people without their knowledge, and we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airtags-review/"&gt;numerous reports&lt;/a&gt; since the AirTags’ release indicating that some tweaks were needed to make the devices more...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden signs order banning US investment in Chinese surveillance companies</title>

  &lt;p id="MCTXS2"&gt;President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/03/executive-order-on-addressing-the-threat-from-securities-investments-that-finance-certain-companies-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; Thursday expanding a Trump-era ban on Americans investing in Chinese companies with purported ties to China’s military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuZtJK"&gt;The order increases the number of restricted Chinese companies from 48 to 59. It also rewrites &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2020/11/12/trump-bans-americans-from-investing-in-companies-that-support-chinas-military/"&gt;a previous order issued&lt;/a&gt; by former President Donald Trump to include companies that create and deploy surveillance technology, like the technology used against Muslim minorities and dissidents in Hong Kong. The move signals that Biden plans to continue some of the same China-related policies previously put in place by the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTLXar"&gt;The order does not include DJI, WeChat, TikTok, or its parent company ByteDance among the 59 companies, despite previous concerns about...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xfpmOJ"&gt;The primary difference between what the service is calling its “essential” plan and the more expensive commercial-free plan — besides the addition of ads — is some missing content. The $10 commercial-free plan includes both local and national news coverage with CBSN and CBS live, whereas the new essential plan only includes national news with CBSN. There’s more sports coverage on the commercial-free plan as well, and premium users also get support for offline downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8WQQg"&gt;Both plans include access to tens of thousands of TV episodes and movies, as well as the platform’s originals, but premium...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford delays Mustang Mach-E deliveries in the UK due to ‘safety risk’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GUYK8m"&gt;Deliveries of Ford’s first long-range electric vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E, in the United Kingdom are on hold after a “safety risk” was discovered, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. It’s the latest delivery snafu to hit the automaker’s much-hyped electric SUV, after US customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22234668/ford-delays-deliveries-mustang-mach-e-quality-checks"&gt;experienced similar delays earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bhxrK"&gt;But while the cause of the US delivery delays was unknown, the UK delays are a result of “incorrect location information when using the eCall system,” according to documents viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The eCall system, in which emergency services are notified when a vehicle’s airbags are deployed, &lt;a href="https://www.carbuyer.co.uk/tips-and-advice/155428/ecall-explained"&gt;is a European Union requirement&lt;/a&gt; in all vehicles manufactured after 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gCPc5S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“incorrect location information when using the eCall system”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Nanoleaf’s light-up wall panels now look like wood accent pieces</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K7ycSs"&gt;Nanoleaf, the company best known for illuminated panels that you stick to your wall, has announced the new Nanoleaf Elements line, a set of wall panels that are designed to look as nice turned off as they do when on. The new Elements line accomplishes this through a wood-like veneer that allows the light to shine through when its on but doesn’t look blank when the light isn’t in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0Lwaz"&gt;Aside from the new veneer, the Elements lights are very similar to Nanoleaf’s other hexagonal light panels. They glow from both the front and back of the panel, allowing for a double lighting effect, and can be programmed with different lighting patterns and effects.
