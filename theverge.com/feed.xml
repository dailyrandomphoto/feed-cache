  &lt;p id="MbSbzA"&gt;A company called Throwboy is &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/throwboy/the-iconic-pillow-collection-2-by-throwboy/description"&gt;back with another Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; for a collection of pillows shaped like classic Macs, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/18/17715884/throwboy-pillow-retro-macintosh-imac-iphone-ipod-nostalgia"&gt;its 2018 line of Apple-inspired plushes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s fittingly called The Iconic Pillow Collection 2, and features pillows shaped like soft versions of Apple’s Lisa, iBook, and both the cheese grater and cube flavors of Power Mac. For Apple history buffs who want to spruce up their living or bedrooms, it may be a campaign worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xB3tvA"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/throwboy/the-iconic-pillow-collection-by-throwboy/description"&gt;its original collection&lt;/a&gt; (which featured pillows shaped like the Finder icon, original Macintosh, and iPods), Throwboy tactfully didn’t mention specific computer names, and it refrained from doing so this time around as well. The Lisa-shaped pillow is called the 1983, the iMac...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox has been down for days and it’s not because of Chipotle</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="akdtjY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has been down for more than two days, with the game and its related website offline for millions of players. The hugely popular game-creating platform first started having issues at around 7PM ET on October 28th. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; initially said it was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454105518197280770"&gt;working hard to get things back to normal&lt;/a&gt;,” and that it had identified “the root cause as [an] internal system issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wh8QEC"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; late Saturday, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; confirmed its platform wasn’t down due to an “external intrusion,” and that the company is working “around the clock” to resolve the huge outage. “We believe we have identified an underlying internal cause of the outage with no evidence of an external intrusion,” says a &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;spokesperson. “We are in the process of performing...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Listen to Device Orchestra cover the Ghostbusters theme using electric toothbrushes and a steam iron</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5DHGtI"&gt;An inspired musician can use pretty much anything as an instrument, but this just-in-time for Halloween cover of the &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; theme song goes in an unexpected direction. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDwMh0pu1iSXeKx7qmqjIQA"&gt;Device Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to posting music videos recorded solely with the sounds of common household devices. It’s the work of a Finnish YouTuber who’s been creating gadget-powered covers since 2014 (via &lt;a href="https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Device_Orchestra"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wikitubia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This time, Device Orchestra busted out 14 gadgets for its composition — including electric toothbrushes adorned with googly eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjHgYQ"&gt;One electric toothbrush with pipe cleaners for arms stands front and center, belting out the familiar chorus in a tone comparable to a musically-inclined bumblebee. It might be the star of the show, but it has plenty of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nikon Z9’s new sensor could be the start of a big shift in photography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/na8o3ezZK2iyEyZun5OTW9ohOI0=/27x0:1143x744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70067206/nikon_z9_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikon’s Z9 pro mirrorless camera has no mechanical shutter, relying solely on an electronic shutter.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nikon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Manxm0"&gt;Nikon recently &lt;a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/about-nikon/press-room/press-release/kv76k47t/THE-NIKON-Z-9%3A-UNSTOPPABLE-PERFORMANCE,-REVOLUTIONARY-INNOVATION.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its new flagship camera, the &lt;a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/mirrorless-cameras/z-9.html#tab-ProductDetail-ProductTabs-Overview"&gt;Z9&lt;/a&gt;. This camera represents Nikon’s first mirrorless camera fully geared towards professional photographers and hybrid shooters, with &lt;a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/mirrorless-cameras/z-9.html#tab-ProductDetail-ProductTabs-TechSpecs"&gt;a huge spec list&lt;/a&gt; designed for use in the demanding fields of photojournalism, sports, nature, birding, and any other use-cases that call for a camera that shoots incredibly fast at high resolution. The $5,500 Z9 is also Nikon’s first camera to omit a traditional mechanical shutter, allowing it to achieve new levels of speed and autofocus performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBvwh0"&gt;Faster speed is great, especially for sports photographers. But it’s interesting to think about where this technology could be used to take traditional-style cameras in the future. This might be the first...&lt;/p&gt;

The platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;previously put restrictions on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt; in late 2020, but didn’t have policies specific to kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmqQSZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/supporting-covid-19-vaccine-children/"&gt;Meta says in a new blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it’s partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to take down harmful content related to children and the COVID-19 vaccine.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oBMn3J"&gt;One of the most anticipated rounds of international climate negotiations this decade will go down at a United Nations summit in Glasgow over the next couple weeks. But many representatives from the frontlines of the climate crisis won’t be there: people from islands that may be lost under rising seas, representatives of indigenous tribes, and activists who typically turn high-level negotiations into boisterous events with their demonstrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4SozB"&gt;The 26th annual United Nations Conference of Parties, or COP26, is the five-year anniversary of the Paris climate accords. Signatories, which included nearly every country on Earth, agreed to limit global warming to a level that might be manageable for humanity. Those nations are not close to...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Gqi8p"&gt;Federal authorities have accused a Minnesota man with trying to extort $150,000 from Major League Baseball after hacking into its computer system. The US Attorney’s office for the southern district of New York and the FBI have charged Joshua Streit, 30, with illegally streaming content from MLB, as well as from the National Hockey League (NHL), the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the National Football League (NFL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4Z57l"&gt;The law enforcement agencies &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/minnesota-man-charged-computer-intrusion-and-illegally-streaming-content-four-major"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt; that between 2017 through August of 2021, Streit operated a website where he illegally streamed the sports leagues’ live games for profit. He gained unauthorized access to the leagues’ websites, and misappropriated login credentials from legitimate subscribers,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save on spooky games to play during Halloween and more</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, Deathloop isn’t scary, but the deal on it is scary good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CQivMw"&gt;It’s the spooky holiday this weekend, but you probably already knew that since Halloween decorations have likely been up in your town for the last month and a half. But what hasn’t been around as long (and will disappear faster than those decorations) are the deals below. To match the mood, we’re going to share special discounts on scary video games that you need to play if you’re trying to get in the holiday spirit this weekend. Just so you know, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/"&gt;Steam’s Halloween sale&lt;/a&gt; ends Monday, November 1st, likely at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. Following that gaming-centric section, you’ll find deals on tech gadgets that we think you’ll enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CNedqh"&gt;Gaming deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="02VKZg"&gt;Okay, so &lt;em&gt;Deathloop &lt;/em&gt;is far from being a scary game at its core (though it can become &lt;em&gt;quite &lt;/em&gt;tense when...&lt;/p&gt;
