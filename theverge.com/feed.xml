    <title>More Americans believe in climate change but still can’t quit fossil fuels</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0GLLqC"&gt;Nearly two-thirds of Americans now believe that climate change is an urgent problem to address, but they aren’t nearly as enthusiastic about giving up oil and gas, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/05/26/gen-z-millennials-stand-out-for-climate-change-activism-social-media-engagement-with-issue/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; by the Pew Research Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNCsqO"&gt;Only one-third of people surveyed supported completely phasing out fossil fuels. Less than half of respondents are okay with phasing out new gas-powered vehicles. Taking those steps might seem drastic, considering fossil fuels currently&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;make up about 80 percent of the &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/"&gt;US energy mix&lt;/a&gt;. But phasing out most, if not all, fossil fuels is pretty much in line with what’s needed to meet the scale of the climate crisis, according to climate experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5d6ue"&gt;Now that many Americans are taking the threats posed by climate change seriously,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sweet Tooth’s post-apocalyptic world is meant to be a ‘storybook dystopia’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sweet Tooth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ymQ4ISwGyqF38yelfVW7-yxxCtM=/0x1:3600x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345107/sto105_nf_pull_02a_20210412R.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tq3UIB"&gt;Jeff Lemire’s &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; is a comic book about a young boy surviving in a world ravaged by a pandemic. He also happens to be a “hybrid,” a new breed of half-human, half-animal creature that began to appear alongside the deadly sickness. It’s a dark story, one that had the potential to be incredibly bleak and uncomfortable when translated to television. That’s particularly true now, as the real world continues to deal with its own pandemic. For the team adapting the story for an upcoming series on Netflix, all of these factors combined to create a slightly different approach. “It made us lean more into the hope,” executive producer Amanda Burrell says of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95Mwbd"&gt;Netflix’s eight-episode &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; series will debut on June 4th. It’s a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb’s CEO thinks the platform can replace your landlord</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dJa8tz"&gt;Airbnb doesn’t want you to forget about Airbnb, especially when you’re planning post-pandemic vacations. So on Monday, the company &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2F2021&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;made multiple announcements&lt;/a&gt; all seemingly designed to get people renting, traveling, and, crucially, choosing Airbnb to do so. It announced flexible booking, which lets people search across days, weeks, or months to plan a trip, as well as more location flexibility when looking for a place to stay. It also launched a faster onboarding process for hosts, during a time when competitors &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vrbo-isnt-airbnbs-problem-11621510202"&gt;like Vrbo&lt;/a&gt; are trying to poach them, as well as a new service for Super Hosts that’ll allow them to reach out to the Airbnb team directly for support issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGOYoA"&gt;“We just think there’s this huge inflection point in travel brought on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waze names former Hotwire president Neha Parikh as CEO</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vkqXaJ"&gt;Waze has a new CEO: Neha Parikh, the former president of Hotwire and a board member of Carvana. Parikh replaces Noam Bardin, who &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/waze-ceo-noam-bardin-to-leave-company-in-early-2021/"&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt; as CEO of the Google-owned navigation service last November after leading the company for 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6epDlZ"&gt;Parikh will join Waze as CEO starting in June, the company says. She is a veteran of online hospitality brand Expedia, having served in a variety of positions at two of the corporation’s subsidiaries: Hotels.com, where she ended as senior vice president for global brands and retails, and flight and hotel booking service Hotwire, where she is currently president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqTWlU"&gt;As Hotwire’s youngest and first female president, Parikh “led a return to growth by revamping the business model, reshaping the product,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Open-world RPG Pokémon Legends: Arceus is launching January 28th, 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g64PMho72s9zQBWQ1R2ecbLzm-g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344706/Switch_PokemonLegendsArceus_Screenshot__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJVRpG"&gt;Possibly the most ambitious &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game to date will be available early next year. Today &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1397539085921800194"&gt;Nintendo announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt; will be launching on the Nintendo Switch on January 28th, 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302841/pokemon-legends-arceus-open-world-rpg-nintendo-switch"&gt;The game was first announced in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECigw4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; looks to be a big change for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, a franchise that’s become known for its slowly evolving roleplaying games. It’s an open-world RPG that takes place in a much older version of the Sinnoh region, before the time of pokémon trainers and organized competitions. In addition to the new setting, the experience also looks to be much more seamless compared to the main games, as Nintendo says players will be able to go out into the wild to “study the pokémon’s behaviors, sneak up to them, then...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now hide like counts on Instagram and Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwbQvj1_XrGbBaO54-q2kLj4b3I=/40x0:1660x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344538/IG_Hiding_Likes__Consumer_View_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8k7TKT"&gt;You can now hide like counts on Instagram and Facebook. After years of testing on both platforms, Facebook and Instagram have settled on an opt-in experience for hiding like counts to allow people to disable seeing them across all posts and an option to hide their own public like counts from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYfAa7"&gt;Instagram is enabling this feature after years of tests and pressure from experts to make changes to its platform. The service was ranked as “the most detrimental to young people’s mental health and wellbeing” in a &lt;a href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/about-us/news/instagram-ranked-worst-for-young-people-s-mental-health.html"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; by the Royal Society for Public Health UK. &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/how-removing-likes-from-instagram-could-affect-our-mental-health"&gt;Experts have argued&lt;/a&gt; that removing a like button or like counts could help reduce anxiety and social pressures for some Facebook and Instagram users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon buys MGM for $8.45 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MGM Logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QRNGpUaT8r90oQ1ZabsmhoMuYFg=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344420/mgm-logo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Metro Goldwyn Mayer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Keh1ON"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-and-mgm-have-signed-agreement-amazon-acquire-mgm"&gt;reached a deal&lt;/a&gt; to acquire the film and TV company MGM for $8.45 billion, the companies announced today. It’s a significant acquisition for the e-commerce giant, and it means it will own a library of content that’s reported to consist of around &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/22/hollywood-giant-mgm-puts-itself-up-for-sale-at-5bn"&gt;4,000 films and 17,000 hours of TV&lt;/a&gt;. The acquisition is likely to help Amazon attract even more big-spending Prime subscribers as its Prime Video service competes with the likes of Netflix and Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meMfR2"&gt;MGM is perhaps most notable for being the Hollywood studio behind the James Bond and Rocky franchises, but its library runs the gamut from classic films like &lt;em&gt;12 Angry Men&lt;/em&gt; to modern TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Vikings&lt;/em&gt;. MGM’s library also includes unscripted TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell is offering $230 off one of its standout gaming monitors</title>

The 27-inch peripheral is currently on &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-14367655?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fproductdetail%2F8vvq" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sale at Dell for $380&lt;/a&gt; — more than $200 off the initial list price — and it touts a 165Hz refresh rate, HDR, and support for both FreeSync and G-Sync, helping to smooth gameplay and reduce unwanted tearing.

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of app reviews detailing the scammy behavior.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288727349657604" target="_blank"&gt;Kosta Eleftheriou&lt;/a&gt; / App Store&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kxk3Bk"&gt;App developer and scam app hunter Kosta Eleftheriou’s latest discovery is a real doozy, an iOS app that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288720357679104?s=21"&gt;refuses to function&lt;/a&gt; before you give it at least a 3-star review in the App Store. Although the UPNP Xtreme app — which claimed to let users stream video to their TVs — now appears to have &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1223416942"&gt;been pulled&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to verify that it generates the App Store rating box the second it opens. You can’t dismiss the ratings box, nor can you tap the 1 or 2-star ratings, Eleftheriou said. We verified this behavior, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/prvrtl/status/1397301269279223809"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; other &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HenrickTheBull/status/1397346867965571073"&gt;users &lt;/a&gt;report they were able to dismiss the dialog box or leave a lower rating.&lt;/p&gt;
