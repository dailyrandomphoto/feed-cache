    <title>The new pro football NFT marketplace has a name: NFL All Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tjap9m"&gt;It has been less than a year since NBA Top Shot served as an introduction for many sports fans into the world of NFTs, and now the NFL is lining up a similar arrangement. In September, the league &lt;a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-nflpa-and-dapper-labs-announce-new-nft-deal-to-create-exclusive-digital-vide"&gt;announced a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with the company that runs Top Shot, Dapper Labs, and now we know the name of the service that will distribute the video highlight clips that make up the “Moments” that become NFTs: NFL All Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KtwLOm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Can the NBA make NFTs cool?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="5UryIF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2MLFDr"&gt;This effort is separate from the Ticketmaster-powered NFTs that the NFL is tying to selected games this season (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789265/nft-nfl-football-commerative-ticketmaster"&gt;the Lions’ annual Thanksgiving appearance on national TV&lt;/a&gt;), but launching the branding now doesn’t feel like a coincidence. There will be many blockchain and NFT discussions amongst family members on Thursday,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Almost buying a copy of the Constitution is easy, but giving the money back is hard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2eLo8BE5M_FA0IJGJi47jvLYoGM=/0x0:1746x1164/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70190316/constdao.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of 13 remaining copies of the Official Edition of the Constitution. | Image: Sotheby’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ps4ajp"&gt;As of last Thursday night, ConstitutionDAO found itself in possession of around $49.8 million it wasn’t able to spend. The group’s organizers only had a mandate to spend the crowdfunded money on one thing — a rare copy of the US Constitution &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790452/constitutiondao-loses-auction-for-rare-us-constitution-copy-sothebys"&gt;that they failed to win at auction&lt;/a&gt; — so instead of trying to get community approval to use the money toward some other goal, they instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799192/constitutiondao-shutting-down-lost-auction-refunds"&gt;began the process of returning the funds to backers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUdMUT"&gt;Returning that much money has been a tricky process, though. Backers have to manually request refunds, so even a week later, tens of millions of dollars are still sitting in ConstitutionDAO’s pockets. And because all of the money was collected in Ether, and sending funds over Ethereum incurs high transaction...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oculus Quest 2 comes with a free $50 gift card through Saturday</title>

  &lt;p id="qbcCmK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 5:33PM ET, November 24th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Amazon now has &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099VMT8VZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;an actual price cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; on the 128GB model, dropping from $299.99 to $249.99. Not only can you currently get this price, but entering OCULUS50 at checkout will earn you a $50 Amazon credit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HY1DtN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 standalone VR headset&lt;/a&gt; is a great value at its regular $299.99 price. It comes with 128GB of onboard storage, and once you log in with your Facebook account, there’s little else standing in your way of finding some amazing virtual reality experiences and games. It’s even more of an appealing holiday gift idea right now because you can get one with a $50 gift card tossed in at no extra charge through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; until Saturday, November 27th. Several retailers are honoring this promotion,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Friday 2021 smart home tech deals: speakers, cameras, robots, and more </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uNHMij"&gt;There is never a better time to dive into the smart home than Black Friday and its close cousin Cyber Monday. Traditionally, tech deals on home gadgets are huge this time of year, plus, it’s the only time you’ll find real bargains on gear from some of the smaller companies, such as Eve, Level, and Nanoleaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjy6kh"&gt;Whether you’re thinking about dipping a toe into this home automation shindig with a smart speaker or maybe a connected door lock, or want to bolster an already impressive smart home setup, it’s worth investing some cash this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRU2qz"&gt;Also, if you just want to upgrade your home cleaning routine or have a way to check in on Fido now that you’re back at work (the separation anxiety is real), this is a good time to get a great...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democrats’ plan to boost ‘tree equity’ is actually a good idea </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ilMjE4"&gt;Trees have become a contentious piece of Democrats’ Build Back Better Act, the budget reconciliation bill that encompasses sweeping social and environmental programs. Congressional Republicans have seized on the $3 billion in the proposed nearly $2 trillion bill earmarked for planting trees, with a focus on boosting ‘tree equity’ — despite the fact that this is a strategy that experts say could reduce health disparities in cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sUyYU"&gt;While opponents have called the tree equity provisions an indicator of Democrats’ “reckless spending &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepBalderson/status/1455180262082596866"&gt;spree&lt;/a&gt;” and a “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepFrenchHill/status/1455255972700729349"&gt;waste&lt;/a&gt; [of] even more taxpayer dollars,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in reality, disparities in tree coverage across American cities are a huge problem that affects heat exposure, air quality and more, with serious...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Macy’s is auctioning off Thanksgiving Day Parade NFTs, including this creepy elf</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Elf is one of 10 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade NFTs up for auction. | Image: Macy’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8XPy4T"&gt;Macy’s department stores might be closed this Thanksgiving, but that doesn’t mean the company has run out of things to sell. The retailer is auctioning off &lt;a href="https://www.macys.com/social/macys-parade-nft/"&gt;10 one-of-a-kind NFTs&lt;/a&gt; to mark the 95th year of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqPJUa"&gt;Each NFT references a parade balloon from decades past, going back to a black and white toy soldier from the 1920s. Also featured is an elf character from the 2000s and a spaceman from the 1950s, who &lt;a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/despite-predictions-of-the-day-before-that-rain-was-in-news-photo/97328196?adppopup=true"&gt;lost an arm&lt;/a&gt; in the 1955 parade after colliding with a lamppost (the NFT version is fully inflated). Proceeds from the auction benefit the Make-A-Wish Foundation, with current bids generating tens of thousands of dollars. The auction ends on November 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47enlx"&gt;In addition to the 10 unique NFTs, Macy’s is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US banking regulators are looking to clarify crypto rules in 2022 </title>

&lt;p id="aLGXuV"&gt;The agencies say they’re focusing on setting expectations for what banks can do when it comes to holding crypto, allowing customers to obtain crypto, issuing their own stablecoins (or cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to a fiat currency like the US dollar), and taking crypto as collateral for loans and keeping it on their balance sheets. According to the letter, the goal is to make sure consumers are protected and that banks act responsibly. The...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5KTAD"&gt;Whether you’re overdue for a new pair or are just trying to cancel out the usual onslaught of holiday music, Black Friday season is a great time to invest in some noise-canceling headphones. You’ll find significant discounts on many of our favorite headphones featured in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;noise-canceling headphones buying guide&lt;/a&gt;. These include picks from Sony, Bose, Apple, Sennheiser, and others. In some cases, these deals will save you $100 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKhJxM"&gt;Aside from the steep discounts, another good thing about buying headphones during the holidays is the extended return period at many retailers. That gives you plenty of time to try out your new cans and make sure the sound quality, ANC, comfort, and other factors are all to your liking before you’re stuck...&lt;/p&gt;
