    <title>Apple’s AirPods Max are $80 off at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SRGhSB"&gt;Apple’s notoriously expensive AirPods Max headphones are, in some ways, more of a luxury purchase — but today you can live it up for just a little less thanks to the Woot’s &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13527013?sid=VergeDailyDeals080221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Fplus%2Fsounds-of-summer-the-sequel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ongoing “Sounds of Summer” sale&lt;/a&gt;. Well, if you’re an Amazon Prime member that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0pq3w"&gt;Now through the end of the month (or while supplies last), &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836602-13527013?sid=VergeDailyDeals090221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-max-headphones-1%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Prime members can save $80&lt;/a&gt; on a pair of the AirPods Max, regardless of color. Woot’s current deal includes a one-year limited warranty from Apple and brings the price down to a cool $470, one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on Apple’s excellent noise-canceling headphones in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugKTpB"&gt;Despite their price, the AirPods Max are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now. The Max can easily block out...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What losing Paradise tells us about today’s blazes</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Town Of Paradise Wiped Out By The Camp Wildfire Continues Long Struggle To Rebuild" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cz7Q3X_tMqEXSQghvXbFq2fk2UU=/21x0:4770x3166/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807720/1129061457.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EaSZSC"&gt;Thousands of Californians have fled their homes this week, as the Caldor, Dixie and other fires &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/"&gt;continue to blaze&lt;/a&gt; across the state. Despite the best efforts of firefighting teams, the Dixie Fire already torched the small mountain town of Greenville in early August, robbing many residents of a home to which to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRtPXd"&gt;The exodus sparked by each blaze has become an eerily familiar scene as fire seasons in the Western US grow more intense with climate change. Each community that loses part, or all of itself brings to mind the carnage left behind by the Camp Fire in 2018. That’s when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21300937/coronavirus-pandemic-california-wildfires-high-school-paradise-climate-change-graduation"&gt;Paradise, California&lt;/a&gt; was nearly wiped off the map, and surrounding communities suffered similar losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PR4VUz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Paradise is worth being remembered”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Music startup Roli has filed for administration and is reforming as beginner-focused Luminary</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3sVXRF2IFRuJloVLXFWhexbc-qI=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807718/JN_200917_ROLI_6342.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OGifix"&gt;UK music startup Roli, best known for its squishy keyboards like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/23/9372961/roli-seaboard-rise-grand-hands-on"&gt;the Seaboard Rise&lt;/a&gt;, has filed for administration and is reforming as Luminary. The new company will focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572899/roli-lumi-review-features-specs-price"&gt;the Lumi keyboard and app&lt;/a&gt;, which are designed to teach beginners to play the piano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lcf7bH"&gt;The news was &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/roli-administration-luminary-hoxton-seaboard-lumi-music-2021-9"&gt;reported by&lt;em&gt; Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which notes that Roli has struggled with generating revenue and growth. The company reported pre-tax losses of £34.1 million ($47 million) from income of £11.4 million ($16 million) in the 18 months leading up to the end of June 2019. The company’s CEO and founder Roland Lamb told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that a limited market for its products had combined with pandemic difficulties to force the closure of Roli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYvgrI"&gt;“Ultimately what happened was the pro-focused products...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fashion follows function: what’s next for the phone industry</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KsdFVb"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is a totally normal phone with One Weird Trick: it folds. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Dan Seifert explained in our full review&lt;/a&gt;, it’s the beginning of a new phase for foldables, one where buying a folding phone is something that could appeal to anybody, not just techies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6wHfV"&gt;Samsung is promoting the phone in the ways Samsung usually does, touting features and spec improvements. But it’s also doing another thing: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r75GjfTy2_w"&gt;promoting the phone as something stylish&lt;/a&gt;. A full-on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsLP5SLsUY0"&gt;music video ad with BTS&lt;/a&gt; joins online vertical video ads that are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r75GjfTy2_w"&gt;as focused on the clothing and pockets the phone fits&lt;/a&gt; in as the phone itself. In essence, it’s the latest in a long time of tech companies trying to make the case that their phones are fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MJ77E"&gt;That’s nothing new, but it’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia Broadcast now works with more cameras and uses less VRAM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aLlIgVb9NdLOZuHncbDwADfT1Ng=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807652/NVIDIA_Broacast_v_1.3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dYR7n0"&gt;Nvidia is updating its Broadcast app to improve noise removal, support more cameras, and reduce the amount of VRAM used by the app. Nvidia Broadcast is primarily used by streamers and content creators to filter out background noise from a microphone, or blur a backdrop for a webcam. Nvidia is focusing on improving these main use cases with version 1.3 today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KzgRa"&gt;While Nvidia Broadcast has become a popular choice for streamers, the app would sometimes filter out high-pitched voices when someone was speaking excitedly. “The new update addresses this with dedicated training sound profiles to retain that speech while removing the unwanted background noise,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fsept-2021-nvidia-broadcast-update%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F2%2F22653658%2Fnvidia-broadcast-version-1-3-update-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;. That should mean any screaming or shock moments on stream will no longer be...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What If...?’s art style aims to keep characters ‘feeling monumental and powerful’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRzk4q"&gt;Ryan Meinerding has spent much of the last 15 years bringing some of the world’s most iconic superheroes to life. After starting as an illustrator on the original &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt;, he worked his way up to head of visual development at Marvel Studios and has spent more than a decade figuring out how to bring comic book characters into live-action films. So it was a nice change of pace when he learned about &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;, an animated anthology that takes those very same characters but remixes them in new, and often strange, situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GGRyg"&gt;“I don’t think anyone could have come up with an animated project that I would’ve been more interested in working on,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The endless possibilities that are created by having the multiverse, by being...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get great audio for podcast interviews</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zIlUWq"&gt;Podcasts continue to be very popular, and more and more people are getting involved in them. Even if you’re not a podcast creator, at some point, you may find yourself being interviewed on or contributing to someone else’s podcast. In that case, it’s not enough to be ready to talk about your topic — you also want to make sure your voice comes through loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VhHII"&gt;We asked &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s senior audio engineer Andrew Marino if he had any audio tips for people who are about to participate in a podcast. Here are his answers to our questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vwNkk4"&gt;Is it better to use my phone’s mic or use my Bluetooth headset?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AS7hH2"&gt;If this is a live show, the quality of the call is important, as there can be no editing later on, so you want to get good sound. (We’ll...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRYLN3"&gt;Sony is announcing that it will hold a special PlayStation showcase on September 9th.

&lt;p id="t9XvQz"&gt;Sony could be ready to launch a new PS5 system software update that it has been beta testing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;The update unlocks M.2 SSD support&lt;/a&gt;, and also includes some UI improvements to the PS5 dashboard and 3D audio support for built-in TV speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JBL boosts the durability of its popular Flip Bluetooth speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The JBL Flip 6.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: JBL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qDPNgb"&gt;JBL has announced an update to its popular lineup of Flip Bluetooth speakers with the Flip 6. Perhaps the biggest change is that the latest speaker is now officially dustproof thanks to its IP67 rating, while the Flip 5 was officially only waterproof (IPX7). Its Bluetooth version has also been boosted from 4.2 to 5.1, and it features a newly redesigned JBL logo. Battery life is unchanged at around 12 hours. It’ll retail for $129.95 when it goes on sale in December in the US, up from the Flip 5’s current $119.95 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMqwmi"&gt;The Flip 6 is just one of a host of new audio products JBL is announcing today. There’s also the Partybox 110 and 710, two large rugged speakers which feature guitar and mic inputs for impromptu music-making and which will...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qBkr5U"&gt;We don’t often write about bicycle components, but it’s not everyday that an innovation like the &lt;a href="https://www.schaeffler.com/content.schaeffler.com/en/news_media/press_releases/press_releases_detail.jsp?id=87716736"&gt;Schaeffler Free Drive&lt;/a&gt; is announced for pedal-assisted e-bikes. The so-called “bike-by-wire” system, first &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/31/radical-new-electric-bike-drive-systems-requires-no-chains-or-belts-entirely-ride-by-wire/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, dispenses with the need to string a chain or belt between the pedals and wheel hub. It’s an all-electric drive system that allows for entirely new bicycle designs with fewer moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfxYfG"&gt;The Free Drive system works by converting the rider’s pedaling power into electrical energy via a small generator housed between the pedals. It then delivers this energy to the rear wheel (or wheels) via cables strung inside or outside the frame of the bike, rather than sending it mechanically through a chain or belt. Excess energy...&lt;/p&gt;
