    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MediaTek’s new Dimensity 9000 flagship could compete with Qualcomm’s top-tier Snapdragon chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4slEI1ao4vAnpgNt-xQBvC0A7xI=/121x0:1654x1022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70162443/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_5.12.45_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="goAfye"&gt;MediaTek has just announced its latest flagship processor: the Dimensity 9000, the company’s most powerful chip ever that looks like it should be able to go head to head with the best chips that more popular competitors like Qualcomm and Samsung offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZACaL"&gt;Where previous top-tier Dimensity chips (like last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartphones/dimensity-1000-series"&gt;Dimensity 1000)&lt;/a&gt; were still less powerful than contemporaries like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 or Samsung’s Exynos 2100, the new Dimensity 9000 is coming out of the gate to make a case for 2022 Android flagships. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7kU3pO"&gt;The new Dimensity 9000 is the first mobile chip to be built on TSMC’s 4nm process, in addition to using Arm’s new v9 architecture. It’s also the first announcement CPU to use Arm’s new core designs: a single...&lt;/p&gt;

The group, which includes officials from California, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, and Vermont, accuses the company of doing this despite reports that its own research showed its platform could have a negative effect on young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VmnOr"&gt;The research in question was exposed in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;a report from the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said the company’s own documents show “Instagram Is Toxic for Teen Girls.” It was later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711947/facebook-whistleblower-teens-safety-hearing-blumenthal-algorithms-harm"&gt;discussed in a Senate hearing&lt;/a&gt;,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exxon’s new Gulf of Mexico leases aren’t what they seem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F7ttME"&gt;ExxonMobil’s &lt;a href="https://www.energyintel.com/0000017d-2f96-defa-ab7d-6fbf0ac90000"&gt;spending spree&lt;/a&gt; during yesterday’s lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico was significant, experts say, because the company might use the area for something other than oil and gas extraction. Experts outside the company speculate that ExxonMobil wants to use Gulf waters for a novel purpose: sequestering captured carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEgMko"&gt;The Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.boem.gov/newsroom/press-releases/gulf-mexico-lease-sale-results-announced"&gt;auctioned off&lt;/a&gt; vast tracts of the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas companies yesterday in one of the &lt;a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2021/11/17/massive-gulf-of-mexico-oil-lease-sale-draws-192-million-283335"&gt;largest federal lease sales in recent years&lt;/a&gt;. The sale drew sharp criticism from environmental groups, which say that allowing new oil and gas development is incompatible with America meeting its climate goals. But it’s possible that Exxon — the biggest bidder in yesterday’s sale — isn’t...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford and GM are getting into chip development to help deal with the shortage</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vMbtLf"&gt;A year into the computer chip shortage that’s heavily affecting vehicle production, Ford announced a collaboration with chipmaker GlobalFoundries Inc., as &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-enters-semiconductor-business-amid-chip-shortage-impact-11637242202?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9xEP7"&gt;Ford’s &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/11/18/globalfoundries-ford-auto-chip-supply.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; about the non-binding agreement is light on specifics but mentions plans “to advance semiconductor manufacturing and technology development within the United States.” Without committing to building any plants, the two companies say they will “explore expanded semiconductor manufacturing opportunities to support the automotive industry.” Speaking during an event later in the day, GM CEO Mark Reuss &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/gm-will-co-develop-chips-with-several-producers-to-secure-supply?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;said his company is working to co-develop new chips&lt;/a&gt; with many semiconductor partners like Qualcomm, TSMC, and others. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook tests giving more control of News Feed content to users again</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook is switching up the News Feed again | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r65vn8"&gt;Facebook parent company Meta said it &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/introducing-more-control-for-brands-and-people-in-feed"&gt;is testing new ways&lt;/a&gt; for users to customize the content they see in their News Feeds. The company said in a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/introducing-more-control-for-brands-and-people-in-feed"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; post Thursday that the test, available to a “small percentage” of users to start, would allow people to adjust their preferences to increase or reduce the amount of content they see from specific friends, family, groups, and pages they’re connected with on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRwSDZ"&gt;Facebook has tweaked the way the News Feed presents content numerous times in the past several years and seems to keep rethinking what content should be prioritized and why. In 2015, it said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/21/8463051/facebook-algorithm-changes-publishers-newsfeed"&gt;changing News Feeds&lt;/a&gt; to favor content from close friends over that from brands and publishers.

Walmart has a next-gen console restock happening today at 3PM ET / 12PM PT, though, it’s exclusive to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart Plus paid subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.
