    <title>Vaccine drives in the US are getting younger  </title>

  &lt;p id="yyEvJx"&gt;This week, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22395472/covid-vaccine-pfizer-kid-ages-12-15-fda-authorization"&gt;authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for people 12-15&lt;/a&gt;, a moment that many families have been eagerly waiting for since the vaccine rollout began in the US. As shots became available, parents &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-rush-to-get-covid-19-vaccines-for-their-children-11620984600"&gt;rushed to get their kids the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. But the decision has also contributed to ongoing discussions about how to best distribute vaccines around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUrG8H"&gt;In Santa Barbara, one 14-year-old got a &lt;a href="https://newspress.com/vaccines-for-teens/"&gt;vaccine for his birthday&lt;/a&gt;. In Colorado, schools are &lt;a href="https://co.chalkbeat.org/2021/5/13/22435327/covid-vaccine-teens-families-colorado-schools"&gt;setting up vaccine clinics&lt;/a&gt;. In Los Angeles, high-schoolers were eager for their shot at experiencing a normal life again. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket suffers failure, loses payload of two satellites</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket launches from New Zealand on Saturday, as seen on the company’s live video feed. | Rocket Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RxHIoa"&gt;Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket failed to reach orbit after suffering an unexpected engine shutdown mid-flight on Saturday, losing the mission’s payload of two satellites, the company said. The launch from New Zealand was Electron’s 20th, and marked the company’s second mission failure in less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aATXd1"&gt;Electron, a roughly six-story tall rocket with two booster stages, lifted off from Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand at 7:11AM ET on Saturday, aiming to send a pair of Earth observation satellites for BlackSky into orbit. Two and a half minutes into flight, the rocket’s second stage booster successfully separated from its first stage and ignited for a few seconds before shutting down, indicating a problem...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Twitter policy that could temporarily censor every single one of your tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l-C9MND0vH5SM4VNjNpiHNWe6xs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69291957/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ay94xs"&gt;On Tuesday, a noted Palestinian-American journalist reporting live from protests near Jerusalem was suddenly and mysteriously silenced on Twitter — with every single tweet replaced by the message “@MariamBarghouti’s account is temporarily unavailable because it violates the Twitter Media Policy.” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8b4x/twitter-said-it-restricted-palestinian-writers-account-by-accident"&gt;It was a mistake&lt;/a&gt;, the company quickly admitted, and her tweets were quickly restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMMZwe"&gt;But it turns out that one part of the incident was &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a mistake. While Twitter may have taken action on this person’s account in error, there actually is one particular situation where Twitter reserves the right to make your tweets disappear. And — if you ask me — it’s super, super dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iOKPG7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;ive been on twitter what feels like my entire life and ive never seen...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly will continue to require masks in its US retail stores </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple will keep its mask mandate in place at its US retail stores | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KWfcNW"&gt;Despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Apple will keep its mandatory mask policy in place at its US retail stores for the time being,&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-15/apple-stores-keep-mask-mandate-as-company-evaluates-measures?sref=10lNAhZ9"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company informed stores that it is continuing to evaluate COVID-19-related health and safety measures, but that the policy requiring customers and employees at its Apple stores would stay in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6U0Bt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434645/vaccines-masks-social-distancing-cdc-covid"&gt;CDC announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that people who had been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus could do away with wearing masks indoors and outdoors, and did not have to continue social distancing. There are some exceptions to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html"&gt;CDC guidance&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends people continue masking on public transit, airplanes, and trains, and in health care settings...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="hbnGki"&gt;When you’ve been through tough times — and we all have — sometimes you just need a distraction or something that just makes you feel good to get you through it. We asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; what they’ve treated themselves to in order to help make all the upheavals and lockdowns of the past year just a bit more bearable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtnjoh"&gt;These are some of the things that made them smile over the past year. Hopefully, you’ve got something that made you smile as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a4FI6v"&gt;World of Warcraft subscription &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MCtE3J"&gt;Nothing feels like an escape more than a world of Orcs, Mages, and Warriors. I’ve played &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; off and on throughout the years, but — faced with hours of Netflix, in-home workouts, and utter boredom during the pandemic — I decided it was time to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Surface Duo is down to $600 at Woot</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nS6yAp"&gt;This week brought some unexpected bargains by way of an eBay sitewide code that can knock up to $100 off a pricey purchase, such as a 4K TV, as well as an excellent Humble Bundle with 100 percent of proceeds going toward COVID-19 relief in India and Brazil. There are more, including a day-long sale on AT&amp;amp;T-locked Microsoft Surface Duo phones and more, so take a spin through this dispatch to see what we thought stood out from the rest in deals world this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="elQOar"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eoq8JU"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Duo is just $600 at Woot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Bzabl7"&gt;We featured a popular deal on the Surface Duo earlier this week, which had the foldable phone selling for $690. That was a great promotion, especially because it was for the version that worked on Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T. That deal is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China has landed on Mars</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JdVKlQ"&gt;China landed its first pair of robots on the surface of Mars on Friday, state-affiliated media &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CGTNOfficial/status/1393365096609435648"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; on social media, becoming the second country to do so successfully after overcoming a daring, seven-minute landing sequence. The country’s Tianwen-1 spacecraft ejected the rover-lander bundle for a Martian touchdown at around 7PM ET, kicking off a mission to study the Red Planet’s climate and geology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FshZmf"&gt;The mission marks China’s first independent trek to Mars, about 200 million miles away from Earth. Only NASA has successfully managed to land and operate rovers on the planet in the past. (The Soviet Union’s Mars 3 spacecraft landed on the planet in 1971 and communicated for about 20 seconds before unexpectedly going dark.) China’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter politely asks you to protect its targeted ad dollars in new iOS 14.5 prompt</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="shKhfk"&gt;As part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; forces developers to ask permission for something they used to be able to do for free: track iOS users. Today, Twitter is joining the ranks of other developers and adding a prompt that asks users to enable tracking on iOS (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/14/twitter-app-tracking-transparency-support/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJ2nR0"&gt;Twitter’s main justification for listening to its request is straightforward — having the feature enabled allows it to serve “better” ads. The company includes a link to settings so you can make those changes, but read Twitter’s explanation before you decide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZXbtIX"&gt;Keep ads relevant to you by allowing Twitter to track data from other companies on this device, like apps you use and websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gEzkzL"&gt;The company also includes a link to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/about-ios-tracking"&gt;a support post&lt;/a&gt; in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>eBay will enact a sex ban starting June 15th</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7rVASp"&gt;If you’re hoping to turn a dollar on that extremely explicit hentai you picked up in college, you won’t be selling it on eBay. As first &lt;a href="https://avn.com/business/articles/legal/breaking-ebay-to-ban-sale-of-all-adult-items-effective-june-15-900875.html"&gt;noticed by Adult Video News&lt;/a&gt;, eBay is banning the sale of most sexually explicit materials starting June 15th, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaiRGB"&gt;Everyone has a different definition of what constitutes “sexually explicit” and eBay’s is extremely PG. While the policy is confusing in that it appears to conflate nudity and sexually explicit content, it carefully defines nudity as “showing any part of male or female genitalia, anus, or female breasts where the areola or nipple is visible.” It goes on to say that those same bits don’t get a pass if they’re covered by see-through material or confined by tight clothing. The policy also...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="N8xFgN"&gt;Venmo has a major privacy flaw that’s been well-known &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-wrong-with-your-venmo-account-and-how-to-fix-it-1543932128"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evjxqa/venmo-letter-eff-mozilla-public-by-default-settings"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;: there’s no way to keep your list of Venmo contacts private.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BCmibJ"&gt;BuzzFeed News found nearly a dozen Biden family members and mapped out a social web that encompasses not only the first family, but a wide network of people around them, including the president’s children,...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
