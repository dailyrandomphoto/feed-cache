    <title>Final Fantasy director’s Paralympics RPG is launching next month</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U9sddg"&gt;The first project from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/em&gt; director Hajime Tabata’s new studio JP Games will finally be released next month, the company has announced. &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; is a mobile RPG themed around the Paralympic Games, the first game ever to carry the official Paralympics license. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18307399/pegasus-dream-tour-paralympics-game-hajime-tabata-2020"&gt;initially announced&lt;/a&gt; more than two years ago, but the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics were postponed a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and there’d been radio silence on the project ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOELvx"&gt;JP Games describes &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; as an “avatar RPG” set in Pegasus City. You can create a character based on a selfie from your phone, and train them in various para-sports. The game features illustrated versions of nine real-world para-athletes who...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft board members thought Gates should step down after alleged affair with employee: WSJ</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s614Xu"&gt;Some of Microsoft’s board members concluded that Bill Gates should step down last year as an investigation was being conducted into an alleged affair with an employee, according to a report in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. Gates ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;resigned from the board in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; says was before the investigation had been completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epJGgK"&gt;The board reportedly hired a law firm in 2019 to investigate the matter following a Microsoft employee alleging in a letter that she had had a sexual relationship with Gates over many years. The employee, who was an engineer at the company, is said to have asked that Melinda French Gates, who was married to Bill at the time, read her letter, though it’s unclear whether that actually happened. Gates...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Green Knight, Wish Dragon, Venom 2, and more</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D4g5So"&gt;So since &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; isn’t dark enough (honestly give us &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, show writers), I also started watching &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; (HBO Max) and over the weekend watched &lt;em&gt;The Woman in the Window&lt;/em&gt; (fine, gritty anti-heroines are my thing, I guess). &lt;em&gt;Mare&lt;/em&gt; is so far reminding me a lot of &lt;em&gt;Broadchurch&lt;/em&gt;, another not-very-uplifting but great show, and Kate Winslet is going all-in on the accent and the look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SRYGK"&gt;But wow what a disappointment&lt;em&gt; The Woman in the Window &lt;/em&gt;was. It has an all-star cast (Amy Adams, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Brian Tyree Henry, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Anthony Mackie) and a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts, based on AJ Finn’s 2018 novel (which BY THE WAY, &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions"&gt;read the bonkers backstory&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; guy).

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xzuGg0"&gt;Officials in Puerto Rico are reportedly investigating an incident involving YouTube star Jake Paul, after he was seen in a now-deleted video riding in a vehicle on a beach that’s a nesting area for turtles this time of year, the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/15/puerto-rico-investigating-jake-paul-after-viral-video-sparks-turtle-outrage/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjg9S9"&gt;“I have ordered an investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the use of two motor vehicles on beaches that are presented to be in Puerto Rico,” secretary of natural and environmental resources Rafael Marchargo said &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/05/15/jake-paul-puerto-rico-investigation-turtles-beach/"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; (h/t TMZ). “Some media have published today a video of the influencer Jake Paul in a motor vehicle on the beach, an activity that is prohibited, apart from law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

The Android app will be available in Brazil, Japan, and Russia on Tuesday, India and Nigeria by Friday, and the “rest of the world” throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is reportedly in talks to merge its media business with Discovery</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vlDm8s"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery are in talks that would combine AT&amp;amp;T’s media business with Discovery’s reality-TV dynasty to create a massive new entertainment entity, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/at-t-is-said-in-talks-to-combine-content-assets-with-discovery-kor6r2uj?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources. &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-05-16/why-att-is-spinning-off-hbo-cnn-warner-media-discovery"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; corroborated the story&lt;/a&gt;, noting that “many Warner Media executives were stunned by the news.” Neither company confirmed the deal, but if it came to pass, the combined company would be a potentially significant competitor for streaming brands like Netflix and Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gm5ih"&gt;But as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, AT&amp;amp;T only recently added some major entertainment brands to its portfolio when it &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-m-a-at-t/att-closes-85-billion-deal-for-time-warner-idUSKBN1JA36U"&gt;acquired Time Warner for $85 billion&lt;/a&gt;, a deal that was finalized in 2018.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H06VAa"&gt;Amazon has launched an ad-supported, free video streaming service called MiniTV within the Amazon India app, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a different offering than its separate Amazon Prime Video service, as MiniTV is contained within Amazon’s traditional shopping app, rather than its own standalone app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0VhbT"&gt;Only available to users in India, MiniTV’s catalog includes mostly older content which its content partners made originally for YouTube and other platforms. The lineup includes beauty and fashion content, tech news, and cooking shows, and Amazon’s partners for the channel include Indian web content studios Pocket Aces and TVF, and  list of well-known Indian comedians. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New leak ahead of Google I/O claims Android 12 may include changes for widgets and notifications </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ClIYju"&gt;Just ahead of Google I/O, which gets underway on Tuesday, a new leak purporting to be a preview of what’s coming during the annual developers’ conference gives some insight into what Android 12 might look like. A new &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRd8v2eRAA&amp;amp;ab_channel=FRONTPAGETECH"&gt;video from Jon Prosser&lt;/a&gt; shows what appear to be slides from a presentation of Android 12.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzHcVl"&gt;The first slide sets up what to expect: “A beautiful new experience,” “Stronger privacy and security protections,” and “All of your devices work better together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKLg96"&gt;The usual caveats about leaked materials apply, of course; there’s no guarantee this is what the final interface will look like, or how much may be announced during I/O. But the most interesting slide in Prosser’s video shows what appears to be a new user interface for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cloudflare says it’s time to end CAPTCHA ‘madness’, launches new security key-based replacement</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dIXSKy"&gt;Cloudflare, which you may know as a provider of DNS services or the company telling you why the website you clicked on won’t load, wants to replace the “madness” of CAPTCHAs across the web with an entirely new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAkTSp"&gt;CAPTCHAs are those tests you have to take, often when trying to log into a service, that ask you to click images of things like busses or crosswalks or bicycles to prove that you’re a human. (CAPTCHA, if you didn’t know, stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.”) The problem is, they add a lot of friction to using the web and can sometimes be difficult to solve — I’m sure I’m not the only person who has frustratingly failed a CAPTCHA because I didn’t see that corner of a...&lt;/p&gt;
