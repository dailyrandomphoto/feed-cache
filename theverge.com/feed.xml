    <title>These USB-C earbuds are a trojan horse for Deezer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/784Ijo0juGyEP5qgWaR7TYe2mA8=/157x0:1845x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186013/deezer__2_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When used with a compatible Samsung device, the headphones launch a custom Deezer theme.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Deezer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FYRo3d"&gt;As part of a &lt;a href="https://www.deezer-blog.com/press/deezer-preinstalled-on-mobeek-hifi-earphones/"&gt;new partnership&lt;/a&gt;, Deezer will be available “pre-installed” on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XX6ZYCK?ref=myi_title_dp&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new pair of USB-C earbuds from Mobee-K&lt;/a&gt; when they’re used with select Samsung Galaxy devices. Plugging the headphones into phones like the Galaxy S21, Note 20, or Z Flip effectively side-loads the music streaming service, without you having to visit the Google Play Store. It’s an interesting marketing tactic that could encourage listeners to give Deezer a try over bigger competitors like Spotify and Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVJZro"&gt;As well as offering access to the streaming service itself, Deezer advertises that syncing the earbuds with Samsung’s devices gives access to a “customized Deezer theme” which includes “wallpapers, exclusive playlists, and shortcuts to Deezer” via the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inventive grandson builds Telegram messaging machine for 96-year-old grandmother</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3M1gR6q3YvOsfe5hkA--Ts-LopQ=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69185832/telegram_machine.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yayagram looks and works like an old-fashioned physical phone switchboard. &lt;/em&gt; | Twitter: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/mrcatacroquer/status/1386318806411325440" target="_blank"&gt;@mrcatacroquer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yKcEPl"&gt;Making sure elders can keep in contact with children and grandchildren has never been more important in a time of global lockdown. That’s why Twitter user @&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mrcatacroquer/status/1386318806411325440"&gt;mrcatacroquer&lt;/a&gt;, Manuel Lucio Dallo, built the Yayagram — a DIY project that makes sending and receiving voice and text messages over Telegram a physical process just like using an old-fashioned phone switchboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0v5EU8"&gt;It’s important, of course, not to generalize about the ability of older generations to get to grips with new technology. But speaking from personal experience, I know my own grandparents struggled with the digital interfaces of modern phones and smartphones. They much preferred physical buttons and switches to apps and touchscreens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbMh2J"&gt;That’s why the Yayagram is so compelling...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixel 5A camera sample leaks, hints at similar specs to the Pixel 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCACWXmndGxHJUKjB6Zv2lQ4b3o=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69185712/pixel_5a_ultrawide.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The since-removed photo, which appears to have been taken with the Pixel 5A.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ljHMMa"&gt;Google seems to have accidentally shared a photo sample from its upcoming Pixel 5A, giving us some hints about what to expect from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;barely announced&lt;/a&gt; device. The photo appeared in an album posted alongside a &lt;a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/04/hdr-with-bracketing-on-pixel-phones.html?m=1"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about Google’s HDR+ Bracketing technology, which aims to reduce noise in HDR photos (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/23/our-first-potential-pixel-5a-camera-sample-looks-like-it-comes-from-a-very-familiar-sensor/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The EXIF data for most of the photos said they were captured by existing Pixel phones including the Pixel 5, Pixel 4A 5G, Pixel 4, and Pixel 4 XL, but in among them was one image apparently taken with a Pixel 5A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2MvhN"&gt;Google recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;confirmed the existence of the Pixel 5A 5G&lt;/a&gt; in response to rumors that the device had been cancelled. However, beyond confirming that the device will be available later this year in the US and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Video game industry wins first Oscar with documentary short Colette</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qib7IMgjm6ZjTnT56NdPGt23484=/0x0:780x520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69185502/colette.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ixwc5U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colette&lt;/em&gt;, a short film featured in the Oculus VR game &lt;em&gt;Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond&lt;/em&gt;, has won this year’s Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject). Presented by Oculus Studios and Electronic Arts’ Respawn Entertainment, and later acquired and distributed by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, it’s the first time a video game industry project has won an Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCUJ5Z"&gt;Directed by Anthony Giacchino, &lt;em&gt;Colette&lt;/em&gt; features a French Resistance survivor, Colette Marin-Catherine, returning to Germany for the first time since the end of World War II to visit a slave labor camp where her brother was killed. The documentary is presented in a traditional 2D format whether you watch it in the Oculus TV app or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cqgAxM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The real hero here is Colette herself.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Ingenuity takes its third flight on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xeQAFs1AJK-vrldW4v9dqjQ9ytY=/36x0:1428x928/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69184344/ingenuity_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ingenuity lifts off from the Martian surface | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka7S42EXPq0&amp;amp;t=1s&amp;amp;ab_channel=NASAJetPropulsionLaboratory" target="_blank"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1WZuqp"&gt;NASA’s tiny Ingenuity helicopter made its third &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8930/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flies-faster-farther-on-third-flight/"&gt;successful flight on Mars&lt;/a&gt; early Sunday, and flew higher and faster than it did even when it was being tested on Earth. At about 1:31 AM ET, the helicopter ascended 16 feet and flew 164 feet during its 80 second third flight, at a top speed of 6.6 feet per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56rAML"&gt;NASA received the flight data shortly after 10AM ET. “Today’s flight was what we planned for, and yet it was nothing short of amazing,” NASA’s Dave Lavery said in a statement. “With this flight, we are demonstrating critical capabilities that will enable the addition of an aerial dimension to future Mars missions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idrzQK"&gt;In its second mission on Thursday, Ingenuity made a 51.9-second flight, traveling seven feet. For &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391496/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars-flight-success"&gt;Ingenuity’s first...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Ted Lasso, Fathom, Annette, The Conjuring, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="27th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKrsNUueXMk8mDl_JgMmWfWsFYw=/459x0:4679x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69184273/1310834710.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ted Lasso returns | Photo by SAGAwards2021 via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CmCS8F"&gt;The Oscars are tonight and despite my best efforts I still haven’t seen all the Best Picture contenders, so will hold off on making predictions (but honestly not sure how anyone beats Chadwick Boseman as Best Actor). Lots of good trailers this week including the return of the most wholesome show on all of streaming and the next big Marvel movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GzBVA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ldLYIo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3Q4Mqy"&gt;Ted Lasso Season 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="l1kA0H"&gt;You know when you really love a show and it gets popular and everyone else likes it... and you brace for its sophomore season to be not quite as good as its debut? I am hopeful that &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; will not fall into this pattern, and the trailer for season two looks extremely promising (Ted: “Back home if a team was playing poorly, we don’t call them unlucky, what do we call ‘em,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse is partnering with the NFL for draft week programming</title>

  &lt;p id="EDvW3o"&gt;Audio social platform Clubhouse is partnering with the National Football League for some exclusive programming during the upcoming NFL draft, the company announced Sunday. This is the first sports partnership for Clubhouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlrD86"&gt;The NFL will host a series of &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/club/NFL"&gt;draft-themed rooms&lt;/a&gt; on Clubhouse beginning Monday and throughout the week, which will include player assessments, a mock draft for fans, and a conversation with football team alumni from the University of Alabama. Football fans can drop into the NFL rooms on Clubhouse to follow the picks as they’re announced and listen to “discussions featuring key NFL figures—from athletes and coaches to network personalities,” according to a release from Clubhouse, and fans could be invited on stage by...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s what Neymar looks like in Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_gsEsZA4yF905TJYcCi8D8YQME=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69183086/Neymar_Jr_Outfits.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2uEFcT"&gt;We’ve known that Brazilian soccer star Neymar was coming to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; since March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;when he was teased as part of the battle royale’s latest season&lt;/a&gt; — and now we finally know what he’ll look like. Today, Epic revealed Neymar’s video game look, which, in traditional &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fashion, gets pretty outlandish, with unlockable outfits that look ripped straight out of Power Rangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHI89T"&gt;Curiously, Neymar isn’t sporting jerseys for either the Brazil national team or his club, Paris St. Germain, despite the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;licensed team kits were introduced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out Neymar’s accessories in the image below. Neymar and his gear — including some new quests — will be available on April 27th for anyone who purchased the current pass.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oscars 2021: how to watch the Academy Awards online</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dm8G5B"&gt;The 93rd Academy Awards (also known as the Oscars) will broadcast tonight, April 25th. This ceremony will recognize the films and their associated talent in a particularly strange and difficult year for the industry, which has been forced to adapt to some big changes during the pandemic. Cinemas weren’t where most people saw newly-released movies. Instead, many of those films were pushed faster than ever to digital distribution platforms like Vudu, Apple TV, and Google TV for purchase or rental. Some were even made available simultaneously with the theatrical release, like some Warner Bros. films on &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=HowToWatchOscars2021"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dh2iIE"&gt;This year’s Oscars are happening later in the year than usual, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/15/21291946/academy-awards-oscars-ceremony-delayed-eligibility-dates-change"&gt;apparently to make room for more movies&lt;/a&gt;, since the pandemic dried...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFvpna"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This biweekly Verge column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPzUSO"&gt;I’ve played a lot of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; over the years, but I’ve never really thought about the internal lives of the many characters that inhabit the battle royale island. I was always too busy seeking shelter and supplies or exploring whatever big event was happening at the time. But now that I’ve read &lt;em&gt;Zero Point&lt;/em&gt;, a crossover between Batman and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, I can’t stop thinking about what’s actually happening to them as they fight to the death over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
