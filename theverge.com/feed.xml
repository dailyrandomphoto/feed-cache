  &lt;p id="OWPiaY"&gt;Twitter has rolled out support for voice direct messages on iOS and Android in India starting today, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIndia/status/1361900922465644544"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/twitter-begins-testing-voice-dms-india-brazil-japan?utm_source=ac_tw&amp;amp;utm_medium=tw_card&amp;amp;utm_content=99269&amp;amp;utm_campaign=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the audio messages are now available in three countries worldwide: India, Brazil, and Japan. Plans for voice DMs were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452932/twitter-voice-audio-direct-messages-test-brazil"&gt;first announced last year&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter says the feature, which it’s calling an “experiment,” will roll out in India in phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGMx9D"&gt;In a statement, Twitter India’s managing director, Manish Maheshwari, said voice messages are designed to “give people a new way to express themselves and help them connect through the nuances, emotion, and empathy built by hearing someone’s voice.” Similar features are already available on other services like Messenger, Instagram DMs, and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super73 is the latest e-bike company to land a huge investment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cr1eNFDk1vKzA3b4LOk1PmTBUos=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829465/sokane_1842_super_73_scout_9173.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oRi4cs"&gt;Super73, the Southern California e-bike company popular among YouTubers and film celebrities, announced that it has raised an impressive $20 million from investors, making it the latest company to benefit from growing venture capital interest after a record year of e-bike sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23vEYt"&gt;The funding round is Super73’s first and was led by equity firm Volition Capital, which was an early investor in Chewy before its acquisition by PetSmart for $3.35 billion in 2017. With these new funds, the direct-to-consumer e-bike company plans on growing its 75-person staff, improving its customer service operation, and expanding its product lineup, said Super73 co-founder and CEO LeGrand Crewse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dtnRhU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Super73 helped popularize a retro, mini-bike style of e-bike&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KMahh1"&gt;“...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to check how much free Google storage you have left</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MTHFTQOgUx6KDH1aiGEOr9sydoM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829474/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4jIz0a"&gt;It seems like the days of free apps are slowly grinding to a halt. Just recently, password manager LastPass announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;drastically limiting the usefulness of its free app&lt;/a&gt;, and now, Google has sent out emails reaffirming that it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;ending its free unlimited photo storage policy&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OTnDg5"&gt;Starting June 1, 2021, all new photos and videos backed up in &lt;a href="https://notifications.google.com/g/p/AD-FnEyR8jsullXkrSTswG7ZPbQQNksSJr10HUd-aLavsdAtjwQyOZfjNDoVgSorQcUstUwN-MFfdBz70-Z7gtBoC2DF0frY1V5CgkzeiOXQj_Chh9zqXLaoYhVkrzduPO1773ycvqzs0KgZ9x5z-XeQrjqOP05XZz4"&gt;High quality and Express quality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; will count toward the free 15 GB of storage that comes with your Google account or any additional storage you may have purchased, the same way other Google services like Google Drive and Gmail already do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="40gBma"&gt;While this isn’t a surprise — Google announced its new policy back in November 2020 — it is still depressing to be reminded of the upcoming storage crunch....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung forced to halt chip production in Austin due to power outages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFD1B5S7gXShNiDutNyBrx0iQ2w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829398/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q9bWvA"&gt;Samsung has temporarily halted chip production at its facilities in Austin, TX in response to the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/16/22284140/texas-blackout-outage-winter-storm-uri-ercot-power-grid-cold-snow-austin-houston-dallas"&gt;region’s power outages&lt;/a&gt; brought on by Winter Storm Uri, the &lt;a href="https://eu.statesman.com/story/news/2021/02/16/austin-energy-shuts-power-off-samsung-other-major-users/6771267002/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Austin American-Statesman&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. “With prior notice, appropriate measures have safely been taken for the facilities and wafers in production,” Samsung said in a statement, “We will resume production as soon as power is restored.” On Tuesday, Austin Energy confirmed it had ordered its biggest customers to shut down, although it’s unknown how long they were without power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOUtIi"&gt;The shutdowns were ordered as some &lt;a href="https://eu.statesman.com/story/news/2021/02/15/austin-power-outage-40-without-power-amid-austin-energys-rolling-blackouts/6752667002/"&gt;200,000 Austin homes&lt;/a&gt; were without power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udWW1x"&gt;What’s unclear at the moment is whether production of Apple’s Mac Pro, which &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2019%2F09%2Fapples-new-mac-pro-to-be-made-in-texas%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287054%2Fsamsung-chip-production-halted-austin-winter-storm-uri-power-blackouts#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is manufactured in Austin&lt;/a&gt;, has also been affected.

    <title>Microsoft hid its new Xbox headset in the Series X launch trailer months ago</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o9TEBO_AQA2zASXwWNqzFtgbOc0=/22x0:534x341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829199/xboxheadset.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3KG6Ju"&gt;Microsoft’s new Xbox Wireless Headset appeared in the company’s Xbox Series X and S launch commercial all the way back in October. British actor Daniel Kaluuya picked up the headset &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508979/microsoft-xbox-series-x-tv-commercial-ad-marketing-campaign-power-your-dreams"&gt;early on in the ad&lt;/a&gt;, but nobody noticed it was an unannounced accessory at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGNgkr"&gt;Microsoft announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285247/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-release-date-price-features"&gt;new Xbox Wireless Headset on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; which features rotating ear cup dials that let you adjust volume and game / audio chat balance. The new headset will be available for $99 on March 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games brings Apple fight to the EU with new antitrust complaint</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="owZZU4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games has made a formal antitrust complaint about Apple to the European Commission, the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-files-eu-antitrust-complaint-against-apple"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Epic alleges that Apple’s “carefully designed anti-competitive restrictions” have “completely eliminated competition in app distribution and payment processes.” It says this leads to consumers playing higher prices, and gives Apple too much control over developers on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geMeM2"&gt;The complaint is the latest legal action taken by Epic in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know/archives"&gt;ongoing dispute with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The developer has criticized Apple’s control over software distribution with the App Store, as well as its policies around payments, which often result in Apple taking a 30 percent cut of in-app purchases. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has called...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX reportedly raised the best part of a billion dollars to fund future missions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SpaceX" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AbzxlnkuUcsAosditoRYyfNdxrs=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68828334/spacex1_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XEPznM"&gt;SpaceX has &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/elon-musks-spacex-raised-850-million-at-419point99-a-share.html"&gt;reportedly raised $850 million in a round of funding&lt;/a&gt;, in transactions that would value shares of the company at $419.99 each. According to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;, this would mean the company is worth around $74 billion. It would also mean that the company has money to continue on with its future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEKgcA"&gt;As one could imagine, some of SpaceX’s projects are deeply unprofitable before they start making money — for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;earlier this month Elon Musk said that there’s a “deep chasm of negative cash flow”&lt;/a&gt; between the company’s satellite-based internet service provider Starlink and profitability. The company’s plan to send &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419841/spacex-starlink-internet-satellite-constellation-download-speeds-space-lasers"&gt;enough satellites to create a global, high-speed internet network&lt;/a&gt; is expensive, and since the service is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;still in the beta...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fjtcHT"&gt;“The upcoming fantasy series tells the story of Davion, a renowned Dragon Knight devoted to wiping the scourge from the face of the world,” according to a &lt;a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/only-on-netflix/80994336"&gt;Netflix press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Following encounters with a powerful, ancient eldwurm as well as the noble Princess Mirana on a secret mission of her own, Davion becomes embroiled in events much larger than he could have ever imagined.”&lt;/p&gt;
