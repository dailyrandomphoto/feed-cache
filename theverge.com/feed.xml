    <title>India reportedly orders social media platforms to remove references to “Indian variant” of COVID-19</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K1T2Ap"&gt;India’s government has sent notices to social media platforms ordering them to take down content that refers to an “Indian variant” of the COVID-19 virus, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/india-asks-social-media-firms-remove-reference-indian-variant-coronavirus-2021-05-21/"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reported. The letter from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology sent Friday was not made public, but was viewed by several news outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRXYW2"&gt;It was not clear which social media outlets received the letter, but India’s government has recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;ordered Twitter to remove tweets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/27/991343032/indias-government-is-telling-facebook-twitter-to-remove-critical-posts"&gt;Facebook and Instagram to take down posts&lt;/a&gt; that were critical of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Samsung smartwatch partnership looks a lot like giving up</title>

&lt;p id="ohGKGe"&gt;The company is throwing in the towel on Wear OS. It’s trying yet again, this time with Samsung’s Tizen OS helping to fill in the gaps that Google, for whatever reason, can’t. It’s theoretically good news for Android owners interested in a decent smartwatch — but one that’s damning of Google’s lackluster efforts in the smartwatch space to date. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eURomX"&gt;Swedish band Wintergatan may be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/2/11147884/marble-machine-music-wintergartan-martin-molin"&gt;widely known for its Marble Machine music video&lt;/a&gt; (which featured a machine dropping marbles to play drums, a bass, and other instruments), but today I learned that they’re building a bigger, better version, and documenting the entire process on YouTube. It’s called the Marble Machine X, and it’s driven by a motor instead of a hand crank, is being built by an entire team of people, and, hopefully will be able to go on tour and be played on stage when it’s finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXIhmY"&gt;Wintergartan also produced a build log of the first machine, but this new project is way grander in scope, offering a deeper look at the creative process that leads to... well, building a massive musical instrument that uses marbles. The band put...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbGNaU"&gt;Richard Branson’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Virgin Galactic completed its first successful space flight in more than two years on Saturday, with its crewed VSS Unity spacecraft carried to an altitude of more than 44,000 feet before gliding safely back to Earth. It marked the first spaceflight from New Mexico, making it the third US state to launch humans into space. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_New_Mexico"&gt;The Zia sun symbol&lt;/a&gt; of New Mexico’s state flag was displayed on the outside of the ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJfZWr"&gt;Virgin’s VMS Eve carrier aircraft took off from Spaceport America in New Mexico at about 10:35AM ET with Unity aboard. About 10 minutes before its release, Unity switched to its own battery power, and conducted flight control and electrical checks. Once released by Eve, Unity’s pilots C.J. Sturckow and Dave Mackay...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="VXjRAv"&gt;Aerion Supersonic, which had plans to build silent business jets that would travel twice as fast as most commercial airplanes, is shutting down operations.

&lt;p id="s0mbzN"&gt;“The AS2 supersonic business jet program meets all market, technical, regulatory and sustainability requirements and the market for a new supersonic segment of general aviation has been validated with $11.2 billion in sales backlog for the AS2,” the company said in an statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="OzoveN"&gt;Pony has been authorized to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers in California since 2017, but the new permit will let it test six autonomous vehicles without safety drivers on specific streets in Fremont, Alameda County; Milpitas, Santa Clara County; and Irvine, Orange County. According to the DMV, the vehicles are designed to be driven on roads with speed limits of 45 miles per hour or less, in clear weather and light precipitation. The first testing will be in Fremont and Milpitas on weekdays between 10AM...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="sD5nPS"&gt;In a new support document on its website, Apple &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212183"&gt;dives a little deeper into the details&lt;/a&gt; around the upcoming launch of lossless audio on Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxkEOt"&gt;Apple now says that both the HomePod and HomePod Mini will support lossless audio after a future software update. That’ll be good news to people who’ve invested in one or a pair of Apple’s smart speakers. Two HomePods grouped in stereo playing a lossless source? Yeah, that’s going to sound wonderful. Apple isn’t yet giving any timetable for when this software update will be released, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIusvP"&gt;The document also clarifies that the Apple TV 4K will only support standard lossless audio when the ALAC files become available in June. Apple has said that in most cases, the “Hi-Res Lossless” tier...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook’s Fortnite trial testimony was unexpectedly revealing</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkoY2d"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial was bookended by Tims. Epic Games called its CEO Tim Sweeney as the first witness nearly three weeks ago. Yesterday, Apple called Tim Cook as the last to take the stand, before both sides make their final case to a judge on Monday. Cook was supposed to bring home Apple’s defense of its ecosystem. He did it by laying out Apple’s most high-minded principles — but also its hard financial calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGpgYJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; covers two separate issues: whether the market for in-app purchases within the App Store is unfairly monopolistic, and whether iOS &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is a monopoly that should be opened up to third-party stores and side-loaded apps. Cook addressed both with an appeal to user safety and privacy. “Privacy from our point...&lt;/p&gt;
