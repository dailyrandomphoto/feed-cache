    <title>Google Podcasts now supports private RSS feeds so you can listen to the shows you pay to access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFPMbeQckkWcQe49mVMAz4Qhc0U=/0x0:820x547/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451718/googlepodcasts_rss_feed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google Podcasts&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bzA9VP"&gt;Google Podcasts is finally getting a feature that’s already standard across most listening apps: private RSS feed support. The head of product for Google Podcasts, Zack Reneau-Wedeen, made the announcement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZackRW/status/1334590407850696705"&gt;on Twitter today&lt;/a&gt; and shouted out some networks that are especially reliant on private feeds, including Patreon, Slate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18522031/redcircle-podcast-service-hosting-analytics-cross-promotion"&gt;Red Circle&lt;/a&gt;, and Supercast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jD29G"&gt;To access the feature, tap over to the activity tab in the bottom right-hand corner and slide over to the Subscriptions tab, then tap the plus symbol. You’ll then be prompted to add by RSS feed. You can see the entire process below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leak left 243 million Brazilians’ medical records and personal info ripe for the picking</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BEbABR"&gt;The personal information of more than 243 million Brazilians was potentially accessible for at least six months thanks to weakly encoded credentials kept in the source code of the Brazilian Ministry of Health’s website (&lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/data-of-243-million-brazilians-exposed-online-via-website-source-code/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The security issue was first reported by &lt;a href="https://saude.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,nova-falha-do-ministerio-da-saude-expoe-dados-pessoais-de-mais-de-200-milhoes,70003536340"&gt;Brazilian publication &lt;em&gt;Estadão&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6knfqU"&gt;The personal data of anyone who had registered with Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS), Brazil’s national health system, could be viewed. That data included people’s full names, addresses, and telephone numbers, reported &lt;em&gt;Estadão.&lt;/em&gt; The database also includes records of living and dead people as the population of Brazil was more than 211 million in 2019, &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=BR"&gt;according to The World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, which is about 32 million fewer people than the reported number of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Justice Department is suing Facebook for side-stepping visa rules</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qckWVB"&gt;The Justice Department has &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-lawsuit-against-facebook-discriminating-against-us-workers"&gt;filed charges against Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly discriminating against US workers in its hiring practices. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142257/united_states_v._facebook_complaint_0.pdf"&gt;The complaint&lt;/a&gt;, filed on Thursday, alleges that the company maintained a separate job listing process for visa-eligible job postings, both limiting the visibility of the job listing online and insisting that job seekers submit their applications by mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqgLyU"&gt;According to the Justice Department, the result was a systematic effort to discourage US workers from applying for an entire class of jobs at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkYuhJ"&gt;“Facebook’s discriminatory recruitment and hiring practice is routine, ongoing, and widespread,” the complaint reads. “It discriminates against U.S. workers because of their immigration or citizenship status,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is stepping up moderation against anti-Black hate speech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PbEyqbqTDfUku3NgAfdILf2MIF8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451258/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3me8N"&gt;Facebook has started weighting anti-Black hate speech on its platform as higher priority than hate speech directed at white people, men, and Americans in an effort to address the disproportionate effects such speech has on minority groups, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1id5x"&gt;The result is that Facebook’s automated moderation systems for detecting and taking action against hate speech should now more proactively scan the site for such racist content. Meanwhile, more innocuous forms of hate speech, like those directed at white people or men in general, are deemed lower priority and left alone unless a user reports them. Facebook has internally deemed this approach “WOW,” or “worst of the worst” for the types of behaviors it now wants to focus...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People are putting their routers in jail to protect themselves from harmless Wi-Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fN9xrBVL1WdSwlUcBkrP6l0ACq4=/0x71:1860x1311/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451248/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_3.37.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="KDdXDD"&gt;Please do not put your internet router in a Faraday cage. Please do not put your internet router in a Faraday cage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZcUIg"&gt;If you’re reading this, as someone who uses the internet, this may seem obvious. A Faraday cage, after all, blocks electromagnetic radiation and signals from escaping. Putting one around your router would, by very similar physics, prevent those same radio waves that &lt;em&gt;carry your internet &lt;/em&gt;from reaching your devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OcnGxT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So apparently putting Faraday cages around routers has become a thing for the 5g conspiracy nuts and there are companies out there ready to cash in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My sides are in orbit. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mGcud5Kb70"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mGcud5Kb70&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;—  Ansgar Odinson  (@AnsgarTOdinson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnsgarTOdinson/status/1334015546979803137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Developers can now sign up for Apple’s reduced 15 percent App Store cut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of a group of apps on an iPhone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dpqJ8RliLpAJvP1Ksqi_Wb0ASqQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68450369/1228782512.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWPPg9"&gt;Apple has opened enrollment in its new small business program that will allow eligible app developers to receive 15 percent more from App Store sales, the company &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6lyxewwp"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Apple says “the vast majority of developers on the App Store who sell digital goods and services are eligible” and all developers need to do to qualify is complete the company’s enrollment form &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QG4Pw"&gt;Apple announced the new program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, marking a significant change in how the App Store is structured. Under the new terms of the program, eligible developers making under $1 million per year in App Store sales and in-app purchase revenue are eligible for the reduced commission rate of 15 percent for the following year. Apple typically...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Warner Bros. will release all of its new 2021 movies simultaneously on HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_v7nf2aTIxH3aujJEuP_SZNOSk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68450048/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lsq6E4"&gt;WarnerMedia is pushing even more aggressively into streaming by releasing every single one of its movies in 2021 simultaneously on HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdPM7m"&gt;There are some limitations to the new business model. The movies will only stream on HBO Max for one month before leaving the platform for a period of time. They will also play in theaters simultaneously, keeping the relationship with movie theater distributors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514822/amc-theaters-cash-movies-delays-closing-pandemic-debt-regal"&gt;AMC and Regal&lt;/a&gt;. The plan is to run this experiment for one year. For people who don’t have access to HBO Max in their market, it appears that theatrical releases will still be the go-to option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaDPNy"&gt;The movies Warner Bros. is planning to release for now include: &lt;em&gt;The Little Things, Judas and the Black Messiah, Tom &amp;amp; Jerry, Godzilla vs. Kong,...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yLpjVs"&gt;Today, the National Science Foundation (NSF) released shocking footage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754959/arecibo-observatory-platform-collapse-dish-puerto-rico-telescope"&gt;the collapse of the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;. The video, captured on December 1st, shows the moment when support cables snapped, causing the massive 900-ton structure suspended above Arecibo to fall onto the observatory’s iconic 1,000-foot-wide dish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ll4nGL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the drone operator was very adept to see what was happening.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7kKJcx"&gt;The videos of the collapse were captured by a camera located in Arecibo’s Operations Control Center, as well as from a drone located above the platform at the time of collapse. The operator of the drone was able to adjust the drone camera once the platform started to fall and capture the moment of impact. NSF, which oversees Arecibo, had been...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="6QgdNa"&gt;Twitter has been experimenting with threaded replies for some time as a way to potentially make replies easier to read and follow. But the company has decided to end those experiments because of user feedback, it announced on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHs05V"&gt;“We asked and you let us know this reply layout wasn’t it, as it was harder to read and join conversations,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334544255298232320"&gt;the company wrote in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; published today. “So we’ve turned off this format to work on other ways to improve conversations on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
