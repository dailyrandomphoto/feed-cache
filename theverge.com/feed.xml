    <title>Twitter suspends Wordle-ruining bot</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wordlinator account tweeted rude messages with spoilers at people posting results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Abv3Um"&gt;Twitter has banned @wordlinator, a bot that replied to people’s Wordle posts with rude messages that include spoilers for the next day’s game. The account’s spoilers appeared to be accurate (the key is easily accessible in the game’s code, so it’s not necessarily a surprise), which could end up ruining the game for anyone who sees them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tiKeZV"&gt;For anyone who’s managed to avoid it, Wordle is a game where you get six chances to guess a five-letter word — if you’re interested, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22892044/wordle-free-game-online-how-to-puzzle"&gt;learn how to play it here&lt;/a&gt;. The answer is the same for everyone playing, and it only changes once a day. The game also has an interesting sharing mechanic, where you can copy and paste a series of emoji to let people know how easy or hard it was for you to guess the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google could bring the fight to Roku and Amazon with an even cheaper Chromecast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06B6rCXbQAgQ3Ap_JlhOHso9hq8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426801/DSCF2108.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EHELU6"&gt;Google is working on a lower-end Chromecast with Google TV that would slot in below its current model in price — and also video resolution. According to &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/entertainment/google-chromecast-hd-boreal-1080p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol’s&lt;/em&gt; Janko Roettgers&lt;/a&gt;, the upcoming, cheaper Chromecast will run the same Google TV software as the existing hardware and will still include a remote control. But it will be limited to a maximum of 1080p video quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRwOB1"&gt;Playing to that limitation, &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; believes Google might market the device as “Chromecast HD with Google TV,” similar to the branding of Apple’s Apple TV HD. The product would be marketed towards consumers with 1080p TVs who don’t necessarily care about having the very best picture quality. Other specs mentioned in the report include a maximum of 2GB RAM and 60fps...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s 2022, and the Surface Duo is finally getting Android 11 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nMessnesE1lF-i5Ll_UiG-dAeOI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426723/vpavic_4176_20200905_0142.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo is getting Android 11 at last.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a5fKdZ"&gt;At the beginning of this month, my colleague Monica Chin published an article with the headline “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/1/22862649/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-missed-update"&gt;It’s 2022, and the Surface Duo still doesn’t have Android 11&lt;/a&gt;,” pointing out that Microsoft hadn’t brought Android 11 to the dual-screen phone despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690003/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-release-date"&gt;having said in September&lt;/a&gt; that it was working on delivering the by the end of 2021. That’s finally changing, as Microsoft has begun to roll out Android 11 for unlocked Surface Duos in North America and Europe, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/24/surface-duo-android-11-ota/"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3WUrd"&gt;Not every Surface Duo will be getting the update right away; if you have a Surface Duo that’s tied to AT&amp;amp;T, it sounds like you’re going to have to wait just a bit longer. “For locked or unlocked AT&amp;amp;T Surface Duos, we are testing this release and it is pending...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s revolutionary James Webb Space Telescope reaches final orbit in space</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d8Kd2l"&gt;After traveling hundreds of thousands of miles through space over the last month, NASA’s revolutionary new James Webb Space Telescope &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/01/24/orbital-insertion-burn-a-success-webb-arrives-at-l2/"&gt;performed its last big course correction maneuver&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon, putting itself into its final resting place in space. Now, the observatory will live in perpetuity at a distance of roughly 1 million miles from the Earth, giving the vehicle a front-row view of the most ancient stars and galaxies of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJnvM2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/25/22850167/james-webb-space-telescope-jwst-launch-mission-success"&gt;Launched on Christmas Day&lt;/a&gt;, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, has had a wild ride to its destination. Too enormous to fly to space in its final form, the telescope had to launch folded up inside its rocket. Once it reached space, JWST began an extremely complex routine of shape-shifting...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla Cybertruck walkaround video shows the absurdly huge windshield wiper in detail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even in handheld video, the truck looks a little unreal.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Cybertruck Owners Club&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F4INAK"&gt;We got the closest look yet at an alleged prototype of the Tesla Cybertruck, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHT040_Pt3w"&gt;walkaround video&lt;/a&gt; posted to the &lt;a href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-photos-leaked-%F0%9F%93%B8-added-video-showing-whole-truck-rear-bed.4660/"&gt;Cybertruck Owners Club forum&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2022/01/24/tesla-cybertruck-prototype-shown-in-detail-in-new-leaked-walkaround-video/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). We get to see a good deal of the vehicle, including its giant windshield and wiper. You can watch the whole thing below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXb84A"&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828220/tesla-cybertruck-prototype-drone-shot-windshield-wiper-elon-musk"&gt;saw the wiper last month&lt;/a&gt; when a drone video captured a Cybertruck doing laps on the company’s test track in Fremont, California. Tesla CEO Elon Musk commented on the wiper at the time, saying that it troubled him and that a wiper you could stow away in the front trunk would be “ideal, but complex.” (Is getting out in the rain, sleet, or snow to put on your windshield wiper &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;ideal, though?)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T’s new 5-gig and 2-gig fiber internet is here, starting at $110 a month</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K66hn1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.att.com/aboutus/pressrelease/2022/fastest-major-internet-provider.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is rolling out 2Gbps and 5Gbps&lt;/a&gt; speed tiers for its &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/internet/fiber/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fiber-optic internet option&lt;/a&gt;. The company made the announcement to kick off its Life Gigified event, where it said new and existing AT&amp;amp;T Fiber customers will soon be able to take advantage of these multi-gig connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUOSaz"&gt;If you don’t know what multi-gig is, it means a single connection that offers speeds higher than 1Gbps. And because it’s a fiber-optic connection, this speed goes both ways. “It’s symmetrical; your upload and download speeds are the same.” Chris Sambar, AT&amp;amp;T’s executive vice president of technology operations said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQf68L"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s new multi-gig speeds need Wi-Fi 6 technology for “optimal” performance, which means you’ll probably want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21283756/arris-surfboard-max-pro-wi-fi-6-mesh-router-review-price-specs-features"&gt;upgrade...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the auto repair professor pivoting to EVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lEEf008xJcbOxJYOlezl0gX2C6U=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426327/Ruth_Morrison1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xsKaVg"&gt;With the number of electric vehicles on the roads poised to skyrocket this decade, millions of drivers are going to need auto mechanics who can fix their new batteries-on-wheels. But today, the &lt;a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2018/12/10/97-of-auto-mechanics-cant-work-on-electric-cars-new-report-concludes/?utm_source=Triggermail&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Post%20Blast%20bii-transportation-and-logistics:%20Tesla%20owners%20dissatisfied%20with%20wait%20for%20services%20%7C%20Ford%20will%20use%20over-the-air%20updates%20in%202020%20%7C%20US%20govt%20grounds%20Chinese%20drones&amp;amp;utm_term=BII%20List%20T%26L%20ALL"&gt;vast majority of auto repair professionals&lt;/a&gt; do not have the training or equipment to repair EVs, which are anatomically very different from their gas-powered predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EI8JQ"&gt;As a result, many early EV adopters have been forced to rely on vehicle manufacturers and dealerships to service their cars — a situation that can &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/26/your-money/26shortcuts.html"&gt;drive up repair costs&lt;/a&gt; and lead to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-owners-dissatisfied-with-wait-for-services-2019-11"&gt;frustratingly long wait times&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1HEqQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smccme.edu/faculty-profiles/#morrison"&gt;Ruth Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, who chairs the &lt;a href="https://www.smccme.edu/academics/degree-programs/automotive-technology/#cert"&gt;Automotive Technology Department&lt;/a&gt; at Southern Maine Community College (SMCC), wants to change that. Morrison, who was an auto mechanic...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase makes it easier to report cryptocurrency taxes</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIGjhJ"&gt;Coinbase, one of the largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, is adding a new tax center to its app and website to help US customers work out how much they might owe to the IRS as a result of their crypto transactions, the company has announced. The section is designed to gather every taxable transaction into one place to simplify matters come tax day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hqKtd"&gt;Although cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin often appear similar to the fiat money we’re accustomed to, in the eyes of the IRS, the digital assets are actually property, according to &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions"&gt;this FAQ&lt;/a&gt; from the federal agency. That means cryptocurrency transactions may need to be reported as capital gains or losses, and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; means keeping track of a cryptocurrency’s value as it’s bought and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Blink outdoor cameras with floodlight and solar-charging configurations are $50 off</title>

  &lt;p id="mZNMmI"&gt;Mondays are for football hangovers, extra strong coffee, and deals. If the weekend brought you grief due to some big playoff upsets, we’re here to ease the pain with great savings on gadgets. What better way to dull the sting of an abysmal 13-10 loss to the sixth seed when you’re supposed to be the favorite to win it all?
