    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NR6ggZ"&gt;The PAX East 2021 gaming convention, previously scheduled for June 3rd through 6th, &lt;a href="https://east.paxsite.com/news/article/pax-east-21-update"&gt;has been canceled&lt;/a&gt;, Penny Arcade and event coordination company ReedPop announced today. The PAX organizers also announced an online convention, PAX Online 2021, for July 15th to July 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FikpKh"&gt;“While we hoped PAX East could safely take place, we remained realistic and did not sell any tickets or space to exhibitors to avoid significantly inconveniencing our friends and partners,” Kyle Marsden-Kish, the PAX event director at ReedPop, said in a statement. “As we have shown via our actions throughout the pandemic, our utmost concern is the safety of the PAX family — from attendees, exhibitors, and show staff to media and content creators — as well as the local...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s new flagship has a giant camera bump with its own OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aGfOLe-QM-MlawlMUpYKqCztL0g=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042307/mi11u2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="angaRd"&gt;Xiaomi has announced its latest flagship, the Mi 11 Ultra. It’s based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;the excellent new Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;, but has a more advanced camera system — including a second screen housed inside the camera bump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MG9c3"&gt;The Mi 11 Ultra has three cameras on the back: a 1/1.12-inch 50-megapixel main sensor, a 48-megapixel ultrawide, and a 48-megapixel 5x periscope telephoto. Those sensors should be upgrades across the board when compared to the regular Mi 11, which had a smaller 108-megapixel main sensor, a 13-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel macro camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KCRBdG"&gt;The camera bump dominates the top portion of the Mi 11 Ultra, and its secondary screen is the reason why. It’s a 1.1-inch 126 x 294 OLED display with a peak brightness of 450 nits and a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s wireless charging pad is the latest clone to attempt the AirPower dream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XmMpFLirD1-i5XfGi7XZF7kNv3E=/173x0:1586x942/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042245/image__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QcfRDd"&gt;Xiaomi unveiled a new wireless charging pad during its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350245/xiaomi-mi-mix-liquid-lens-autofocus-focal-length-camera"&gt;Mi Mix event this morning&lt;/a&gt;. The pad is capable of simultaneously charging three devices without precise placement, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;canceled Apple AirPower charger&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoSfpz"&gt;According to Xiaomi, this wireless charging pad features up to 20W of wireless power per device and includes &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1376506733493768192?s=20"&gt;19 coils&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to place any three devices that support Qi wireless charging, according to Xiaomi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTOOaT"&gt;Unlike most other clones out there, Xiamoi’s wireless charging pad is more affordable, selling for about $90. However, it is unknown if the charging pad will see a release outside of China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1lB9kW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Xiaomi is not the first company to make its own clone of the Apple AirPower&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>These TikToks are a playful look into the harsh realities of game development</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FCimnf"&gt;Leslee Sullivant approaches the camera curiously. Her hair is pulled back into a ponytail, and she’s dressed in an olive green button-up against a bar background. “Are you one of the new hires?” she asks. “Oh, you’re the intern!” She offers to sneak you a drink when she learns you’re underage and asks about your boyfriend. You’re not like her wife, she says. The wife doesn’t really get the whole gaming thing. “If you’re looking for a mentor, I’m your guy,” she concludes. The caption on the TikTok video is “grooming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOMoWn"&gt;The games industry struggles with #MeToo-style reckonings every few months, and Sullivant’s video is a pitch-perfect impression of one of the many insidious ways those problems happen. On TikTok and Twitter, where she later...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Echo Show 10 that moves is $40 off for the first time</title>

  &lt;p id="3BWttr"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a deal on Amazon’s new Echo Show 10 smart display that can spin around to always be facing you, today’s your day. Normally $250, it’s down to $210 right now for the black or white versions, both of which feature a camera for video chats, as well as for tracking you in order to make sure the screen’s within view for convenience. This is the first price drop, and 16 percent off isn’t bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qA5gIY"&gt;This deal is available through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551%3Fpreselect%3D80770248%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, but Amazon has the exclusive on a deal that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/echo-show-10/dp/B08SQ2F8D2?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs just $5 more&lt;/a&gt; and lets you checkout with the Blink Mini home security cam added to your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
