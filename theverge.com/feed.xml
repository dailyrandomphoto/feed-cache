    <title>John Legere is considering becoming the Un-Candidate</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U6Gzx8"&gt;John Legere, former T-Mobile CEO and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/7/10729714/john-legere-carrier-bullshit"&gt;aspiring Batman&lt;/a&gt;, has reacted to the mob that attacked the Capitol like many other political and business leaders by calling for President Donald Trump to step down. But he’s also going a step further by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1347374021495681024?s=19"&gt;considering a run for political office himself&lt;/a&gt;. Legere left his post as CEO and member of T-Mobile’s board after successfully negotiating the merger between the company and Sprint, so he very well could be looking far and wide for his next gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzfrsy"&gt;Legere’s time as T-Mobile’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/mobile/2013/3/26/4149204/tmobile-new-direction-no-contracts-lte-uncarrier"&gt;turned the company into the “Un-Carrier,”&lt;/a&gt; a plan that came with an end to contracts, revamped mobile plans, and a variety of freebies and perks for customers designed to set T-Mobile apart from its longtime rivals AT&amp;amp;T and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is kicking Parler off its web hosting service</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6OqwvA"&gt;In the latest blow to social app Parler, Amazon said Saturday it was suspending the company from its web hosting platform effective at 11:59PM PST Sunday. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;unless Parler finds another web hosting service, the site will go offline Sunday night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSELOn"&gt;Parler CEO John Matze said in &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/009ba435b68c46d4955e1cd7737fa27c"&gt;a post on the site Saturday&lt;/a&gt; evening that the site could be offline for up to a week “as we rebuild from scratch.” Matze said the company had prepared for such an event, “by never relying on amazons [sic] proprietary infrastructure and building bare metal products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZ2aYe"&gt;He added that “many” were competing for Parler’s business, and accused Amazon, Google, and Apple of a coordinated attack to kill competition. “We were too successful too fast,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple removes Parler from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jYBDmZ"&gt;Apple has removed Parler from the App Store, following accusations that the social media app was fostering calls to violence ahead of, and following, the raid on the US Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sczRDR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity. Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety. We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues,” reads a statement from the company on Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMGX2M"&gt;Apple issued an ultimatum to Parler on Friday demanding that it remove content in violation with its policies and provide a plan on how it would moderate...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What just happened this week?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;A mob of President Trump’s supporters rioted at the Capitol  | Photo by ALEX EDELMAN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3QTk5R"&gt;Ah, what a year this week has been! Our entire perception of time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22167586/pandemic-time-perception-2020-covid"&gt;has already been skewed by the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, but even by &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; standard the last few days have felt like a bizarre time warp, starting with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213105/slack-outage-down-2021-server-error"&gt;Slack outage on Monday&lt;/a&gt; that seemed like it would be the story of the week. Oh how naive we were. Of course, Wednesday’s attack on the Capitol as Congress was certifying the Electoral College results dominated the rest of the news cycle, and social media and other online platforms decided that by &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22220746/trump-speech-incite-capitol-riot"&gt;inciting the rioters&lt;/a&gt;, the president had finally crossed a line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wK7vmN"&gt;Here’s a review of the tumultuous first week of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aRjs3y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, January 6th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="t4gziB"&gt;After he spoke to a rally near the White House, a mob of Trump supporters marched on, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;and broke into the...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s ban from Twitter creates the ultimate case of link rot in posts across the internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4dPXR0"&gt;When Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned President Trump&lt;/a&gt; from its platform permanently on Friday, the thousands of tweets he put forth from his realDonaldTrump account over the past decade were wiped out. Retweets of realDonaldTrump tweets from other accounts now show a “this tweet is unavailable” message instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnF4BL"&gt;But embeds of Trump’s original tweets are now displaying in articles across the internet as shadows of their former selves, some with just the text of the former tweet included, others as empty gray boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYJGsZ"&gt;This effect, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot"&gt;known as link rot&lt;/a&gt;, happens when images or content are deleted or otherwise broken, so links don’t point back to the original target, whether that’s a tweet, a video, or a web page. In most instances, a dead link is a visually...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social media and telco companies urged to preserve evidence from Capitol attack</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7aoZXg"&gt;Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), incoming chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is asking mobile carriers and social media platforms to preserve “content and associated metadata” that may be  connected to the attack on the US Capitol. Warner said in a statement Saturday that he contacted the CEOs of AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Apple, Facebook, Gab, Google, Parler, Signal, Telegram, and Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4VTOB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The United States Capitol is now a crime scene,” Warner &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22224462/capitol_attack_twitter.pdf"&gt;wrote in his letters&lt;/a&gt;. “The FBI and other law enforcement agencies are currently investigating the events of that day, and trying to piece together what happened and the perpetrators involved. The prospect of litigation on behalf of the victims of the mayhem also is highly likely....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use your Oculus Quest 2 to play any PC VR game wirelessly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q8Sb_6aZYKAVgUN-Mu726FoGJrQ=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68643020/hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh hey, it’s all of my PC games available to play on the Quest 2, wire-free, from within a virtual room. This is getting weird.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vDDDh3"&gt;One of the best features of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; is it can be manually linked via USB to your gaming PC to play more demanding VR games you couldn’t otherwise run natively on the headset. That’s great if you want a way to play games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; but the obvious downside is that you’re now physically tethered to a PC — so much for the wireless freedom that the Quest 2 advertises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTupji"&gt;Thankfully, developers have already figured out the seemingly impossible: how to run system-intensive titles on your PC and stream the visual feed to your VR device while syncing all of your movements over Wi-Fi. It gives you the best of both worlds: letting you play the games you want without being attached by a cable to your computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3KFeB"&gt;Doing this isn’t...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DraftKings announces it will now allow betting on drone races in some states</title>

  &lt;p id="0z1ast"&gt;Sports betting company DraftKings and the Drone Racing League (DRL)  will now allow betting on drone races in some states, the two &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-drone-racing-league-and-draftkings-take-flight-with-official-sports-betting-agreement-ahead-of-season-finale-races-301203192.html"&gt;companies announced&lt;/a&gt;. DRL, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/draftkings-and-drone-racing-league-partnership-lets-you-bet-on-drone-races.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; describes&lt;/a&gt; as a first-person view racing league, allows pilots to compete for prizes by flying their drones through courses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRta0L"&gt;Residents of Colorado, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Tennessee, and West Virginia will be able to bet on the races via their phones, and regulatory approval is pending for betting on drone races in other states, the companies said. The terms of the deal and the amounts of the prize money weren’t disclosed, but drone racers &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/19/drone-racing-is-worth-100000-in-upcoming-championship.html"&gt;in a 2017 tournament&lt;/a&gt; competed for $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s 2021, and the pandemic is still here </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dodger Stadium COVID-19 testing site, which is the largest in the U.S., will reopen today after a weekend closure for restructuring to alleviate traffic in the area.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wHWLA1"&gt;I regret to inform you that even with all of the other news happening this week, there is still a pandemic going on. It would have been great to sweep it out the door with the old planners and dead Christmas trees. But it’s 2021, and COVID-19 is still here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0l3wX"&gt;More than a year after this &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-virus-discovered-by-chinese-scientists-investigating-pneumonia-outbreak-11578485668"&gt;coronavirus made its big debut&lt;/a&gt;, it’s bigger than ever. Days after it was sequenced on January 7th, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/"&gt;there were 41 cases in China&lt;/a&gt; and one death. A year later, the toll now stands at 88,617,915 infected, and 1,907,608 dead. &lt;/p&gt;
