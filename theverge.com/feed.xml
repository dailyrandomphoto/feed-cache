    <title>Roblox to introduce content ratings for games to better restrict age-inappropriate content</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qohKIu"&gt;Virtual gaming platform Roblox is developing content ratings for games and easier-to-use parental controls, the company’s chief privacy officer Remy Malan told &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roblox-struggles-with-sexual-content-it-hopes-a-ratings-system-will-address-the-problem-11618660801"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjUe7F"&gt;Half of Roblox’s audience of more than 30 million daily users are kids under 13, but the platform has struggled at times to contain sexually explicit content. Age-inappropriate games sometimes surface up on kids’ “recommended for you” lists, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdybR0"&gt;The platform’s current system restricts kids to specific games, but under the new system, parents would have more information about what kids might find in a given game; until you play a game, it’s not always clear that it might have explicit or inappropriate content in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mWaEs"&gt;Malan did not...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google introducing a feature in Chrome 90 to create links to highlighted text on a webpage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cUclObS02E-f6lIvl6OO_Z-EiGE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69143488/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1h5rqm"&gt;An upcoming feature in Chrome 90 will allow users to create a link to a section of a website that they’ve highlighted. First &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295300/google-link-to-text-fragment-chrome-extension-chromium-highlight-scroll-down"&gt;launched as a browser extension&lt;/a&gt; called Link to Text Fragment last year, Google has now added the feature within Chrome itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDkFv7"&gt;The new feature is still rolling out to users; I wasn’t able to get it to work even after I updated to Chrome 90. But the feature works just like the browser extension did, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/more-helpful-chrome-throughout-your-workday/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Google product manager Kayce Hawkins: Visit a web page, highlight the text you want to create a link to, right click, and select “copy link to highlight.” A URL ending in a pound sign (#) is generated, which you can then share with others. When they open the link, they’ll be sent to the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon has reportedly canceled its Lord of the Rings MMO game</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OkE29Z"&gt;Amazon Game Studios has canceled a &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; online role-playing game, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-17/amazon-cancels-lord-of-the-rings-game-announced-two-years-ago?srnd=technology-vp&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20688736/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-athlon-games-leyou-free-to-play-tolkien"&gt;announced the project&lt;/a&gt; with Leyou-owned Athlon Games back in 2019, and planned it to be a free-to-play game for PC and consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsMYkR"&gt;The game was to be set “at a time long before the events of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, exploring lands, people and creatures never seen before by fans of the Tolkien universe,” according to an announcement from Athlon at the time. But &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-12-14-leyou-shareholders-approve-tencent-takeover"&gt;Leyou was acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Tencent Holdings in December, and contract negotiations between Amazon and Tencent later fell apart, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OkiJOG"&gt;Amazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday, but a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;that it was “unable to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA reschedules Ingenuity helicopter’s first flight on Mars for Monday </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;An artists’ rendering of the Ingenuity and its parent rover Perseverance | NASA/JPL-Caltech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZarA9f"&gt;NASA has rescheduled the first flight of its Ingenuity Mars helicopter to April 19th at 3:30AM ET, the&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-to-attempt-first-controlled-flight-on-mars-as-soon-as-monday"&gt; agency announced&lt;/a&gt; Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY26kL"&gt;The four-pound helicopter that arrived on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Mars on February 18th with its parent rover Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; has seen its first flight delayed a few times. It touched the surface of Mars on April 4th, and has been undergoing tests and checkouts. It survived its first night alone on Mars’ frigid surface, passing a first test of its independence from Perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijL8wR"&gt;The craft was scheduled to take flight April 11th, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377299/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flight-delayed-wednesday"&gt;last weekend NASA said&lt;/a&gt; data from a high-speed rotor test showed the test sequence ended early, as Ingenuity’s computer tried to switch from pre-flight to flight mode The date was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381554/ingenuity-mars-first-flight-delayed-nasa-fixes-software-bug"&gt;pushed back again&lt;/a&gt; after...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CPSC urges people with children at home to stop using Peloton Tread Plus treadmill ‘immediately’</title>

  &lt;p id="2qHhQF"&gt;The Consumer Product Safety Commission on Saturday &lt;a href="https://cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-Stop-Using-the-Peloton-Tread+"&gt;issued a warning&lt;/a&gt; about Peloton Tread Plus treadmills, saying the machines pose “serious risks to children for abrasions, fractures, and death.” In a March blog post by CEO John Foley, the company &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;said it was aware&lt;/a&gt; that a child had died in an accident on the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9yzbK"&gt;The agency says it is aware of 39 incidents with the Tread Plus, including one death. “In light of multiple reports of children becoming entrapped, pinned, and pulled under the rear roller of the product, CPSC urges consumers with children at home to stop using the product immediately,” the CPSC bulletin states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLvtZt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y&amp;amp;ab_channel=U.S.ConsumerProductSafetyCommission"&gt;The CPSC posted a video&lt;/a&gt; showing what could happen in a Tread Plus accident involving a child. It shows an...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CJzRMV"&gt;During a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis on Thursday, a company policy barring some employees from having their cell phones on them while working prevented family members from being able to contact workers inside the facility, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/us/shooting-fedex.html?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxyT7b"&gt;Authorities said the gunman, a former employee, fired into the warehouse killing eight people and wounding at least seven others, then fatally shot himself before police arrived. The incident began around 11PM Thursday and was over in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVaTcf"&gt;Tami Campbell, whose husband works at the facility, said she didn’t know what had happened to him until he called her after his shift ended at 10AM Friday. “I called his phone a thousand times even though I knew he...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter having a partial outage Saturday morning</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tAkjEl"&gt;It looks like problems on Twitter that began Friday night are persisting Saturday morning. People on the east coast of the US were reporting that while the page would load, they were unable to send tweets and DMs. As of 11 AM ET Saturday, the site was still experiencing issues for many users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rG6yl0"&gt;There’s no official word on how widespread the outage is, but Twitter said Saturday it was “fixing an issue” with its servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ylVPU"&gt;Twitter Support posted a brief message Friday night that it was looking into the matter, and updated it Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BV6AwV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We know that parts of Twitter still aren’t working for some of you. We’re fixing an issue with our servers to get things back to normal soon. Thanks for sticking with us.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Peloton is fighting a recall request on its treadmill after a child died last month</title>

  &lt;p id="1AV52L"&gt;Peloton is resisting a request from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to recall its Tread Plus treadmill, which was &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;involved with the death of a child last month&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/16/peloton-treadmill-injuries-death-cpsc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; is reporting tonight&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="rWjp6m"&gt;The agency is reportedly planning on issuing a consumer alert about the Tread Plus and may do so as early as Saturday, according to officials who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;Post. &lt;/em&gt;One official added that “this doesn’t happen with other treadmills.” The &lt;em&gt;Post’s&lt;/em&gt; sources tell the paper that the CPSC is aware of “‘dozens’ of incidents involving Peloton’s treadmills, some involving pets or exercise balls and many of them resulting in serious injuries.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="q2t5kR"&gt;A judge in Australia found Google misled users about personal location data the company collected via Android devices,  a violation of Australian law, the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/australia-canberra-court-decisions-courts-laws-c6a7b75ac7cbfabc6ff2bc4069e3911c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6MLDP9"&gt;According to Federal Court Judge Thomas Thawley, the violations occurred between January 2017 and December 2018. Users creating a new Google account while setting up a new Android device were led to believe that the “Location History” setting was the only Google account setting that would determine if the company collected identifiable data about the user’s location. In fact, another Google account setting that was turned on by default — the “Web &amp;amp; App Activity” setting— allowed Google to collect and store personally identifiable location information when it...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="fCh9NZ"&gt;Google’s Project Zero, a team of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/15/5902061/google-project-zero-security-team"&gt;dedicated security engineers&lt;/a&gt; tasked with reducing the number of “zero day” vulnerabilities around the entire internet, says it will &lt;a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/04/policy-and-disclosure-2021-edition.html"&gt;give developers an extra 30 days&lt;/a&gt; before disclosing vulnerability issues, in order to give end-users time to patch their software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qumkuq"&gt;Developers will still have 90 days to fix bugs, but Project Zero will wait another 30 days before it discloses the details of the bug publicly. If a flaw is being actively exploited in the wild, a company will have seven days to issue a patch, and a three-day grace period if requested. But Google Project Zero will wait 30 days before it discloses technical details. &lt;/p&gt;
