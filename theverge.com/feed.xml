    <title>Newly named panda cub is still online as National Zoo closes doors  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rP9OK9nCmdcOtcVx4z0ghLl1qIY=/428x0:3668x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67851070/20201118_roshanpatel004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nov. 18, 2020: The Smithsonian’s National Zoo’s giant panda cub received a clean bill of health from Zoo veterinarians during his third veterinary exam. They listened to his heart and lungs, checked his eyes and mouth, and tested the range of motion in his limbs. The cub also received his second canine distemper vaccine.   | Image: National Zoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ibyaz9"&gt;The National Zoo and other Smithsonian institutions closed their doors to visitors again today because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the zoo’s &lt;a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/webcams"&gt;webcams&lt;/a&gt; are still live, including the &lt;a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/webcams/panda-cam"&gt;Giant Panda Cam&lt;/a&gt;, which will keep broadcasting adorable footage of the institution’s newly named baby panda during the latest shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="IGA8s6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“little miracle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6DSRSD"&gt;The National Zoo just announced the panda’s name today: Xiao Qi Ji (SHIAU-chi-ji), which is Mandarin for “little miracle.” The zoo left the naming up to voters, who cast almost 135,000 votes online last week for their favorite moniker. Xiao Qi Ji beat out four other options, including Xing Fu (my personal favorite, which translates to “happy and prosperous”) and Zai Zai (a Chinese nickname for a boy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xySKgl"&gt;Xiao Qi...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Friday deals: what time sales start at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RdbcVcS8LSPFLdltbZVxKFA8Cs4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67851019/acastro_191031_1777_blackFriday_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nj1X37"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; will officially kick off on Friday, November 27th, but if you plan to make that the only day you buy gifts for the holiday season, you are missing out. Several retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, are already getting a head start on holiday discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjhxYw"&gt;Whether you take advantage of the deals now or hold off until Black Friday, it’s important to know how every major retailer is handling Black Friday this year. Due to the pandemic, some retailers are doing things a bit differently, with many consistently offering good deals over the last several weeks leading up to Black Friday. In either case, if you plan to spend some money on Black Friday, here are the schedules for these retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to disable Edge’s new URL copy and paste feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EcAd9jWuVPG1-RTycViJiBaciM8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67850983/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M9RmfB"&gt;If you’re using a recent version of Microsoft’s Edge browser, you might have noticed that the way URLs copy and paste &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/improved-copy-and-paste-of-urls-in-microsoft-edge-d3bd3956-603a-0033-1fbc-9588a30645b4#:~:text=a%20hyperlinked%20title%3A-,In%20Microsoft%20Edge%2C%20copy%20the%20URL%20you%20want%20from%20the,to%20paste%20the%20web%20address."&gt;has changed&lt;/a&gt;. As of Edge version 87 for Windows or 88 for macOS, you’ll find that by default trying to copy and paste a URL from an address bar will paste the title of a webpage as a hyperlink rather than its URL directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcY0qC"&gt;So instead of seeing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8Hx47m"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="q9ZBli"&gt;...like you’d expect to, you’ll instead paste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MK06b0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="IgT2Om"&gt;Depending on what you’re doing, this might be helpful. If you’re sending an email that you want to be nicely formatted with a hyperlink, then this might save you some time, for example. It’s also possible to still paste a plain URL if you use the Ctrl + Shift + V command to paste the plain URL without...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSby2y"&gt;The majority of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; deals will launch the day after Thanksgiving (November 26th) in the US as usual, but the pandemic has shaken things up in yet another way. The best deals will be happening online, with fewer in-person sales for the sake of safety. Better yet, some of those great deals are already available, so you can get started on your holiday gift (or personal) shopping. With this post, we’re rounding up the best early Black Friday deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Adorama, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Newegg, and anywhere else we find deals you should know about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos Move, Beam, and Sub are $100 off for Black Friday week</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cFY5CE"&gt;Sonos has discounted several of its speakers for the week leading up to Black Friday, including the portable Move, Beam soundbar, and Sub add-on. All three models are $100 off, a significant discount from their regular prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDNf8U"&gt;Sales on Sonos speakers are rare — we typically only see meaningful discounts on them during the holiday shopping season. The company discounted the Move &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/14/21563848/sonos-move-wifi-bluetooth-speaker-alexa-google-assistant-sale-deal-best-buy-amazon-bh-photo"&gt;for the first time just a week ago&lt;/a&gt;; this week’s sale matches that price should you have missed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="DBFDtg"&gt;The Sonos Move is the company’s first portable speaker with a built-in 11-hour battery that lets you easily move it from room to room, outside, or even take it to an entirely different location. It has similar sound quality to the smaller Sonos One and...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rzQIrV"&gt;Amazon is hosting a wide variety of tech deals for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The company started its deal festivities early by knocking down prices for many of its own devices, including some of its newer products that hadn’t yet seen any discounts. The fourth-generation Echo smart speaker, the latest Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi routers, and more are all discounted right now, in addition to several other Amazon devices, such as the company’s entire range of Fire TV streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7OYsE"&gt;Of course, that’s just the beginning. More deals will come later this week, and we’ll be including the best deals we find below. The latest deals to hit the wire will be at the top, while the others will be organized by category. If your search for gifts spans...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="gyNgwb"&gt;If you are a gamer looking to expand your gaming library, this time of year is an ideal time to get a ton of games for less. Like many other retailers, GameStop is slashing the prices on many products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="p1BRZ2"&gt;If you are not planning to buy a next-gen console, then there’s a ton of game deals to take advantage of. Many games released for the PS4, Switch, and Xbox One are heavily discounted. including some of...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="cfELta"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neo: The World Ends With You&lt;/em&gt;, the follow-up to Square Enix’s 2007 cult classic for the Nintendo DS, will launch for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch in summer 2021, the developer announced today. The action roleplaying game returns players to the Shibuya district of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtB74b"&gt;Few details about&lt;em&gt; Neo: The World Ends With You &lt;/em&gt;have been released. As Rindo, players will once again participate in the Reapers’ Game, which plays out through a series of missions that will determine whether the player is erased from existence itself. A trailer released today teases a return to the series’s colorful, fictionalized take on Shibuya, as well as a new cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQqXuy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The World Ends With You&lt;/em&gt; first launched for Nintendo DS more than a decade ago to critical acclaim....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn’s Wisconsin factory reportedly wins Google server manufacturing contract</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIeof6"&gt;Foxconn is reportedly planning to assemble Google server components at its beleaguered Wisconsin factory. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/foxconn-plant-championed-by-trump-lands-google-server-contract"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Foxconn landed a deal with Google and is establishing assembly lines for making circuit boards, aiming to start mass production in the first quarter of next year. Foxconn confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that it was developing computing and infrastructure “capabilities” but did not name customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSdLnz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; suggests that Google is expanding American manufacturing to win more government contracts, and one source said Foxconn was the only manufacturer that could assemble the necessary components inside the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Assistant can now be used to schedule your smart lights</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wmvXKjv8lxiNouqRsLWweuhqOH8=/540x0:2340x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67846291/Hero_image_of_new_Smart_Display_visual_experience.0.png" /&gt;

&lt;p id="fsFa93"&gt;One caveat: you have to be really specific if you want to schedule the lights (or other devices) to turn on or off a day in the future. Just saying something like, “Hey Google, turn the lights on tomorrow at 8PM,” isn’t enough. You’d need to say, “Hey Google, turn on the lights Tuesday at...&lt;/p&gt;
