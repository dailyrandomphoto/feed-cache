    <title>Pinterest had a giant fourth quarter thanks to a strong holiday season</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JI8rg3"&gt;Like other online platforms, Pinterest reaped the benefits of an uptick in e-commerce advertising during the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LCvWI"&gt;The image-sharing platform saw a 76 percent year-over-year jump in fourth quarter revenue, to $706 million, the &lt;a href="https://investor.pinterestinc.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2021/Pinterest-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx"&gt;company said Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Pinterest had 459 global million monthly active users (MAUs) in the fourth quarter, up from 442 million in &lt;a href="https://investor.pinterestinc.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2020/Pinterest-Announces-Third-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx"&gt;its third quarter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6kOE5"&gt;Pinterest said in its &lt;a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/958601754/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Pinterest-Q4-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;letter to investors&lt;/a&gt; that its revenue growth was mostly driven by a robust holiday season and product improvements in advertising. It saw a six-fold increase in the number of businesses that used its shopping ads format during the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyHUKJ"&gt;“We welcomed over 100 million additional monthly active users to Pinterest in 2020, more than...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even you can afford Serena Williams’ gamer chair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r0uqc3ozgb637VyVpPDOY8jU6IU=/320x0:2354x1356/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771476/Screen_Shot_2021_02_04_at_4.56.20_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qq8XB6"&gt;There’s a great deal to gawk at in Serena Williams’ house, from the perfectly shined wood floors to furniture made of Elmo dolls. But there’s one item that feels out of place in house full of luxury: a cutesy pastel gamer chair. You can spot the oddly pedestrian item in a &lt;a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/step-inside-serena-williams-striking-florida-home"&gt;recent feature from &lt;em&gt;Architectural Digest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqScUJ"&gt;There’s no rule that a legendary athlete like Williams needs a bougie, high-end chair that costs more than most people’s rent. But given the other features of her house (see: hidden room and big clear piano), it’s surprising, and a little endearing, to spot something so... average. As &lt;a href="https://jezebel.com/serena-williamss-interior-decor-is-a-nerds-delight-1846199282"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jezebel &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, Williams’ chair — dubiously named “Zeanus Pink Ergonomic Gaming Chair for Girl” because it’s pink, I guess — is shockingly...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo IV and Overwatch 2 aren’t launching this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overwatch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ADtgvvlfqbwyH-XwB8ol4gZy6Hs=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771439/OVR_Ashe_000.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YDBJRn"&gt;Blizzard has two huge sequels in the works, but it looks like neither will launch this year. During its most recent earnings call, Activision Blizzard revealed that it doesn’t expect &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; to be part of its 2021 financials, suggesting both will launch in 2022 or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ph5R0F"&gt;Technically, this doesn’t represent a delay since neither game had a specific release date in place. Both&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943766/blizzard-overwatch-2-sequel-announcement-blizzcon-2019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942565/diablo-4-announced-release-date-blizzcon-2019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were first announced at BlizzCon 2019, and the developer has been relatively quiet since then, particularly about the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V98E9t"&gt;That said, while the games may be further off than many fans expected, we’ll still likely hear more about them soon. Blizzard will kick off a remote version of BlizzCon on February 19th, and...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>The latest GameStop stock dip looks like the end of the line</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="gamestop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fUcvbW3Gf66pxzabVr6_zu9iQwE=/0x32:1100x765/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771381/GameStop_Store_Front_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CNBYIE"&gt;When GameStop’s stock price fell by over 50 percent on Tuesday, closing at $90, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262546/gamestop-amc-stock-down-short-squeeze"&gt;we weren’t sure if it was going to pick back up or keep going down&lt;/a&gt;. It seems we now have our answer, as GME is down another 41 percent, closing today at just $53.50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sD8OHh"&gt;That's &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/"&gt;less than the stock sold for&lt;/a&gt; the week before it took off on a wild rollercoaster ride induced by Reddit retail investors and an unprecedented social media frenzy. So it seems like we’re not so much in a dip, but on the long, slow ride back to the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YB3j2r"&gt;When I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262546/gamestop-amc-stock-down-short-squeeze"&gt;about GameStop’s stock dip on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, the stock was down 81 percent from its peak of $483. Now, it’s down 89 percent from that peak. There was always the chance of a rally (and I guess, technically, there still is), but...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Google union files labor board charge against contract company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KgZx2K"&gt;The Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) has filed an unfair labor charge against Adecco, a subcontracting firm that provides data center services to Google. The union says managers tried to stop Google contractors from discussing pay, which is illegal. Shannon Wait, a union member and contractor, was suspended after posting about working conditions on Facebook. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/alphabet-union-alleges-contract-workers-were-silenced-about-pay"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U78oHc"&gt;The charge is the first legal action the Alphabet Workers Union has taken to protect employees. Since the union went public in early January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220778/alphabet-workers-union-demands-youtube-ban-trump"&gt;it’s called on YouTube to ban Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and voiced concern with the treatment of AI ethics researcher Margaret Mitchell, but both of these actions took the form of open letters and had no legal force.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niagara is a minimalist Android launcher I wish I’d had on my bus commute</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Niagara Launcher puts your apps within easy striking distance of your thumb.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOd31n"&gt;After a couple years of beta testing, Niagara Launcher is now &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;available for download from the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. It’s designed to replace the default Android app drawer and home screen grid with a layout that’s easier to access with one hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZIrlX"&gt;You pick your favorite apps to pin on the home screen, and the rest are accessible under an alphabetized list on the right side of the screen in easy striking distance of your thumb. It’s quick and very responsive; you can either tap on the part of the alphabet you’re aiming for or swipe up and down to scroll your list of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eS7Yah"&gt;Niagara also allows you to take quick action from the home screen by swiping across any app to bring up a list of options, like setting a new timer in the clock app or...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap says its TikTok competitor already has 100 million monthly users</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T9LAwZ"&gt;Snap says &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;its TikTok competitor&lt;/a&gt;, Spotlight, &lt;a href="https://investor.snap.com/news/news-details/2021/Snap-Inc.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx"&gt;had 100 million users&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021, just two months after it launched. The figure would suggest a surprisingly successful debut for the service, which has taken over the rightmost tab inside of Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5wYl0"&gt;TikTok likely still has a significant lead on the new service, though. TikTok said it &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-reveals-us-global-user-growth-numbers-for-first-time.html"&gt;had 100 million monthly users&lt;/a&gt; in the United States alone as of June 2020, and signs suggest the app has only continued to grow since then. (On the other hand, Instagram’s leader has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238513/instagram-adam-mosseri-reels-decoder-interview-podcast"&gt;said he’s “not yet happy with” Reels&lt;/a&gt;, its shortform video competitor.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is weighing an anti-tracking feature for Android, following Apple’s lead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7GqZ7rzl3eJHMMEzH_uM2rn3p38=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770894/acastro_190228_1777_vpn_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OQOo4A"&gt;Google is considering developing an Android alternative to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253366/apple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch"&gt;upcoming App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt;, a new planned opt-in requirement the iPhone maker will impose on developers that demands they ask for permission to track iOS users across apps and websites. The news, first &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/google-explores-alternative-to-apple-s-new-anti-tracking-feature?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported on Thursday by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, underscores the increasing pressure on large tech companies, many spurred on by Apple, to take more proactive measures to better protect user privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkP3j3"&gt;Google won’t say whether it is indeed working on an anti-tracking privacy measure for Android. But in a statement, a Google spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “We’re always looking for ways to work with developers to raise the bar on privacy while enabling a healthy, ad-supported app...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Smartmatic sues Fox News, Rudy Giuliani, and others over election disinformation campaign</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZMjKjC"&gt;Voting tech company &lt;a href="https://www.smartmatic.com/uploads/Smartmatic_Complaint_Against_Fox_Corporation.pdf"&gt;Smartmatic has sued&lt;/a&gt; Fox News, former Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, and TV host Lou Dobbs for spreading a conspiracy theory about the 2020 US presidential election. The New York state court lawsuit says Fox and others deliberately made Smartmatic the “villain” in a false story about fraudulent voting. Since then, it says, employees have received death threats, and clients have balked at the company’s tarnished reputation. It’s demanding $2.7 billion in damages and a full retraction of all false statements.&lt;/p&gt;
