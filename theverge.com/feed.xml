    <title>A very sus chicken nugget shaped like an Among Us crewmate sells for $99,997 on eBay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3aSSXd7jAizhVH_IYno9waPdUP4=/0x160:1200x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404693/s_l1600.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d still eat it.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/304012821839?_trksid=p2471758.m4704" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UI0t59"&gt;After an intense, dayslong bidding war, a single McDonald’s chicken nugget shaped like one of the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; crewmates has just sold for an eye-watering $99,997&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F304012821839%3F_trksid%3Dp2471758.m4703&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F6%2F4%2F22504587%2Famong-us-mcdonalds-chicken-nugget-ebay-auction-bts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on eBay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpPCcV"&gt;The little nugget started off from humble beginnings, listed for a respectable 99 cents on May 28th. (I’d pay that much for it. Maybe even $5.) And for a little while, there were no bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cumi2C"&gt;But then, two days after it was first listed, somebody placed an (at the time) astonishingly high $14,869.69 first bid on the nugget, and things just escalated from there. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fbfl%2Fviewbids%2F304012821839%3Fitem%3D304012821839%26rt%3Dnc%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.l2565&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F6%2F4%2F22504587%2Famong-us-mcdonalds-chicken-nugget-ebay-auction-bts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;I recommend scrolling through the bid history, it’s wild&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A7d4Js"&gt;One factor that may have driven up the price is that the nugget apparently came from &lt;a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/bts-meal.html"&gt;a BTS...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taito announces mini arcade cabinet with rotating screen and trackball controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDH2eMvkcCQXwbrp_ZCGWmtQgNo=/1x0:1000x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404638/taito1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zBZ6Hi"&gt;Taito is the latest Japanese video game publisher to resurrect old hardware in mini form. The company behind &lt;em&gt;Space Invaders&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bubble Bobble&lt;/em&gt;, and many more arcade classics has just announced the &lt;a href="https://taito.co.jp/egret2mini"&gt;Egret II Mini&lt;/a&gt;, which like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22347909/astro-city-mini-review-sega-arcade-cabinet-us-release-price-games"&gt;Sega’s excellent Astro City Mini&lt;/a&gt; is a shrunken-down version of a popular arcade cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3A3OIp"&gt;The original Egret II was released in the ‘90s, and its key feature was the ability to rotate its screen 90 degrees so that games with tall aspect ratios — like &lt;em&gt;Space Invaders&lt;/em&gt; and other shooters — could be played in &lt;em&gt;tate&lt;/em&gt; (vertical) mode. Appropriately enough, that feature is present on the Egret II Mini, which has a 5-inch 4:3 LCD that can be played in either orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OHAVB6"&gt;The Egret II Mini’s primary controls include six...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next iPad Pro has wireless charging and a glass back: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2021 11-inch iPad Pro. This review has focused a lot on the 12.9, but other than the screen and size the 11-inch is the same." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xD1MZdg_0RBL6JtRDapYh_oyZsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404453/vpavic_210512_4592_0203.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sYmdkN"&gt;Apple is working on a new version of the iPad Pro with wireless charging, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/apple-working-on-ipad-pro-with-wireless-charging-new-ipad-mini"&gt;new report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. To accommodate the technology, Apple will reportedly switch to a glass back for the new models, instead of the aluminum found on the rear of every iPad released so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nmfVk"&gt;Apple is said to be testing a magnetic charging system for the new iPad Pro similar to the MagSafe connector introduced with the iPhone 12 range of phones last year. Apple may also include reverse wireless charging in the new iPad Pro, according to the report, which would allow the iPad to serve as a wireless charging point itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Climate tech is about to fly commercial</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HlVmHmfQJ0b5DKC-A4UxCxIBcio=/0x0:689x459/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69403168/paolo_wilczak_groton_ct_04252020_compressed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hiring private contractors to sample greenhouse gases from the air is an important aspect of NOAA’s climate research. Here, Paolo Wilczak pilots a sampling flight over southeastern Connecticut on April 25, 2020, as part of the East Coast Outflow field mission. The Global Monitoring Laboratory hopes to add civilian airliners to its sampling fleet.&amp;nbsp; | Paolo Wilczak, Scientific Aviation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7IXYA"&gt;A greenhouse gas-tracking technology is about to go commercial. Greenhouse gas detectors will soon take flight on an Alaska Airlines-run Boeing 737-9, in an effort to help federal scientists get even more information about how we’re changing the climate. The tools would measure concentrations of planet-heating pollution in the air, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwQyHa"&gt;They’re calling the plane, which won’t have any passengers, an “&lt;a href="http://www.boeing.com/principles/environment/ecodemonstrator"&gt;ecoDemonstrator&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s testing a number of contraptions along with the greenhouse-gas detector — including features that might make the plane more fuel-efficient or less noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bR1OzA"&gt;Over several test flights this year, NOAA will figure out the best place to install their...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google confirms diversity exec no longer in role after problematic post</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="laUksJ"&gt;One of Google’s top executives in diversity strategy and research has left his post after a 2007 blog post slamming the state of Israel resurfaced on June 1st. In the post, Kamau Bobb used antisemitic language, insinuating Jews have an “insatiable appetite for war and killing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z37YRi"&gt;The post was quickly picked up by the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt;. “While Google has been a vocal supporter of diversity initiatives... it has not commented on the recent spike in anti-Semitic hate crimes,” &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/google-diversity-head-said-jews-have-insatiable-appetite-for-war/"&gt;read a &lt;em&gt;Washington Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article on the subject&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qvq8H6"&gt;But the controversy likely didn’t start with the right-wing press. It seems to have initiated internally, with an email from a member of Google’s Jewish employee resource group. On June...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook to end special treatment for politicians after Trump ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SY6tpr"&gt;Facebook plans to end its controversial policy that mostly shields politicians from the content moderation rules that apply to other users, a sharp reversal that could have global ramifications for how elected officials use the social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1TpWJ"&gt;The change, which Facebook is set to announce as soon as Friday, comes after the Oversight Board — an independent group funded by Facebook to review its thorniest content rulings — affirmed its decision to suspend former President Donald Trump but critiqued the special treatment it gives politicians, stating that the “same rules should apply to all users.” The board gave Facebook till June 5th to respond to its policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is updating AirTags to make them less creepy</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="A bunch of AirTags" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0QOSWYvghxFn8weHchD7bXIkdAs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69401765/vpavic_4547_20210421_0131.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oQ4Ki1"&gt;Apple is distributing an AirTags software update that makes it harder for people to use them for surreptitious tracking, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-bolsters-airtag-privacy-measures-to-offer-android-detector-app-later-this-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. According to a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Apple is also working on an app for Android users which will let them detect potentially unwanted trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoHH1q"&gt;AirTags were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as Apple’s solution for helping people keep track of everyday objects. In its marketing, Apple shows people finding their lost keys or bags that have the trackers attached. However, there have been concerns the tiny devices are being used to secretly track people without their knowledge, and we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airtags-review/"&gt;numerous reports&lt;/a&gt; since the AirTags’ release indicating that some tweaks were needed to make the devices more...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MCTXS2"&gt;President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/03/executive-order-on-addressing-the-threat-from-securities-investments-that-finance-certain-companies-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; Thursday expanding a Trump-era ban on Americans investing in Chinese companies with purported ties to China’s military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuZtJK"&gt;The order increases the number of restricted Chinese companies from 48 to 59. It also rewrites &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2020/11/12/trump-bans-americans-from-investing-in-companies-that-support-chinas-military/"&gt;a previous order issued&lt;/a&gt; by former President Donald Trump to include companies that create and deploy surveillance technology, like the technology used against Muslim minorities and dissidents in Hong Kong. The move signals that Biden plans to continue some of the same China-related policies previously put in place by the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTLXar"&gt;The order does not include DJI, WeChat, TikTok, or its parent company ByteDance among the 59 companies, despite previous concerns about...&lt;/p&gt;
