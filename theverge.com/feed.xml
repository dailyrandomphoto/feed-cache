    <title>Go read this look at how Clubhouse’s blocking system is problematic</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="lRKsUn"&gt;Anyone who’s spent more than five minutes on social media can tell you that most platforms have plenty of trolls, reply-guys and other people who may just be unpleasant to interact with. On big platforms like Twitter, Faecbook, and Instagram, the option to block another user allows you to keep someone out of your feed. Blocking is far from a perfect solution, but at least it gives users a way to continue to use the platforms and avoid (some) nasty interactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsBh1h"&gt;But as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/05/clubhouse-has-blocking-problem/618867/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;Will Oremus writes for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the year-old audio chat platform Clubhouse has a different mechanism for blocking, one that affects more than just the blocker and the blockee (I know, but what would you call it?): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ugrqj0"&gt;When you block someone on Clubhouse, it doesn’t just...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Colonial Pipeline says operations back to normal following ransomware attack</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CeagMe"&gt;Colonial Pipeline said Saturday that all of its systems are back to operating normally, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;pipeline it shut down a week ago&lt;/a&gt; amid a ransomware attack. The pipeline is now servicing all its markets including Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Washington, DC, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, the company tweeted. Colonial carries 45 percent of the fuel supplies for the eastern United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YprrWR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As we previously reported, Colonial Pipeline initiated the restart of pipeline operations at approximately 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, May 12. Since that time, we have returned the system to normal operations, delivering millions of gallons per hour to the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is reportedly continuing a ban on anti-coup groups in Myanmar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWuyZsTB73Jql1G3uPp3vwWD6rA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292441/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3amtd"&gt;Facebook has reportedly upheld a ban on many organizations in Myanmar that have joined forces to resist the military coup that occurred back in February, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/facebook-is-still-censoring-groups-fighting-the-military-coup-in-myanmar/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The bans were put in place back in 2019, when organizations like the Arakan Army, and many of its allies, were classified as terrorist organizations by the democratically-elected government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IE5Jnd"&gt;Things have changed in Myanmar since then. After the military coup and government takeover by the Tatmadaw (carried out after an election which &lt;a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/election-fraud-01282021184631.html"&gt;the military claims was fraudulent&lt;/a&gt;), the political situation has become extremely complex. There is, however, one thing that is seemingly clear: the Arakan Army is no longer classified as a terrorist organization, either by the &lt;a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-military-regime-removes-arakan-army-list-terrorist-groups.html"&gt;c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter may be working on Twitter Blue, a subscription service that would cost $2.99 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DrXZxW9zkRnSgMqroLciklrDtY4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292410/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IV4i7C"&gt;Twitter has previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349644/twitter-subscription-service-survey-undo-sent-analytics-feature-ideas"&gt;confirmed that it’s exploring&lt;/a&gt; a paid subscription model for some features, and app researcher Jane Manchun Wong tweeted Saturday that she’s discovered how much it will cost and what it will be called. Twitter Blue, Wong says, will cost $2.99 per month, and will include an Undo Tweets feature and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393287285156859911?s=20"&gt;bookmark collections&lt;/a&gt;. Wong says it appears Twitter is working on a tiered subscription model, which she posits could mean a less-cluttered, premium experience for the highest-paying subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zgZgW2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is calling their upcoming Subscription Service “Twitter Blue”, priced at $2.99/month for now, including paid features like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Undo Tweets: &lt;a href="https://t.co/CrqnzIPcOH"&gt;https://t.co/CrqnzIPcOH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Collections: &lt;a href="https://t.co/qfFfAXHp1o"&gt;https://t.co/qfFfAXHp1o&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/yyMStpCkpr"&gt;p...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ONt52x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22421637/infrastructure-week-broadband-hospitals-biden-plan-ev-charging"&gt;Infrastructure Week&lt;/a&gt; focused partly on how dire the broadband problem currently is for Americans. On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;we showed you a map&lt;/a&gt; of the worst counties for broadband in the US — and on Friday, we closed the week by showing how satellite services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt; aren’t enough to close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VeSTgq"&gt;But even for the people who do have high-speed internet access, many of them have done desperate things to secure access to it. Our team resides all around the US, and they’ve shared some personal tales below about their experiences getting (or failing to get) high-speed internet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden revokes Trump executive order that targeted Section 230</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BV2gd3"&gt;President Biden on Friday &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/14/executive-order-on-the-revocation-of-certain-presidential-actions-and-technical-amendment/"&gt;revoked several of former President Trump’s executive orders&lt;/a&gt;, including one that would have changed legal protections for social media sites and other online platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMLIC8"&gt;Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act limits how much online platforms can be held liable for content users share on their platforms. The Trump order, titled “preventing online censorship,” would have allowed federal authorities to hold companies like Twitter, Google, and Facebook responsible if they were found to be infringing on users’ speech by deleting or otherwise modifying users’ posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gB5SPn"&gt;Trump signed the order last May, just as Twitter started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;applying labels to his tweets as “misleading.”&lt;/a&gt; Trump was eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As shots became available, parents &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-rush-to-get-covid-19-vaccines-for-their-children-11620984600"&gt;rushed to get their kids the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. But the decision has also contributed to ongoing discussions about how to best distribute vaccines around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUrG8H"&gt;In Santa Barbara, one 14-year-old got a &lt;a href="https://newspress.com/vaccines-for-teens/"&gt;vaccine for his birthday&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RxHIoa"&gt;Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket failed to reach orbit after suffering an unexpected engine shutdown mid-flight on Saturday, losing the mission’s payload of two satellites, the company said. The launch from New Zealand was Electron’s 20th, and marked the company’s second mission failure in less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aATXd1"&gt;Electron, a roughly six-story tall rocket with two booster stages, lifted off from Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand at 7:11AM ET on Saturday, aiming to send a pair of Earth observation satellites for BlackSky into orbit. Two and a half minutes into flight, the rocket’s second stage booster successfully separated from its first stage and ignited for a few seconds before shutting down, indicating a problem...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Twitter policy that could temporarily censor every single one of your tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l-C9MND0vH5SM4VNjNpiHNWe6xs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69291957/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ay94xs"&gt;On Tuesday, a noted Palestinian-American journalist reporting live from protests near Jerusalem was suddenly and mysteriously silenced on Twitter — with every single tweet replaced by the message “@MariamBarghouti’s account is temporarily unavailable because it violates the Twitter Media Policy.” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8b4x/twitter-said-it-restricted-palestinian-writers-account-by-accident"&gt;It was a mistake&lt;/a&gt;, the company quickly admitted, and her tweets were quickly restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMMZwe"&gt;But it turns out that one part of the incident was &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a mistake. While Twitter may have taken action on this person’s account in error, there actually is one particular situation where Twitter reserves the right to make your tweets disappear. And — if you ask me — it’s super, super dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iOKPG7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
