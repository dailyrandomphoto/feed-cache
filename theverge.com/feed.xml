    <title>A year later, Apple’s MagSafe continues to underwhelm </title>

  &lt;p id="QxPh0J"&gt;One year ago yesterday, I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21515490/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-accessories-ecosystem"&gt;how MagSafe could be the biggest reason to buy an iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;. I believed it, too. It looked like Apple had cracked the code to effortlessly accessorize the iPhone and even add modular new capabilities. The company showed its pricey new MagSafe cases and wallets seemingly snapping into place, plus faster wireless charging. The future looked bright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzRPOV"&gt;But if you became an early adopter like me, you might have wound up disappointed. As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1449111887388549126"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, two of Apple’s first overpriced MagSafe accessories are already out of date. First, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/15/magsafe-duo-apple-watch-series-7-no-fast-charge/"&gt;we just learned Friday&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s $129 MagSafe Duo Charger can’t fast-charge an Apple Watch Series 7. Second, Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674261/apple-iphone-leather-wallet-magsafe-find-my-tracking"&gt;already replaced the $59 MagSafe...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Treasury says ransomware payouts in 2021 could top entire past decade</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7nJRIU"&gt;The ransomware business is booming this year and could be bringing in billions for some of its top players, according to &lt;a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/ransomware-trends-bank-secrecy-act-data-between-january-2021-and-june-2021"&gt;a report released&lt;/a&gt; by the US Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN (&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/treasury-said-it-tied-5-2-billion-in-btc-transactions-to-ransomware-payments/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The report analyzed the massive growth in ransomware payments in the first half of 2021 by looking at suspicious activity reports from financial institutions and was even able to estimate how much some hacking groups were making by analyzing blockchain transactions linked to their wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BI3REj"&gt;The report found that reports of suspicious ransomware-related transactions totaled around $590 million from January 2021 to June 2021. One of the most shocking numbers in the report is that the top 10 hacking groups have...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve bans blockchain games and NFTs on Steam, Epic will try to make it work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQwrFGXtUrMP0sAp8zX80GVAeBc=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000611/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IVcxLA"&gt;Games that use blockchain technology or let users exchange NFTs or cryptocurrencies won’t be allowed on Steam, according to a rule added to &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding"&gt;Valve’s “What you shouldn’t publish on Steam” list&lt;/a&gt;. The change &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713803680473089"&gt;was pointed out by SpacePirate&lt;/a&gt;, a developer working on an NFT-based game, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713807312801796?s=20"&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt; that the change was because the company doesn’t allow game items that could have real-world value. But Steam could also be avoiding controversy with the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2VLSl"&gt;Steam is one of the most well-known PC game stores, but it’s not the only one. While Epic’s CEO Tim Sweeney has said that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696978/epic-tim-sweeney-nft-scam-concerns-web-3"&gt;isn’t interested in touching NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, that policy doesn’t seem to apply to games in its store: &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22493091"&gt;Epic told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “open” to the idea of games that use NFTs or...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic says it’s ‘open’ to blockchain games after Steam bans them</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i37MNz"&gt;Epic tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s “open to games that support cryptocurrency or blockchain-based assets” on its game store, unlike its competitor Valve which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust"&gt;has banned games that feature blockchain technology or NFTs from Steam&lt;/a&gt;. When we asked about allowing games that featured NFTs, Epic told us there’d be some limitations, but that it’s willing to work with “early developers” in the “new field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wydB5N"&gt;Epic says that the games would have to comply with financial laws, make it clear how the blockchain is used, and have appropriate age ratings. It also says that developers won’t be able to use Epic’s payment service to accept crypto; they would have to use their own payment systems instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZUyCOD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic will clarify its rules in the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>McDonald’s is testing the McPlant, a Beyond Meat meatless burger</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by McDonald’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mG8wnh"&gt;McDonald’s new plant-based burger, aptly named the McPlant, is coming to eight restaurants across the US (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/mcdonalds-to-test-mcplant-which-includes-its-own-meat-free-burger-next-year-beyond-meat-shares-fall.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The fast-food chain teamed up with Beyond Meat to make the meatless option. This comes about a year after McDonald’s ended its P.L.T. pilot, another Beyond Meat branded burger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9VN7a"&gt;It’s still unclear what the differences are between the McPlant and the P.L.T., other than the name. A &lt;a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/ourstories.mcplant-usrestaurant.html"&gt;post on McDonald’s website&lt;/a&gt; says that the McPlant patty will contain peas, rice, and potatoes and will also be topped with tomatoes, lettuce, onions, pickles, mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and American cheese. That sounds a lot like the P.L.T., but we won’t really know until the start of its test on November 3rd. It’s also important to note that the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Human rights activist suing Twitter for allegedly giving Saudi spies access to his info</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qMSOOT"&gt;A Saudi human rights activist has filed a lawsuit against Twitter, alleging that the company hired two people who spied on behalf of the government of Saudi Arabia and accessed his personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xBjAG"&gt;Ali Al-Ahmed, head of the human rights advocacy organization Institute for Gulf Affairs, has frequently been critical of the Saudi government. Twitter, Al-Ahmed claims, did not have the right to disclose or share his private information under its own privacy policy and should have done more to protect his information. He names two men in the suit &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22930394/indictment.pdf"&gt;who were indicted last year&lt;/a&gt; (.pdf) by federal prosecutors for working as agents of the Saudi government while working for Twitter several years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moscow adds facial recognition payment system to more than 240 metro stations</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l9dT0o"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mosmetro.ru/news/detail/?news=802"&gt;Moscow launched “Face Pay” on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, a facial recognition payment system implemented in more than 240 Mosmetro stations, “the largest use of facial recognition technology in the world,” officials claim (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/15/privacy-fears-moscow-metro-rolls-out-facial-recognition-pay-system"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The service relies on stored photographs to validate metro payments, an obvious privacy concern given the previous uses of facial recognition technology by the Russian capital’s law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCs3tj"&gt;Face Pay requires metro riders to upload a photo and connect their bank and metro cards to the Mosmetro mobile app. With everything uploaded, all you need to do is look at the camera posted above the turnstiles to make it in time for your next train. Moscow authorities expect 10 to 15 percent of riders to use Face Pay...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Busta Rhymes has questions about NFTs, and he has NFTs for sale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nas Performs At City Harvest Benefit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3iavKzjhlkOPfPnEsM_mqI6sY_w=/0x0:2592x1728/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70001553/1342270247.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0nBah"&gt;You can’t always take Busta Rhymes &lt;a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1699317/mayan-apocalypse-busta-rhymes/"&gt;literally&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2021/08/24/busta-rhymes-goes-on-anti-mask-rant/"&gt;you shouldn’t take his questions seriously at all&lt;/a&gt;, but a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BustaRhymes/status/1448979255807946755"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from this morning about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; is solidly in line with the disturbing reality of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hz6zAQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;SHOULD I BUY A HOUSE… or.. A LINK TO A PICTURE OF A PIXELATED MONKEY&lt;/p&gt;— Busta Rhymes (@BustaRhymes) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BustaRhymes/status/1448979255807946755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cmvUjv"&gt;I won’t give you, or Busta, any help with your investment or trading decisions. However, understanding that some NFTs are a link to a picture on a server &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726556/signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-nft-whim-change-platform-shit-emoji-fragility"&gt;that could change or disappear&lt;/a&gt; is information worth knowing before you spend your hard-earned cryptocurrency on a digital collectible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bs0KLv"&gt;And yes, Busta Rhymes is talking about crypto and NFTs for the same reason almost anyone else is. Just like every &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725019/fox-maskverse-masked-singer-nft-community-blockchain-collectables"&gt;TV network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;s...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The employee declined to speak to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B41xJf"&gt;“All these white people are going around talking to the press and speaking publicly on Twitter and the only person who gets fired is the Black person who was quiet the entire time,” says a former employee in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That’s absurd, and just further shows that Black trans people are the ones...&lt;/p&gt;

The company reportedly removed the app at the request of government officials, a somewhat surprising move given Islam is a protected religion in the People’s Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;

The app’s removal apparently had nothing to do with its religious content, “according to Apple, our app Quran Majeed has been removed from the China App Store because it includes content that is illegal,” the developer told the BBC.
