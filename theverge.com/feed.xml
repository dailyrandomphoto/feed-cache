    <title>Hurricane Sandy was much worse because of climate change, study finds</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S62loA"&gt;Just a few inches of human-driven sea level rise contributed to Hurricane Sandy’s devastation of the Northeastern US in 2012. Tens of thousands more people were affected, and more than $8 billion in damages incurred during the storm were a result of climate-induced sea level rise, according to a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNzqS8"&gt;That’s about 13 percent of the more than $62.5 billion total in damage that the superstorm created in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Because climate change pushed sea levels higher, floodwaters were able to creep further inland — bringing more destruction with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G4TZQs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Sea level rise raises the launchpad for every single coastal storm.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jL0rHg"&gt;This is the first study to put a dollar sign...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this difficult time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grand Theft Auto V is coming to the PS5 and Xbox Series X in November</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s9lggj"&gt;One of the bestselling games of all time is coming to next-gen consoles at the end of the year. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3981k373a7a9ok/details-on-new-updates-to-g-t-a-online-and-red-dead-online"&gt;Rockstar announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; and its online spinoff will both be launching on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on November 11th; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288378/grand-theft-auto-v-5-gta-ps5-2021-release"&gt;the new version was previously announced at the PS5’s reveal event last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgnvJA"&gt;We don’t yet know what exactly will be changed for the next-gen iterations, but Rockstar says they will be “expanded and enhanced.” It’s also not clear what the upgrade path will look like for current owners of the game. &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, will be available as a standalone title, and Sony previously said that it would be free for all PS5 owners during its first three months of availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEJ28b"&gt;Despite launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/16/4736176/grand-theft-auto-v-review"&gt;in...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deepfake dubs could help translate film and TV without losing an actor’s original performance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1MqwYRLLmJ8lPyasIyKhzumyTE=/59x0:791x488/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304782/flawless_deepfake_dub.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tz78tk"&gt;What exactly is lost in translation when TV shows and films are subbed or dubbed into a new language? It’s a hard question to answer, but for the team at AI startup Flawless, it may be one we don’t have to think about in the future. The company claims it has the solution to this particular language barrier; a technical innovation that could help TV shows and films effortlessly reach new markets around the world: deepfake dubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsUOmP"&gt;We often think of deepfakes as manipulating the entire image of a person or scene, but Flawless’ technology focuses on just a single element: the mouth. Customers feed the company’s software with video from a film or TV show along with dubbed dialogue recorded by humans. Flawless’ machine learning models then...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify will auto-transcribe podcasts over the coming weeks</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify says it plans to generate transcripts for all podcasts on its app.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AhQUZ7"&gt;Spotify announced multiple updates to make its app more accessible across iOS and Android today, including a beta version of a podcast transcription feature. The company says it’ll start auto-transcribing certain exclusive and original shows over the coming weeks as part of a beta rollout. People will be able to read the transcript with or without audio and can tap on text to jump to that point in the audio. The company says the goal is to eventually “enable transcripts across all podcasts on Spotify.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bF71a"&gt;This is an especially helpful feature for people who want to scan and move around a podcast, possibly to hear a specific segment, and for people who would rather read than listen to a show. Spotify is one of the first major podcast apps to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford F-150 Lightning: what to expect from the automaker’s first electric pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pblSoU25aA7G0v03m0kNJujsI4A=/248x0:1193x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304637/2021_f_150_reveal.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OFvMqP"&gt;Ford is set to unveil its next major electric vehicle, the F-150 Lightning, at 9:30PM ET on Wednesday, May 19th. But this isn’t just another EV event. An electric version of the automaker’s iconic F-series pickup truck is a very big deal for Ford, for the auto world, for car buyers, and even for the US economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yKrzT"&gt;Ford is very proud of its F-series trucks, and for good reason. It’s the bestselling truck in the US for 44 years. It’s also the bestselling vehicle in the country, period. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fmost-popular-cars%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F18%2F22441793%2Fford-f150-lightning-announcement-rumors-specs-details" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to Edmunds&lt;/a&gt;, F-series trucks are the most popular vehicle in 30 out of 50 states in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5cNKL"&gt;That means the F-Series trucks create a huge windfall for Ford. The Detroit automaker netted around $42 billion in revenue in 2019 from nearly 900,000...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia is nerfing new RTX 3080 and 3070 cards for Ethereum cryptocurrency mining </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eIq7tp"&gt;Nvidia is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR” identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeYpom"&gt;“This reduced hash rate only applies to newly manufactured cards with the LHR identifier and not to cards already purchased,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/05/18/lhr/"&gt;says Matt Wuebbling&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s head GeForce marketing. “We believe this additional step will get more GeForce cards at better prices into the hands of gamers everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5G6za"&gt;These new RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070, and RTX 3080 cards will start shipping later this...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s redesigned MacBook Pros with next-gen in-house chips could arrive early this summer</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mJ4Nkl"&gt;The performance of Apple’s M1 chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;exceeded our expectations&lt;/a&gt; and made the 2020 MacBook Air the most impressive laptop we’ve used in years (it’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;done wonders for the redesigned iMac&lt;/a&gt;). So it’s not too surprising, as per &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this morning, that Apple is readying a whole slate of Macs using next-gen versions of the company’s in-house chips. The details sound very promising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbwIIR"&gt;The story, from reliable Apple-watcher Mark Gurman, says the company is preparing to unveil redesigned MacBook Pros in 14-inch and 16-inch screen sizes “as early as this summer.” Not only will the machines have a redesigned chassis, but they’ll also bring back the beloved magnetic MagSafe charger (though it’s not clear in what form) and previously excised...&lt;/p&gt;
