    <title>Uber discriminates against people with disabilities, new DOJ lawsuit alleges</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fWObmA"&gt;Uber discriminates against people with disabilities by charging them a “wait time” fee while entering the vehicle, according to a new lawsuit filed by the US Justice Department against the ride-hailing company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xa9oqJ"&gt;These extra fees have “harmed many passengers and potential passengers with disabilities throughout the country,” some of whom may be entitled to monetary damages, the department said. The lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for Northern California, alleges that Uber is in violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits discrimination by private transportation companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZzFsgJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Passengers would incur the fee two minutes after their Uber car arrives at their pickup location&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is making it easier to share your screen in Microsoft Teams and other video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pyOMePO74E8d32_DTdfmVFNsfo=/0x0:1332x888/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123056/Share_any_window_zoomZoom2X.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams share buttons will appear in Windows 11 soon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3GFgBI"&gt;Microsoft is adding a useful new Microsoft Teams integration into Windows 11 soon. The software maker has started testing a feature in Windows 11 that will allow Teams users to hover over open windows on the taskbar and quickly share the window content on a Microsoft Teams call. It will make screen sharing a lot easier for Teams and other communication apps on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dtp59a"&gt;Microsoft is testing this initially with Microsoft Teams for work or school rather than the built-in consumer version of Teams in Windows 11. “This means not everyone will see this right away with their Teams calls,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/10/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22499/"&gt;says Amanda Langowski&lt;/a&gt;, head of Microsoft’s Windows Insider program. “We plan to bring this to Chat from Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Teams for home) later.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash will acquire European delivery company Wolt as it builds a global platform</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1neYDT"&gt;DoorDash has agreed to acquire the food delivery company Wolt for €7 billion (about $8.1 billion) with plans to expand its reach to Europe (via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/doordash-to-acquire-food-delivery-company-wolt/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://wolt.com/en/about"&gt;Founded in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, Wolt is a Finland-based company that contracts out couriers to deliver takeout, groceries, and other goods to customers in 23 countries mainly throughout Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYLmul"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Joins-Forces-with-Wolt/default.aspx"&gt;DoorDash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.wolt.com/hq/2021/11/09/wolt-joins-forces-with-doordash/"&gt;Wolt&lt;/a&gt; announced the all-stock transaction in separate blog posts, confirming a move that will bring DoorDash to Europe for the first time. Currently, DoorDash is only available in cities across the US, Canada, Japan, and Australia. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian goes public in one of the biggest IPOs ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n8k55W2Y7ME6-g842TXKjZEed7c=/0x0:2880x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123010/2022_Rivian_R1T_17.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mFyrrP"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Rivian is now a publicly traded company after executing one of the biggest initial public offerings in history. Rivian shares started trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange Wednesday at around $78 per share. That gave Rivian an overall valuation of nearly $80 billion and helped it net $12 billion in fresh cash, despite the fact that it only just recently started to make and ship its first electric pickup trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEODrf"&gt;It’s the sixth-largest IPO ever on a US stock exchange, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-09/ev-maker-rivian-is-said-to-guide-ipo-price-above-top-of-range?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s hard to imagine the company picking a better time to debut. Tesla has generated an incredible amount of interest in electric vehicles &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;is now one of the most highly valued companies in the world. The public markets...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego is now letting you preorder unofficial sets, including an epic Lego store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-8VvRE_tQGyvDTYWxxnMsztQNQo=/0x50:1200x850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122964/lego_store_bricklink.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zuliKf"&gt;What do a Lego store, a beautiful abandoned windmill, a retro bowling alley, a miniature aquarium, and a pair of Venetian houses have in common? They’ve all just become incredibly limited edition Lego sets &lt;a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/designer-program/introducing.page"&gt;that you can preorder from the Lego company itself&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSeXpV"&gt;They started out as candidates for Lego’s Ideas program, got rejected, and now, they’ve been crowdfunded back to life by fans like you through a separate competition &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/blogs/a4ae09b6-0d4c-4307-9da8-3ee9f3d368d6/post/7e027d01-6ec9-473c-b6b0-db8f92bbe5af"&gt;called the BrickLink Designer Program&lt;/a&gt; that gives creators 10 percent of the proceeds for their work. That means you have a short window of opportunity to snap up these unofficial official sets for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0u2kXr"&gt;And if you’ll allow me to indulge myself, they are &lt;em&gt;glorious&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvaIKm"&gt;Atop this post, you’ll spot the &lt;a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/designer-program/designer-sets-for-adult-fans-of-lego/215728/Modular-LEGO-Store"&gt;$179.99 Modular Lego...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s profit on ads, subscriptions, and data is double the money it makes selling TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vizio" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sJGP6DZ4xn65FZHlU9OznBD6950=/0x0:1217x811/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122952/vizio_voice.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mf6LSd"&gt;It’s been less than a year since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308068/vizio-ipo-filing-smartcast-inscape-tvs-soundbars-vzio"&gt;Vizio became a publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt;, and one consequence of that is we know more about its business than ever before. The TV maker &lt;a href="https://investors.vizio.com/news/news-details/2021/VIZIO-HOLDING-CORP.-Reports-Q3-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx"&gt;released its latest earnings report on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; and revealed that over the last three months, its Platform Plus segment that includes advertising and viewer data had a gross profit of $57.3 million. That’s more than twice the amount of profit it made selling devices like TVs, which was $25.6 million, despite those device sales pulling in considerably more revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z48v5t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most of Vizio’s profit came from advertising&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YFtA3l"&gt;When Vizio filed to go public, it described the difference between the two divisions. While Devices is easy to understand — 4K TVs, soundbars, etc. — Platform Plus is a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2020 was the worst year yet for power outages in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9TszQV"&gt;2020 was a record-breaking year for power outages in the United States, according to an Energy Information Administration (EIA) &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=50316"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; published today. Extreme weather is leaving Americans in the dark for longer than it has in the past, a problem that is bound to get worse as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;climate change fuels even more violent weather.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2tJ1L"&gt;On average, a person in the US went over eight hours without electricity in 2020. That’s more than twice as long the average American went without power in 2013, the year that the EIA started keeping track. Across the US, outage times varied considerably. Residents of Louisiana, the state with the longest outages, went a full 60 hours, on average, without electricity last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yiojJN"&gt;Twitter is building a new division for “all things blockchain at Twitter,” called Twitter Crypto, and has hired Tess Rinearson as the team’s engineering lead to “set the strategy for the future of crypto at (and on) Twitter,” the company said in a release Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9uhGP"&gt;“First, we’ll be exploring how we can support the growing interest among creators to use decentralized apps to manage virtual goods and currencies, and to support their work and communities,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_tessr/status/1458466734327963648"&gt;Rinearson said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “Looking farther ahead, we’ll be exploring how ideas from crypto communities can help us push the boundaries of what’s possible with identity, community, ownership and more.” She added that her team would be working closely with Bluesky, an independent...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube gives dislikes the thumbs-down, hides public counts</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S3u7bx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/"&gt;YouTube has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be hiding public dislike counts on videos across its site, starting today. The company says the change is to keep smaller creators from being targeted by dislike attacks or harassment, and to promote “respectful interactions between viewers and creators.” The dislike button will still be there, but it’ll be for private feedback, rather than public shaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSpOFu"&gt;This move isn’t out of the blue. In March, YouTube announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358992/youtube-hiding-dislikes-experiment-creator-review-bomb"&gt;experimenting with hiding the public dislike numbers&lt;/a&gt;, and individual creators have long had &lt;a href="https://www.the1janitor.com/blog/2018/11/30/why-i-disable-ratings-on-my-youtube-videos"&gt;the ability to hide ratings on their videos&lt;/a&gt;. But the fact that the dislike counts will be disappearing for everyone (gradually, according to YouTube) is a big deal — viewers are used to...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B9Q8Hz"&gt;Juiced, the San Diego-based electric bike company known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22537406/juiced-hyperscrambler-2-ebike-moped-price-specs"&gt;extremely fast, extremely heavy, moped-style cruisers&lt;/a&gt;, wants you to know that its newest model, the RipRacer, is “fun-sized.” Not like tiny-Snickers-bars-you-hand-out-at-Halloween-fun-size, but like a smaller frame size for a younger generation of riders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5Osw6"&gt;Electric bikes are typically marketed and sold to adults, but increasingly, companies are seeing an opportunity around selling bikes to teens and young adults. Juiced is the latest to try its hand at making bikes that are smaller and cheaper than the typical e-bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pp28PS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The RipRacer may be fun-sized, but it will no less powerful than Juiced’s other hulking models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XjMOkW"&gt;The RipRacer may be fun-sized, but it will no less powerful...&lt;/p&gt;
