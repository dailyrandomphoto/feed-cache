    <title>The first trailer for Last Night in Soho shows a neon-filled time-traveling ghost story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/InhHiG_0GU_g1XL097cteNp4FrY=/159x0:3312x2102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340273/Screen_Shot_2021_05_25_at_9.53.10_AM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9twlIf"&gt;Being a young person in the city is hard enough without being haunted by a cabaret singer from the 1960s, but that’s exactly what Thomasin McKenzie (&lt;em&gt;Jojo Rabbit)&lt;/em&gt; appears to be dealing with in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/edgarwright/status/1397205817879928835?s=20"&gt;the first trailer for Edgar Wright’s &lt;em&gt;Last Night in Soho&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The film is set to premiere in theaters in October, but the trailer seems like a nice taste of Wright’s clever style through a horror lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKw9HQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Night in Soho &lt;/em&gt;follows McKenzie as Eloise, a young fashion fan who seemingly has the ability to dream herself into the past. The problem is she isn’t herself when she visits London’s West End in the 1960s; she’s Anya Taylor-Joy’s Sandy, a singer who, if the trailer is anything to go by, probably shouldn’t be dating whoever Matt Smith is playing...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now buy Asus’ gaming-ready ROG Phone 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k21J-gQWk1woZxBGM5nLi9PVksc=/0x0:1875x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340185/Screen_Shot_2021_05_25_at_9.54.34_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3x5FZD"&gt;Asus’ ROG Phone 5 is now available in the US &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM210000001/ROG5-ASUS-ROG-Phone-5---6.78%E2%80%9D-FHD%2B-2448x1080-HDR-144Hz-Display---6000mAh-Dual-Cell-Battery---64MP%2F13MP%2F5MP-Triple-Camera-with-24MP-Front-Camera-%E2%80%9316GB-RAM---256GB-Storage-5G-LTE-Unlocked-Dual-SIM-Cell-Phone"&gt;from its official store&lt;/a&gt;, with a price tag of $999.99. It’s Asus’ latest maxed-out gaming phone, with all of the top-notch specifications: a Snapdragon 888 Plus, 144Hz display, front-facing speakers, and a massive 6,000mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpw3uf"&gt;Asus says the Ultimate and Pro versions of the phone will be available later this year. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;reviewed the Ultimate in March&lt;/a&gt; and found that it was a good phone that went a little — okay, maybe a lot — overboard with its specs. The vanilla version available for sale today, though, is perhaps a bit more reasonable: it “only” has 16GB of RAM (as opposed to the Ultimate’s 18GB), has half the storage (256GB instead of 512GB), and features an RGB logo on the back instead of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft teases a ‘next generation of Windows’ announcement ‘very soon’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g9eIsg"&gt;Microsoft isn’t talking about its big Windows plans at Build 2021 this week, and that’s because the company is preparing to detail what’s next for its PC operating system separately. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella teased this announcement during his Build keynote this morning, revealing he has been testing “the next generation of Windows” in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qeVKgM"&gt;“Soon we will share one of the most significant updates to Windows of the past decade to unlock greater economic opportunity for developers and creators. I’ve been self-hosting it over the past several months, and I’m incredibly excited about the next generation of Windows. Our promise to you is this: we will create more opportunity for every Windows developer today and welcome every...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>The founder of lidar maker Velodyne is going to war with his own SPAC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ford-Velodyne-CES-2016-verge-03" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/czbsq0mjct2Fe_jFJd6fL-jzFDk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340093/Ford-Velodyne-CES-2016-verge-03.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PdXyz3"&gt;David Hall, the founder of leading lidar manufacturer Velodyne, is going to war with the SPAC that acquired his company. In a letter, Hall is calling for the resignation of two of the company’s SPAC-appointed board directors, whom he blames for Velodyne’s “poor financial performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yULce"&gt;It’s the latest twist in the increasingly dramatic saga of Velodyne, a top maker of the laser sensors that are viewed as crucial for the operation of autonomous vehicles. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295550/velodyne-founder-lidar-david-hall-marta-investigation-board"&gt;Hall was ousted as chair of the company’s board, and his wife, Marta Thoma Hall, was removed as its chief marketing officer&lt;/a&gt;. The board cited an investigation into “inappropriate behavior” by both Halls in its justification for their removal. Marta Hall remains a member of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DC attorney general launches antitrust suit against Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WD6gpt7OasrSMiaP-O3Bq_6_rOE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339766/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="axTcj2"&gt;On Tuesday, DC Attorney General Karl Racine &lt;a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/Amazon-Complaint-.pdf"&gt;sued Amazon on antitrust grounds&lt;/a&gt;, accusing the e-commerce giant of suppressing competition by placing strict conditions on what third-party sellers can do outside of the company’s platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2bctC"&gt;“Amazon’s policies have prevented competing platforms, including sellers’ own websites, from competing on price and gaining market share,” Racine said in a press call. “The loss of competition results in less innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3mjG7"&gt;Filed in DC Superior Court, the lawsuit alleges that Amazon unlawfully maintains its monopoly power by preventing independent sellers from offering products at lower prices on other platforms. It also claims that these “most favored nation” agreements harm consumers by inflating prices and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos updates the One SL to make it more power efficient and recyclable</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t4BEJY"&gt;Sonos is refreshing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20849821/sonos-one-sl-port-price-specs-features-announcement"&gt;One SL speaker&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn’t have always-on microphones or integrated voice controls, to make it more power efficient and recyclable, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. However, the new model won’t have any additional features or functionality. The updated speaker first appeared in &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/SBVRM038"&gt;FCC filings published Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnFlfH"&gt;The primary change in this new One SL is a “more efficient” wireless radio, according to Sonos. The base of the speaker has also been redesigned to remove extra plastics and “stickering,” and the product packaging has a “more sustainable design” like what’s used with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368487/sonos-roam-bluetooth-speaker-review-features"&gt;recently released Sonos Roam&lt;/a&gt;. And while there won’t be any new functionality, Sonos says that this updated One SL will only work with...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="o5Ek5G"&gt;Music streaming service Tidal is now available &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2FAppleWatch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453031%2Ftidal-apple-watch-offline-listening-spotify-deezer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, allowing subscribers to stream music directly to Apple’s wearable or download it for offline listening. Instructions on how to get set up can be found on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2FAppleWatch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453031%2Ftidal-apple-watch-offline-listening-spotify-deezer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tidal’s site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447222/spotify-adding-feature-music-downloads-offline-apple-watch"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443522/deezer-apple-watch-offline-listening"&gt;Deezer&lt;/a&gt; both announced similar offline listening features for the Apple Watch last week. Subscription prices for Tidal start at $9.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpKOR7"&gt;Tidal has historically sold itself on the quality of its audio streaming, offering features like lossless playback and even hi-res streaming before many of its bigger rivals. But this year, some of its biggest competitors are starting to catch up. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;Spotify’s lossless HiFi tier&lt;/a&gt; is set to launch later this year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;Apple Music will introduce support&lt;/a&gt; for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sling TV announces completely redesigned app, and it looks way nicer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c2fl8sQAly3jMLGV5BMcEh7wBcM=/63x0:737x449/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339536/SlingApp2.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DjxL6H"&gt;Compared to competitors like YouTube TV and Hulu, Sling TV has never had the flashiest app, and the overall user experience leaves something to be desired. It’s been easy enough to overlook these faults since Sling TV undercuts those rivals on price, but today the company &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sling.com/pm/newapp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced a completely redesigned app&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on more polish and personalized recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBcfV6"&gt;The new Sling TV app is rolling out first to “select customers” using Amazon’s Fire TV devices, and other platforms will be added as the year stretches on. (It’ll arrive on Roku sometime this summer, for example.) The Dish-owned company describes this as the “most comprehensive update in Sling TV’s history.” And based on screenshots and the GIF above, it does look like a...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NdLR3A"&gt;The GH6 will feature a new image engine along with the sensor and will have the capability to record 10-bit 4K at 120fps and 10-bit 5.7K at 60fps. The camera also promises DCI 4K60 at 4:2:2 without a recording time limit. The GH6 is currently in development, so Panasonic didn’t provide many more details, but it did say that the camera would feature a Micro Four Thirds...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft has built an AI-powered autocomplete for code using GPT-3</title>

  &lt;p id="B5jsjU"&gt;In September 2020, Microsoft purchased an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451283/microsoft-openai-gpt-3-exclusive-license-ai-language-research"&gt;exclusive license&lt;/a&gt; to the underlying technology behind GPT-3, an AI language tool built by OpenAI. Now, the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant has announced its first commercial use case for the program: an assistive feature in the company’s PowerApps software that turns natural language into readymade code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gICEYz"&gt;The feature is limited in its scope and can only produce formulas in &lt;a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-microsoft-power-fx-the-low-code-programming-language-for-everyone/"&gt;Microsoft Power Fx&lt;/a&gt;, a simple programming language derived from Microsoft Excel formulas that’s used mainly for database queries. But it shows the huge potential for machine learning to help novice programmers by functioning as an autocomplete tool for code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="om6Q70"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Why don’t we ... speak the language of a normal human?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
