    <title>Gumroad announces cheaper pricing for creators</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8kFL0z"&gt;Gumroad is announcing &lt;a href="https://gumroad.com/pricing"&gt;a new pricing structure today&lt;/a&gt; that streamlines the fees and features of its platform, making it easier for creators to get started selling products or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21572698/gumroad-patreon-like-memberships-support-creators"&gt;memberships online&lt;/a&gt;. Gumroad was one of the early “help people sell things online” businesses, but this change is a sort of reset for the company as the space grows even more crowded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3UBLN"&gt;The first major change is an end to Gumroad’s free and paid “Pro” tiers. Previously, Gumroad locked features like using a custom domain name or offering HD video streams behind a $10 per month subscription. That caused some confusion from users just starting out — did it make sense to commit to paying upfront? Now everyone receives the same features without having to pay extra or worry...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil announces new smartwatches for 2021 that won’t have Wear OS 3 until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fossil Gen 6 watches" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ih9HkKecpnYWoYLZHbZ1Yw1kwfc=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792561/FSL4013827_FA21_AD_09_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fossil Gen 6 watches | Fossil&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4kSfGK"&gt;Fossil has announced its fall 2021 smartwatch lineup running Wear OS, which it is calling the Gen 6 Touchscreen. As with the Gen 5 Fossil watches, the Gen 6 will come in a few different styles and sizes and there will also be versions sold under the Michael Kors brand. Prices will start at $299 and they’ll be available for preorder immediately. It does not appear that Fossil will offer LTE options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BzDRh"&gt;Unfortunately, these watches will be shipping with the current Wear OS 2 software and not the new Wear OS 3 that runs on t&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;he latest Samsung Galaxy Watches&lt;/a&gt;. Fossil says that it’s going to offer upgrades to Wear OS 3 for Gen 6 watches in 2022, though exactly &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; in 2022 is a trickier question. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;Google has said&lt;/a&gt; that Wear OS 2 watches wouldn’t...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kids in China now restricted to just 3 hours of online gaming per week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tencent To Limit Daily Playtime Of Online Game" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/urUKRugx-18Z2CzXsv0HCnc_MaU=/0x0:4320x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792285/805984782.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A4LTwD"&gt;Chinese gaming platforms like Tencent and NetEase must limit online gaming to minors to just three hours per week following new rules imposed by regulators on Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/china-limits-minors-to-just-three-hours-of-online-gaming-a-week?sref=D9adxNGw"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; citing state media reports&lt;/a&gt;. The change is being made in response to growing concern over gaming addiction and a broader crackdown on China’s tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECbtmw"&gt;Children under the age of 18 will now be restricted to one hour of gaming from 8pm to 9pm on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday; and on public holidays. That’s a change from the previous limit of 1.5 hours of online gameplay on most days. Gaming companies must restrict online game play outside those hours, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-rolls-out-new-rules-minors-online-gaming-xinhua-2021-08-30/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and must have a real name verification system in place to ensure the new rules...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first Neon Genesis Evangelion Blu-rays you can actually buy ship November 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DNCg8bQJHd4PNxBDDCRgmc42Bc=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792184/eva_blu_ray_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kTk12m"&gt;You might have heard that &lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;, the seminal 1995 anime series seemingly about giant mech battles but &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; deeper and more disturbing than that,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is coming to Blu-ray for the very first time in the US, UK, and beyond. What you might not have heard: when that news was first announced nearly two weeks ago, it was just for a $275 limited-edition &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22632212/neon-genesis-evangelion-blu-ray-release-date-price-ultimate-editiona"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;’s Ultimate Edition&lt;/a&gt; whose stateside release of just 5,000 copies sold out in the blink of an eye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RP36J4"&gt;Today, GKids is rectifying that with a five-disc Standard Edition that costs just $60 and will actually ship a month earlier than those $275 copies, technically making it the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; first official Blu-ray release in the United States when it arrives November 9th....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse embraces spatial audio for more lifelike conversations</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xjif2O"&gt;Clubhouse began rolling out a iOS app update on Sunday that enables &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/spatial-audio-clubhouse/"&gt;spatial audio support&lt;/a&gt;. The Android update is “coming soon,” according to the company. The feature works by introducing subtle spatial cues that position speakers on Clubhouse calls into three-dimensional space around your head, making the remote listening experience a better approximation of being in a room full of people. It works best with headphones, either Bluetooth or wired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkE178"&gt;Clubhouse tweeted out a video allowing you to hear for yourself how it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BB2ytc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hear ye, hear ye   spAAaAaAatial audio on Clubhouse!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's like surround sound, but w/ your own headphones. A more vibrant, human experience! Plus makes it much easier to tell who's talking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juberti?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@juberti&lt;/a&gt; for this...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoPro’s next flagship action camera leaks</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qrDJpe"&gt;Images and specs of the GoPro Hero 10 Black have apparently leaked in full. &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124840.html"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which accurately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408480/gopro-hero9-leak-render-front-facing-display-full-color"&gt;leaked the redesigned Hero 9 Black&lt;/a&gt; at this same time last year, the new flagship GoPro action camera will look pretty much the same as last year’s miniature cam only with a more powerful GP2 processor of GoPro design inside for improved overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plNikH"&gt;The new GP2 processor is expected to provide a major boost in performance with support for 5.3K videos shot at a smooth 60fps, or 4K video recorded at 120fps which is useful for slo-mo. That’s an improvement from 5K30 and 4K60 on last year’s flagship. The Hero 10 Black can also record at 2.7K and 240fps for even more motion control but at reduced resolution. There’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 7 reportedly has flat sides and bigger screens</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eE2i2p"&gt;The upcoming Apple Watch will feature its first new hardware design in years, according to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman’s &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter. Gurman says the Apple Watch Series 7 will have “a flatter display and edges,” seemingly continuing Apple’s quest to flatten the sides of every product in its lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pmZVT"&gt;The display is said to be slightly larger than the current panels found in the Series 6, and the cases’ sizes will also be a little bigger than before, with each model getting a 1mm bump to 41mm and 45mm. Unverified leaked images last week suggested the same &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1430866547787149315"&gt;41mm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1430698847450189824"&gt;45mm&lt;/a&gt; sizing. Gurman says Apple will include multiple new watch faces to make the most of the extra screen real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgOepv"&gt;Physical appearance aside, the Series 7 will also...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;A satellite image of Hurricane Ida over the Gulf of Mexico. | GOES-East NOAA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MxaNmA"&gt;Hurricane Ida is pummeling Louisiana as an “extremely dangerous” storm after strengthening rapidly over the weekend. The hurricane swirled towards the coast with winds of 150 miles per hour, accompanied by a life-threatening surge of water, forecasters with the National Hurricane Center &lt;a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/291157.shtml?"&gt;warned on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oni6Do"&gt;“This will be one of the strongest hurricanes to hit anywhere in Louisiana since at least the 1850s,” Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/us/ida-forecast.html"&gt;said at a press conference&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday. The storm &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NHC_Atlantic/status/1432024656932794373"&gt;made landfall just before noon&lt;/a&gt; local time, near Port Fourchon, Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zN1Co1"&gt;Ida already had wind speeds of 103 miles per hour on Saturday night. Just six hours later, the storm had strengthened into a major hurricane with wind speeds increasing to 130...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 could have satellite connectivity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S3VPiN8oube9tQWoXUnhGVXMq0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69790682/acastro_190530_1777_wwdc_2019_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Kjyga"&gt;Finally a fun iPhone 13 rumor! If Apple holds to its traditional schedule we’re mere weeks away from a new iPhone, and until now the rumors have been slight and, dare I say boring. Yet noted Apple prognosticator and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is now claiming the iPhone 13 could have the ability to make satellite calls built right in, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/29/iphone-13-to-feature-leo-to-make-calls-and-text/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j35M46"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The X60 would likely be supporting another element of 5G&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ErnFaS"&gt;In a note to investors, Kuo claims that the iPhone 13 will be able to connect directly to low earth orbit (or LEO) satellites thanks to a customized Qualcomm X60 baseband chip. LEO satellites are probably best known as the backbone of Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service which relies on satellites in a lower orbit to beam internet...&lt;/p&gt;
