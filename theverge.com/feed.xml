    <title>There will never be another Pokémon Go</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NSrbkL"&gt;Creating a follow-up to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is an impossible task. The game was the kind of breakout success that had never been seen before — and might never happen again; it’s hard to overstate how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15888210/pokemon-go-one-year-anniversary-timeline"&gt;the game was absolutely &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; when it first launched in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. People were trespassing to catch Squirtles as the game set App Store download records. The wish fulfillment that came from seeing pokémon in the real world created a sensation that, even years after its peak, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;remains one of the biggest games in the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZBrOq"&gt;It was only natural that developer Niantic would try to follow that with something new. But re-creating the lightning in a bottle that is &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t gone quite as planned, despite Niantic snapping up some enviable properties...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s inexpensive Air Quality Monitor plays nice with Alexa</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d885_j148nEww3MILHcT1jPwsUg=/0x0:4342x2895/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085546/Amazon_Smart_Air_Quality_Monitor_Lifestyle_Image_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The air quality monitor (right) can show information on Echo Show devices. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h3EZce"&gt;Amazon’s latest smart home device is the $69.99 Smart Air Quality Monitor, a small puck around half the size of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;latest Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; that’s designed to keep an eye on the quality of the air in your home. It can track your home’s temperature and humidity, and the presence of dust, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc9d5A"&gt;A key selling point of the Smart Air Quality Monitor is its Alexa integration. It lets you ask compatible Alexa-enabled devices for an update on the air quality of the home at any time or view trends via the Alexa app or an Echo Show device. Importantly, the Smart Air Quality Monitor’s temperature sensor can also integrate with Alexa Routines. That allows it to function as a trigger for things like smart...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Indiegogo switches gears to more closely screen crowdfunding campaigns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5mw5soWy9YDKHF8tx9ZQWGva3fw=/0x271:1080x991/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085536/logo_lockup_white.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Indiegogo and GoFundMe have partnered to form the Crowdfunding Trust Alliance | Indiegogo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VYsa4f"&gt;Crowdfunding platform Indiegogo is changing the way it does business, shifting from an open platform where anyone can raise money for just about any purpose to a closed model where every campaign will receive a manual review before it can go live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4J3gCo"&gt;“Candidly, we have not always lived up to our backers’ expectations,” said Will Haines, vice president of product and customer trust at Indiegogo. When the company launched in 2008, there were few restrictions on would-be entrepreneurs seeking to raise money from like-minded backers. But Haines says that “open” isn’t what the crowdfunding community really wants now, more than a decade later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8KnkW"&gt;“Crowdfunding is not shopping — people generally understand that now — but it also shouldn’t be a leap...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GE wants you to trust its smart oven to cook the perfect turkey </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bIFR-w2lDUN7AU9iszeZoLJRnYU=/0x0:4200x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085558/kriech_higdon_photo_9231.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new Turkey Mode coming to GE’s Wi-Fi connected ovens and ranges this week promises to cook the perfect turkey&lt;/em&gt; | IMAGE: Kriech-Higdon Photography&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6SjT25"&gt;The smart kitchen is getting a little more intelligent this holiday season. Appliance manufacturer GE has a new Turkey Mode for its smart ovens that promises to take the prep and guesswork out of roasting that big bird. It arrives on over half a million GE connected ovens and ranges this week via an over-the-air software upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNqBos"&gt;The Kentucky-based GE Appliances gave me a demo of the new tech, and it’s pretty impressive. You put the bird in the roasting tin, pop it in a cold oven, insert the temperature probe built into the oven, push the Turkey Mode button (either on the LCD screen of the oven or in the GE SmartHQ smartphone app), and sit back and relax. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>How to print a document when you don’t own a printer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UcV48yWBrR4u1ubd6QQE_f3BL9Y=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085276/IMG_2913.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;div id="XMQ01a"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jc3f3k"&gt;It can be difficult to figure out what to do when you’re asked to provide a hard copy of a document but don’t have access to a printer at home. While it used to be a safe bet that everyone had a printer at home, that’s no longer the case — but if you don’t have one, odds are that at some point, you’ll come across someone who hasn’t gotten the memo and insists on a hard copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0HN35"&gt;If you’ve found yourself in this situation, you’ve got options. To help, I’ve researched the various methods you can use to get a document from your computer to whoever needs it and have come up with a few tips and considerations for printing without your own printer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0mqi9"&gt;Before I get to that, though, you’ll have to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4UiFG3"&gt;Prepare to print&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="h5BMec"&gt;Presumably, the file you want...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo is bringing its autonomous vehicles to New York City for (manually driven) mapping</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GJk-3T-wNCKNAXPnINz7YHYXutI=/127x0:1474x898/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085218/O0CtGcQE53rLMZODMK_XXR4sEcsD73_ZALIzuuhdA8Rv_XdvjlUgAraW_KzZ0W7he97FRwrbUjdA9K65kh6OqW7IXHNYaPUnz6_Klq2c1c3Wz4GioI7WdAutNZd2d1PsxDgZebJSRQ.5.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8dfA5r"&gt;The latest autonomous vehicle company to tackle the mean streets of New York City will be Waymo. The Google spinoff is bringing a handful of cars to the Big Apple, where they will start mapping the city streets using manually driven vehicles with two people riding inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Qul4g"&gt;Waymo cited New York’s vibrant street life, “unusual road geometries” (which is a nice way of saying utterly confusing), and the likelihood of heavy rain and snow as being among the reasons the company is eager to test there. Presumedly the company is also curious to see how its vehicles will react when down-on-their-luck street hustlers slap their hoods and shout &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z-tCU-sULA"&gt;“I’m walking here!”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ndLN0"&gt;Waymo won’t have more than five vehicles on the street at a time to start out, a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democrats’ infrastructure bills don’t go far enough on cleaning up the power grid</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gnx254"&gt;On a call Tuesday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rallied Democrats to pass two ambitious bills at the heart of President Biden’s agenda, aiming for a final house vote later this week. But the climate provisions of the $1.75 trillion budget reconciliation bill that progressives want to pass alongside a bipartisan infrastructure bill are newly uncertain after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) pushed to further delay the vote during a surprise press conference on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jOOOq"&gt;It’s the latest twist in a long struggle for Congress to pass meaningful legislation in support of the ambitious climate goals President Biden set on entering office. The reconciliation framework released last week puts $555 billion into clean energy, the first major effort to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google News to relaunch in Spain after mandatory payments to newspapers scrapped</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zd85vS"&gt;Who should get paid when big tech platforms aggregate news stories? This was the question that prompted Google to &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/media/google-news-spain/"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; its Google News platform in Spain in 2014, after the country decided the US tech giant should cough up a monthly fee to Spanish papers. Today, though, Google announced that Google News &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/google-news-in-spain"&gt;will return to Spain&lt;/a&gt; “early next year” after the country overhauled its online copyright laws in line with EU regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVcwQg"&gt;The big difference from Google’s point of view is that it no longer has to pay a fee to Spain’s entire media industry and can instead negotiate fees with individual publishers. Some may want to charge Google for sharing stories in Google News, and Google can pay them or exclude them, depending on its preference....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clearview AI ordered to delete all facial recognition data belonging to Australians</title>

  &lt;p id="RBoJJZ"&gt;Controversial facial recognition firm Clearview AI has been ordered to &lt;a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/updates/news-and-media/clearview-ai-breached-australians-privacy"&gt;destroy all images and facial templates&lt;/a&gt; belonging to individuals living in Australia by the country’s national privacy regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cr2CQz"&gt;Clearview, which claims to have scraped 10 billion images of people from social media sites in order to identify them in other photos, sells its technology to law enforcement agencies. It was &lt;a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/afp-admits-to-trialling-controversial-facial-recognition-tool-clearview-ai-546729"&gt;trialled by the Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; (AFP) between October 2019 and March 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQAnQF"&gt;Now, following an investigation, Australia privacy regulator, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), has found that the company breached citizens’ privacy. “The covert collection of this kind of sensitive information is unreasonably intrusive...&lt;/p&gt;
