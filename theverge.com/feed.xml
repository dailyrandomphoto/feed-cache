    <title>Acer is slapping its logo on SSDs and RAM made by a company called Biwin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ACER SSDs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f8rPvxmrruF3QfW1nJ6rvC5lr00=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194328/acerbiwinssd.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starting with SSDs, but soon RAM sticks will be launched.&lt;/em&gt; | Acer / Biwin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HnsUTp"&gt;Acer announced &lt;a href="https://www.acerstorage.com/news-detail/biwin-to-offer-acer-branded-memory-and-personal-storage-products.html"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it’s getting into the flash storage and memory business with help from a Chinese manufacturer called Biwin. Acer’s brand will be slapped onto each of these SSDs, but it’ll be another company that’s responsible for building them. Even though you’ll see an Acer logo on this storage, &lt;a href="https://www.acerstorage.com/support/warranty-policy/"&gt;it’s Biwin that’ll handle the warranty&lt;/a&gt; for these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFiBfR"&gt;Acer isn’t the only major company utilizing Biwin’s hardware. This storage and memory manufacturer also &lt;a href="https://hp.biwintech.com/products/"&gt;puts out HP-branded products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Portable-External-1F5P4AA-ABC/dp/B08DDJZP3N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;portable SSDs&lt;/a&gt;, NVMe SSDs, 2.5-inch SATA SSDs, and RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pa6eMw"&gt;The latest partnership aims to release Acer-branded products first in the US, China, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and in the UK. Release dates...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE is selling a $200 phone with wireless charging through Visible and Yahoo Mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sjp5VRooId_eTJ7urb12esvpm5Y=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194294/Blade_11_Prime_Front_Left.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZTE Blade 11 Prime features a 6.5-inch display and also supports wired reverse charging.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cR9ydL"&gt;ZTE is offering a feature rarely seen in the budget class of phones: wireless charging. The Blade 11 Prime is on sale now in the US for $192 through Visible and Yahoo Mobile, two MVNOs that use Verizon’s network. It’s an otherwise fairly unremarkable budget device, with a 6.5-inch 720p display shipping with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdOn9x"&gt;In addition to wireless charging, the Blade 11 Prime supports reverse wired charging to provide some power to other devices in a pinch. However, the phone’s 4,000mAh battery is on the smaller side, so the feature is probably best reserved for emergencies. The 11 Prime uses a MediaTek 6762 chipset with 4GB of RAM and offers 64GB of built-in storage. It features 16-megapixel standard and 8-megapixel wide rear-facing cameras,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress is way behind on algorithmic misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwVi0T"&gt;One of the scariest concerns about social media is the idea of algorithmic misinformation — that the recommendation systems built into platforms like Facebook and YouTube could be quietly elevating the most harmful and disruptive content on the network. But at a Senate hearing Tuesday titled “Algorithms and Amplification: How Social Media Platforms’ Design Choices Shape our Discourse and Our Minds,’’ lawmakers didn’t appear any closer to finding a solution for the violence platforms like Facebook have &lt;a href="https://t.co/6tvhkqG8hA?amp=1"&gt;internally recognized&lt;/a&gt; they cause in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTx8iL"&gt;At the top, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) said “there’s nothing inherently wrong” with how the testifying companies, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, leverage algorithms to keep users engaged on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft brings Office and OneNote apps to Amazon’s Fire tablets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6n8zy-ESVBoKF8qJawYR251G694=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193974/Fire_HD_10_Plus_Lifestyle_Productivity_Bundle.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ddn8mz"&gt;Microsoft is launching its Office and OneNote apps on Amazon’s Fire tablets today. Both apps are available in Amazon’s Appstore, with the Office app combining Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a single tablet app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46lUFG"&gt;Microsoft is no stranger to Amazon’s Appstore, having previously published apps like Outlook, Xbox, and Xbox Game Pass for Fire tablets. This is the first time Office has appeared on Amazon’s tablets, though. Microsoft has essentially taken its Android Office app that’s already available on the Google Play Store and modified it to work on Amazon’s Fire OS — a forked version of Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1zK1qU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s new Fire HD 10 tablet has slimmer bezels and better specs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405230/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-announced-kids-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FPmAeY"&gt;Both the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08WC1B9D2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VVX1QLD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OneNote&lt;/a&gt; apps will be available on Amazon’s Appstore in regions where Fire tablets are currently sold. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F27%2Fmicrosoft-365-apps-now-available-for-amazon-fire-tablets%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; it has...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People who are vaccinated don’t need to wear masks during many outdoor activities, CDC says</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eDZKag"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/participate-in-activities.html"&gt;new guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, outlining the situations where vaccinated people can stop wearing masks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfHs43"&gt;People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and two weeks after the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8VAK2"&gt;The guidelines, announced today by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, give fully vaccinated people more leeway to return to normal activities — recognizing how effective the vaccines are at preventing disease. But they’re complicated, and they ask people to keep track of different mask guidelines for a wide range of situations. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Secretlab’s first PC desk keeps your cables under control with the help of magnets</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MUSxhG"&gt;Secretlab, which you may know for its gaming chairs, is announcing its first-ever PC desk — the Magnus Metal Desk — and the company has a smart solution to help you manage your cables: you’ll be able to attach magnetic cable-management accessories right onto the desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvzHF5"&gt;The company will offer proprietary accessories like magnetic cable holders to keep your phone’s charging cable from slipping off your desk and a magnetic cable sheath that can be attached to one of the desk’s legs. The desk has a cable tray in the back you can use to store cables as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkoYz6"&gt;The Magnus desk doesn’t just use magnets to help hide cables, though — Secretlab is also making a desk mat that attaches magnetically so it will stay in place while you’re gaming or...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford takes its first step toward producing its own electric car batteries</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j4ZMtl"&gt;Ford announced the launch of a new battery development center in Michigan, the first step toward taking on some of the burden of building its own battery cells for electric cars in-house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqM5m0"&gt;The new “global battery center of excellence” will be called Ford Ion Park and will be based in Southeast Michigan. Ford said the purpose is to conduct research on how to go about making its own electric vehicle batteries. A team of 150 experts will work on ways to build EV batteries that are long lasting, quick to charge, and sustainable for the environment. They will also develop a process for making batteries quickly, cheaply, and at scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4j1Xvb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There will be “lab scale and pilot scale” battery assembly at the new center&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1SS5od"&gt;But Ford Ion Park, which will...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose no longer requires you to make an account just to use its app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A close-up photo of the Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700, the best noise-canceling headphones for video conferencing and voice calls." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p5XrFitUIcOi-c8mzWiA4l1PZ78=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193061/cwelch_190605_3471_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ITjLQM"&gt;Recent Bose headphones and earbuds have come with a somewhat frustrating requirement: to use the accompanying Bose Music app, you needed to create an account. So if you wanted to, say, customize the noise cancellation of the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, you’d have to make a Bose account just to access those important controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eITGqt"&gt;Now Bose is doing away with the needlessly annoying mandatory account. The update notes for the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bose-music/id1364986984"&gt;latest version of Bose Music on iOS&lt;/a&gt; say “when you set up your Bose headphones and earbuds, you can skip creating an account and get right to enjoying your product.” That’s the way it ought to be. (Bose previously had &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.bose.com/en_us/support/articles/HC2547/productCodes/noise_cancelling_headphones_700/article.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this help article up&lt;/a&gt; for customers with “privacy concerns regarding data...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC now lets you directly buy Vive repair parts through iFixit</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QicUrB"&gt;HTC has partnered with iFixit to make its Vive virtual reality systems more repairable, selling a list of screws, cables, adapters, and other standalone components directly to consumers. &lt;a href="https://blog.vive.com/us/2021/04/26/vive-ifixit-repair-partner/"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, HTC says the move is aimed at helping people whose headsets are out of warranty or potentially no longer being sold. iFixit also offers repair guides for the original Vive, the Vive Pro, the original Vive controller, and the Vive Pro Eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kH1pe4"&gt;HTC confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this is the first time consumers have been able to order many of these replacement parts directly. A few listings, like a $3.99 controller lanyard, wouldn’t be hard to find through other sellers. But VR headsets are specialized and niche devices, so if you want a...&lt;/p&gt;
