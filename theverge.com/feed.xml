    <title>Lordstown Motors delays Endurance EV pickup after announcing Foxconn deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dw7xasOy3DvbaYZsP7Iquqb7XKE=/110x0:3050x1960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130173/Screen_Shot_2021_11_11_at_4.39.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gEHaB"&gt;Cash-strapped EV startup Lordstown Motors is delaying the launch of its electric pickup truck, the Endurance, one day after announcing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775168/foxconn-lordstown-motors-electric-vehicle-factory-trump-ohio"&gt;sale of its Ohio factory to iPhone assembler Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJigzW"&gt;Lordstown Motors said Thursday that it now plans to ship the Endurance in the third quarter of 2022, not the second as previously targeted, because of supply chain shortages. It &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;announced a third-quarter loss&lt;/a&gt; of $96 million and said it will finish the year with just $150 million to $180 million in cash — including a $100 million payment from Foxconn toward the purchase of the factory. Lordstown Motors is also still building pre-production versions of the truck at the Ohio factory despite saying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620787/lordstown-motors-q2-2021-earnings-gm-factory-production-manufacturing"&gt;as recently as August&lt;/a&gt; that it would be making...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The global chip shortage is a nightmare before Christmas</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fHMlPj"&gt;The global chip shortage has had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;massive effect&lt;/a&gt; on the entire technology industry for more than a year, but a wave of gaming hardware news over the past week and change has shown that things aren’t going to get better anytime soon. Gaming companies big and small are going to be feeling the sting well into next year, and it’s not just Sony and Microsoft’s next-gen consoles that could be hard to get a hold of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zl9b8"&gt;Nintendo was arguably the first to kick off the waterfall of news, revising its &lt;strong&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/strong&gt; sales forecast for the fiscal year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762933/nintendo-earnings-q2-2021-switch-sales-forecast"&gt;down by 1.5 million&lt;/a&gt; on November 4th “due to the effects of the global semiconductor shortage,” &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/211104_4e.pdf"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa elaborated further &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/211105_2e.pdf"&gt;in a Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt;, saying that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s unexciting 2021 Mac and iPhone software prove it should take a break from annual OS updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1qRq7SHCJLRJiiCNR0ulhJp0cwg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130116/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZnL4b"&gt;Apple’s fall software updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, are officially out in the world for everyone. But Apple’s latest software has arrived with more of a whimper than a bang; the two updates aren’t so much bad as they are &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;. Which has me wondering: why is Apple still clinging to its annual release schedule at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lXVnu"&gt;There are two problems that Apple’s annual cadence causes. The first, as is the case this year, is that iOS and macOS are increasingly mature operating systems with fewer issues to fix or missing features to add. Which, in turn, means that there are fewer opportunities for sweeping upgrades like there were in the early days when the iPhone getting copy and paste support was headline news. Short of Apple changing its...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is emailing out 50,000 Microsoft Store gift cards for the holiday season</title>

  &lt;p id="znkudT"&gt;Double-check your inbox and your spam folder because Microsoft might have left something in there for you. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775341/microsoft-store-gift-card-email-promotion"&gt;a few people noticed gift cards for the Microsoft Store suddenly appearing via email&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has confirmed it sent out 50,000 of the codes to US customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2qx6t"&gt;Per a Microsoft spokesperson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dEPNd9"&gt;To help spread holiday cheer, Microsoft Store has surprised a total of 50,000 U.S. customers with virtual gift cards via email. 25,000 customers will receive a $100 Microsoft Gift Card while 25,000 others will receive a $10 Microsoft Gift Card ahead of this holiday season. These randomly selected recipients can redeem their gift card on Microsoft Store through December 31, 2021 and spend it within 90 days of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Ten top weather apps for Android phones</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="revCAV"&gt;One of the more popular uses for phones (besides taking photos and watching TikTok videos) is to check out the weather. As a result, there are myriad weather apps out there, making it really hard to pick which one to use. So we’ve put together this guide to what we think are some of the better ones out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcUkev"&gt;With the exception of one that used to be very well-liked: Dark Sky. Back in March 2020, Dark Sky was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;acquired by Apple&lt;/a&gt; and almost immediately removed from the Google Play app store. Originally, the Dark Sky API was going to be pulled as well — leaving a lot of third-party apps desperately looking for a substitute — but that’s been put off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527878/dark-sky-apple-ios-app-website-api-shut-down-end-of-2022"&gt;until at least the end of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. (By the way, if you use the iOS version of Dark Sky, that’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify is acquiring an audiobook company </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1EVy8u"&gt;Spotify has announced plans to acquire the audiobook services and distribution company Findaway for an undisclosed price. The company operates multiple businesses, including distributing audiobooks to various platforms and offering audiobook creation services under its business Findaway Voices. The company pairs authors with narrators, which could become a new and valuable source of revenue for Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M31AsA"&gt;It also makes Spotify both a commercial bookseller and a publisher of audiobooks, a title the company has been hesitant to accept for its podcasting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1js05"&gt;“With this acquisition, we’re going to be able to accelerate the addition of an audiobook catalog onto the platform so that users can effectively get all of the audio content that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using Apple Pay and Touch ID on an external Magic Keyboard can get complicated</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mropuN"&gt;Publications like &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/11/apple-pay-doesnt-work-on-your-magic-keyboard/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have reported some odd behavior when trying to use Apple’s Magic Keyboard with Touch ID to authenticate for Apple Pay — specifically, that it won’t work if you’re trying to do it with a MacBook that has its display closed, as it would be while running it in “clamshell mode” hooked up to an external monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECgIvc"&gt;Obviously, when the MacBook’s lid is closed, you can’t use the built-in Touch ID sensor, so it’s easy to see how this limitation was put in place. But in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607386/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip"&gt;Apple sells an external keyboard with the sensor&lt;/a&gt; (starting at &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK293LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-us-english"&gt;an eye-watering $150&lt;/a&gt;), it’s an awkward limitation. That’s especially true given that the keyboard’s Touch ID functionality only works with Apple Silicon-powered Macs...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can watch Valve’s Steam Deck developer event at 1PM ET Friday, even if you’re not a dev</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TJLYVt"&gt;We’ve known for a little while that Valve is giving developers a huge five-hour tour of its upcoming Steam Deck gaming handheld on Friday, November 12th starting at 10AM PT /  1PM ET. Now, we’re learning &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/steamworksvirtualconference/steamdeck"&gt;you can come watch&lt;/a&gt; even if you’re not a developer — Valve is telling press that “anyone can watch the event.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMQ2gu"&gt;The five-hour virtual conference will include discussions of the hardware; games that will appear &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/"&gt;“on Deck”&lt;/a&gt;; how the Linux handheld can play Windows games via a Proton compatibility layer; a deep dive on the AMD APU that powers it by AMD itself; and of course tips for Steam developers on how to make those things work in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MadBBJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s free to watch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vix6QQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3104662546549776336"&gt;The initial announcement&lt;/a&gt; made it seem like you had to be a Steamworks...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I just bought a $329 Nvidia RTX 3060 for $329, and all I had to do was wait nine months in line</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mw6LBXY92_u2mo1PaqQuHBa1jz8=/0x102:2791x1963/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70129121/verge_sean_hollister_evga_rtx_3060_20211111_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ERjrAP"&gt;Nearly nine months ago, Nvidia said it would launch its most affordable RTX 3000 graphics card yet — the $329 RTX 3060. Good luck actually finding one at that price, right? That’s why I subtitled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;my review&lt;/a&gt; “$329 with an asterisk sign.” And sure enough, they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301391/nvidia-rtx-3060-launch-supply-demand-newegg-shuffle"&gt;nigh-impossible to find on launch day&lt;/a&gt; for Nvidia’s sticker price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAFqs2"&gt;But that same day, February 25th, I signed up for EVGA’s graphics card &lt;em&gt;waiting queue&lt;/em&gt; on a whim. And after waiting in that queue for so long that I completely forgot I ever signed up, I got a surprise. On Monday, I received an email from EVGA letting me know I could actually purchase that $329 card for $329.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql4mzI"&gt;So I did. Yesterday afternoon, a brand-new RTX 3060 arrived for $379.41 after tax and shipping. That’s a...&lt;/p&gt;
