    <title>Twitter has lost legal immunity for users’ posts in India, government argues</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="crpKYy"&gt;Twitter is now legally liable for content posted by its users in India after failing to comply with the country’s new IT rules, the government said in a legal filing. As reported by both &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-loses-immunity-over-user-generated-content-india-2021-07-06/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/twitter-has-lost-liability-protection-in-india-government-says/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;India’s IT ministry argues in a filing with New Delhi’s High Court that the social media firm has lost its legal immunity after failing to comply with new requirements imposed in May. These include appointing a chief compliance officer, a grievance officer, and a contact person to respond to requests from law enforcement 24 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r60baz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports that the court filing came in response to allegations from a Twitter user that they had been defamed by tweets posted on the platform, and that Twitter has not appointed the new...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned about Karateka’s 37-year-old easter egg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="1984 Apple II game Karateka booted upside down" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yQmZzLbAz2Qq5p6UwebcL-wHWFA=/248x0:2615x1578/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69543439/Screen_Shot_2021_07_05_at_1.20.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YguQH0"&gt;Karateka, an early martial arts side-scroller published in the US by Broderbund in 1984, was a little before my time. It was created by Jordan Mechner before he went on to make Prince of Persia&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— a game I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; remember thanks to the horror of sending that character to a bloody, pixelated death on a bed of spikes. Karateka however was an early hit, with later iterations making it to NES and Game Boy. And the original Apple II version included a delightful little easter egg from the early days of PC gaming — putting in the floppy disk upside down would boot up the game upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJHGjv"&gt;This isn’t new exactly — people have been trying this trick for more than 35 years — but it was new to me, and I got a quick refresher today thanks to the magic...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hong Kong’s new anti-doxxing proposal could put tech companies at risk, says new letter</title>

&lt;p id="3vatIr"&gt;Sent to Hong Kong’s privacy commissioner for personal data by the Asia Internet Coalition (which counts Google, Apple and Facebook as members), the letter argues that the new measures will have an extreme impact on due process in Hong Kong, and could result in major US tech companies ceasing operations there. The letter was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-twitter-google-warn-planned-hong-kong-tech-law-could-drive-them-out-11625483036"&gt;first obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XKnFM3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The only way to avoid these sanctions for technology companies would be to refrain from... offering their services in Hong Kong.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Kaseya ransomware attackers demand $70 million, claim they infected over a million devices</title>

  &lt;p id="1GOXwe"&gt;Three days after ransomware attackers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22561252/revil-ransomware-attacks-systems-using-kaseyas-remote-it-management-software"&gt;started the holiday weekend by compromising Kaseya VSA&lt;/a&gt;, we have a clearer idea of how widespread the impact has been. In a new ransom demand, the attackers claim to have compromised more than 1 million computers, and demand $70 million to decrypt the affected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjFjTf"&gt;Kaseya’s software is used by Managed Service Providers to perform IT tasks remotely, but on July 2nd, the Russia-linked REvil ransomware group deployed a malicious software update exposing providers who use the platform, and their clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6yZ05"&gt;The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) &lt;a href="https://csirt.divd.nl/2021/07/03/Kaseya-Case-Update/"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that it appears the exploit used for the breach was same one they discovered and &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseya-was-fixing-zero-day-just-as-revil-ransomware-sprung-their-attack/"&gt;were in the process of addressing&lt;/a&gt; when the attackers...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 9 is on sale — and it’s an even better deal at $649</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0XoJzbpw0mSnKeUGflvNB8t8miA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69543226/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0070_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 misses some of the high-end features on the more expensive Pro model, but it’s a better overall buy for most people.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u8wNGQ"&gt;The OnePlus’ latest flagship phones are marked down at several retailers, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/05/grab-a-oneplus-9-for-the-price-it-probably-shouldve-been-at-launch/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B08Y73NTXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;normally $729 OnePlus 9 down to $649&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B07XM7WVS8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro (usually $1069) to $969&lt;/a&gt;. We think that the more basic 9 is already the better buy than the 9 Pro for most people, and the extra $80 off the retail price makes it an even sweeter deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwH0B6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;The OnePlus 9 gives up surprisingly few features&lt;/a&gt; compared to its more expensive sibling — you still get a Snapdragon 888 processor, display with 120Hz refresh rate, and an excellent 50-megapixel ultrawide camera. You’ll have to make do with an unstabilized main camera, plastic rather than aluminum frame, and slower wireless charging. Considering that you save more than $300 off the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rimac takes over Bugatti from VW in powerhouse electric supercar deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hJNC5Z3NQbk-K2G7x0KlxbuQXAU=/245x0:7571x4884/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69542819/Bugatti_Rimac_4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRkwgd"&gt;Croatian electric supercar startup Rimac &lt;a href="https://www.rimac-automobili.com/media/press-releases/rimac-and-bugatti-combine-forces-in-historic-new-venture/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was taking over Bugatti from Volkswagen to form a new company called Bugatti Rimac. The news was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/56be5f08-fe6e-481f-ba6d-71ef49d2cfc4"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk90BC"&gt;Bugatti Rimac will be led by Mate Rimac, who founded the company in 2009 in a garage as a one-man operation. Over that period, Rimac has become a highly desirable brand, with many legacy automakers calling upon the startup to help build their own electric supercars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kR13b2"&gt;It’s not much of a question why that is. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463499/rimac-nevera-production-c-two-concept-hypercar"&gt;Rimac released the Nevera&lt;/a&gt;, a quad-motor, 1,914 horsepower demonstration of electric absurdity, with a top speed of 258mph and an ability to leap to zero to 60mph in less than 2 seconds. The Nevera is expected to be the...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="6q7aFD"&gt;Airbnb has blocked or redirected “potentially risky reservation attempts” from over 50,000 people across 15 US cities as part of a crackdown on parties in its properties during the pandemic. These include 7,000 in Dallas, 6,000 in San Diego, 5,100 in Charlotte, 3,500 in St. Louis, 3,000 in Columbus, and 2,700 in New Orleans, the company’s head of trust and safety communication Ben Breit tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk just now realizing that self-driving cars are a ‘hard problem’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iZNPnP"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk is finally admitting that he underestimated how difficult it is to develop a safe and reliable self-driving car. To which the entire engineering community rose up as one to say, “No duh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aX0R2K"&gt;Or at least that’s how it should have happened in a just world. Instead, all the Tesla sycophants and ass-kissers on Twitter told Musk to keep up the good work, that they believed in him, and encouraged him to hurry up and roll out the latest version of his “Full Self-Driving” software that, it’s worth pointing out, does not enable a Tesla vehicle to drive itself without input from the driver. &lt;/p&gt;

Steel drawbridges were &lt;a href="https://mynorthwest.com/2995816/seattle-bridges-cool-baths-heatwave/"&gt;doused with water&lt;/a&gt; to make sure they wouldn’t swell shut under the oppressive heat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asgJXs"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547454/2021-heat-wave-temperature-high-heat-dome"&gt;heat dome&lt;/a&gt; that sat over the region provided a brutal stress test of i&lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/likely-heat-caused-crack-closes-north-denver"&gt;ts roadways&lt;/a&gt;, some of which couldn’t withstand multiple days of record-breaking temperatures.

  &lt;p id="RhFUhy"&gt;Jeff Bezos, who has served as the CEO of Amazon since founding the company exactly 27 years ago on July 5th, 1994, has officially stepped down from the role.

The July 5th handover date was previously announced in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455126/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-jeff-bezos-july-5-birthday"&gt;shareholder meeting in May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
