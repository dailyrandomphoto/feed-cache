    <title>WhatsApp says accounts will soon be usable across up to four devices</title>

  &lt;p id="ucgf95"&gt;WhatsApp has confirmed that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21361542/whatsapp-multiple-devices-support-ipad-app-chat-sync-rumors"&gt;long-rumored multi-device support&lt;/a&gt; will be entering public beta in the coming months, allowing users to access their accounts from up to four linked devices. New “view once” and “disappearing mode” features were also officially announced. The news came in an interview &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/will-cathcart-and-mark-zuckerberg-confirm-to-wabetainfo-3-features-to-come-on-whatsapp/"&gt;between &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and WhatsApp head Will Cathcart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uw3ZLj"&gt;Cathcart stopped short of confirming reports that WhatsApp has an iPad app in development, but said that multi-device support will make WhatsApp on iPad a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1oDl4"&gt;As well as multi-device support, Zuckerberg also confirmed that WhatsApp is adding a new “view once” feature, which will allow users to send content that disappears after it’s been viewed. The...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring adds new public way for agencies to request video clips in Neighbors app</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OHfItJ"&gt;Ring is adjusting how public agencies such as police and fire departments are able to request video clips from Ring camera owners in its Neighbors app. Starting next week, agencies will only be able to request clips be sent to them through public posts that are viewable in the app’s main feed; they will no longer be able to send individuals specific requests for clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKWy2g"&gt;Ring says this new method provides greater transparency to what public agencies are requesting, as all requests will now be logged on the agency’s profile and reviewable by anyone using the app. Agencies will not be able to remove or delete the posts, according to Ring, though they can be marked as “resolved.” Ring says it limits video clips requests to “verified public...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue gets a sleeker new app rebuilt ‘from the ground up’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FeSmzT"&gt;The Philips Hue app is getting a big update on Thursday. The team at Signify, which makes Hue lights, has rebuilt the app “from the ground up” to make it easier to use. The new version looks mostly the same as the existing app, but it has tweaks around the edges to make it quicker to access different controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VwFTw"&gt;One of the bigger changes is faster access to room controls. Now, when you tap on a room or zone, the app will present a grid of all the available lights and pre-set scenes so you can find them right away. In the prior version, you had to switch back and forth across different tabs that were easy to get lost in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3xLAy"&gt;You’ll also now be able to add new lights from within the Room tab — not just the Settings menu — and if you’re a power...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FBI names REvil as the group behind meat supplier cyberattack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7eQ7X5pGNF_dB6Www2v6lKSlLvs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381104/acastro_170621_1777_0007_v2_0001_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DDT59J"&gt;The FBI has said that cybercriminal group REvil (also known as Sodinokibi) was behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463621/jbs-cyberattack-russia-largest-meat-supplier"&gt;recent attack on meat supplier JBS&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/fbi-jbs-ransomware-attack-was-carried-out-by-revil/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This follows a statement from White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, which indicated that the attack likely came from a Russian-based organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rq45lg"&gt;REvil has previously been implicated in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396283/apple-schematics-leak-ransomware-quanta-supplier-leak"&gt;recent Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt; ransomware attacks, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054951/travelex-currency-exchange-offline-malware-attack-ransom"&gt;last year’s Travelex attack&lt;/a&gt;. The JBS intrusion, however, could have wide-ranging effects: the company is the world’s largest meat processor, and the incident shut down some of the largest slaughterhouses in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9CRtpp"&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces Snapdragon-powered Galaxy Book Go laptops from $349</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3yT_Dj49x9ax6ylxJXO-Mt7vNY4=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381067/Galaxy_Book_Go_PR_main2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cZisZm"&gt;Samsung has announced two new Windows laptops running Arm-based processors. The Galaxy Book Go and Galaxy Book Go 5G both use Snapdragon chips from Qualcomm rather than Samsung’s own Exynos designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BpoTw"&gt;The Galaxy Book Go is an entry-level model that starts at $349. It has the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451392/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-arm-processor"&gt;updated Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 processor&lt;/a&gt; that Qualcomm announced last month, as well as 4GB or 8GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of eUFS storage. The display is a 14-inch 1080p LCD and the laptop is 14.9mm thick, weighing in at 1.38kg.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XkBZOG"&gt;The Galaxy Book Go 5G, meanwhile, uses Qualcomm’s more powerful &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020"&gt;Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; processor — though other laptops with that chip aren’t exactly powerhouses — and, as the name suggests, it includes 5G connectivity. Despite...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>For Apple TV Plus to succeed, it has to be everywhere — even Android TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCCa0KZN32lwitIK2S2LLzcnmV8=/128x0:1505x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69380653/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV Plus logo.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKzcOk"&gt;This week, Apple brought its Apple TV app to many new Android TV devices — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462960/apple-tv-app-nvidia-shield-now-available"&gt;not just the Nvidia Shield&lt;/a&gt;. And Apple was smart to widen that support — the expiration date for free trials of Apple TV Plus is swiftly approaching, with many customers about to see their subscriptions end July 1st. That gives Apple a month to win over Android TV users by letting them watch flagship shows like the earnest and delightful &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; on the big screen, a show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;whose second season&lt;/a&gt; will premiere near the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zz9VYe"&gt;The rollout of the Apple TV app to Android TV OS devices started Monday at 8AM PT, a Google spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. As a caveat, the Google spokesperson clarified that support does not extend to third-party operator set-top...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="EuE0J6"&gt;Ethereum mining is coming to perhaps an unexpected place: Norton 360, the antivirus software that many readers will know from setting up new computers for their parents (&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/norton-360-antivirus-now-lets-you-mine-ethereum-cryptocurrency/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005361/en/"&gt;its press release&lt;/a&gt;, Norton claims its brand is a perfect fit: people looking to mine crypto won’t have to dig through the dark, scary parts of the web, where they could possibly find “unvetted code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2ZGUl"&gt;The company also says that it’ll store users’ crypto wallets in the cloud, with its own Norton Wallet. As far as actually using their gains, a Norton spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; there will be a button that allows users to “pull money into Coinbase.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2krHr"&gt;Until now, Norton claims, people who wanted to mine had to disable their security software to do it,...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mu0DvE"&gt;The agency has picked two new robotic missions to explore the hot hell-world of Venus, Earth’s neighbor and the second planet from the Sun, administrator Bill Nelson announced on Wednesday. The two missions, DAVINCI+ and VERITAS, were among four competing proposals under the latest round of NASA’s Discovery Program, which manages smaller planetary exploration missions with a slim budget of roughly $500 million each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0vEeA"&gt;“These two sister missions both aim to understand how Venus became an inferno-like world capable of melting lead at the surface,” Nelson said during his first “State of NASA” address at the agency’s headquarters in Washington, DC on Wednesday. “They will offer the entire science community a chance to investigate a planet we...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="q0JJHI"&gt;Apple employees are being asked to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Tim Cook sent out an email Wednesday informing staff of the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PODrP"&gt;“For all that we’ve been able to achieve while many of us have been separated, the truth is that there has been something essential missing from this past year: each other,” he said. “Video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sgrpkz"&gt;Cook said that most employees will be asked to come in to the office on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, with the option of working remotely on Wednesdays and Fridays. Teams that need to work in-person will return four to five days a week. &lt;/p&gt;
