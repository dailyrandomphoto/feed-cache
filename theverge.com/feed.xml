    <title>For Apple TV Plus to succeed, it has to be everywhere — even Android TV</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKzcOk"&gt;This week, Apple brought its Apple TV app to many new Android TV devices — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462960/apple-tv-app-nvidia-shield-now-available"&gt;not just the Nvidia Shield&lt;/a&gt;. And Apple was smart to widen that support — the expiration date for free trials of Apple TV Plus is swiftly approaching, with many customers about to see their subscriptions end July 1st. That gives Apple a month to win over Android TV users by letting them watch flagship shows like the earnest and delightful &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; on the big screen, a show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;whose second season &lt;/a&gt;will premiere near the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zz9VYe"&gt;The rollout of the Apple TV app to Android TV OS devices started Monday at 8AM PT, a Google spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. As a caveat, the Google spokesperson clarified that support does not extend to third-party operator set-top...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your next laptop may come with a cryptominer, courtesy of Norton</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EuE0J6"&gt;Ethereum mining is coming to perhaps an unexpected place: Norton 360, the antivirus software that many readers will know from setting up new computers for their parents (&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/norton-360-antivirus-now-lets-you-mine-ethereum-cryptocurrency/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005361/en/"&gt;its press release&lt;/a&gt;, Norton claims its brand is a perfect fit: people looking to mine crypto won’t have to dig through the dark, scary parts of the web, where they could possibly find “unvetted code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2ZGUl"&gt;The company also says that it’ll store users’ crypto wallets in the cloud, with its own Norton Wallet. As far as actually using their gains, a Norton spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; there will be a button that allows users to “pull money into Coinbase.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2krHr"&gt;Until now, Norton claims, people who wanted to mine had to disable their security software to do it,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA will send two missions to Venus for the first time in over 30 years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mu0DvE"&gt;The agency has picked two new robotic missions to explore the hot hell-world of Venus, Earth’s neighbor and the second planet from the Sun, administrator Bill Nelson announced on Wednesday. The two missions, DAVINCI+ and VERITAS, were among four competing proposals under the latest round of NASA’s Discovery Program, which manages smaller planetary exploration missions with a slim budget of roughly $500 million each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0vEeA"&gt;“These two sister missions both aim to understand how Venus became an inferno-like world capable of melting lead at the surface,” Nelson said during his first “State of NASA” address at the agency’s headquarters in Washington, DC on Wednesday. “They will offer the entire science community a chance to investigate a planet we...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple asks staff to return to office three days a week starting in early September </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q0JJHI"&gt;Apple employees are being asked to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Tim Cook sent out an email Wednesday informing staff of the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PODrP"&gt;“For all that we’ve been able to achieve while many of us have been separated, the truth is that there has been something essential missing from this past year: each other,” he said. “Video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sgrpkz"&gt;Cook said that most employees will be asked to come in to the office on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, with the option of working remotely on Wednesdays and Fridays. Teams that need to work in-person will return four to five days a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnaG3Q"&gt;Employees also have the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You probably shouldn’t eat cicadas if you’re allergic to shellfish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Five cicadas hanging out on some lush green leaves. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcaduiW0DQhAPdf_AewOnROwIdM=/0x0:4511x3007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69379630/1321221870.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWLEhs"&gt;Brood X is back and ready for action. After a 17 year nap, the cicadas of the Eastern US have emerged to scream, mate, and perhaps pick up a fungus that turns them into “&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-this-zombie-fungus-turns-cicadas-into-horror-movie-sex-bots/"&gt;horror movie sex bots.&lt;/a&gt;” While some people have been dreading the return of the screeching multitudes, others have eagerly awaited the brood with tasty &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eating-cicadas-brood-x/"&gt;bug recipes in hand&lt;/a&gt;. But before you run to the nearest cicada cookout, be aware that you’ll probably want to avoid these crunchy morsels if you have a shellfish allergy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h1kgWn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yep! We have to say it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don't eat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cicadas?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#cicadas&lt;/a&gt; if you're allergic to seafood as these insects share a family relation to shrimp and lobsters. &lt;a href="https://t.co/UBg7CwrObN"&gt;https://t.co/UBg7CwrObN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/3qn7czNg53"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3qn7czNg53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— U.S. FDA (@US_FDA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1400135267269414914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s newest euphemism for overworked employees is ‘industrial athlete’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8XpOwZys4hDJaucPMFW0ED904y0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69379529/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IseoFD"&gt;Amazon tells its warehouse employees to think of themselves not as overworked cogs in an enormous, soul-crushing machine, but&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;as “industrial athletes,” and to prepare their bodies for that experience like someone training for a sporting event, according to &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epnvp7/amazon-calls-warehouse-workers-industrial-athletes-in-leaked-wellness-pamphlet"&gt;a pamphlet obtained by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The comparison is a troubling euphemism for a company whose workers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463132/amazon-injury-rate-warehouses-osha-data-report"&gt;almost double the amount of serious injuries&lt;/a&gt; as the rest of the warehousing industry and who reportedly are often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;unable to take bathroom breaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDtIcu"&gt;The pamphlet tells employees that some of them will walk up to 13 miles throughout the course of the day, burning an average of 400 calories an hour. It also suggests all sorts of ways to help workers prepare for the athlete life,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If you play Fortnite right now, you might get abducted by aliens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RpAp0v24MTBr8M1zgixeUG0s2Hc=/16x0:978x641/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69379422/fortnite.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image for &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;em&gt; next season.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CGD5Or"&gt;If you hop into a game of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; right now, you might get teleported across the map by a mysterious laser beam that appears out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGNxRz"&gt;Yes, seriously. Watch it happen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIHjp-TgGDI"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt; from streamer Ali “SypherPK” Hassan, which I’ve also embedded below at the right timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lc4ogm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tNM0zk"&gt;While it’s hard to tell exactly where the laser beam is coming from, it’s hard to think that it isn’t coming from some kind of UFO or alien... thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Igtbu2"&gt;The abductions started happening in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Tuesday evening, just one week before the game’s next season &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/what-to-do-before-fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-ends-and-7-starts"&gt;begins on June 8th&lt;/a&gt;. And a few other hints seem to indicate that Chapter 2 Season 7 could be alien-themed in some way, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUkxEb"&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iFireMonkey/status/1400142779670577157"&gt;this video teaser&lt;/a&gt; that apparently is on TikTok, for example, which features...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QPBOUA"&gt;The Apple Card experienced an outage on Wednesday that reportedly affected users’ ability to make payments, manage their cards, and see recent transactions, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupport%2Fsystemstatus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F2%2F22465000%2Fapple-card-outage-cant-make-payments-recent-transactions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s status page&lt;/a&gt;. Interruption in service appears to have started at 6:17AM PT today and lasted for a little over five hours, ending at 12:19PM PT.&lt;/p&gt;

Apple said that all users were affected by today’s outage, but it wasn’t clear if every user experienced all of the possible issues the company reported.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will stop testing most employees for weed</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfFDai"&gt;Amazon is relaxing its policy around employees using weed, according to &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/update-on-our-vision-to-be-earths-best-employer-and-earths-safest-place-to-work"&gt;a new blog post&lt;/a&gt;, and will no longer enforce marijuana drug tests for any employee who isn’t also regulated by the Department of Transportation, like a delivery driver. In the past, Amazon used positive tests as a reason to disqualify applicants during the hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;
