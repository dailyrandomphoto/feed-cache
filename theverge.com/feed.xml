    <title>Twitch warns streamers another wave of copyright strikes is coming</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FMLK4H"&gt;Twitch has received a “batch” of new takedown notices from music publishers over copyrighted songs in recorded streams (known as VODs), the company said in an email to streamers today. The notice may be worrying for some streamers who were affected by the waves of takedowns that hit last year, because if a user gets three copyright strikes on their channel, they will be permanently banned from the platform, according to Twitch’s policies. With this advance warning, it seems Twitch is trying to get ahead of a sudden flurry of takedowns and give streamers some time to remove potentially offending VODs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49EQjd"&gt;“We recently received a batch of DMCA takedown notifications with about 1,000 individual claims from music publishers,” Twitch said in an...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Memorial Day sales happening now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 6, in Product Red" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LGSdFyIHYKHdYolpTFgi2Bb_6A4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69357654/vpavic_200929_4216_0128.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Our favorite smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 6, is $70 off at multiple retailers this weekend. | Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCrwEW"&gt;Memorial Day weekend has officially arrived. Numerous retailers, including GameStop and Walmart, have already kicked off their Memorial Day sales online, offering customers a chance to save on a variety of electronics ahead of the three-day weekend. The holiday remains a great way to save on mattresses and camping equipment — it’s the unofficial start to summer, after all — but if you’re a gamer or prefer electronics over home goods, there are plenty of bargains to be had on headphones, TVs, and games throughout the long weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4MxBJ"&gt;We’ve seen discounts on many of these items before, sure, but if you’re still looking for a good deal, it’s hard to go wrong with the highlights below. Also, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt; now reportedly set for June...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cybertruck patent applications show off UI, solar bed cover, ‘armor glass’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6T8gkP"&gt;New patent applications submitted by Tesla in 2020 but published Thursday have revealed a bit more information about the Cybertruck, which is currently slated to start shipping at the very end of this year or in early 2022. One includes (in rather grainy detail) a bunch of screenshots of the new UI Tesla has been working on. Another details how the company plans to integrate solar panel tech onto the retracting tonneau cover for the truck bed — &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-solar-roof-option-add-range/"&gt;something CEO Elon Musk said might be an option&lt;/a&gt;. And there even appears to be an application for what could be Tesla’s so-called “armor glass,” which memorably failed during an onstage demo in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui8Xpc"&gt;We’ve seen glimpses of Tesla’s new user interface before, at the Cybertruck reveal event and &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/04/28/tesla-head-ui-leaves-leaks-unreleased-cybertruck-fsd-images/"&gt;when...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="whLQfu"&gt;When you are a parent, you quickly learn that your kids will inevitably get into shows or videos or learn songs that slowly chip away at your sanity because you will hear them over and over and over. Anyone who knows what “Baby Shark” is will know exactly the kind of hellscape I’m talking about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMKOoe"&gt;But once in a while, a kids’ show comes into your family’s life and you miss it when your kid ages out of it — like &lt;em&gt;Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;. For our family, that show was &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt;; my now-teenager voraciously watched episodes of the show that ran on Nickelodeon from 2004 to 2013 (we watched the DVDs), and would actually get up and dance when the music started. We looked forward to new episodes about the hijinks of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Mars helicopter had a midair brain fart</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tr7jo4"&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter ended its sixth flight test on Mars earlier than planned last week after bugging out mid-flight, the rotorcraft’s chief pilot wrote in a blog post on Thursday. The four-pound mini helicopter was aiming to fly farther than any of its previous excursions to test out its scientific reconnaissance capabilities, as the latest trial in an extended test campaign to demonstrate a new mode of transportation on another world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkHMm0"&gt;Last Saturday, Ingenuity powered up and rose 33 feet from the Martian surface to travel a distance of roughly two football fields along a preprogramed flight path, all the while snapping photos of a “region of interest” on Mars during flight. As it buzzed along at about nine miles per hour toward...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="sKi4jL"&gt;Officially referred to as the “force sensor” (a title that makes the button sound far more interesting than it actually is), it’s technically nothing more than an indented portion of the AirPods Pro’s stems, with some fancy hardware that measures not just capacitive touch but also pressure. But the faux-buttons solve one of the most annoying things about earbuds: how to control them. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We have bigger problems than COVID-19’s origins  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eGuT9W"&gt;As the COVID-19 pandemic scales down in the United States, debates around the origins of the virus — and speculations that it came from a lab in China, not an animal — rumbled back to life. And they’re diverting attention to the wrong places. Focusing on where the virus came from is a distraction from the rest of the urgent work governments and health agencies around the world need to do in order to end this pandemic and prepare for the next one. We don’t need a consensus on the origins of COVID-19 in order to take steps to strengthen global public health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdK4Es"&gt;That doesn’t mean finding out where the coronavirus came from isn’t important. It’s one of the pieces of information that could &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fwe-still-dont-know-the-origins-of-the-coronavirus-here-are-four-scenarios&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22458230%2Fcovid-origins-lab-leak-biden-vaccines-pandemic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;give us tools&lt;/a&gt; to prevent a similar situation from...&lt;/p&gt;

Until then, we’ve got some great deals highlighted below.&lt;/p&gt;
