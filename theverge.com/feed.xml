    <title>The snooze button is the best part of the world’s most hated gadget</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c7hkUokE7HxgQ9XxexTTIdv7-Pw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70192046/cgartenberg_211119_4889_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EB4QgU"&gt;Few gadgets are more hated than the alarm clock, a device whose primary purpose is to rudely rip you from the pleasant world of sleep into the cold, harsh, unforgiving reality that we live in every day — and whose level of functionality is directly proportional to how goddamn annoying the beeping sound it can make is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZfWsi"&gt;But within virtually all alarm clocks is also a crucial reprieve: the snooze button, a temporary salve for the alarm’s cruel clarion call, a stay of execution for the day you will inevitably have to face. It is the phrase “just a few more minutes” rendered in plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0hoNG"&gt;The alarm clock here is a Sharp SPC028B, bought from a Walmart somewhere in Pennsylvania ahead of my time as a sleepaway camp counselor over a decade ago....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify becomes latest to experiment with a TikTok-style video feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kUxuHi"&gt;Spotify is testing a new TikTok-style video feed in its beta iOS app that shows fullscreen video clips as songs are played, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/spotify-tests-a-tiktok-like-vertical-video-feed-in-its-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The feature was first spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/1463542273216446472"&gt;Chris Messina&lt;/a&gt;, who posted a video of the feed in action. When available, the video feed is accessible from a new fourth tab in the navigation bar labelled “Discover.” Individual tracks can then be liked as you scroll through the feed, and there’s also a three dot menu icon to bring up options for each song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goODdV"&gt;Spotify confirmed the test in a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, but declined to comment on if or when it might see a wider rollout. “At Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience,” a spokesperson said. “Some of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest settles lawsuit that alleged racial and gender discrimination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vz-xO3DuXo9YoHInudSL3Jkf4_Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70190928/acastro_200902_1777_pinterest_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7ZBY8M"&gt;Pinterest has settled a lawsuit brought against it by shareholders who claimed that the company’s workplace discrimination against women and racial minorities hurt its reputation, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/pinterest-settles-shareholder-lawsuit-workplace-culture-rcna6519"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company reportedly agreed to spend $50 million on improving its diversity and equity, and will let former employees talk about racial or gender discrimination they experienced, even if they were bound by a non-disclosure agreement. Other financial details of the settlement weren’t disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOHYj9"&gt;The lawsuit was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755406/pinterest-shareholders-lawsuit-sue-toxic-work-culture-discrimination"&gt;filed against the company’s executives in November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, with shareholder claiming that the company was acting irresponsibly by doing nothing to address “widespread claims of race and gender discrimination.” The complaint also...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You probably have better options than the candy bar-shaped monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Elsonic, via Nojima Online&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B83hkB"&gt;Another day, another interesting gadget &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/ultra-tall-732-monitor-is-ready-for-your-never-ending-newsfeed/"&gt;making the rounds on the internet&lt;/a&gt; — this one is a very tall (aspect ratio-wise anyway) portable monitor with an 8.8-inch display running at a resolution of 420 by 1920. It’s called &lt;a href="https://online.nojima.co.jp/commodity/1/0479960021309/"&gt;the Elsonic EK-MD088&lt;/a&gt;, and while its size, shape, and built-in stand make it intriguing, it also raises the question: what would you even use such a narrow monitor for? And are there better ways to spend your 14,800 yen (around $130 US dollars)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eoJxvx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/super-tall-vertical-monitor-is-perfect-for-doomscrollin-1848116439"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; the most obvious use case for such a tall screen: it seems tailor-made for endlessly scrolling through Twitter or Instagram, keeping the gloom of the internet ever-present off to the side of your work. Honestly, that seems like a great way to destroy your brain...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Battle.net has recovered from DDoS attack, Blizzard says</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWXEbY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1463665481177571332"&gt;Blizzard says&lt;/a&gt; that the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that were overwhelming its servers with coordinated traffic are over, and that you should be able to log into Battle.net again. During the almost hour-long Wednesday evening attack, you may have experienced serious issues trying to get onto the online service underpinning &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;’s online features and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="38wBVF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The DDOS attacks that we were monitoring have ended. If you are still unable to log in try &lt;a href="https://t.co/XSV7UVlWlu"&gt;https://t.co/XSV7UVlWlu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Blizzard CS - The Americas (@BlizzardCS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1463665481177571332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nqpif4"&gt;Blizzard stated that the issue was caused by a DDoS on its verified customer service Twitter account, and additionally in a “Breaking News”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new pro football NFT marketplace has a name: NFL All Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Indianapolis Colts v Buffalo Bills" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ptgZvzYz251drAke3eAhzy4671M=/0x0:3117x2078/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70190318/1354725238.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joshua Bessex/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tjap9m"&gt;It has been less than a year since NBA Top Shot served as an introduction for many sports fans into the world of NFTs, and now the NFL is lining up a similar arrangement. In September, the league &lt;a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-nflpa-and-dapper-labs-announce-new-nft-deal-to-create-exclusive-digital-vide"&gt;announced a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with the company that runs Top Shot, Dapper Labs, and now we know the name of the service that will distribute the video highlight clips that make up the “Moments” that become NFTs: NFL All Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KtwLOm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Can the NBA make NFTs cool?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="5UryIF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2MLFDr"&gt;This effort is separate from the Ticketmaster-powered NFTs that the NFL is tying to selected games this season (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789265/nft-nfl-football-commerative-ticketmaster"&gt;the Lions’ annual Thanksgiving appearance on national TV&lt;/a&gt;), but launching the branding now doesn’t feel like a coincidence. There will be many blockchain and NFT discussions amongst family members on Thursday,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Almost buying a copy of the Constitution is easy, but giving the money back is hard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2eLo8BE5M_FA0IJGJi47jvLYoGM=/0x0:1746x1164/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70190316/constdao.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of 13 remaining copies of the Official Edition of the Constitution. | Image: Sotheby’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ps4ajp"&gt;As of last Thursday night, ConstitutionDAO found itself in possession of around $49.8 million it wasn’t able to spend. The group’s organizers only had a mandate to spend the crowdfunded money on one thing — a rare copy of the US Constitution &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790452/constitutiondao-loses-auction-for-rare-us-constitution-copy-sothebys"&gt;that they failed to win at auction&lt;/a&gt; — so instead of trying to get community approval to use the money toward some other goal, they instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799192/constitutiondao-shutting-down-lost-auction-refunds"&gt;began the process of returning the funds to backers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUdMUT"&gt;Returning that much money has been a tricky process, though. Backers have to manually request refunds, so even a week later, tens of millions of dollars are still sitting in ConstitutionDAO’s pockets. And because all of the money was collected in Ether, and sending funds over Ethereum incurs high transaction...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbcCmK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 5:33PM ET, November 24th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Amazon now has &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099VMT8VZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;an actual price cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; on the 128GB model, dropping from $299.99 to $249.99. Not only can you currently get this price, but entering OCULUS50 at checkout will earn you a $50 Amazon credit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HY1DtN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 standalone VR headset&lt;/a&gt; is a great value at its regular $299.99 price. It comes with 128GB of onboard storage, and once you log in with your Facebook account, there’s little else standing in your way of finding some amazing virtual reality experiences and games. It’s even more of an appealing holiday gift idea right now because you can get one with a $50 gift card tossed in at no extra charge through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; until Saturday, November 27th.

    <title>Black Friday 2021 smart home tech deals: speakers, cameras, robots, and more </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZzBxpdIVD7rM7z674DaQ5xUPd_E=/0x0:6033x4022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70178330/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 8 is one of many smart speakers and displays on sale this smart home buying season.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uNHMij"&gt;There is never a better time to dive into the smart home than Black Friday and its close cousin Cyber Monday. Traditionally, tech deals on home gadgets are huge this time of year, plus, it’s the only time you’ll find real bargains on gear from some of the smaller companies, such as Eve, Level, and Nanoleaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjy6kh"&gt;Whether you’re thinking about dipping a toe into this home automation shindig with a smart speaker or maybe a connected door lock, or want to bolster an already impressive smart home setup, it’s worth investing some cash this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRU2qz"&gt;Also, if you just want to upgrade your home cleaning routine or have a way to check in on Fido now that you’re back at work (the separation anxiety is real), this is a good time to get a great...&lt;/p&gt;
