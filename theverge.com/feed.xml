    <title>Would you pay $30 a month for a faster web browser that eats less battery?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LENmsQirMZcz7iocpzQn4960BIg=/0x0:1376x917/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203413/mighty_browser.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ao3iRA"&gt;No matter how much web browsers improve, it feels like they can’t keep pace with everything we want to do. Open one too many tabs on a few-year-old laptop, and your fan starts spinning, your battery life dips, your system starts to slow. A faster or cleaner PC might fix it, but &lt;a href="https://www.mightyapp.com/"&gt;a startup called Mighty has a different idea&lt;/a&gt;: a $30-a-month web browser that lives in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ievKTm"&gt;Instead of your own physical computer interacting with each website, you stream a&lt;em&gt; remote &lt;/em&gt;web browser instead, one that lives on a powerful computer many miles away with its own 1,000Mbps connection to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAtGyB"&gt;Suddenly, your decent internet connection would feel like one of the fastest internet connections in the world, with websites loading nigh-instantly and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook claims it mistakenly hid posts calling for India’s prime minister to resign</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLTZoh"&gt;When Facebook users tried to view a hashtag calling for the resignation of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/srinivasaiims/status/1387472195316711426"&gt;instead saw a message&lt;/a&gt; saying that Facebook was temporarily hiding the posts in order to keep the community safe. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-blocking-posts-hashtag-resign-modi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the posts were hidden for about three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3qohU"&gt;Facebook has now restored the posts. The company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the hashtag was blocked “by mistake” and claims it wasn’t because the Indian government asked Facebook to remove it. It also says the block was the result of some of the content that used the hashtag, but did not specify what kind of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeLMIH"&gt;The temporary suspension of the hashtag is likely to fuel concerns about the influence that Modi’s BJP party wields...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s pay raise for over 500,000 workers comes at an interesting time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTm_XxvVt3EXSYcqwX81Bd4F8hY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69202415/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFHMtK"&gt;Amazon has announced that over 500,000 of its workers will get a permanent increase in their hourly wages starting in mid-May, from as low as an additional 50 cents an hour to as much as three extra dollars per hour (via &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-boost-pay-500k-operations-workers-much-3-hour-1b-investment/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That’s a substantial chunk of its 1.3 million person workforce getting at least a small pay bump, and the company shared that it’s investing over $1 billion in these pay increases. Amazon said that it’s also on a hiring spree for “tens of thousands of jobs across our operations in the US.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xGE3T"&gt;Amazon previously recognized its warehouse and delivery workers with a $2 pay bump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21182411/amazon-hires-employees-warehouse-delivery-pay-raise-coronavirus"&gt;last March&lt;/a&gt; as the company worked to meet increased demand during the pandemic, but that was a temporary raise that disappeared &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/amazon-to-end-wage-increases-and-overtime-pay-in-june.html"&gt;in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is giving its top prepaid hotspot plan a big price cut and more data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F6nYNSjSefgz4FUmbf23KKjuw7g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69202232/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customers already enrolled in the prepaid plan will get a data boost and a lower price when their plan renews.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCXn6a"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says it will now offer a prepaid 5G data-only plan with up to 100GB of data for $55 per month — a big upgrade from its previous offering of 40GB for $75. The new pricing extends to Cricket Wireless customers as well as AT&amp;amp;T’s direct prepaid subscribers, though those on Cricket won’t be able to access the 5G network. These plans allow customers to buy data for their tablet or mobile hotspot separate from their voice plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEnrf2"&gt;That 100GB is a lot of data at a lower price than the other major carriers are offering; currently, T-Mobile has a prepaid data-only plan of 50GB for $50 and Verizon has a 30GB plan for $65 per month. It may be no coincidence that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497743/verizon-home-lte-service-rural-communities-48-states"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; are also eager to expand their own 5G and LTE-based fixed home...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Space community mourns the death of Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Michael Collins Studying Flight Plans" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GkE4stmIsKUKEK68OdCmV0i5Q1g=/0x20:3989x2679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69201988/517427560.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kuQOSQ"&gt;Michael Collins, the witty “forgotten” astronaut of NASA’s legendary Apollo 11 mission to the Moon, died of cancer on Wednesday, his family said. An icon of space exploration and an eloquent storyteller (who, arguably, had the best sense of humor among the Apollo 11 crew), Collins passionately advocated for further exploration of other worlds. Astronauts, NASA officials, and others in the space community who are heeding his advocacy mourned his death today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKtfx9"&gt;Collins was the Columbia command module pilot who stayed in orbit around the Moon in 1969 while his crew mates, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, descended to the lunar surface and became the first two humans to set foot on another world. Aldrin, now the only living Apollo 11 astronaut,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook expects ad tracking problems from regulators and Apple</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YMzHQN"&gt;Facebook’s ad revenue was up more than 45 percent during the first three months of 2020, soaring to $25.4 billion — or about seven times what Twitter makes in an entire year. But the company sees some potential problems on the horizon that could limit continued growth: regulators are closing in on ad tracking practices, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;a feature launched this week by Apple&lt;/a&gt; could harm its ability to target ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1BP9s"&gt;“We continue to expect increased ad targeting headwinds in 2021 from regulatory and platform changes,” Facebook CFO Dave Wehner writes in the company’s &lt;a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;Q1 2021 earnings release&lt;/a&gt;. Wehner specifically calls out iOS 14.5, which includes a feature that lets iPhone and iPad users easily stop apps from tracking them in certain ways. Facebook expects...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iPhone 12 and Mac sales skyrocket despite ongoing pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mEoNl7"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 12 lineup maintained enormously strong demand from consumers from January through March, according to the company’s fiscal Q2 earnings &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-reports-second-quarter-results%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F28%2F22407894%2Fapple-q2-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;posted today&lt;/a&gt;. Apple reported record March quarter revenue of $89.6 billion, up 54 percent year over year. The iPhone took in just under $48 billion, jumping up by 66 percent from a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eusbyT"&gt;Sales of Mac and iPad hardware also surged for yet another quarter, up 70 and 78 percent respectively, due in part to continued remote work and schooling necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. That success might slow down as some regions of the world return to a sense of normalcy, so most eyes — as usual — are on the iPhone. It’s been reported that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;iPhone 12 mini isn’t doing as well as Apple hoped&lt;/a&gt;,...&lt;/p&gt;

WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar has also confirmed in a March analyst event that HBO original shows won’t get ads added in, so customers won’t have to worry about &lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;getting interrupted by commercials. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fired Amazon worker is trying to unionize four NYC-area facilities</title>
    <content type="html">
