    <title>Microsoft to end Windows 10 support on October 14th, 2025</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bhb6kCBxm4HB7OUFuf5adZ3XCFo=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69449073/windowslogo_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="chG9SQ"&gt;Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10 on October 14th, 2025. It will mark just over 10 years since the operating system was first introduced. Microsoft revealed the retirement date for Windows 10 in an updated &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro"&gt;support life cycle page&lt;/a&gt; for the OS. &lt;a href="https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/251736/windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-2025"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thurrott&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that this is the first time Microsoft has ever described the end of support for Windows 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ajzah0"&gt;It’s not clear exactly when the support document was updated, but &lt;em&gt;Thurrott&lt;/em&gt; reports it only previous documented “when specific Windows 10 versions would leave support,” and not the entire OS. It could be another hint that a new version of Windows is on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DnZw65"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft keeps dropping Windows 11 hints&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7bFXyG"&gt;Microsoft has been dropping lots of hints that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;ready to launch Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon wants you vaccinated, so here’s $180 AirPods Pro and other accessory discounts  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9-ZJMAVDO75nkdN07lIyy9_DAPc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448997/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="U7IgN6"&gt;Verizon is joining &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/today-the-first-winners-of-washington-states-covid-vaccine-lottery-will-be-chosen/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/media-center/odh-news-releases/odh-news-release-05-28-21"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; in offering a financial incentive to get the COVID vaccine: its customers who have gotten at least one dose can get a 10 percent discount on accessories, from either its online or physical stores. To sweeten the deal even more, Verizon is letting customers stack that discount on top of sale prices, which can be used to get some pretty solid deals. It’s unclear if or how you’ll have to prove your vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKbanD"&gt;For example, Verizon has the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/apple-airpods-pro-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro on sale&lt;/a&gt; until June 20th, and the 10 percent discount brings them down to $180 from their normal price of $250. If you’re more a fan of headphones and can snag the discount, you’ll be able to pick up Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/sony-wireless-noise-canceling-over-the-ear-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;delightfully named WH-1000XM4s&lt;/a&gt; for $270.

    <title>Lordstown Motors CEO resigns after investigation into preorders</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zAyIMY"&gt;Steve Burns, the CEO of General Motors-backed startup Lordstown Motors, has resigned following an investigation into allegations that he and other executives lied about preorders for the company’s electric pickup truck. The startup’s chief financial officer Julio Rodriguez has also resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1Pfh3"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-results-special-committee-investigation"&gt;investigation found&lt;/a&gt; that while Lordstown Motors said on multiple occasions that a majority of the 100,000 non-binding preorders it collected were from commercial fleets, this was not the case. It also discovered that “one entity that provided a large number of pre-orders does not appear to have the resources to complete large purchases of trucks,” and that other companies on the list “provided commitments that appear too vague or infirm to be...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Novavax says its COVID-19 vaccine is 90 percent effective </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HgCDwP"&gt;The two-shot COVID-19 vaccine made by Novavax is 90 percent effective against the disease, the company &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-90-overall-efficacy-and"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8AeAZr"&gt;The Novavax shots are a different type of vaccine than the ones already available: it’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons"&gt;protein-based vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that directly delivers bits of the coronavirus spike protein, which the body then makes antibodies against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCHQSc"&gt;Novavax tested its vaccine in 29,960 people across the US and Mexico who were randomly assigned to get either the vaccine or a placebo injection. There were 77 cases of COVID-19 in the study: 14 in people who’d received the vaccine, and 63 in the group that got a placebo. All 14 cases in the vaccine group were mild. In the placebo group, ten cases were moderate and four were severe, showing the shots...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go creator Niantic is making a Transformers game</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1wPQlY"&gt;Niantic is expanding from cute critters to giant robots. Today, the game developer announced its next project: a location-based augmented reality game called &lt;em&gt;Transformers: Heavy Metal&lt;/em&gt;. The game is expected to launch globally this year, with a soft launch in select countries “soon.” Niantic says that it has partnered with Seattle-based studio Very Very Spaceship, which will be leading development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsnYit"&gt;You might be wondering just how towering transforming robots will translate to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;-style gameplay. Here’s the basic description from Niantic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9kbMBM"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Transformers: Heavy Metal&lt;/em&gt;, players will join the Guardian Network, a group of humans who have banded together with the Autobots in a war against the Decepticons. As a Guardian, players will...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Future Apple Watches could feature blood glucose and body temperature sensors</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h8ahct"&gt;This year’s Apple Watch could feature an improved screen and updated ultra-wideband support, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, but more substantial improvements like temperature and blood glucose monitoring will not appear until later models. The company is also reportedly planning a successor to last year’s more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a new extreme sports-focused model, due for release in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBxl32"&gt;The improvements coming to this year’s model, which will almost certainly be called the Series 7, appear to be small. Its display bezels are said to be thinner, and a new lamination  technique could reduce the distance between the display and the front cover. The watch’s ultra-wideband support could also be improved after getting its Apple...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s premium G1 OLED now comes with a 5-year warranty in the US and UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pU-sbNp7Kjiwl0jQpwSNgkvLaK4=/4x0:1597x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448531/large01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG is now offering a 5-year warranty for its G1 OLED.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bu8FhG"&gt;LG is offering an extended 5-year warranty on its 4K G1 OLED in the US, covering any problems that develop with its panel after the standard one-year warranty. In the UK &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fuk%2Foled-tvs%2F2021%2Foled-warranty&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F14%2F22532894%2Flg-5-year-warranty-g1-oled-z1-4k-8k-usa-panel-failure-burn-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; the extended warranty also applies to its Z1 8K OLED. It’s unclear in how many other countries LG is offering the extended warranty, and the company did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6jAqo"&gt;The extended warranty appears to be an attempt to upsell customers from LG’s popular lower-end sets like the C1 to its more premium G1 model. But it should also allay any fears that the new brighter Evo OLED panel LG is using in the G1 won’t last as long as its previous OLED panels. Or, as LG said in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/lg-oled-tvs-now-come-with-a-five-year-warranty-but-not-all-of-them"&gt;given to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “The warranty is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Workspace and Google Chat are officially available to everybody</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n1st3n"&gt;Google is announcing some changes to its Workspace suite of apps and services today, including availability for anybody who has a Google account. Google says that there are over three billion users of its Workspace apps — though it’s probably a safe bet that Gmail accounts for a healthy chunk of that userbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oeUWT"&gt;A lot of people will soon have the option to switch over to Google’s more modern system for Gmail, Docs, and Chat. All of them can be integrated in a single tab more easily, for example with chats sliding over to the left to reveal a shared spreadsheet. It’s also related to the company’s new “smart canvas” push, which is also designed to interlink its various apps via “smart chips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYHrm5"&gt;To get started, Google is now officially offering...&lt;/p&gt;
