    <title>Twitter to work with AP and Reuters to provide more context around disputed topics</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="toli3h"&gt;Twitter is working with news agencies the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;to more proactively combat misinformation on its platform, the &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/bringing-more-reliable-context-to-conversations-on-twitter"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The platform’s internal teams already work to explain and add context to Twitter content, but it says the two news agencies will help provide more authoritative information, especially when facts are in dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meIFu2"&gt;In particular, Twitter says it wants to be more proactive about providing accurate information on topics as they develop, before misinformation emerges. “Rather than waiting until something goes viral, Twitter will contextualize developing discourse at pace with or in anticipation of the public conversation,” the platform says. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; will also...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP is flooding the zone with seven new gaming monitors</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vb6p4B"&gt;HP has gone on a tear and announced seven new gaming monitors in its X lineup, featuring a range of sizes, panel types, and resolutions, as well as some that are curved or flat-screened. It seems like HP is aiming to deliver a flurry of options that have a high refresh rate, low response time, competent design, and crucially, competitive prices. HP is staggering this launch over the next few months, with availability starting now for some of its monitors and continuing through October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZaRHW"&gt;To being with, there’s HP’s X27, which is available now and comes in a 1080p version for $259.99 or a 1440p variant called the X27q that costs $339.99. Both are IPS panels with a 165Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s drone delivery program ‘one gigantic oversell,’ says report into UK operation</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s delivery drones have gone through many iterations, including the design above. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K1f7IU"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into Amazon’s drone delivery program in the UK says the operation has lost over 100 employees, with insiders saying the project is “collapsing inwards.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4P7k9o"&gt;Citing testimony from former employees, &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;describes a culture of managerial dysfunction and overwork. In February 2020, for example, Amazon reportedly shut down a team of dozens in the UK dedicated to analyzing drone footage to identify humans and animals, only to re-open the unit months later. Other stories cited in the report include the fast turnover of senior staff, an employee drinking beer at their desk in the morning, and another “pinning down the ‘approve’ button on their computer so that all the frames of footage were being approved irrelevant of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi overtakes Samsung to take top spot in European phone shipments in Q2 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LPLZPwxGXWuTO09gw8-Cz5XZ6Q8=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670808/DSCF7531.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GDnNl2"&gt;Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is continuing to post solid growth. After overtaking Apple as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22579771/worldwide-smartphone-market-share-ranking-q2-2022-canalys-xiaomi-apple-samsung"&gt;number two smartphone vendor in the world&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2021, it’s now become the top seller in Europe for the first time, according to &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210802005339/en/Strategy-Analytics-Xiaomi-Captures-Top-Position-in-European-Smartphone-Shipments-for-the-First-Time-in-Q2-2021-%C2%A0"&gt;new figures from Strategy Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fn4FXW"&gt;Xiaomi overtook Samsung to take the top spot in Europe, with 12.7 million phones shipped in Q2, up 67.1 percent year-on-year. Samsung’s shipments fell 7 precent in that same period to 12 million units, though the Korean company remains the world’s biggest phone vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGCRE1"&gt;Overall smartphone shipments in Europe increased in 2021 thanks to post-COVID recovery, say Strategy Analytics’ researchers, with Apple also showing decent growth. The iPhone maker was up 15.7...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will give you a whole $10 for your palm print</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon One identifies unique patterns in your palm to confirm payments in Amazon stores. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5X5L15"&gt;Amazon is offering $10 in credit if you enroll your biometric data in the company’s palm print recognition system, Amazon One. The promotion, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;says people must connect their palm print to their Amazon account to claim the reward, though it’s not clear exactly where it’s available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZyqLB"&gt;Amazon launched Amazon One in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493094/amazon-one-palm-recognition-hand-payments-amazon-go-store"&gt;September last year&lt;/a&gt;, presenting it as an easy way to pay in the company’s stores, as well as a future identity service to be used by other venues and businesses. Users simply position their hand over the company’s scanners, which recognize their unique palm print based on its patterns of lines, ridges, and veins. This information can be used to verify payments in stores, but also in lieu of entrance tickets...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This $55 Amazon Smart Soap Dispenser is dumb as dirt</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xunZyB"&gt;Not &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; needs Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Case in point is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GWRT223?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s new Smart Soap Dispenser&lt;/a&gt;, the latest let’s-stick-a-chip-in-it replacement for ordinary objects. And because it’s made by Amazon, it’s design to be paired with an Echo speaker to run Alexa routines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0sWMC"&gt;Why? Well, according to Amazon, it’s to “automatically play songs, jokes, and more when you wash.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7HgBu"&gt;The 12oz liquid soap dispenser is fitted with 2.4GHz (only) 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi and features an LED timer around the top that reminds you to keep scrubbing until the CDC-recommended minimum wash time of 20 seconds has elapsed. The rechargeable battery is said to last three months on a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iRFdth"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A feature available on touchless soap dispensers that cost a lot less&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates have officially divorced</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0I0X1b"&gt;Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates filed for divorce on May 3rd after 27 years of marriage. Now, three months later, the separation of one of the world’s richest, most powerful couples has been finalized by a judge in King County, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPN50M"&gt;Court records show that neither party will change their name or receive “spousal support,” report &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/02/tech/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-finalized"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-02/bill-gates-and-melinda-french-gates-divorce-becomes-official?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but exactly how the Gates’ immense fortune will be divided is unclear. Washington is a community property state, which means all assets accumulated during a marriage must be divided equally in the event of a divorce. But the Gates’ split is being carried out under the aegis of a separation contract, details of which are unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X4RTvO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bill Gates is currently the fourth richest man in the...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Spotify is testing a less restrictive ad-supported tier costing $0.99 a month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_aM2-y-aYoWbYTAmN0jOB-eLSps=/1x0:1096x730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670663/lede.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ux6RY7"&gt;Spotify Plus is a new low-cost subscription tier being piloted by the streaming service which combines elements of its existing free and premium tiers. The plan still features ads like Spotify’s free tier, but it doesn’t impose any limits on the number of tracks you can skip per hour. Users are also free to pick which specific songs they want to listen to, rather than mostly being limited to shuffling within albums and playlists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv3HtV"&gt;At least one user has seen Spotify Plus being advertised at $0.99 a month (a tenth of the cost of its standard $9.99 premium tier), but it’s understood that Spotify’s test involves offering the new plan randomly at a variety of price points to gauge user interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9H3f2T"&gt;Spotify’s free tier has existed in its current...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — all of which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release in the fall — and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to...&lt;/p&gt;
