    <title>Intel and Samsung’s new demo shows how blisteringly fast a PCIe 5.0 SSD setup will be</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GWroGG"&gt;PCIe 5.0 SSDs have already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851422/samsung-adata-pcie-5-0-ssd-ces-speed-date"&gt;started to get announced&lt;/a&gt; ahead of CES 2022, with Samsung and Adata teasing early hardware that supports the new standard. But it’s not just theoretical: Intel has released a new demo video showing off Samsung’s new PM1743 PCIe NVMe SSD in action (together with Intel’s Core i9-12900K CPU, of course) to hit data speeds over 13GB/s in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YH3LX7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Perks of the job! Was going to save this demo for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2022?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CES2022&lt;/a&gt; but with that off the table, why not just share it with everyone right now?! Here’s a 12th Gen ⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@intel&lt;/a&gt;⁩ Core i9-12900K system paired with a new ⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Samsung?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Samsung&lt;/a&gt;⁩ PM1743 PCIe 5.0 SSD getting over 13GB/s!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/oyL08KzDtV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oyL08KzDtV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Shrout (@ryanshrout) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryanshrout/status/1476609814402945029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Plans to capture CO2 from coal plants wasted federal dollars, watchdog says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Operations Inside The NRG Energy Inc. Coal Power Plant" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7W9uT-1pNS9Aszswgz-VWra69U=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331211/643866618.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Water vapor rises from the NRG Energy Inc. WA Parish generating station in Thompsons, Texas, U.S., on Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017. The plant was home to the Petra Nova Carbon Capture Project, until it shut down in 2021 because of high costs.&amp;nbsp; | Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="36YVlb"&gt;The Biden administration wants to shove more money into projects that are supposed to capture CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial facilities before they can escape and heat up the planet. But carbon capture technologies that the Department of Energy has already supported in the name of tackling climate change have mostly fallen flat, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105111"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the watchdog Government Accountability Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hO15jY"&gt;About $1.1 billion has flowed from the Department of Energy to carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration projects since 2009. Had they panned out, nine coal plants and industrial facilities would have been outfitted with devices that scrub most of the CO2 out of their emissions. Once captured, the CO2 can be sent...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two NFT copycats are fighting over which is the real fake Bored Ape Yacht Club</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PHAYC leftward-facing Bored Ape Yacht Club avatars" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p_uWUfl1t3tugia26lqE2D3MTug=/0x0:1352x901/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331194/Screenshot_2021_12_30_140753.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4cnebo"&gt;A pair of non-fungible token projects are testing the boundary between plagiarism and parody. Digital marketplace OpenSea has banned the PHAYC and Phunky Ape Yacht Club (or PAYC) collections, both of which are based on the same gimmick: selling NFTs with mirrored but otherwise identical versions of high-priced Bored Ape Yacht Club avatars. Now the dueling projects are selling their apes while dodging bans from other marketplaces, becoming the latest example of how the NFT world handles copied art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvitS4"&gt;Bored Ape Yacht Club (or BAYC) NFTs are some of the most expensive crypto art assets — they recently overtook CryptoPunks as the &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/89060/bored-ape-yacht-club-nfts-flip-cryptopunks-floor-price-in-ethereum"&gt;highest-priced NFT avatars&lt;/a&gt; with the cheapest available ape selling for $217,000. Like other avatars, though,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW, IBM, Panasonic, and Mercedes to skip planned in-person events at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Attendees walk through the Las Vegas Convention Center January 10, 2020 on the final day of the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show (CES)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMGvZxqSubxFb3b2WJ-BhDTYvAk=/5x0:4996x3327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330060/1192992530.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nb0HqF"&gt;BMW has announced it will no longer be showing up in person for media events at CES 2022 — the giant electronics show that’s typically held each January in Las Vegas, attracting well over 100,000 attendees per year from around the world. It’s the latest company to at least partially bail on the show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;following announcements from Intel, AMD, GM, Google, T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta,&lt;/a&gt; Waymo, and a large number of tech publications, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as COVID cases rise in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="EggSjj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reports indicated BMW will show a car with color-changing paint and a “Theater Screen” for in-car cinematic experiences&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PPzBBN"&gt;A statement from BMW says, “Out of an abundance of caution, BMW will move all planned media activities at CES to a fully online program from Germany...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google pulls back the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro December update to fix dropped calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xik8yFqTkuaY5qhOedcK19CeChI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331126/akrales_211020_4802_0082.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUeh6c"&gt;The rollout of the first major update for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; has been slow and plagued by reports of problems. Now the company says it paused releasing the December 2021 update to investigate reports of calls dropping and disconnecting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="voe159"&gt;The news arrived &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143183382/december-2021-update-paused?hl=en"&gt;in a post on the Google Support forums&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/12/30/google-confirms-pixel-6-december-update-pause/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Droid-Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that says a new version with all the previously announced features and a fix for the disconnection issue should be ready by late January. If you’re not having any problems, then you can keep using the new software for now, but for those afflicted by the connection issues, Google only suggests reverting and factory resetting your device as an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="poCwHS"&gt;Hey Pixel Community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGpYCX"&gt;The Pixel team paused the December software...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wondercise Studio wants to replace Zoom for connected fitness classes</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FHtKcJ"&gt;At CES 2022, Wondercise is looking to shake up connected fitness with a series of intriguing launches, including a new stationary bike, TV app, and trackers. However, the Taiwanese company’s most intriguing launch is Wondercise Studio — a social media platform for fitness that lets anyone livestream their own class, complete with real-time metrics and performance feedback from fitness trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjpifC"&gt;Wondercise describes Studio as a “social media platform with a fitness focus,” but the reality is it’s more of a mish-mash of every bit of fitness tech currently out there. Users can voice and video chat with each other during livestreamed classes. Anyone can host their own class, and users also “follow” other users or instructors as you would on...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EMp8N7"&gt;Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holidays may have come and gone, but there are still some great discounts available on Apple’s AirPods. In fact, we’ve actually been seeing some deals that are even better than they were during the recent shopping holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SziSp1"&gt;Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in October and unveiled its new AirPods lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. Even better, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen AirPods,...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ojOKDk"&gt;On Wednesday, New York City announced it has &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dcas/news/21-020/nyc-taking-another-step-towards-achieving-all-electric-municipal-fleet"&gt;ordered 184 fully electric Ford Mustang Mach-Es&lt;/a&gt; for use by law enforcement and emergency response workers. The vehicles are set to be delivered by June 2022, as part of an $11.5 million contract that will remain in place for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uudz0v"&gt;The city said the Mach-Es would be used by the New York Police Department, New York City’s Sheriff’s Office, the Department of Correction, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Environmental Protection, and other emergency management and response departments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0m7YJ"&gt;New York City plans to buy over 1,250 electric vehicles in 2022, transitioning all law enforcement vehicles to electric ones by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon has PS5 consoles in stock again (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDNL5b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 30th, 11:48AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; And it appears that due to an astounding lack of defenses against bots, Amazon is already sold out, again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1BIer"&gt;Sony’s latest gaming console, the PlayStation 5, is one of many gaming gadgets that are hard to find in stock right now due to mostly online-only sales. If you are trying to get your hands on one, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09DFCB66S/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has PS5 consoles in stock right now&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5hDPX"&gt;The consoles are only available for Amazon Prime subscribers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;continuing a trend of retailers restricting access to consoles for paying subscribers only&lt;/a&gt;. If you can’t add it to your cart, keep trying — occasionally the sites restock over a period of a few minutes. We will update this post once Amazon confirms it’s out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="pxRWfX"&gt;I am the very person who should care about my appearance on Zoom calls. I don’t mean the state of my hair or appearance of hormonal acne on my face. I’m talking image quality. Focal length. &lt;em&gt;Bokeh. &lt;/em&gt;I have written about and reviewed cameras and smartphones for over a decade. I use videoconferencing platforms throughout my work day. I own a nice camera that I could connect to my laptop and use for Zoom meetings. But I won’t, and I simply do not care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekE4Xe"&gt;I know how much more flattering a longer focal length would be than my MacBook Air’s built-in wide-angle lens. I have the tools, the knowledge, and the power to employ a softly blurred background behind me. If I did, maybe I’d command more respect in meetings. My colleagues might scroll through...&lt;/p&gt;
