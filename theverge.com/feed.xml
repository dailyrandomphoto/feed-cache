    <title>Polaris teases an all-electric Ranger, first in its collaboration with Zero Motorcycles </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zRD1WN"&gt;The first electric power sports vehicle to emerge from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21473587/polaris-zero-motorcycles-electric-ev-off-road-vehicle-snowmobiles"&gt;new collaboration between Polaris and Zero Motorcycles&lt;/a&gt; will be a battery-powered Ranger utility side-by-side. The companies didn’t provide any details about the vehicle’s range, battery pack, or price, but they did say that production on the new UTV (or utility terrain vehicle) was expected to start in December 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKHj2u"&gt;Ranger is the number one-selling brand in the Minnesota-based Polaris’ lineup of utility vehicles. More details are forthcoming, a spokesperson said, but the goal is to “build a better Ranger with more torque, more power, more hauling, the capabilities needed to give customers the advantage. Electric allows Polaris to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lime says it will spend $50 million on a huge e-bike expansion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KcMg8n9_69TIhJNXXxYMOUBpuCs=/0x514:7713x5656/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68889668/Lime_feb2020_reamer013_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7FJVGu"&gt;Lime is getting back to its roots. The scooter company formerly known as LimeBike says it will invest $50 million to grow its shared electric bicycle network, including adding a new model of bike and doubling the number of cities in which it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJSCdr"&gt;Lime got its start with shared bikes, only to quickly pivot after Bird first introduced the concept of dockless electric scooters in 2017. The company dropped the “bike” from its name and started phasing out its bikes in 2019. But the following year, Lime acquired bike-share company Jump from Uber, and suddenly, bikes were back on the menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oD4irY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;50 new cities by the start of 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NIRzaN"&gt;Now, the company is doubling down on shared electric bikes, with plans to launch in “a dozen” new cities in North...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2021 Golden Globes: Netflix dominates the night, Nomadland takes top honor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="78th Annual Golden Globe® Awards: Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1gD3ZvSOje4nPciYZVOu5P9mIY=/0x0:5103x3402/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68889573/1304637142.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Hollywood Foreign Press Association&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hPm2zo"&gt;In a year of ongoing movie delays and stalled television productions, it’s no surprise that this year’s Golden Globes winners were dominated by streaming services — in particular, Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZop4y"&gt;However, before getting into the winners of the evening, it’s impossible to ignore that this year’s Golden Globes were surrounded by a number of important controversies. Last week the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; published an &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021-who-are-the-members"&gt;in-depth feature investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the questionable ethics involving all 87 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the voting body that selects Golden Globe winners every year. Some members were flown to Paris and put up in expensive hotels on Netflix’s dollar for on-set visits to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498727/emily-in-paris-review-darren-star-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emily in Paris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was nominated for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cybersecurity firm says social media bots hyped GameStop during trading frenzy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cauyjDHhe5MNV7eHWFEpxCcaWa0=/0x0:4015x2677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68888800/gamestop_stock_sean_hollister.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="989dBd"&gt;A cybersecurity firm found that bots were promoting GameStop stock on social media before and after the stock’s frenzied rise last month, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-gamestop-robots-idUSKBN2AQ2BH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; Massachusetts-based PiiQ Media says social media bots promoted Dogecoin, GameStop, and other “meme” stocks in posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. The firm estimated that tens of thousands of bots participated, but it’s still unclear how much influence they had or didn’t have on the rise and fall of GME and other stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADCGcc"&gt;Shares in GME skyrocketed in January as Reddit users on r/wallstreetbets rallied around the stock in an attempt to squeeze hedge funds that had bet against the video game company. PiiQ told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; it detected “patterns of artificial behavior” in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Minneapolis hiring social media influencers for former police officers’ trials</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MINNEAPOLIS, MN - OCTOBER 14: Flameless candles are illuminated" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4to7671hU4QeJLvoWn8eVEBvLNY=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68888606/1229485925.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;George Floyd died in police custody in May 2020 | Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d0JiiN"&gt;Minneapolis is hiring social media influencers to share “city-generated and approved messages” during the trials of four former city police officers charged in the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, according to the &lt;a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/02/26/amid-massive-security-presence-minneapolis-is-turning-to-grassroots-to-keep-the-peace/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minnesota Reformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Minneapolis &lt;a href="https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/RCA/7568"&gt;city council approved the plan&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, which calls for six influencers to be paid about $2,000 each to spread the city’s messages with Black, Native American, Hmong, and Latino communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fr4XUX"&gt;The goal is to “address/dispel incorrect information” by using “trusted messengers,” part of a program the city refers to as its Joint Information System to share “timely and relevant information” with the public during the trials. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New AI ‘Deep Nostalgia’ brings old photos, including very old ones, to life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xjrKwNiPRigKH1YKq5BTtmYHYHo=/161x0:869x472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68888360/my_heritage_photo.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;MyHeritage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2c9DQO"&gt;An AI-powered service called Deep Nostalgia that animates still photos has become the main character on Twitter this fine Sunday, as people try to create the creepiest fake “video” possible, apparently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQHFum"&gt;The Deep Nostalgia service, offered by online genealogy company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.myheritage.com%2Fdeep-nostalgia&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F28%2F22306097%2Fai-brings-still-photos-life-meme-twitter-geneaology-myheritage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MyHeritage&lt;/a&gt;, uses AI licensed from D-ID to create the effect that a still photo is moving. It’s kinda like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9296829/apple-live-photos-feature-iphone-6s"&gt;iOS Live Photos feature&lt;/a&gt;, which adds a few seconds of video to help smartphone photographers find the best shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIprDM"&gt;But Deep Nostalgia can take photos from any camera and bring them to “life.” The program uses pre-recorded driver videos of facial movements and applies the one that works best for the still photo in question. Its intended purpose is to allow you to upload...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="FuzJDE"&gt;Awards season in Hollywood begins Sunday, February 28th, with the 78th Golden Globe Awards, hosted by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. The Golden Globes, usually considered a harbinger of who may take home awards at other shows like the Oscars, will look a bit different this year thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. The hosts and presenters will be in different locations in the US and around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZ0iX5"&gt;Streaming services have finally come into their own at the Globes, with Netflix leading the pack of with 20 total nominations for its television shows; Hulu has six total nominations, Apple TV Plus has two, and Disney Plus has one. In the motion picture categories (the Globes honor films and TV shows), Netflix leads the way with 22...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon support says you should turn off 5G to save your phone’s battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Verizon Communications logo seen displayed on a smartphone with the 5G inscription background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYLHsvbhArPFRlGPayxGnme_6xc=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68887873/1227822210.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwJAmv"&gt;Despite its relentless promotion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22194419/5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide"&gt;5G phones&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that it spent more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;$45 billion bidding&lt;/a&gt; on a new faster spectrum, Verizon support now is advising people on Twitter to turn off their phones’ 5G access to preserve battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1vDDR"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1366055566347546635?s=20"&gt;Sunday morning tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon support helpfully suggested that “one way to help conserve battery life is to turn on LTE” if users found their batteries were “draining faster than normal.” That step would, of course, turn off 5G in a phone that has it available. It’s also worth pointing out that you don’t actually “turn on LTE” when doing this step — LTE is always enabled as a fallback for the 5G network. But Verizon is obviously being cautious so as not to actually tell its customers to “turn...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s shiny red Galaxy Chromebook 2 is now available at Best Buy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OO3OOg"&gt;Samsung’s latest Chrome OS laptop, the Galaxy Chromebook 2, is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733322550682053658" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now available for purchase at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The Chromebook 2 was first announced at CES in January and features a new QLED display, 360-degree hinge, and a striking red paint job. It starts at $549.99 for a Celeron model and goes up to $699.99 for a Core i3 version, putting it at the higher end of Chromebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfKjrF"&gt;That price is the most significant thing about the Chromebook 2 because it’s considerably less than the Galaxy Chromebook that debuted a year ago. The older Chromebook had an 4K OLED screen and came with a stylus — neither of which you’ll fine with the new model — but it also cost just under $1,000 when it came out. In our review, we found despite the gorgeous screen and...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="JFJCzT"&gt;The teaser video for Q: &lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming documentary series from HBO about the QAnon conspiracy movement has a lot of deplatforming experts concerned; it looks more like a preview for a spy thriller than a careful examination of the umbrella group of conspiracy theories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="11uYj7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sA756Y"&gt;The breathless tone might be effective at building hype, but it has many disinformation experts concerned. Ben Collins, one of the leading journalists covering online radicalization, tweeted that the trailer was “being marketed in a way that could recruit more people.” Promoted by HBO as a series that “charts a labyrinthine journey to unmask the mastermind behind QAnon,” critics pointed out that the trailer felt a lot like “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/soundmigration/status/1365393034351943680"&gt;a recruitment video for Q.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
