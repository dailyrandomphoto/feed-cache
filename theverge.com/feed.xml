    <title>The LAPD built collecting social media info into its interview process for civilians</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zANvuB"&gt;The Los Angeles Police Department asked officers to gather social media information as a standard part of their interviews with civilians, whether or not the people were implicated in a crime. The practice, revealed in public records &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/lapd-documents-reveal-use-social-media-monitoring-tools"&gt;obtained by the Brennan Center for Justice&lt;/a&gt;, is part of a larger LAPD social media monitoring strategy — one that’s similar to other US police department policies but may go beyond them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JigbTU"&gt;As the Brennan Center notes, &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/D.%20Beck%20FI%20Memo%202015.pdf"&gt;a 2015 memo&lt;/a&gt; from LAPD Police Chief Charlie Beck told the department that “similar to a nickname or an alias, a person’s online persona or identity used for social media and communication can be highly beneficial to investigations and possibly even future outreach programs.” Beck said that officers...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund pledges $150 million to climate justice groups</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v96T8M"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ $10 billion Earth Fund just doled out millions more in funding to groups fighting off climate change. This time, a lot of the cash is going to groups that advocate for communities of color and low-income neighborhoods, which often face the first and worst effects of climate change and fossil fuel pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmBMCI"&gt;The fund &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-grants-from-the-bezos-earth-fund-emphasize-climate-justice-pro-jobs-climate-action-and-innovation-in-decarbonization-301370952.html?tc=eml_cleartime"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a total of $203.7 million in new grants today. Of that, more than $53 million will go toward communications on climate change and efforts to cut emissions from businesses. Another $20 million will go to groups focused on climate justice — a movement to stop climate change from taking a disproportionate toll on already marginalized communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mbgybv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A movement to stop climate change from taking a...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id="0b7sTV"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;lots of expectations for a new Series 7 model&lt;/a&gt; ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event on September 14th&lt;/a&gt;, however, the new editions might bring larger sizes in addition to higher price points than we often see with the current models. Each Apple Watch offers ample functionality, and has seen more than its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>NASA sets new date for James Webb Space Telescope launch</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JxScVZ"&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope, humanity’s next big space-bound eye on the cosmos, has a new launch date of December 18th, NASA announced on Wednesday. It’s the latest among dozens of other delays for a telescope that was originally planned to go to space as early as 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HK0luF"&gt;The $8.8 billion observatory, named after NASA’s second administrator, is a tennis court-sized successor to NASA’s famed Hubble telescope. Its 18 hexagonal gold-plated mirrors will allow the spacecraft to view distant planets and the far reaches of the universe with a level of detail that far surpasses Hubble’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeY4hp"&gt;Astronomers have been looking forward to the telescope’s launch for years, but its development has been set back by years of delays, development...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Whoop’s new fitness tracker is better thanks to a battery breakthrough</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xbxLslNmTUuEVtEf83IsE90XYg=/189x0:2211x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831427/WHOOP_SILA_2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1TIDKy"&gt;Fitness company Whoop has a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/introducing-whoop-4-0-and-whoop-body-featuring-any-wear-technology-301371503.html"&gt;new tracker&lt;/a&gt; that squishes five LEDs, four photodiodes, a pulse oximeter, skin temperature sensor, and more into a package that is 33 percent smaller than its predecessor — all while still offering five days of battery life. But a particular change to the tracker’s battery chemistry is one of the biggest reasons Whoop was able to do all this in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzdMa6"&gt;The change was pioneered by a Silicon Valley company called Sila Nanotechnologies, which was co-founded in 2011 by Gene Berdichevsky, one of Tesla’s earliest employees. And it’s one that, if it scales up, could help break some of the biggest limitations currently facing lithium-ion technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXy9i0"&gt;On paper, it’s a simple change: the battery’s anode is now...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase says SEC threatened lawsuit over Lend feature</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFYqWA"&gt;Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase seems to have some issues with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over a planned feature that lets people lend cryptocurrency through its platform. &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009"&gt;In a Medium post&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, Coinbase’s chief legal officer wrote that the regulatory agency threatened to sue the company if it launched the feature. Coinbase’s CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439291715358721?s=20"&gt;posted a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday evening saying that the SEC wasn’t clear about what it wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSmRbh"&gt;According to Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, the company told the SEC about its new Lend feature as a courtesy but didn’t anticipate pushback, based on his impression that similar features exist on other platforms. However, according to Armstrong, the SEC informed the company that the lend...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="EfEGdr"&gt;As cool as videoconferencing hardware can look, it’s often exorbitantly expensive — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661653/series-one-desk-27-google-meet-laptop-monitor"&gt;the $2,000 Series One Desk 27&lt;/a&gt; for Google Meet being a perfect example.

&lt;p id="KDzqjH"&gt;The Rayz Rally Pro comes in a gray-tone fabric-covered body that looks a bit like Google’s smart speakers but with a phone dock carveout.

    <title>Microsoft’s new Xbox controller firmware lets you quickly switch between paired devices</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="neWzXy"&gt;Microsoft is starting to test a new firmware update for existing Xbox One, Xbox Elite 2, and Xbox Adaptive Controllers today that will bring some important improvements to existing hardware. The biggest addition is the ability to quickly switch between paired devices on an Xbox controller, and Microsoft is also adding Dynamic Latency Input (DLI) to improve input latency on older controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkXdzY"&gt;This new firmware update includes Bluetooth Low Energy support for compatible controllers. Most of Microsoft’s existing Xbox One controllers include Bluetooth support for use on smartphones or PCs, but the controllers connect to Xbox consoles through the Xbox Wireless protocol. This new firmware will now make it easier to switch between the two,...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJnRvD"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price and larger size.&lt;/p&gt;
