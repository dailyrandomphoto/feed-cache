    <title>You can now queue to purchase a PS5 at Sony</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InjNmw"&gt;If you’re still trying to get your hands on a PlayStation 5, lining up at Sony’s digital storefront is one of the more reliable ways to snag Sony’s next-gen console. Sony &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;has reopened the digital queue on its direct store&lt;/a&gt; to place orders for the $500 &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;disc-based PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the $400 &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqKvo7"&gt;Provided you’ve already &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/ps5"&gt;registered&lt;/a&gt; and logged into your PlayStation account, you should be able to line up once you’ve hit the landing page. Once you’ve entered the queue, you’ll be given an ETA of when you’ll be able to check out and, once that timer hits zero, it's all systems go. It's no secret that these consoles go quick and getting into the queue doesn’t necessarily guarantee a console, but Sony’s direct store...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals at Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Walmart DTD 555" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J1sVDLMyFhHiEXvLMs9mRbpKOfk=/2x0:554x368/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154121/walmart555.1419973090.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart is already discounting the AirPods Pro, Google Nest Mini, and a host of other products ahead of Black Friday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AtjyQ3"&gt;As Black Friday approaches, several retailers are already offering significant discounts — and Walmart is no exception. Right now, the retail giant is dropping early Black Friday deals on everything from the AirPods Pro to the most popular TVs and streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uTIwf"&gt;We’ve featured a few of these items in our guide to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, however, the list below highlights all of the best sales Walmart is offering across several categories rather than just a few. It’s perfect, then, for anybody who plans on shopping primarily at Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OVcC4"&gt;The store will continue to publish more deals as we get closer to the big day, with many of the better deals going live on November 22nd, according to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fstore%2F3520-secaucus-nj%2Fweekly-ads&amp;amp;subid1=VergeWalmartBFDeals111721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a recent online circular&lt;/a&gt;.

The company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement, most of which will be used to reimburse drivers who made deliveries in the city between 2016 and 2020, before a new state law covering gig workers took effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ICKaI"&gt;California’s gig workers law, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;voters approved in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; as ballot measure Proposition 22, allows companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash to treat workers as independent contractors, not employees. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/21/22635286/judge-rules-california-prop-22-gig-workers-law-unconstitutional"&gt;judge ruled in August&lt;/a&gt; that the law was unconstitutional, but it remains in effect pending...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tile is selling its Bluetooth tracking business to Life360 for $205 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple, Tile, and Samsung all offer smart Bluetooth trackers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xN5MSY7SpMUzSz28Pw_InmyY5jg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180433/ajohnson_210702_4659_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Me6qU1"&gt;Tile popularized marking items and tracking them from your phone with its small Bluetooth tags, but is suddenly facing more competition from giants like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung. Now the company that started out of an incubator &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/tile-grabs-2-6m-via-selfstarter-for-its-lost-property-finding-bluetooth-tags-plus-app/"&gt;and crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/life360-to-acquire-tile-creating-the-world-leader-in-finding-and-location-solutions-301430364.html"&gt;has announced it will be acquired by Life360&lt;/a&gt;, which calls itself a “leading family safety platform.” The deal is valued at $205 million and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUtvVv"&gt;Tile has developed its product line over the years with a variety of different trackers, as well as partnerships with other companies to use its technology. It also has a subscription service, Tile Premium, with extra features, battery replacements, and even offers insurance against...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC approves $6 billion Verizon-Tracfone acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ib4gJG"&gt;On Monday, the Federal Communications Commission voted to approve Verizon Wireless’ purchase of Tracfone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435980/verizon-tracfone-acquisition-prepaid-phones-budget"&gt;in a deal worth more than $6 billion&lt;/a&gt;, positioning Verizon to become one of the largest prepaid service providers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQJqTB"&gt;Tracfone is the largest reseller of wireless devices in the US and maintains over 20 million subscribers with more than 90,000 retail locations. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621905/verizon-tracfone-merger-lifeline-fcc-public-interest"&gt;Verizon’s Tracfone acquisition&lt;/a&gt; combines the largest mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) with the largest wireless provider in the country. When Verizon first proposed the deal last September, the company said that the acquisition would bolster Tracfone’s networks while making low-income wireless services more competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wN31HY"&gt;“After rigorous review, the Commission found...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Prime Gaming is giving away EA games over the next few months</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LIGPO3"&gt;Amazon and EA will be &lt;a href="https://primegaming.blog/tis-the-season-for-even-more-new-free-games-and-in-game-content-for-prime-gaming-members-9fd509131336"&gt;giving away free PC games&lt;/a&gt; and content through Amazon’s Prime Gaming program for the next few months, so it may be time to &lt;a href="http://gaming.amazon.com/"&gt;check in on the gaming service&lt;/a&gt; if you’ve forgotten that it comes included with Prime. This month, Prime subscribers will be able to get a free Origin code for the surprisingly decent remaster of 2010’s &lt;em&gt;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit,&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon says that four more of EA’s “most popular titles” will be coming in 2022 (though given the starting game, it may be worth keeping your expectations in check).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aCQrd"&gt;If it’s still November when you’re reading this, you &lt;a href="https://primegaming.blog/spend-the-holiday-season-gaming-with-family-and-friends-with-new-free-games-and-content-from-prime-b180be31c66e"&gt;can also snag&lt;/a&gt; EA’s &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age Inquisition&lt;/em&gt; for free from Prime Gaming. Amazon’s partnership with EA also includes skins for games like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart is now delivering diapers and food by drone (if you live close to this Arkansas store)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WWXWAd"&gt;Just last week, Walmart made headlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22786919/walmart-zipline-drone-delivery-commercial-service-arkansas"&gt;by launching its first commercial US drone delivery service&lt;/a&gt; within a 50-mile radius of Pea Ridge, Arkansas — dropping parachute-laden packages from an autonomous Zipline plane to a “hand-selected group of recipients.” Now, it’s already expanding those drone deliveries in another, small way: customers who live in Farmington, Arkansas, &lt;a href="https://droneupdelivery.com/"&gt;can now order small items&lt;/a&gt; like cans of tuna, baby supplies, and paper plates starting today. That’s &lt;a href="https://www.droneup.com/2021/11/22/walmart-droneup-announce-first-multi-site-drone-delivery-operation/"&gt;thanks to a partnership with DroneUp&lt;/a&gt;, which will also provide drone delivery stations in Rogers, AR and Bentonville, AR “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emZW8R"&gt;While it’s kind of exciting for drone delivery watchers, you should know that it’s also very much baby steps. DroneUp’s...&lt;/p&gt;
