    <title>Foxconn reveals three ‘Foxtron’-branded electric vehicle prototypes</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Foxtron Model E sedan.&lt;/em&gt; | Images: Foxconn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jifjLR"&gt;iPhone assembler Foxconn has &lt;a href="https://www.foxconn.com/en-us/press-center/press-releases/latest-news/694"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; three prototype electric vehicles as part of its effort to become a major player in the automotive industry. The Taiwanese conglomerate showed off an SUV it calls the Model C, a sedan it calls the Model E, and a bus dubbed the Model T, all under a new “Foxtron” branding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ssilst"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/article/20140609/OEM02/306099974/why-ford-just-said-no-when-musk-tried-to-put-the-e-in-sex"&gt;Ford may take issue with the naming convention&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t seem that Foxconn plans to make these specific vehicles itself. Rather, it wants them to be seen as reference designs, examples of the types of vehicles that can be built on the EV platform it’s been developing, and advertisements for the automotive components and software it plans to sell. In fact, Foxconn didn’t even build the prototypes — the were made by Taiwanese...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces 16-inch MacBook Pro with new ports and design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q3n76A8lOcCeTxI7UKOuQ0M1CsQ=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012026/lcimg_982af7b3_d14a_4a82_8073_a94b6e73fdd5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2xXc9"&gt;Apple has introduced its new 16-inch MacBook Pro, promising an upgrade in both design and performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyW7Ra"&gt;The chassis has also received a modern redesign. The device is 4.7 pounds and 16.8 mm thick, with a 16.2-inch display. The Touch Bar has been replaced by physical keys, and there’s an HDMI port on the right side in addition to a Thunderbolt 4 port and an SD slot, in addition to a headphone jack and two Thunderbolt 4 ports on the left. It’s the most connectivity we’ve ever seen from a Mac notebook, according to Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhRU2Y"&gt;The first MacBook Pro 16 debuted in November 2019. It had a very similar design to previous 15-inch MacBook Pros and was powered by Intel’s 9th-Gen processors (which are now two generations old). Reviewers praised its...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new MacBook Pro has a notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vs_a3EC0lVvh66-mJaX1RihgKao=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012024/lcimg_dbbf28e3_568c_48d1_8c66_10c4149e89fe.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="koVG91"&gt;Apple is adding a notch on the display of its new MacBook Pro. It’s a cut out that will house the camera system, much like how Apple moved to a notch design for its iPhone X launch in 2017. The surprising addition of the notch comes in the new 14-inch MacBook Pro, equipped with Apple’s new M1 Pro silicon inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPNtvK"&gt;The 14-inch MacBook Pro is completely redesigned, and the bezels have been completely trimmed down thanks to this notch. The bezels at the side at 3.5mm, that’s 24 percent thinner than before, and up top it’s 60 percent thinner. The macOS menu bar now wraps around the camera, and it seems to look a lot better with dark mode enabled so the notch isn’t as noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8nZA4"&gt;This display is also 120Hz with HDR support, so you do get a big...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new 14-inch MacBook Pro with a notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W8Gu1yCl8X5f8qVymayXFLwwadY=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012007/1Rm4aV2YiD.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pzYFl7"&gt;Apple has announced a redesigned MacBook Pro, which now includes a 14-inch screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;Apple’s new M1 Pro and Max chips&lt;/a&gt;, a notch, and a wider selection of ports in addition to the standard Thunderbolt ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McMzX0"&gt;The redesign is the first major one in Apple’s pro laptop lineup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13490774/apple-macbook-pro-review-2016-13-inch-laptop"&gt;since 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the year that brought ill-fated butterfly keyboards, the Touch Bar, and Thunderbolt 3 as the standard and only port type (with the exception of a headphone jack, of course). It also marks the return of the mid-size 14-inch screen, which Apple hasn’t put on a laptop since the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook#iBook_G4_(%22Snow%22)"&gt;2005 iBook G4&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beNUXV"&gt;It’s nice to see Apple more clearly differentiating the smaller MacBook Pros. The lineup has been a bit confusing for the past few years — the two-port MacBook Pro and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod Mini gets three new color options</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s HomePod Mini ... now in color&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0FT5Ir"&gt;With Siri now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22720890/siri-voice-control-ecobee-smart-thermostats"&gt;socializing on other smart speakers&lt;/a&gt;, Apple took to the stage at its October event to announce a new look for its HomePod Mini smart speaker. In addition to white and black (space gray), you will soon be able to pick up a HomePod Mini in yellow, orange, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dctHY3"&gt;Apple is catching up with the competition here. Google’s Nest Mini smart speakers have blue and orange options, and there’s also a blue Amazon’s Echo Dot, plus some fun animal-themed colors offered on the Echo Dot Kids edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ql281U"&gt;Apple’s new, colorful smart speakers cost the same, $99, and will be available in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noxVVm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22495680"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Pro event live blog &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors take its in-house Arm-based chips to new heights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7BlgsBIEdxifeQl6sj7oGLgHlM=/127x0:1288x774/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011926/Untitled.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lzy4HC"&gt;Apple has officially announced its most powerful chips ever: the M1 Pro and M1 Max, souped-up versions of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558095/apple-silicon-m1-chip-arm-macs-soc-charge-power-efficiency-mobile-processor"&gt;the M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; that it debuted last fall and the heart of its new MacBook Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MyN0q"&gt;The original M1 chip was announced a little less than a year ago as Apple’s first in-house, Arm-based chip for laptops. At launch, it was featured in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s revamped MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;the entry-level Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;2021 iMac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;iPad Pro refreshes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MulTxQ"&gt;But as good as the M1 chip was, it was only a solution for replacing Intel on Apple’s entry-to-mid level hardware, with its high-end MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Mini models (meant for developers, programmers, graphic designers, and other more demanding workloads) all...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jLKVKU"&gt;In the Monday letter addressed to Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy, lawmakers called on the company to provide “exculpatory evidence” to corroborate congressional testimony that directly conflicts with recent reporting regarding the use of third-party seller data. Specifically, lawmakers called out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21347083/jeff-bezos-amazon-tech-antitrust-hearing-jayapal-questioning"&gt;Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for statements&lt;/a&gt; made in a 2020 hearing, claiming that the ecommerce giant “prohibits the use of anonymized data, if related to a single seller, when making decisions to launch private brand products.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Music Voice Plan lets you access music through Siri.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g3viTf"&gt;Apple unveiled a new Voice plan for Apple Music during its Unleashed event on Monday that will be $4.99 per month. You can use only your voice and its Siri voice assistant to access all Apple Music content across Apple devices. It will be available later this fall in 17 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="du7pLy"&gt;“Apple Music and Siri are natural partners and already work seamlessly together,” Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-introduces-the-apple-music-voice-plan/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. And non-subscribers can sign up for a free, seven-day trial without auto-renewal to check out Voice before they commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKcI0d"&gt;Users can subscribe to the plan with Siri by saying, “Hey Siri, start my Apple Music Voice trial,” or by signing up through the Apple Music app. Once subscribed, users can...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces third-generation AirPods for $179</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M1fVSZ"&gt;Apple has just introduced its third-generation AirPods, the latest set of the company’s massively popular true wireless earbuds. With a new design that blends aspects of the prior AirPods and AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods retain a hard plastic, one-size-fits-most fit in the ear. But the form factor is seeing significant change for the first time since 2016: the new earbuds have much shorter stems than before. Priced at $179, the third-generation AirPods will be available to preorder today and will go on sale next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4qpkZ"&gt;They’re now water and sweat resistant. Battery life has been extended to 6 hours of continuous listening. With the case, you’ll get a total of 30 hours. The new third-gen AirPods have a redesigned custom driver and...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="k92NoU"&gt;A robotic spacecraft that NASA just launched to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22711372/nasa-lucy-mission-jupiter-trojan-asteroids-12-years-launch"&gt;explore clusters of asteroids around Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; may be in some slight trouble on its journey through space. The space probe, named Lucy, is &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/lucy/2021/10/17/lucy-spacecraft-healthy-solar-arrays-being-analyzed/"&gt;having issues with one of its two main solar panels&lt;/a&gt;, which are critical for gathering rays from the Sun and generating power for the spacecraft on its 12-year trip through the Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WOopU"&gt;NASA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22729626/nasa-launches-lucy-probe-study-jupiter-trojan-asteroids"&gt;launched Lucy early in the morning on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, October 16th, on top of an Atlas V rocket from Florida. The launch was deemed a success, putting Lucy on its trajectory to reach Jupiter’s asteroids, named the Trojans, by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
