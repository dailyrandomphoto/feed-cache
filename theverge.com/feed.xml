    <title>Apple’s new ad invites you to imagine dying alone without a Watch on your wrist</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cx6aL7"&gt;Apple wants you to know that buying a $400 smartwatch could be a matter of life-and-death — and it’s brilliantly, gruesomely captured that feeling in a new TV ad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJXVSP"&gt;Titled “911,” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ2JiwEARFo"&gt;the one-minute ad spot&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t show any of the gory details — you simply hear three phone conversations between 911 operators and people who managed to use their Apple Watch when facing seemingly imminent death: one who might drown in a sinking car, one who fell a great distance and broke his leg, and a paddleboarder who got swept out to sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiOZiV"&gt;They each have a happy ending, Apple informs us: “With the help of their watch, Jason, Jim, and Amanda were rescued in minutes.” But the underlying message is brutally clear: if they didn’t have this miraculous life-saving...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T and Verizon may have to delay 5G deployments another two weeks over airline safety fears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQc0cfDVFbOQyriJ8meFsw6J9eQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70336748/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OOFwVV"&gt;US officials have asked AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon to further delay new 5G deployments so that the Federal Aviation Administration can have more time to determine where they might interfere with airlines. US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson sent a letter to the CEOs of the two telecoms on Friday requesting a delay of “no more than two weeks,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-officials-ask-att-verizon-delay-5g-wireless-over-aviation-safety-concerns-2021-12-31/"&gt;according to Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8V1bx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon had already delayed these deployments by a month over regulators’ concerns and planned to start the rollout on January 5th as a result. The two telecoms now &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buttigieg-delay-5g-service-airline-safety-concerns-verizon-wireless-att-2022-1"&gt;tell &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;they are reviewing the latest request for a further delay. Buttigieg and Dickson write that, even with an additional delay, they expect 5G deployment will still...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Winnie-the-Pooh and around 400,000 early sound recordings enter public domain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbUJyI4NtyS1oYJ_rTSUakyu9mc=/0x6:468x318/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70336490/WinnieThePooh.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cover art for A. A. Milne’s &lt;em&gt;Winnie-the-Pooh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xTHmug"&gt;A. A. Milne’s &lt;em&gt;Winnie-the-Pooh&lt;/em&gt;, Ernest Hemingway’s &lt;em&gt;The Sun Also Rises&lt;/em&gt;, and other books, movies, and compositions from 1926 enter into the public domain today in the US. The works are now “free for all to copy, share, and build upon,” &lt;a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2022/"&gt;according to Duke’s Center for the Study of the Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks which copyrighted materials will become public each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDk9sJ"&gt;This year, the usual list of books, movies, and compositions comes with a sizable bonus: a trove of around 400,000 early sound recordings. A recent law, the 2018 Music Modernization Act, standardized how early sound recordings are handled under federal copyright law. As part of that, it set today as the date that copyright protections would end for “recordings first published...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Merry Christmas! Santander Claus made a $176 million payment mistake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="IRAQ-NEW YEAR-CHRISTMAS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hxXwzt5nlwVB5SKcSXcuCXJO3Z0=/1x0:5461x3640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70335231/1237483801.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ve6QaU"&gt;Some tens of thousands of people woke up on Christmas Day to doubled wages and a higher-than-expected bank balance after Santander did an oopsie, depositing £130 million ($176 million) into accounts held by its UK customers. Santander would now like the money back, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="928ipr"&gt;The deposit mishap was the result of a mysterious “scheduling issue,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/santander-bank-error-gives-thousands-an-unexpected-christmas-bonus-dd5vt2g87"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which first reported the story. The bank confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that some payments were accidentally doubled. (Santander is characterizing it as a “technical issue.”) Those transactions included those from 2,000 businesses, as well as accidental deposits across 75,000 accounts of individuals and companies like a corporate Ebeneezer Scrooge who’d been scared into generosity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 will close a day early because of COVID concerns</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X3M40f"&gt;CES has dropped the last day of its 2022 tech conference in Las Vegas, and the show will now end on January 7th, the Consumer Technology Association announced today. The shorter schedule is “an additional safety measure” in the face of a surge of COVID-19 diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFgIXC"&gt;Over the last two weeks, a number of large companies — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22850502/ces-2022-exhibitors-dropping-bmw-ibm-mercedes"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;Intel, AMD, GM, Google, T-Mobile, Amazon,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22853157/ces-microsoft-canceled-omicron-covid"&gt;Microsoft &lt;/a&gt;and the company formerly known as Facebook — have dropped their physical presences at the conference. It’s the largest tech conference in the world, which typically pulls more than 10,000 people in each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s558Kt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The CTA’s president and CEO has said the show “will and must go on.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UlzW2W"&gt;The US will continue to work with other countries’ space programs on the International Space Station through 2030, &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/"&gt;NASA announced today&lt;/a&gt;. That will allow for an uninterrupted transition to a planned commercial space station (or stations!) in the late 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmX7v9"&gt;Funds for the ISS have already been approved through 2024. NASA administrator &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440208/nasa-administrator-bill-nelson-interview-rockets-moon-plans-partnerships"&gt;Bill Nelson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in May &lt;/a&gt;that he wants to continue work on the ISS through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="a0thkP"&gt;The ISS’s future was called into question in 2018, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16930154/nasa-international-space-station-president-trump-budget-request-2025"&gt;a draft budget proposal&lt;/a&gt; from President Donald Trump’s administration had scheduled ending support for the space station in 2025.

    <title>Colorado fires close out a year of disastrous drought</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yXt3Pq"&gt;Devastating fires in Colorado cap off a year of awful drought across the US. Dry conditions helped set the stage for blazes that scorched hundreds of homes and forced tens of thousands to evacuate just ahead of New Year’s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rFml3"&gt;The fires have been raging through suburbs near Denver since December 30th. Strong winds fanned the flames and knocked out power. About 6,000 acres and at least 500 homes had burned by Friday morning. But there were no casualties, which Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle called “miraculous” given the severity of the fire in a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;amp;v=310406430998077"&gt;press briefing&lt;/a&gt;. Families had “minutes” to evacuate their homes, Governor Jared Polis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzMqMX"&gt;More than two-thirds of Colorado’s land is experiencing “severe” drought, according to the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;US Drought...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="JsWfht"&gt;Starting today, eligible US residents can apply for help with their internet bills under the new &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/acp"&gt;Affordable Connectivity Program&lt;/a&gt;. The program &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-launches-affordable-connectivity-program"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; today with $14.2 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law passed in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9Ab0r"&gt;Households can apply to take up to $30 a month off their internet service bill. For households on &lt;a href="https://acpbenefit.org/do-i-qualify/enhanced-tribal-benefit/"&gt;qualifying Tribal lands,&lt;/a&gt; the discount is up to $75 per month. The program could help to connect millions of people to the internet who haven’t had access to it at home, especially in communities that have historically faced more barriers to getting online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKFVbD"&gt;Almost a third of people living on Tribal lands lacked high-speed internet at home in 2017, according to a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41134-020-00147-9"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the Federal Communications Commission...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The governor of Missouri still doesn’t know how websites work</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dQd1Uj"&gt;Mike Parson, Governor of Missouri, does not understand how websites work. He held a press conference earlier this week in St. Louis to once more reiterate his desire to prosecute a &lt;em&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; journalist for looking at the source code of a state-run website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVG4vC"&gt;In October 2021 reporter Josh Renaud &lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-teachers-social-security-numbers-at-risk-on-state-agency-s-website/article_f3339700-ece0-54a1-9a45-f300321b7c82.html"&gt;reported that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education website source code had exposed the social security numbers of over 100,000 school teachers, administrators, and counselors&lt;/a&gt;. He published the story only after he’d reported the problem to the state and the vulnerability had been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx8hFA"&gt;Parson and the DESE were apparently not grateful for the alert and immediately accused Renaud of “hacking” the DESE website. Missouri...&lt;/p&gt;
