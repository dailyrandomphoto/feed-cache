    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G chipset will put premium features in midrange phones</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qualcomm’s 700-series Snapdragon chipsets are popular among midrange and premium midrange phone manufacturers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dHT4li"&gt;Qualcomm has announced a new 700-series chipset for mobile devices: the Snapdragon 778G 5G. It will start appearing in premium midrange phones from manufacturers including Motorola, Xiaomi, Realme, Honor, Oppo, and iQOO in the next few months, bringing with it some video capture and AI capabilities borrowed from the Snapdragon 888, the current chipset of choice for flagship Android phones. The company has also made a couple of other announcements today designed to get 5G connectivity into more tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mhwNy"&gt;The Snapdragon 778G offers three image-signal processors, or ISPs — a feature Qualcomm touted in its flagship 888 chipset, and also appears in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350079/qualcomm-snapdragon-780g-888-5g-mobile-chipset-phone-android"&gt;higher-end 780G&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it possible to capture photos and video from three different...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lofelt’s new haptics framework is ready to bring good vibrations to Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Qualcomm Lofelt" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owHO1DVBrVcpvFHKo7sgIRSPo2o=/69x0:807x492/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310907/0_66eU5_KB84vIXV7A.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lofelt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="htfuLm"&gt;Haptic feedback on Android phones is usually terrible, at least compared to devices that have Apple’s Taptic Engine. You know it, I know it, and a haptics company called Lofelt apparently knows it, too. Today, though, Lofelt, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297285/qualcomm-lofelt-haptics-vibration-snapdragon-888-api-software"&gt;partnership with Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, announced that it’s making its VTX haptic framework available to OEMs, with the hope that these manufacturers will start putting better haptics into more Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeMuxB"&gt;The framework will allow OEMs to utilize high-definition haptic vibration on phones running the latest Snapdragon 8-series and 7-series without any hardware tweaks. The system is “tightly integrated with Snapdragon and fully validated by Qualcomm,” according to Lofelt. While the framework is technically compatible...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People are uncomfortable with digital health tools used to control COVID-19</title>

  &lt;p id="3Bb4sh"&gt;Most people in the United States don’t want their digital data used to control the spread of COVID-19, a &lt;a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.10918?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=051921"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; found. More than half of the people in the study remained wary of sharing their data in different scenarios, including a smart thermometer company sharing information with public health officials, or using the Google and Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222161/apple-google-bluetooth-contact-tracing-system-coronavirus-health"&gt;exposure notification app&lt;/a&gt; to track infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgKd6k"&gt;“I was surprised a bit about the degree of skepticism when the potential benefits are so high,” says study author David Grande, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify enters the virtual concert business, starts selling $15 tickets to events</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3jDAwIgkefm7JvFJkkJxkqe0VPY=/0x0:1227x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310892/spotifylivestream.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify is hosting virtual, prerecorded concerts starting in May.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dQywgq"&gt;Spotify is entering the virtual concert business, just as in-person concerts are becoming more of a possibility. The company &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.live/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that people can now buy tickets to five different concert streams, which will air throughout May and June. Initial artists include The Black Keys, Jack Antonoff of Bleachers, and Leon Bridges. The streams all are prerecorded but can only be viewed at a given time through the web browser. The shows aren’t available on demand, and they aren’t accessible through the Spotify app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79LZSv"&gt;Tickets cost $15, and viewers must have a Spotify account to watch the show. (Viewers can set up a free Spotify account during the ticket-buying process if they don’t already have one.) You can check out the &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.live/faq"&gt;FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; for more...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China releases first images from its Zhurong rover on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vcYr2EHpT8Ept2uc7VEHMrSE5UA=/0x342:2048x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310749/E1wEz5VWYAINTeA.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqRu1w"&gt;China’s Zhurong rover has beamed back its first images from the surface of Mars after landing on a vast plain called Utopia Planitia. The rover plunged through the Martian atmosphere last Friday, bundled together with a lander after separating from China’s Tianwen-1 probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hHHok"&gt;The new images released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) show the two robots meticulously executing their first post-landing steps: the lander extended a tiny ramp to help Zhurong put its six wheels on the Martian surface for the first time. And Zhurong unfolded its four wing-like solar panels and a communications antenna, as seen from one of the rover’s navigation cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Apple asks court to rule iOS is not an ‘essential facility’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cfvrvd"&gt;After two and a half weeks in court, Apple is taking aim at one of the central elements of Epic’s antitrust case. &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20761616-apple-motion-to-dismiss-essential-facility-claim"&gt;In a filing Tuesday night&lt;/a&gt;, Apple asked the court to dismiss one of the 10 counts alleged in the initial complaint, arguing Epic had failed to establish any evidence for the charge that Apple had violated the essential facilities doctrine by failing to provide access to software distribution tools on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cptEsS"&gt;“At trial, Epic adduced no proof in support of this claim,” Apple’s filing reads. “On the contrary, Epic’s principal expert expressly disclaimed any opinion on essential facility, and (in response to a direct question from the Court) rejected the notion that iOS should be treated as a public utility. The Court should enter...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Official NBA jerseys are coming to Fortnite this week</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fepGFp"&gt;Soon you’ll be able to fight to the death in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; while representing your favorite NBA team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79fNwK"&gt;Today, Epic revealed the latest collaboration for its battle royale game, which includes new purchasable characters that can don the jerseys of all 30 NBA clubs. They’ll be available in the in-game shop starting May 21st, along with basketball-related emotes and tiny basketball net backpacks. As part of the crossover, two NBA stars — Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young — have also hand-picked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lockers that players can purchase starting next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pxB9GC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10507966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rbvvtm"&gt;This is just the latest in Epic’s push to bring the world of sports into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. In 2018, there was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18064380/fortnite-nfl-skins-football"&gt;a collaboration with the NFL&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;this year nearly two dozen soccer clubs were featured in...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="X3QXNg"&gt;Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase &lt;a href="https://status.coinbase.com/"&gt;experienced a “partial” outage&lt;/a&gt; this morning for its entire site and application. Additionally, both Coinbase and Binance are reporting issues specifically focused around withdrawals of Etherium and ERC-20 tokens this morning due to “network congestion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NYtOH"&gt;“We’re seeing some issues on Coinbase and Coinbase Pro and we’re aware some features may not be functioning completely normal. We’re currently investigating these issues and will provide updates as soon as possible,” Coinbase commented in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4eql7X"&gt;The outage, which lasted about an hour and a half, appears to have been resolved now, with Coinbase’s status page noting that “A fix has been implemented and we are monitoring the results.”&lt;/p&gt;
