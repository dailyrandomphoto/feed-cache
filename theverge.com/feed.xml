    <title>EA Play won’t come to Xbox Game Pass for PC until 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EOh1g2"&gt;PC gamers subscribed to Xbox Game Pass for PC or the pricier Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier will need to wait just a little while longer until they have access to EA Play on Windows machines. Today, Microsoft announced that EA Play would arrive on PC as part of Xbox Game Pass sometime in 2021. Originally, the partnership was supposed to &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/15/update-on-ea-play-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-2021/"&gt;go into effect today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpXa0q"&gt;“We established this partnership with Electronic Arts because they are as passionate as we are about helping people and communities discover great games, and we knew we could provide a great experience for members by working together. In order to deliver on that, we need more time to provide the Xbox Game Pass experience,” reads &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/15/update-on-ea-play-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-2021/"&gt;a Microsoft blog post published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos will soon be able to add a 3D effect to 2D photos</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0hwFDQ"&gt;Google Photos will soon be able to take your 2D images and make them appear as if they’re 3D, the company announced in a blog post on Tuesday. Google is calling these types of images “Cinematic photos,” and they’re a new type of image the app can show as part of its Memories feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpYDO0"&gt;Here’s a GIF from Google comparing a 2D image to a Cinematic photo. I think the feature looks pretty impressive:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WIOWAI"&gt;To make Cinematic photos, “we use machine learning to predict an image’s depth and produce a 3D representation of the scene—even if the original image doesn’t include depth information from the camera,” Jamie Aspinall, a Google Photos product manager, writes in Tuesday’s blog. “Then we animate a virtual camera for a smooth panning...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad’s new leather MacBook Pro sleeves are luxurious but pricey</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B23XwTLixrhWFayQZQMAtkaQSDg=/114x0:1926x1208/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516593/Untitled_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="khMIkp"&gt;Accessory company Nomad is expanding its case lineup once again with its first &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Flaptop-sleeve-horween-leather-rustic-brown-macbookpro-16-inch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F15%2F22176171%2Fnomad-new-leather-macbook-pro-sleeves-luxury-expensive-price-release-date-hands-on#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro sleeves&lt;/a&gt;, available today. The cases might be the nicest that Nomad has made so far, but with a starting price of $229.95 (for the 13-inch model) and $249.95 (for 16-inch MacBook Pros), they’re also the most expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8gWsh"&gt;The MacBook Pro cases are made out of the same brown Horween leather that Nomad uses for most of its products. But instead of the plastic shell the company uses on its iPhone cases (which I’m less of a fan of), the new cases are just solid expanses of leather on the outside, backed by EVA foam to keep your computer safe, with a final layer of microfiber cloth for the interior. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Google Meet adds live captions on the web for French, German, Portuguese and Spanish</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cBnkZL"&gt;Google Meet is adding live captions on the web in four languages to make meetings more inclusive, the &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/12/additional-language-support-for-live-captions.html"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Live captions in Spanish, French, German, and Portuguese will be available across all versions of Meet starting today. Meet rolled out real-time captions in English last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WJhYP"&gt;“We know from our work with teachers and parents over the years how essential caption tools can be for students with learning disabilities, as well as English-language learners in both K-12 and higher education,” Google Workspace project manager Philip Nelson wrote in a blog post announcing the update. “By expanding live captions to more languages, we can help more students feel empowered to participate, and help more teachers share a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s not as easy to get a Cyberpunk 2077 refund as CD Projekt Red suggested</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3oLDizJXjp-I8vE0mQOBKYSDlNc=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516541/cyberpunk_2077_800.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h21efq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; developer CD Projekt Red has confirmed it has no special refund agreement with Microsoft or Sony, despite saying dissatisfied players should return their copies of the game in a statement. It means players are covered by both platforms’ standard refund policies, which, in the case of Sony, explicitly prohibits refunds if you’ve already started playing a game “unless the content is faulty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8SpLo"&gt;The confirmation came from the company’s senior vice president of business development, Michał Nowakowski, on an &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2020/12/call-transcript_en.pdf"&gt;investor call&lt;/a&gt; held on Monday evening. “Microsoft and Sony have refund policies for every product that is released digitally on their storefronts,” Nowakowski said. “Despite several articles I’ve seen that things are being set...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart will use fully driverless trucks to make deliveries in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJqG9X3Xj9c5gBwSUp2NsFTU0NY=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516473/gatik_self_driving_vehicle_use_for_lead_image__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eR8xcg"&gt;Walmart will use fully autonomous box trucks to make deliveries in Arkansas starting in 2021. The big-box retailer has been working with a startup called Gatik on a delivery pilot for 18 months. Next year, the two companies plan on taking their partnership to the next level by removing the safety driver from their autonomous box trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYnR4c"&gt;Gatik, which is based in Palo Alto and Toronto, outfitted several multitemperature box trucks with sensors and software to enable autonomous driving. Since last year, those trucks have been operating on a two-mile route between a “dark store” (a store that stocks items for fulfillment but isn’t open to the public) and a nearby Neighborhood Market in Bentonville, Arkansas. Since then, the vehicles have...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Months later, the great Twitter hack still boggles my mind</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ceT25e"&gt;One of the wildest stories of the year was the day some of the most-followed Twitter accounts on the planet posted cryptocurrency scams because of a massive unprecedented hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibDhao"&gt;Elon Musk was the first hacked account most people noticed. “I’m feeling generous because of COVID-19,” a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised"&gt;now-deleted 4:17PM ET tweet said&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ll double any BTC payment sent to my BTC address for the next hour. Good luck, and stay safe out there!” The tweet also included an address where people could send bitcoin. But because Twitter scammers regularly use Musk’s name and image to post cryptocurrency scams, it was hard to tell if the tweet was just Musk mocking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dN1wqG"&gt;It quickly became clear that, yes, Musk was hacked, and it wasn’t just him. The company accounts...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="d8iHSq"&gt;In February, a cab driver in Northern California was transporting a 92-year-old woman to the bank when &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-16/cab-driver-woman-25000-scam"&gt;she told him she was taking out $25,000 to send to the IRS&lt;/a&gt;. The driver, Raj Singh, thought this sounded suspicious. Perhaps it was an IRS scam? The woman didn’t believe him, but she agreed to stop by the police station just in case. There, a law enforcement officer convinced her Singh was right — scammers were trying to steal her money. The woman went home, Singh got a $50 gift card for his troubles, and that was the last time anything good happened in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNOTqh"&gt;In the ensuing months, we’ve been through a pandemic, an economic crisis, senseless police shootings, nationwide protests, a tsunami of misinformation, and an extremely fraught...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The MCU is so big Disney Plus is getting a new Legends clip show to help you keep track</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qdihak"&gt;Disney has announced that yet another new Marvel series is coming to Disney Plus: &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/marvel-studios-legends-new-series-disney-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel Studios: Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The new ongoing series will “showcase individual characters viewers have come to know and love over the years and revisit some of their most iconic moments.” In other words, it seems like Marvel Studios is making its own clip show to recap the franchise before its major new releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMnQn6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; will kick off with two episodes focusing on the characters of Wanda Maximoff and Vision, respectively, to help refresh viewers’ memories of the two heroes’ history in the previous Marvel films. The episodes will unsurprisingly debut on Disney Plus on January 8th, 2021 — just a week before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168373/wandavision-trailer-disney-plus-marvel-studios-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany"&gt;the first episode of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is due to be released...&lt;/p&gt;
