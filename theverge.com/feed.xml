    <title>Amazon settles with the activists it fired</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i98rut"&gt;Amazon has settled a dispute with two workers that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367672/amazon-employees-climate-justice-nlrb-case-wrongful-termination"&gt;National Labor Relations Board said were fired for their activism&lt;/a&gt;. In April 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220353/amazon-covid-19-criticism-protest-fired-employees-cunningham-costa-climate-change"&gt;fired Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa&lt;/a&gt; after they had organized a protest against Amazon’s work with oil and gas companies, as well as raising concerns with the company’s coronavirus measures at its warehouses. &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15kVQrpyqH_sbtOXvQ38DeXZx7lwLAn3GVsZUDb6i0e8/edit"&gt;In a joint statement&lt;/a&gt;, Costa and Cunningham said that the company would have to pay them lost wages as well as inform employees that they couldn’t be fired for organizing. They haven’t mentioned whether they would be getting their jobs as UX designers back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czFgdX"&gt;At the time of the NLRB’s ruling, Amazon said that it disagreed with the findings, and that Costa and Cunningham had been fired...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is Facebook’s internal research on the mental health effects of Instagram</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hbaYAV"&gt;Facebook has shared the internal research about the impact of Instagram on teenage mental well-being reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported that the files showed Instagram knew the social media network has a negative affect on teens’ mental health. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;has pushed back&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’s&lt;/em&gt; characterizations of its research, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; “it is simply not accurate that this research demonstrates Instagram is ‘toxic’ for teen girls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSTY2F"&gt;The research slide decks are available on &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;Facebook’s newsroom here&lt;/a&gt;, split into two PDFs. We’ve also embedded the PDFs at the bottom of this story. Notably, the two PDFs have been annotated by Facebook in an effort to provide context.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo categorically denies that a 4K Switch Pro is in development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzndv147yiO9wZfKx_61I1fa9VI=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69929036/nintendo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f4M4eY"&gt;It is rare for a big company to come out and categorically deny an entire report, but that’s what Nintendo just did today — the Japanese corporate entity has issued a press release insisting that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/nintendo-switch-4k-developers-make-games-for-nonexistent-console?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s seeming revelation&lt;/a&gt; that Nintendo was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled"&gt;pushing developers to build 4K-resolution games&lt;/a&gt; for an upcoming but potentially canceled “Switch Pro” handheld was entirely incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNMMYO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1443366440183074819"&gt;Nintendo writes&lt;/a&gt; the report “falsely claims that Nintendo is supplying tools to drive game development for a Nintendo Switch with 4K support” and insists that it’s “not true.” Separately, it says that it has no plans for any new Nintendo Switch other than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview"&gt;the slightly refined OLED model&lt;/a&gt; that’ll be out next week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chinese companies are suing Amazon after getting banned for paid reviews</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rW7Egv"&gt;Several Chinese companies have filed a class-action complaint against Amazon for banning them from the Amazon marketplace over their use of paid reviews, a new complaint filed on September 13th claims. In the last year, Amazon has cracked down on companies soliciting paid reviews on its platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680269/amazon-ban-chinese-brands-review-abuse-fraud-policy"&gt;claiming to have permanently banned 600 Chinese brands&lt;/a&gt; across 3,000 seller accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SR7iBT"&gt;The companies listed in the complaint, doing business as Sopownic, Slaouwo, Deyixun, Cstech, Recoo Direct, Angelbliss, and Tudi, are seeking “recovery of funds that are being illegally and improperly withheld by Amazon” and are filing the class action to “stop any further misappropriation and misuse of funds that are legally and rightfully due to thousands of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA clears Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo for flight after probe into July incident</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P7FAry"&gt;Virgin Galactic is cleared to resume flights of its SpaceShipTwo space plane, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Wednesday, after capping a safety investigation into issues that came up during the company’s July flight carrying its founder Richard Branson. During that mission, SpaceShipTwo strayed from its designated airspace on its descent from space, and Virgin Galactic didn’t tell the FAA about it when it was supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXcghp"&gt;With the investigation now closed, the FAA required Virgin Galactic to make changes “on how it communicates to the FAA during flight operations to keep the public safe,” it said in a statement. Virgin Galactic said that includes “updated calculations to expand the protected airspace for future flights”...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Switch Pro was real, Bloomberg reports</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AiWjTY"&gt;Don’t get me wrong; we’re excited about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview'"&gt;Nintendo’s new OLED Switch&lt;/a&gt; — the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257643/nintendo-switch-lite-how-to-buy-in-stock"&gt;preorders&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; newsroom confirms it. But what about the more powerful Switch that so many of us thought was around the corner? A new &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/nintendo-switch-4k-developers-make-games-for-nonexistent-console?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report suggests that the global chip shortage is why plans fell through for a “Switch Pro” with upgraded hardware from Nvidia and 4K resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ll0JLN"&gt;The outlet, which previously reported on the device, backs up those reports by saying it’s identified at least 11 developers, like Zynga, who have received 4K Nintendo Switch development kits. Specifically, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; claims employees heard from Nintendo that they should design games to target the higher resolution. In response, Nintendo told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; its reporting...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok settles lawsuit with actress over its original text-to-speech voice</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AfRJ4J"&gt;TikTok has agreed to settle a lawsuit with Bev Standing, the voice actress who said she was behind the app’s original text-to-speech voice. Standing sued TikTok in May, saying that the app was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22435058/tiktok-voice-sues-unauthorized-usage-text-to-speech"&gt;using her voice without permission&lt;/a&gt;. A robotic version of what sounded like Standing’s voice had been in the app for months, speaking over what felt like every other video at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onzcGh"&gt;A lawyer for Standing said the settlement was still being finalized and details around payment could not be disclosed. “They’ve reached an amicable resolution,” Robert Sciglimpaglia, who represents Standing, said in a phone call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Sciglimpaglia said TikTok would license Standing’s voice as part of the agreement, but it’s up to TikTok whether or not to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cadillac axes Escalade’s hands-free driving feature due to chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XrhZig"&gt;The 2022 Escalade is heading into production, but it’ll be missing a key feature when the first customers pick up their new ride: the hands-free driving mode known as Super Cruise. It’s the latest feature to get the axe as a result of the global semiconductor shortage, which has been an especially big drain on the auto industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImJ4Yc"&gt;The shortage is also forcing Cadillac to hold off on adding Super Cruise to the CT4 and CT5 sedans, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2022-cadillac-escalade-super-cruise-hands-free-chip-shortage/?UniqueID=A3F2E32E-2148-11EC-8A3C-BD1F16F31EAE&amp;amp;PostType=link&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-09-29T17%3A14%3A01&amp;amp;ServiceType=twitter&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Roadshow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; With the Bolt currently not on sale due to the massive battery recall, that means parent company General Motors’ most advanced technological feature is currently not available on any new car. &lt;/p&gt;
