    <title>Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker’s early access period didn’t provide much access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AsqN_S-AKlRX5kQLGZGAeisYMio=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241384/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_32.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kUJcXc"&gt;On December 3rd, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;’s latest expansion launched its early access period, allowing those who preordered the game the opportunity to play &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; in advance of its December 7th release date. Or at least that’s how it was supposed to work. For lots of players, the early-access experience was an exercise in patience. With game servers at max capacity and login queues containing upward of 4,000–8,000 players, if you were in early access and actually got access, you were one of the privileged few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5jyap"&gt;Square Enix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809776/ff14-endwalker-square-enix-log-in-queues-extended-wait-times"&gt;warned players this would happen&lt;/a&gt;. Days before early access began, it published a notice detailing what the company had done to prepare for the inevitable congestion, along with tips to mitigate wait times. Still, after a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Power companies commit to building nationwide EV charging network </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O1UZ02"&gt;Over 50 utilities across the US have come together to speed up the build-out of electric vehicle charging stations along the nation’s highways. The new National Electric Highway Coalition was announced today by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), an association of investor-owned power companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qc2JVT"&gt;Together, the companies aim to “fill charging infrastructure gaps along major travel corridors,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.eei.org/issuesandpolicy/Documents/EV_NEHC_Fact_Sheet.pdf"&gt;fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;. Each utility that’s a member of the coalition must commit “in good faith” to create an EV fast charging network across its service territory “using any approach they see fit” by the end of 2023. The US will need more than 100,000 fast charging ports for the 22 million electric vehicles expected to traverse American...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The vice president should not be using Bluetooth headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vice President Kamala Harris Delivers Remarks At Maternal Health Day of Action Event" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ynFWBmHzffJhr5oUl6p0SSF49w=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241293/1237073492.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZhHXHk"&gt;Yesterday, &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; opened its newsletter with an article on Vice President Kamala Harris’ &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2021/12/06/kamala-harris-is-bluetooth-phobic-495343"&gt;aversion to using Bluetooth headphones&lt;/a&gt;. The VP was “Bluetooth-phobic,” the story claimed, “wary” of her AirPods and cautious with her technology use to an extent former aides described as “a bit paranoid.” Proof could be seen in her televised appearances: wires dangling from her ears in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K00Zx8apeg"&gt;an interview with MSNBC’s Joy Reid&lt;/a&gt; or clutched in her hand &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1325126733482385409"&gt;during the famous “We did it, Joe” call&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjqI9Y"&gt;But for a high-profile public official, this is a lot more reasonable than you might think. As security researchers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1468044270099742723"&gt;were quick to point out&lt;/a&gt;, Bluetooth has a number of well-documented vulnerabilities that could be exploited if a bad actor wanted to hack, say, the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alleged Bitcoin inventor trial ends without a real Satoshi standing up</title>

The court case has generated a lot of buzz in the Bitcoin community because he would have had to transfer those Bitcoins if the court had ordered him to, and that’s something only the real Satoshi can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnTC3G"&gt;If the name Satoshi Nakamoto rings a bell, it’s because that name shows up on the original whitepaper &lt;a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"&gt;that described how Bitcoin would work&lt;/a&gt;. While Satoshi is a hallowed name in Bitcoin lore (it’s also used as a way to denominate the smallest unit of the currency), Nakamoto’s identity has never been proven — we don’t even know if it was one person or a group of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An Amazon server outage is causing problems for Alexa, Ring, Disney Plus, and deliveries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration an Amazon Web Services logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVu4i0c_YWVLUdA-WvFOOWrbvps=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240006/1230840274.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HsxliB"&gt;Problems with some Amazon Web Services cloud servers are causing slow loading or failures for significant chunks of the internet. Amazon’s widespread network of data centers powers many of the things you interact with online, including this website, so as we’ve seen in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; AWS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14765042/amazon-s3-outage-causing-trouble"&gt;outage incidents&lt;/a&gt;, any problem has massive rippling effects. People started noticing problems at around 10:45AM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="lI8pyl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s internal apps went down too, cutting off some delivery drivers and stalling warehouse robots&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yicS6U"&gt;While some affected services that rely on AWS have been restored, the internet is still a bit slower and more unsteady than usual. The most important app impacted by the outage might be the ones that Amazon employees use. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/amazon-web-services-outage-causes-issues-at-disney-netflix-coinbase.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; points out Reddit...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram makes it easy for teens to find drugs, report finds</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2HHAdk"&gt;Instagram’s algorithms recommend drug dealers’ accounts to minor users, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/xanax-ecstasy-and-opioids-instagram-offers-drug-pipeline-kids"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the Tech Transparency Project. The platform also suggests drug-related hashtags, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehthwu"&gt;In the report, published Tuesday, the Tech Transparency Project (TTP) created seven fake accounts for teen users aged 13, 14, 15, and 17. Instagram did not stop those accounts from searching for drug-related content. In one case, the platform auto-filled results when a user started typing “buyxanax” into the search bar. One suggested account was a Xanax dealer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcoFt9"&gt;After following the account of a Xanax dealer, a fake minor user got a direct message “with a menu of products, prices, and shipping options,” the report found. A fake minor...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hVywrG"&gt;Yesterday, NASA announced its newest class of astronauts: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820265/nasa-new-astronaut-candidates-artemis-generation-announcement"&gt;10 new candidates who will train to fly to space&lt;/a&gt; with the agency over the next two years. The group included plenty of qualified individuals with backgrounds in the military, as well some with more unique professions. One of the candidates was most recently a flight surgeon at SpaceX, while another has worked as a drilling engineer on remote rigs in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeuIZ5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke briefly with three of the newest astronaut candidates to get a better understanding of their backgrounds and what inspired them to pursue becoming an astronaut. Learn more about the newest members of NASA who could fly to deep space one day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon outage isn’t just online: delivery vans and warehouse bots aren’t moving packages</title>

  &lt;p id="goafai"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822332/amazon-server-aws-down-disney-plus-ring-outage"&gt;Amazon Web Services outage that started this morning&lt;/a&gt; might be worse than it seemed. That’s not only because it’s reportedly cutting off some streams from Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, and Netflix, but because the apps that keep warehouse, delivery, and Amazon Flex workers connected are down too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPKHhy"&gt;Amazon has confirmed it’s “experiencing elevated error rates for EC2 APIs in the US-EAST-1” region, meaning that connections from one of its largest server operations are spotty at best. Posts in the Amazon employee subreddits say many people can’t access the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-a-to-z/id1413909063?mt=8"&gt;AtoZ app&lt;/a&gt; that manages practically everything about their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWrEsI"&gt;Warehouse workers report entire facilities shut down due to network problems and have &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/rb4pj2/currently_at_cle2/"&gt;posted pictures&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gzo4X7"&gt;Apple seems to be close to rolling out the Apple Music Voice Plan, a more affordable tier of Apple Music that lets you access music using only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733053/apple-music-voice-plan-playlists-price-siri"&gt;your voice and the company’s Siri assistant&lt;/a&gt;. The new plan appeared in the update notes for the iOS 15.2 release candidate, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1468280991244603393"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacStories&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Federico Viticci&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests it will be available widely sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
