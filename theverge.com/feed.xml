    <title>Lime’s old e-bike batteries are now powering these Bluetooth speakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/73w0IsDFVOlIPpehWDamTXK3Uco=/644x660:2317x1775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68896150/Gomi_0310.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The speakers are powered by old e-bike batteries and have a case made from recycled plastic.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X1ieFr"&gt;Accessory manufacturer Gomi is launching a limited edition Bluetooth speaker powered by batteries from old Lime e-bikes. In its &lt;a href="http://v1.li.me/second-street/gomi-upcycles-lime-e-bike-batteries-to-create-zero-waste-portable-speakers"&gt;announcement of the partnership&lt;/a&gt;, Lime says Gomi will use 50,000 battery cells from over 1,000 old e-bikes. The result is a Bluetooth speaker priced starting at £99 (around $138) that has 20 hours of battery life and will be available for 30 days as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gomi-eco-tech/gomi-speaker-powered-by-waste"&gt;Kickstarter launching later today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CC44fR"&gt;It’s an interesting initiative that Lime hopes will further decrease the environmental impact of its shareable e-bikes, which are touted as a way of reducing reliance on cars for short journeys. In the past, other shared micromobility options like e-scooters have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18307591/electric-scooter-sharing-bird-lime-uber-economics-big-picture"&gt;criticized for their short lifespans&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/electric-scooters/"&gt;one 2019...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo says it will only sell electric cars by 2030</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwclOPYUDvZXaKl6UiGYQndHtEs=/287x0:4814x3018/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68896092/259202_Volvo_XC40_Recharge_P8_AWD_in_Glacier_Silver.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Volvo unveiled its first fully electric car, the XC40, in 2019.  | Image: Volvo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DuISGu"&gt;Swedish automaker Volvo says it will &lt;a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/uk/en-gb/media/pressreleases/277409/volvo-cars-to-be-fully-electric-by-2030"&gt;only sell electric cars&lt;/a&gt; by 2030, phasing out all diesel, petrol, and hybrid options in an effort to reduce global carbon emissions. The company previously aimed for half of its cars sales to be electric by 2025, but says the new strategy is an “acceleration” of this goal driven by “strong demand” for its electric options. The company also says future sales of its electric cars in “coming years” will be online-only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvhPnZ"&gt;Volvo, which is owned by Chinese conglomerate Geely, launched its first fully-electric car, the XC40 Recharge, last year. The SUV has a roughly 200 mile range and can charge its batteries to 80 percent capacity in 40 minutes. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195499/volvo-xc40-recharge-ev-suv-first-drive-specs-price"&gt;our time with the car&lt;/a&gt; we found it to be an “impressive blend...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is boosting AR performance on Android phones with dual cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rVDrG2Da_KkqCtDvBT67AevvE2Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68895806/vpavic_191016_3730_0029.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aq3EMv"&gt;Google is updating its augmented reality SDK so that phones with dual cameras can capture better depth information. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/01/googles-about-to-enhance-ar-performance-by-taking-advantage-of-your-phones-dual-cameras/"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent update to the Google Play Services for AR app, which is how Google distributes ARCore features, now notes “Dual camera stereo depth on supported devices” in its changelog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDIf0S"&gt;For now, it appears that the support will be limited to Google’s own Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, which were both released in 2019. The &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of compatible ARCore devices on Google’s developer site says that dual camera support will roll out in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NN0JB1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google keeps adding Pixel features it claims it didn’t need: 2020 edition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496779/google-pixel-5-ultrawide-telephoto-camera-headphone-jack-direction-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ERD4y1"&gt;Notably, this means that the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G, both of which are 2020 Pixel phones with dual cameras, won’t see the benefits for now. That may be because...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rudy Giuliani just lost his YouTube privileges for two weeks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rudy Giuliani Appears Before Michigan State Legislature’s House Oversight Committee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGYR4_NR5NhQLyjqIs2XzSAoOwc=/0x81:5077x3466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68895097/1229918044.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rey Del Rio/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wikrPL"&gt;YouTube has suspended Rudy Giuliani’s YouTube channel for the second time this year for making false claims of fraud in the 2020 US presidential election and has issued a strike against his channel. It’s Giulani’s second strike within 90 days, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/youtube-suspends-rudy-giuliani-again-for-election-fraud-claims"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;meaning that Giuliani cannot upload videos for two weeks. In a statement, YouTube also cited Giulani’s promotion of nicotine, which is against the company’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvUyKd"&gt;“We have clear Community Guidelines that govern what videos may stay on YouTube, which we enforce consistently, regardless of speaker,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We removed content from the Rudy W. Giuliani channel for violating our sale of regulated goods policy, which prohibits...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku’s advertising ambitions just got even bigger with new Nielsen deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_xl6o-P1xgohBd4v5owUnDePvk=/0x47:1200x847/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68894583/roku_verge.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zaL2fS"&gt;Roku, one of the most popular streaming platforms in US homes, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2021/03/roku-and-nielsen-announce-strategic-alliance-/b-twyx4b-1614633923"&gt;is acquiring Nielsen’s video advertisement business&lt;/a&gt; as it tries to become a central hub for TV advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYhHSN"&gt;Specifically, Roku is acquiring Nielsen’s Advanced Video Advertising unit. The acquisition means that Roku will also acquire Nielsen’s automatic content recognition (ACR) and dynamic ad insertion (DAI) technology. DAI technology simply means that advertisers will be able to receive “better targeting and measurement” capabilities so they can hyper-target a specific audience instead of more broad demographics like age and gender. Think of ads for products people might actually want playing before a YouTube video compared to seemingly random ads playing on CNN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vTL8e"&gt;It’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grimes sold $6 million worth of digital art as NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JzkT16"&gt;Grimes is the latest artist to get in on the NFT gold rush, selling around $6 million worth of digital artworks after putting them up for auction yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKdrsb"&gt;A series of 10 pieces — some one of a kind, others with thousands of copies — went up for sale on &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/profile/grimes"&gt;Nifty Gateway&lt;/a&gt; on February 28th. The highest-selling piece was a one-of-a-kind video called “&lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x948b3515d81034a3c16d5393c6c155946c93c103/1"&gt;Death of the Old&lt;/a&gt;” that involves flying cherubs, a cross, a sword, and glowing light that’s set to an original song by Grimes. The winning bidder took it for nearly $389,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfZMIe"&gt;The bulk of the sales came from two pieces with thousands of copies available that sold for $7,500 each. The works, titled “&lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0xe04cc101c671516ac790a6a6dc58f332b86978bb/1"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0xe04cc101c671516ac790a6a6dc58f332b86978bb/2"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;,” are both short videos featuring their titular planet with a giant cherub over it...&lt;/p&gt;

It calculates the window where someone could get pregnant based on statistical modeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBASYu"&gt;“It personalizes over time.

&lt;p id="QSdDV2"&gt;The company plans to launch its digital birth control some time this year. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ecdmyw"&gt;Vizio today &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1835591/000119312521062802/d87723ds1.htm"&gt;filed its S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; as the TV and soundbar maker heads toward an initial public offering. “We envision the Vizio smart TV as the center of the connected home — where families play games together, where friends watch movies together, where work and learning happen, and where all things in between take place,” Vizio founder, chairman, and CEO William Wang wrote in a letter that opens the S-1. “Going public is an important milestone for us as we continue to grow and execute our goals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrlcoi"&gt;The filing reveals that Vizio has sold over 80 million TVs and 11 million soundbars since the company’s founding. It sold 7.1 million TVs in 2020. Vizio’s TVs have long delivered performance and picture...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo’s first EV is stuck at cargo ports waiting for a software update</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7qdKwr"&gt;Volvo XC40 Recharge electric SUVs are currently being held at US ports because the company is waiting to ship a crucial software update before releasing them to customers and dealers, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucX6rR"&gt;The problem appears to be that these XC40 Recharge SUVs — which is Volvo’s first all-electric vehicle — left the company’s factory without the Volvo On Call software activated. Volvo On Call is a subscription service that connects Volvo cars to an owner’s smartphone, allowing them to remotely turn the vehicle on and off, lock or unlock the doors, and access diagnostic information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxgOSv"&gt;One customer, who was supposed to take delivery of his XC40 Recharge at the end of February, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; his dealer’s best guess is that his SUV may not...&lt;/p&gt;
