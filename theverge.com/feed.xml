    <title>Judge says the FTC’s Meta monopoly lawsuit can go forward</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AifJ7H"&gt;A federal judge says the US Federal Trade Commission can proceed with an antitrust lawsuit against Meta, formerly known as Facebook, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;dismissing the suit&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZejye"&gt;District of Columbia Judge James Boasberg &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21177063-memorandum-opinion"&gt;said in an opinion&lt;/a&gt; released today that the FTC’s first complaint had “stumbled out of the starting blocks.” But a revised version, Boasberg said, makes the same arguments with facts that are “far more robust and detailed than before.” As a result, he’s denying Meta’s motion to dismiss and allowing the case to proceed, although he states that the agency “may well face a tall task down the road in proving its allegations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tr0N24"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FTC may still face a “tall task” proving its claims&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile identifies issue that prevented some iPhone users from using Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lX89e"&gt;T-Mobile said Tuesday that it had not blocked iCloud Private relay, and that it had identified what was causing some iPhone users to appear blocked from using the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OE9nGi"&gt;“Overnight our team identified that in the 15.2 iOS release, some device settings default to the feature being toggled off. We have shared this with Apple. This is not specific to T-Mobile. Again though, we have not broadly blocked iCloud Private,” the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1480987702363189248?s=20"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reporter Mark Gurman. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhyPo0"&gt;iCloud Private Relay lets users hide the websites they visit from third parties, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/t-mobile-block-icloud-private-relay/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Apple’s $19 polishing cloth is back in stock online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy the cloth once again.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PGwWdl"&gt;Apple’s $19 polishing cloth is back in stock &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth"&gt;at the company’s online store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/the-nightmare-is-over-the-apple-polishing-cloth-is-back-in-stock-and-ready-to-ship/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The very expensive piece of cloth was first introduced following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;Apple’s October event&lt;/a&gt;, but it was quickly backordered — &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/11/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it was “impossible” to get one before the holidays — so if you’ve been waiting to get one, now’s your chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIrJTx"&gt;“Made with soft, nonabrasive material, the Polishing Cloth cleans any Apple display, including nano-texture glass, safely and effectively,” reads Apple’s description of the cloth on its product page. Sounds perfect if you need to clean a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161487/apple-mac-pro-display-xdr-review-6k-lcd-screen-price-features"&gt;Pro Display XDR&lt;/a&gt; with the nano-texture glass screen. That already costs $5,999 — the nano-texture glass is a $1,000 upgrade from the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/pro-display-xdr"&gt;standard model&lt;/a&gt; — and if...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House says that insurers are required to reimburse or pay for at-home COVID tests</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Db29zb"&gt;At a press conference on Monday, the Biden administration announced a policy that will require insurance companies to reimburse up to eight over-the-counter at-home COVID-19 tests for their customers beginning January 15th, as first reported &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-cb49a8458f33a698c3a4f3b721835270"&gt;by the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The administration said in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1480639293756522502?s=20"&gt;a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; that the “update” is a part of a larger plan to “increase access to COVID-19 testing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5yEWe"&gt;Under the new policy, insured Americans will either have to purchase the test kits under their insurance or submit receipts to their insurance for reimbursement. A family of four under the same plan would be eligible to be reimbursed for up to eight COVID tests each, totaling 32 tests per month. The plan will also require consumers wanting...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The excellent Beats Fit Pro earbuds are coming to many more countries on January 28th</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fIDPIb"&gt;Beats’ best earbuds yet, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"&gt;Beats Fit Pro&lt;/a&gt;, were only available in the United States immediately upon their release a few months ago. Apple then launched the earbuds in China, but now they’re set to become much more widely available on January 28th. That’s when the Beats Fit Pro will launch across Canada, Europe, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV04z1"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beatsbydre/status/1480947737118101506"&gt;a tweet from the Apple-owned brand&lt;/a&gt;, preorders for the “worldwide” release will begin on January 24th before the buds hit shelves on the 28th. The Beats Fit Pro include flexible wingtips that help them (comfortably) stay anchored in your ears without coming loose — even during exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaoI5x"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-canada-europe-japan-release-date-161335850.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in Europe the Beats Fit Pro will be priced at £200 / €230; in Canada they’ll cost $250 CAD; and...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRrncq"&gt;A ransomware attack last week has left an Albuquerque area jail without access to its camera feeds and rendered automatic door mechanisms unusable. Inmates have been confined to their cells as a result, while technicians struggled to bring systems back online.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon workers will redo Bessemer union election on February 4th</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4ob1ga"&gt;The second union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama will begin on February 4th, according to a notice posted Tuesday by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which you can read below. The election is a redo of the one that was carried out in 2021, the results of which were declared invalid by the regulatory agency after reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;Amazon had broken labor laws&lt;/a&gt; during the union drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzk62X"&gt;The election will be carried out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;almost a year after&lt;/a&gt; workers originally voted on whether to unionize Amazon’s BHM1 facility. The union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;lost that election nearly two-to-one&lt;/a&gt; but disputed the results, taking issue with a mailbox that employees feared Amazon had access to. The mailbox was installed by the USPS, at Amazon’s request, and at...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peer-to-peer car-sharing service Turo files to go public </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWkSHp"&gt;Turo, the peer-to-peer car-sharing service, has filed for its initial public offering, the latest transportation-related startup to sell its shares on a public stock exchange. The company proposes to sell $100 million of stock, but that figure could change as Turo gets closer to its public debut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2jBdJ"&gt;Founded in 2010, the San Francisco-based company allows people to rent out their personal cars to other customers, much like Airbnb does for homes. In its &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1514587/000119312522005696/d145731ds1.htm#toc145731_4"&gt;S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;, Turo claims it has 85,000 active hosts (meaning vehicle owners), 161,000 active vehicles, and 1.3 million active guests over the period of 12 months ending September 30th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="LfYRnO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4:30PM ET, January 11th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;GameStop’s bundle of the Xbox Series X with Elite Series 2 controller has sold out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsr5z2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:58PM ET, January 11th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Best Buy has sold out of consoles for now.&lt;/p&gt;

They are available for the standard $499.99 without a bundle. As usual for Best Buy, it is based on local availability at stores in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxxl53"&gt;Another week, another restock of Xbox Series X consoles at GameStop. Hopefully this is a trend that new console availability is opening up in 2022 to a point where soon anyone will be able to walk into a store and pick up their hardware of choice without any fuss. While we’re not...&lt;/p&gt;
