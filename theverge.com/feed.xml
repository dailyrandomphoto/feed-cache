    <title>Invasive snails on the run leave behind DNA evidence </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZMfTv8"&gt;DNA sleuthing helped scientists spot early outcrops of a spreading snail invasion in Pennsylvania. The method could be used to spot the unwanted critters before they cause serious damage. That way, conservationists can stop them from conquering even more places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGF6zJ"&gt;New Zealand mud snails became a global pest in part because they can reproduce asexually — just one snail in a new area can essentially clone itself until there are 500,000 snails in a single square yard. They’re about the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;length of a pencil eraser so they’re hard to find until there are so many in a location that it’s nearly impossible to stop their spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZI03nk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It opens the door for us to be able to use this technology to detect the snail at a much wider scale”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FIS3oK"&gt;“It’s kind of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valorant is the latest big shooter to get a mobile spinoff</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bnLd5oQGKxa5xug793iWlvXfLPc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376560/VALORANT_Viper.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FMQuLZ"&gt;Riot is bringing its tactical shooter &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; to mobile devices. There aren’t a lot of details yet — such as when it will launch, on what hardware, or how it will differ from the main game — but Riot says the new version will simply be called &lt;em&gt;Valorant Mobile&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4jtMu"&gt;The developer claims that the PC version of the game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21280796/valorant-riot-games-launch-overwatch-league-blizzard-esports-competitive-gaming"&gt;which launched last year&lt;/a&gt;, currently averages 14 million monthly players. Valorant is also coming off of its biggest competitive tournament to date, with an event in Iceland, and Riot says that more than 1 million concurrent viewers tuned in to the finals on May 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFUxas"&gt;The news shouldn’t be too surprising. Earlier this year, Riot made a similar move with &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"&gt;launching a mobile-focused spinoff called &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I broke off a tiny piece of the world with a self-flying drone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DXME7X7sOEMN5KMOK5u4oBHxpl0=/0x0:1766x1177/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376551/skydio_3d_model.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4vAmLZ"&gt;With photogrammetry, hundreds of still photos can be transformed into an incredibly realistic 3D model of a real place on Earth — assuming you capture them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJh1u8"&gt;This Memorial Day weekend, a self-flying robot cameraman did that entire job for me. I simply designated where to fly and where not to fly, kicked back in a chair, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21009994/skydio-2-review-self-flying-autonomous-drone-camera-crash-proof-price"&gt;Skydio 2 drone&lt;/a&gt; nabbed those photos all by itself. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IQIi7G"&gt;Today, Skydio is launching &lt;a href="https://www.skydio.com/3d-scan"&gt;Skydio 3D Scan&lt;/a&gt;, an optional software suite for its self-flying drones that lets them build incredibly detailed models for &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more important tasks than my holiday backyard BBQ. We’re talking about scanning bridges that might be in need of structural repair, accident reporting at crash sites, and allowing clients to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No Man’s Sky is getting a ‘visual overhaul’ and flying pets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uDZtxoeEMSc-F4xf7dSxyDkmX8U=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376568/No_Mans_Sky_Prisms_Screen_2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S0eFcw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; is getting yet another big update, this time focused on the way the sci-fi adventure looks. The update is called “Prisms,” and developer Hello Games describes it as “a visual overhaul” of the game. It’s available starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="CS8p2c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:579707"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1wG6bI"&gt;The changes include new weather effects, volumetric lighting, furry aliens, skies full of stars, and more. The studio also says that PC and next-gen versions of the game will get “detailed reflections, improved lighting quality, more detailed biomes, and more.” You can get a good rundown in the trailer above. As part of the update, &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; is also getting a very cool new feature: flying pets that you can ride. These include giant beetles, flying worms, and huge butterflies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qg5Jcv"&gt;As always, the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch, Fitbit users with heart conditions get more medical procedures</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2J9zAn"&gt;People with irregular heartbeats who use wearable devices like Apple Watches and Fitbits aren’t overwhelming doctors with worried calls about their hearts, a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2780408"&gt;new study shows&lt;/a&gt;. But they are more likely to be treated with a heart procedure called an ablation, the analysis found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8OKAk"&gt;The small&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;study is one of the first to show how people with existing heart problems use wearables. Devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17850660/apple-watch-series-4-ekg-electrocardiogram-health-2018"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; have a heart-monitoring feature that can alert users if they have an irregular pulse. Technically, those features on the Apple Watch are only authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for people who &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have underlying heart conditions. But people with heart conditions, including a type of abnormal heart rhythm called atrial...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s HarmonyOS arrives on tablets with the new MatePad Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gGuGmbKjDF8RbO-QPKN1pBeAyVA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376236/jporter_20210601_4610_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s new 12.6-inch MatePad Pro with stylus and keyboard cover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3m61Jb"&gt;Huawei has announced a trio of new MatePad tablets; a new 12.6-inch MatePad Pro, a smaller 10.8-inch MatePad Pro, and a new MatePad 11. Not only are they the company’s first tablets running its own HarmonyOS operating system, but the smaller MatePad Pro and MatePad 11 use Snapdragon chips produced by Qualcomm rather than the Huawei-designed Kirin processors found in its previous devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJa5An"&gt;Between these hardware and software changes, the tablets highlight the challenges that the Chinese technology giant is going through. It’s simultaneously trying to break free of Android, which outside of China is dominated by the Google apps and services that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension"&gt;Huawei is unable to preinstall on its phones&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Huawei’s Watch 3 is its first HarmonyOS smartwatch  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5WZ1-h_51CjfAOxicSrxfdcoCcc=/0x2:3424x2285/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376245/MKT_HUAWEI_WATCH_3_crop_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huawei Watch 3.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GnKvGW"&gt;Huawei has announced its first smartwatches running its own HarmonyOS operating system, the Huawei Watch 3 and Huawei Watch 3 Pro. In theory it’s the third separate operating system Huawei has used for its smartwatches, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/25/9397931/huawei-watch-review-android-wear"&gt;originally ran Google’s Android Wear&lt;/a&gt; (now Wear OS) before introducing its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967136/huawei-watch-gt-fitness-gps-watch-specs-release-date-price-hands-on"&gt;LiteOS software&lt;/a&gt; with more recent devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXiI7C"&gt;Despite the new OS, the Watch 3 offers a similar set of features to Huawei’s previous wearables. New additions includes a redesigned home screen that now consists of a watchOS-style grid of apps rather than a list (though you’re free to switch back to a list if you prefer), and there’s also support for video calling through Huawei’s own MeeTime service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaTaJ9"&gt;Although it’s branded as a HarmonyOS device,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge dismisses charges against Apple chief accused of bribing police officers with iPads </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q4CY76"&gt;A Californian court has dismissed bribery charges against Apple’s Chief Security Officer Thomas Moyer, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/judge-dismisses-charges-against-apple-security-chief-gun-permit-probe-2021-06-01/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, who was accused of offering iPads as bribes to obtain concealed-weapons permits for Apple employees. Judge Eric S. Geffon dismissed arguments of corrupt intent as “pure speculation” that were “not supported by the evidence presented to the grand jury.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bViO1M"&gt;Moyer was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611525/apple-ipads-bribes-concealed-gun-permits-security-head-accused-santa-clara"&gt;accused last November&lt;/a&gt; of trying to bribe Santa Clara County officials by offering to donate 200 iPads to two officers in the sheriff’s office following a meeting in 2019. Moyer had indeed made the offer, but evidence suggests he believed the permits were already approved at this time, Judge Geffon wrote. This, combined with the fact that Moyer followed Apple’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Etsy targets Gen Z shoppers with $1.6 billion Depop acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Depop Space Selfridges Launch Party" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2fkEEvGa9Nvo7kvAkAiS4Nf2Utk=/4x0:4996x3328/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376020/1165583337.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clothes hangers with Depop’s logo appear in a pop-up shop in Selfridges, London. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by David M. Benett/Getty Images for Depop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oy1IEw"&gt;E-commerce site Etsy, best known for selling handmade and vintage wares, is &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/etsy-to-acquire-global-fashion-resale-marketplace-depop-865217575.html"&gt;buying up a cooler, younger rival&lt;/a&gt;, UK-based secondhand shopping app Depop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLy3MU"&gt;The $1.6 billion acquisition lets Etsy access Depop’s young and growing userbase. Etsy says more than 90 percent of Depop’s users are under 26, meaning they mostly belong to Gen Z, while Etsy’s own users are firmly millennial, with a median age for sellers of around 39. Etsy claims that Depop is the 10th most visited shopping site for Gen Z consumer in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
