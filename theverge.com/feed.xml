    <title>Samsung announces bigger and smaller versions of its TV-like Smart Monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jdq5m-75yjM2IaLkZaAyndfnnac=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69332653/Smart_Monitor_PR_main1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vLuDrb"&gt;Samsung’s Smart Monitor range is expanding. The company’s line of Tizen-powered smart computer displays &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-smart-monitor-lineup-worldwide-to-meet-growing-demand-of-do-it-all-displays"&gt;now includes&lt;/a&gt; a 43-inch 4K M7 model as well as a 24-inch 1080p M5, marking the biggest and smallest Smart Monitors to be made available to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egIBP3"&gt;Samsung introduced the Smart Monitor last year and describes it as a “do-it-all” display designed for both work and entertainment. The screens have built-in speakers and smart TV functionality through Samsung’s Tizen platform, meaning you can run video apps like Netflix directly on the device, as well as remote desktop access and productivity software like Office 365. The Smart Monitors have a remote control that works with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Bixby, and there’s also wireless support...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly hit with campaign by pro-Palestinian activists leaving 1-star app store ratings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iny5gO"&gt;A social media campaign by pro-Palestine activists has pushed down the ranking for Facebook’s app in Apple and Google’s app stores, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/pro-palestinian-activists-target-facebook-1-star-app-store-reviews-n1268258"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The activists are seeking to protest Facebook’s alleged censorship of Palestinian accounts on its platform, and are instructing people to leave Facebook’s app a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Skkyy__/status/1394588317900025858"&gt;one-star review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50MaNh"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;NBC New&lt;/em&gt;s, Facebook is treating the situation as a high-priority issue internally; one software engineer wrote in a post on an internal Facebook message board that “users are upset with our handling of the situation,” adding that the users “have started protesting by leaving 1-star reviews.”  Facebook has reached out to have the reviews removed, but so far, Apple has declined the request to remove the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Trese, Respect, Friends: The Reunion, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZoVXqVZmNzNXdvoIg5FHZ8sfhvs=/0x4:1358x909/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69331064/trese.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; comes to Netflix in June | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUy0RgeggCQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=NetflixPhilippines" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Q7QtV"&gt;Still reeling from that shocking ending to last week’s &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt;? Me too! I have literally no idea what to expect in tonight’s episode or from next week’s finale. I can’t say the same for &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead,&lt;/em&gt; a movie I really, really wanted to like but which felt really predictable. I found myself wishing the entire movie could have been as wild as its opening credits. &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; looks spectacular (except perhaps for the digitally-added Tig Notaro character), but could have done away with a few of the rag-tag mercenary characters and tightened things up a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9QyiE"&gt;Here are this week’s trailers: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R8iD42"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The needless drama of buying a PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-SKPnBNhfD9hT9qezauEBfTzDeo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69330601/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STXeel"&gt;Securing a PS5 is not easy, and it feels like it could be. With a combination of greed and incompetence, the stores selling PS5s in the United States have transformed the process into a weirdly dramatic affair where you’re forced to join Discords and follow overly exuberant guys on Twitter in the hopes that they’ll give you a heads-up on a PS5 “drop” — a store making a big shipment of PS5s available for purchase. These stores have turned every drop into an event, when really, buying a PS5 should be as easy as buying a pepper grinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAccHq"&gt;The other day, a package was sitting in the vestibule of my apartment building. I noticed my name on the label and mentally cataloged any recent purchases I may have made or packages someone mentioned...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India reportedly orders social media platforms to remove references to “Indian variant” of COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K1T2Ap"&gt;India’s government has sent notices to social media platforms ordering them to take down content that refers to an “Indian variant” of the COVID-19 virus, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/india-asks-social-media-firms-remove-reference-indian-variant-coronavirus-2021-05-21/"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reported. The letter from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology sent Friday was not made public, but was viewed by several news outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRXYW2"&gt;It was not clear which social media outlets received the letter, but India’s government has recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;ordered Twitter to remove tweets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/27/991343032/indias-government-is-telling-facebook-twitter-to-remove-critical-posts"&gt;Facebook and Instagram to take down posts&lt;/a&gt; that were critical of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Samsung smartwatch partnership looks a lot like giving up</title>

&lt;p id="ohGKGe"&gt;The company is throwing in the towel on Wear OS. It’s trying yet again, this time with Samsung’s Tizen OS helping to fill in the gaps that Google, for whatever reason, can’t. It’s theoretically good news for Android owners interested in a decent smartwatch — but one that’s damning of Google’s lackluster efforts in the smartwatch space to date. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="eURomX"&gt;Swedish band Wintergatan may be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/2/11147884/marble-machine-music-wintergartan-martin-molin"&gt;widely known for its Marble Machine music video&lt;/a&gt; (which featured a machine dropping marbles to play drums, a bass, and other instruments), but today I learned that they’re building a bigger, better version, and documenting the entire process on YouTube. It’s called the Marble Machine X, and it’s driven by a motor instead of a hand crank, is being built by an entire team of people, and, hopefully will be able to go on tour and be played on stage when it’s finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXIhmY"&gt;Wintergartan also produced a build log of the first machine, but this new project is way grander in scope, offering a deeper look at the creative process that leads to... well, building a massive musical instrument that uses marbles. The band put...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbGNaU"&gt;Richard Branson’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Virgin Galactic completed its first successful space flight in more than two years on Saturday, with its crewed VSS Unity spacecraft carried to an altitude of more than 44,000 feet before gliding safely back to Earth. It marked the first spaceflight from New Mexico, making it the third US state to launch humans into space. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_New_Mexico"&gt;The Zia sun symbol&lt;/a&gt; of New Mexico’s state flag was displayed on the outside of the ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJfZWr"&gt;Virgin’s VMS Eve carrier aircraft took off from Spaceport America in New Mexico at about 10:35AM ET with Unity aboard. About 10 minutes before its release, Unity switched to its own battery power, and conducted flight control and electrical checks. Once released by Eve, Unity’s pilots C.J. Sturckow and Dave Mackay...&lt;/p&gt;
