    <title>HalloApp is a private ad-free social network from two early WhatsApp employees</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GDOZAL"&gt;Two of the earliest employees behind WhatsApp have emerged with a new private social network called HalloApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5W2EMY"&gt;Starting Monday, anyone can download and sign up for HalloApp in &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halloapp/id1501583052"&gt;Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halloapp"&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt; on Android devices. There are many parallels between HalloApp and WhatsApp: the app is designed for group or individual chats with close friends and family, the only way you can find people is by knowing their phone number, the messages are encrypted, and there are no ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M65akw"&gt;While other startups have over the years tried and failed to build successful social networks for close friends (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8683885/daum-kakao-buys-path"&gt;RIP Path&lt;/a&gt;), the pedigree of HalloApp’s two cofounders, Neeraj Arora and Michael Donohue, makes this particular effort notable. They both worked at...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will end onsite COVID-19 testing at its US warehouses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nuyzTQ"&gt;Amazon has informed workers that it will end on-site COVID-19 testing at its US warehouses, as first &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-to-stop-covid-testing-in-u-s-warehouses"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will begin ramping down its testing operations in the US by July 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkJBIi"&gt;Although many in the US are vaccinated — 48 percent of the country is fully vaccinated, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; data as of Monday&lt;/a&gt; — the change comes as case rates around the country &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/us/covid-cases-rise.html"&gt;are going up&lt;/a&gt;. The significant majority of new cases have been found &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-covid-19-cases-united-states-almost-all-among-people-unvaccinated/"&gt;among unvaccinated people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYrxjm"&gt;Amazon informed staff Monday about its plan to end COVID-19 testing, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. “Free COVID-19 testing is now widely available and our employees have many options available to them, including...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Louis Vuitton’s $2,890 light-up speaker looks like something Thanos would steal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yztDz0l_5RmyYPGWyoRsgp9rg8M=/0x124:1674x1240/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69603136/Screen_Shot_2021_07_19_at_3.11.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tZgyG3"&gt;Louis Vuitton has revealed its next foray into tech products: the $2,890 Horizon Light Up Speaker, which looks less like either a gadget or a piece of high fashion, and more like an artifact of untold cosmic power from the next Marvel movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E5qkW"&gt;According to Louis Vuitton, the idea is that the Horizon speaker will serve as an artistic centerpiece of your living room or outfit, a unique blend of fashion and technology that aims to challenge what a portable speaker should look like, a goal in which it undoubtably has succeeded. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PJLrrI"&gt;But between the glass, stainless steel, and leather construction, 35 LEDs, and the brand’s traditional symbols and logos plastered on virtually every surface of the speaker, the overall effect is less...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Olympics are approaching a danger zone of extreme heat</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NwMFjV"&gt;Olympic athletes are grappling with another public health threat on top of the pandemic: extreme heat. This year’s summer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Olympics are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/17/weather/olympics-heat-forecast-climate/index.html"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; to be the hottest in decades. Temperatures expected to rise above 30 degrees Celsius (close to 90 degrees Fahrenheit) this week could put even the strongest athletes in danger of heat stroke or illness. They’ll also have to contend with oppressive humidity, which interferes with the body’s ability to regulate its temperature by sweating, on top of the scorching heat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TTbCmH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The training is brutal, and the conditions that the athletes are training for are dangerous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bnp6hT"&gt;Athletes have tried to acclimate themselves to the weather in advance of the games. Team USA, for example, even took inspiration from how...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish cuts a 10-year, $5 billion deal to make AT&amp;T the primary service provider for its MVNO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqQWkZfflK3-Dud_Zc1jQyamkjE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602744/acastro_200804_1777_dish_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dish is on a mission to become the US’ fourth wireless carrier.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D5m5WV"&gt;Dish Network has a new network operator partner for its MVNO brands: AT&amp;amp;T. The companies &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001001082/000100108221000019/dish-20210714x8k.htm"&gt;have signed a network services agreement (NSA)&lt;/a&gt; that will see Dish pay AT&amp;amp;T at least $5 billion over the course of the next ten years to use its 4G and 5G networks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;as Dish brings its own 5G network online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1A6h6"&gt;The deal takes effect immediately and comes at a time when relations between Dish and T-Mobile — currently a major network partner — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;are particularly strained&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a nonexclusive agreement, and Dish says that some of its customers will likely continue to connect to T-Mobile’s network. The arrangement also gives AT&amp;amp;T the right to request access to use some of Dish’s wireless spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Se1Rrl"&gt;Dish owns Boost Mobile, Ting, and Republic Wireless MVNOs,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap buys another company to make AR shopping a reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1YngSmx-JtlK3DZ60nzTkJBoHB4=/0x624:3204x2760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602719/Gucci_x_Snap_Shoe_Try_On_Women_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap and Gucci recently partnered to let users virtually try on a limited edition pair of shoes. | Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ntRwo0"&gt;Snap is making a big bet on AR shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PMYnt"&gt;The parent company of Snapchat has bought Vertebrae, a company that lets brands create and manage 3D versions of their goods. Vertebrae’s 50-person team will keep developing the platform for existing and new clients, according to a Snap spokesperson. The idea is that a company can easily upload visuals and other information about an item into Vertebrae and have a 3D version made for shoppers to access, and potentially buy directly, within Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVYRK1"&gt;While Snap first used its augmented reality tech for silly effects like puking rainbows and dancing hotdogs, the company increasingly sees AR as a way to shop. Early tests of AR shopping experiences, such as a recent collaboration with Gucci to let...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Jeff Bezos get launched into space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hsh0N8nmaZU9KBuntn4q83O7nCM=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602639/Blue_Origin_New_Shepard_launch.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blue Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VYKuOT"&gt;Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, is flying to space Tuesday morning on his company’s suborbital rocket. He’s riding with a motley crew of three other passengers: his brother Mark, 82-year-old aviation icon Wally Funk, and 18-year-old Dutch high school grad Oliver Daemen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szOpG9"&gt;The mission, called NS-16, will mark the first time Blue Origin sends humans to space. Bezos will become the second billionaire to fly a rocket he helped fund, after Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson launched on his company’s rocket-plane to space on July 11th. Daemen will be the youngest person to fly to space and Funk, a lively firebrand aviator who trained as an astronaut in the ‘60s but never made it to space, will be the oldest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wdzia4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The launch crew is...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The best free apps for video calling</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jz5xAw"&gt;Things are starting to open up, but for now, the COVID-19 pandemic is still with us and many are still relying on video calls to keep in touch with work colleagues, family, and friends. And for most of us — especially those who are facing financial difficulties — free is best. Zoom continues to top the list of videoconferencing apps, but there are a bunch of applications out there that will allow you to meet others online for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBifoi"&gt;We’ve listed a few of the best known videoconferencing apps, along with a couple of popular text chat apps that include video calling features. While most of these already have free versions, some are offering access to additional features for those who are currently working from home or who want to check up...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat will let you pose your Bitmoji on your profile in 3D</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Bitmoji in 3D.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rhxyge"&gt;Snap is introducing the ability to pose your Bitmoji avatar on your Snapchat profile in 3D, the company announced on Monday. For your 3D Bitmoji, you’ll be able to pick from more than 1,200 combinations of body poses, facial expressions, gestures, and backgrounds, according to Snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWUMwN"&gt;You can get a look at some of the options available in the image at the top of this post and in the one below. It looks like there will be a lot of fun ways to pose your Bitmoji to represent you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jXjIUr"&gt;Snap says the feature is rolling out on Monday, but I haven’t been able to access it on Snapchat myself just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwuBIw"&gt;Bitmoji avatars are very popular — Snap says that more than 200 million people use them daily — and this isn’t actually the first time...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="U2Ct9Z"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211808#147"&gt;has released iOS 14.7&lt;/a&gt;, an update which lets iPhone 12 owners fully utilize the MagSafe Battery Pack, HomePod users manage timers from their phone, and more (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/19/ios-14-7-release-notes-features-changes/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgikvO"&gt;Arguably the update’s most exciting feature is one that adds support for new hardware: Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22576245/iphone-12-reverse-wireless-charging-magsafe-battery-pack"&gt;recently announced MagSafe battery pack&lt;/a&gt;, which should soon be arriving at stores and doorsteps. At least one of the charging devices has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22347900"&gt;already made its way to a customer’s hands&lt;/a&gt;, so Apple seems to be releasing the update in the nick of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePsyjW"&gt;The update also brings improvements to the HomePod timer experience, letting you manage timers from the Home app, rather than having to solely rely on your voice. Apple has also added a new Apple Card feature, which &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-introduces-apple-card-family-enabling-people-to-share-apple-card-and-build-credit-together%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F19%2F22583871%2Fapple-ios-14-7-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-ipad-timers-apple-card" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it announced in...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
