    <title>Apple doesn’t make a MagSafe car charger — here are your options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2YypLOutr2SHxGrv2FW75FTcd5Y=/337x0:1537x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68675287/belkin_wic002_magnetic_vent_cable_management_product_page_v01_r01_1680x600_us.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XkfDkH"&gt;Getting a MagSafe car charger for your iPhone seems like a simple process, but the current landscape is one of trade-offs: there are no all-in-one solutions that will wirelessly hold and charge your phone &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; are MagSafe certified to provide up to 15W of power. However, manufactures have been finding workarounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agS2QL"&gt;First, there’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-WIC002%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F15%2F22231718%2Fmagsafe-car-chargers-apple-iphone-certification-process#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Belkin’s Car Vent Mount Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only MagSafe Certified car mount, and it sells for $39.99. Being certified doesn’t mean it provides power, though. You’ll have to plug your phone in with a Lightning cable (which you’d have to do anyway for wired CarPlay compatibility). This does technically let you charge your phone faster than regular wireless charging, but it leaves you messing around with a cable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WarnerMedia extends its 20 percent discount on HBO Max subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vaxg3vCzbZGKNaPQgOXHkOpl2cw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674938/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVLkDb"&gt;A discount on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21272223/hbo-max-app-how-to-watch-download-price-subscription-stream-shows"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; that was supposed to end today, January 15th, has been extended until March 1st, 2021. The fine print of the offer hasn’t changed: you can get six months of HBO Max for 20 percent off the normal total cost, which is usually $90 before tax. &lt;a href="https://www.hbomax.com/"&gt;You’ll pay $70 with this deal&lt;/a&gt; (it’s like paying just under $12 per month instead of $15), but the catch is that you have to prepay in full and it’s nonrefundable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOq3Hq"&gt;This discount is open to both new and returning HBO Max subscribers, but it can’t be stacked with a free trial or any other promotion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhmXqS"&gt;WarnerMedia kicked off this deal in early December 2020 on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;Warner Bros. announcing that its 2021 slate of films would debut on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; alongside the theatrical releases and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is again extending TV Plus trials to July</title>

The trials were originally included with the purchase of any Apple device (e.g., an iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV) and were initially set to last until November 1st, 2020. This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508148/apple-tv-plus-free-period-extended-february-2021-streaming"&gt;the second extension&lt;/a&gt;, with the first extending from November 2020 to February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWCt0Q"&gt;Subscribers who had free subscriptions that were set to expire any time from February 2021 to June 2021 will also get an extension until July. The extension comes in the wake of production delays. Only one of the shows the service launched with (&lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt;) has had its second season premiere, while others — like &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; —...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp to delay new privacy policy amid mass confusion about Facebook data sharing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H4Ou6zEiXz4l_m0CuKUCG1iVlvg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674807/akrales_180215_2310_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ItYbS"&gt;WhatsApp on Friday announced a three-month delay of a new privacy policy originally slated to go into effect on February 8th following widespread confusion over whether the new policy would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;mandate data sharing with Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2zqvq"&gt;The update does not in fact affect data sharing with Facebook with regard to user chats or other profile information; WhatsApp has repeatedly clarified that its update addresses business chats in the event a user converses with a company’s customer service platform through WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nfZOsh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WhatsApp is trying to clear up confusion about its privacy practices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q26Fj9"&gt;“We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There’s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will address Pixel 4A 5G touchscreen woes in February update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="You probably don’t need 5G yet, but the Google Pixel 4A 5G has other strong benefits." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WA4VgG46-A0OT6SNdczAkoyuvQA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68665252/akrales_201013_4137_0289.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TUco78"&gt;Google says it’s aware of a problem with Pixel 4A 5G touchscreens and will address the issue in its February security update. Some devices are failing to respond consistently to taps on the lower part of the screen, which is particularly impacting folks who have opted for three-button navigation rather than swipes. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/12/pixel-4a-5g-touchscreen-issue-can-make-navigation-buttons-hard-to-use/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; spotted complaints&lt;/a&gt; from 4A 5G owners experiencing the issue, which seems to have cropped up after the December security patch was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrWHuU"&gt;Google’s response comes courtesy of &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/87628791?hl=en"&gt;a Pixel support forum post&lt;/a&gt;, which was recently updated with the February patch timing. In the meantime, Google advises users to work around the issue with some specific instructions on tapping navigation controls. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly planning big iMac redesign and half-sized Mac Pro</title>

  &lt;p id="ZlSMVl"&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;revamped MacBook Pros that ditch the Touch Bar and resurrect MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is also said to be planning to announce its long-awaited iMac redesign this year — and a pair of Mac Pro refreshes are on the roadmap, too. This is all according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, who says the iMac will undergo its most significant overhaul since 2012: Apple will reportedly ditch the chin beneath the screen, cut down on display bezels, and move to a flat-back design. The overall appearance will likely resemble the Pro Display XDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rT5Uv7"&gt;The new iMac will replace the Intel-powered 27-inch and 21.5-inch versions currently available and move the all-in-one desktop to Apple silicon. It’ll be one of the most significant visual makeovers of any...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="3xOVb6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;World of Assassination&lt;/em&gt; trilogy launch on January 20th, and at launch, Google Stadia players will be able to share access to distinct points within a game thanks to Stadia’s State Share feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRK7aF"&gt;With State Share in &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll be able to share a link alongside an image or video from your game. Then, others can click on it to try the scenario you were playing for themselves. There are multiple “states” of missions you can share to customize the experience, including a mission’s starting location, the objectives, Agent 47’s loadout, and difficulty level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvzieK"&gt;The feature works with any campaign or custom mission, and you’ll even be able to use weapons or items that you haven’t unlocked yet if a game state is ahead of your...&lt;/p&gt;

Now, GitHub workers are saying “Nazi” repeatedly in Slack, in regards to the US Capitol rioters, to protest what is being perceived as unfair treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxuW3U"&gt;“Others have already said so, but I just want to say it explicitly myself - I think that nazis were present at some protests on Jan 6, and that it’s very scary to see those ideas on display,” wrote one senior engineer in a 390-person Slack channel called #inclusion-belonging. “100% Nazis were there, and 1000000000% Nazis...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In its third season, American Gods is the most fascinating disaster on TV</title>

There are a lot of places to mess up! And yet we hear about so few mistakes. Which is why it’s a pretty big story when something as large as &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt; goes awry. &lt;/p&gt;
