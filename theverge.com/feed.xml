    <title>Enterprising developers are emulating PS2 games on the Xbox Series S and X</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BaIEpV"&gt;Developers have now made it possible to emulate PS2 games on the Xbox Series X and S using the RetroArch emulator — something that the PlayStation 5, a successor to the PS2, can’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8cWOf"&gt;Thanks to the Xbox Series X / S consoles’ “Developer Mode,” &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-11-30-people-are-using-xbox-series-x-s-to-emulate-playstation-2-games"&gt;the emulation software can be added as a Universal Windows Application (UWA)&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to download a retail version of the emulation software directly to their console without tricky workarounds, so players don’t have to wait for a re-release to play an older favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nVhbo"&gt;While RetroArch is able to emulate several different consoles, the compatibility for running PS2 games using the PCSX2 core is particularly notable because of how limited Sony’s PlayStation 5 is when it comes to backwards...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Component failure in NASA’s deep-space crew capsule could take months to fix</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="45dBbb"&gt;Engineers are racing to fix a failed piece of equipment on NASA’s future deep-space crew capsule Orion ahead of its first flight to space. It may require months of work to replace and fix. Right now, engineers at NASA and Orion’s primary contractor, Lockheed Martin, are trying to figure out the best way to fix the component and how much time the repairs are going to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ga7dwg"&gt;In early November, engineers at Lockheed Martin working on Orion noticed that a power component inside the vehicle had failed, according to an internal email and an internal PowerPoint presentation seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Known as a power and data unit, or PDU, the component is a “main power/data boxes,” according to the email, responsible for activating key systems that...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7QychB"&gt;Cyber Monday is here. It’s the last big shopping opportunity of 2020, and if you didn’t already take advantage of some deals that debuted over the weekend, now’s your chance. Every retailer has debuted at least a few new deals earlier than ever, and we’re focused on adding them here — in addition to the great Black Friday deals you can still get. As you’re expecting, there are some great deals on gaming laptops, wireless noise-canceling headphones, earbuds, tablets, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHCSuC"&gt;We’ll be doing our best to keep this post updated during Cyber Monday, and stay tuned throughout Cyber Week as we give you as many chances as possible to get everything on your holiday wish list. We’ve put the latest deals right at the top for easy viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and they offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are commonly discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offer noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the second-generation AirPods, the more expensive second-generation AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;

    <title>The best Cyber Monday deals on Apple devices</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5VU3Q"&gt;It’s rare that Apple slashes the prices on its own products. Fortunately, other retailers are putting a lot of Apple products on sale for Cyber Monday. A bunch of retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Walmart, and Woot are slashing the prices on everything from wearables to its wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIuihu"&gt;Additionally, the online Apple store will have a special promotion on Friday, November 27th, and running until Monday, November 30th. The promotion will allow &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you to get up to $150 in an Apple gift card&lt;/a&gt; if you purchase an eligible product during the four-day event as listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VKYPYw"&gt;Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy an &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-3#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Zoom once again quadrupled its revenue year over year</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RKqzvc5CfsvegvB3qZOz9WRijM0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68037848/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1SdCFH"&gt;Zoom is doing pretty well. The company reported $777.2 million in revenue during &lt;a href="https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-reports-results-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2021"&gt;its third quarter&lt;/a&gt;, well over 4x its revenue from the same quarter last year. That’s now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408902/zoom-2-quarter-earnings-revenue-profit-pandemic"&gt;two quarters in a row&lt;/a&gt; that Zoom’s revenue has quadrupled. Zoom expects to quadruple its revenue year over year once again in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lj2SYX"&gt;The immense success should come as no surprise. Zoom became the go-to videoconferencing app at the start of the pandemic, and it’s managed to hold on to that spot even as other services — like Google Meet, Slack, and Microsoft Teams — have increasingly vied for attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FEUf4"&gt;Zoom doesn’t state how many users it has in total, but its metrics around paying customers continue to grow. The company now has 433,700 subscribers with more...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple hires venture capitalist Josh Elman to help improve App Store discovery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Dg9xmdKPggJ8NEjsgETIPTJO84=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68035850/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5GQi5r"&gt;Apple has hired Josh Elman, a prominent venture capitalist and former vice president of product at stock-trading app Robinhood, to help it improve iOS app discovery in the App Store. Elman announced the news via his Twitter account on Monday, saying he’s also leaving his role as a board partner at the firm Greylock Partners and as a board member of prominent tech companies like Discord and Medium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4JjGX"&gt;Elman joining the App Store team may help improve the iPhone maker’s relationship with developers after a rather rough year in which Apple’s stewardship of the App Store has been called into question by critics, rivals, and regulators. For instance, Elman is previously a board member of and investor in Houseparty, the chat app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662708/epic-games-houseparty-acquisition-fortnite-video-chat"&gt;acquired by &lt;em&gt;F...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rGB7RG"&gt;Let’s be honest: gaming is expensive, but the holiday season is a good time to take advantage of deals and sales and buy more than one game. Whether you are adding games to your personal library for your backlog, or you are planning to buy some games for a friend or family member, retailers like Amazon, GameStop, and Target have various discounts on titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0KAAJ"&gt;If you are planning to buy a PS5 or an Xbox Series X / S during this time, please keep in mind that both are in high demand, limited supply, and are receiving irregular restocks at retailers. But if you are looking for games on PS4, Xbox One, and Switch, there are many deals available right now. If you own a next-gen console, several of these games on PS4 and Xbox One are either...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yrgydV"&gt;Smart homes are no longer just for the rich or digital experimenters. Your speakers, locks, lights, security cameras, and kitchen utensils can now be controlled via your phone or other digital device — and there are a lot of products to choose from. Many of which are going for less during this year’s Cyber Monday event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDmu9C"&gt;You can start with a simple smart speaker from Google, Amazon, or Apple, and then add some smart bulbs or a security camera. Use a smart display to make controlling your home even easier and to communicate instantly with a friend or relative. And you can make your home internet fast and accessible with a mesh network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qz4xCb"&gt;We’ve listed below all of the best deals we could find on home tech, and we’ll keep it updated as the...&lt;/p&gt;
