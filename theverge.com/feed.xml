    <title>Google settles with worker allegedly fired for his workplace activism</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6N0gM6"&gt;Google reached a settlement with a fired employee who the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claims was let go from the company for his workplace activism, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/google-settles-with-employee-allegedly-fired-for-activism?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The employee, Laurence Berland, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20983053/google-fires-four-employees-memo-rebecca-rivers-laurence-berland-union-busting-accusation-walkout"&gt;fired in 2019&lt;/a&gt; allegedly for violating Google’s data security policies. He had been a vocal critic of Google’s work with the US Customs and Border Protection and was terminated amid internal organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nS1ix5"&gt;The settlement was approved in July by the NLRB, though the terms haven’t been revealed, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Google hasn’t replied to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JGpO7"&gt;The NLRB has accused Google of violating labor law &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421969/google-illegally-firing-three-workers-nlrb-president-biden"&gt;in firing Berland and four other workers in 2019&lt;/a&gt; over organizing activities and is still battling Google...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood opens up a slow and steady approach to crypto investing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dDfHN7"&gt;Robinhood is &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/9/8/crypto-recurring-investments-are-here"&gt;rolling out a new feature&lt;/a&gt; that lets you automatically invest in cryptocurrencies on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule. The investment app says this service will let you automatically invest in things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and &lt;a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/commission-free-cryptocurrency-investing/"&gt;other supported cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; without a commission fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNfTJL"&gt;Before we go any further, though, I should warn you that nothing in this article is qualified or expert financial advice. It’s probably wise to talk with an expert who can help you come up with an investment strategy that’s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJnKju"&gt;Robinhood’s approach here is automatic investing, not trading. It won’t sell the crypto for you when an algorithm decides it’d make financial sense to do so. Instead, it’s just steadily building...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Addison Rae signs Netflix film deal after going from TikTok to He’s All That</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="“He’s All That” Special Screening" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1BHQXVzFpM6AHTUMpvA-grxOMc=/0x0:4988x3325/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831966/1336432090.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xd8D2W"&gt;Netflix is doubling down on TikTok star Addison Rae with &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/addison-rae-enters-multi-picture-creative-partnership-with-netflix"&gt;a new multi-picture film deal&lt;/a&gt; that could see the social media celebrity bringing even more eyes to the streaming service, As part of the deal, Netflix will develop projects specifically for Rae to star in and executive produce (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/addison-rae-tiktok-netflix-hes-all-that-1235052075/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e15qed"&gt;The motivation seems to be the early success of &lt;em&gt;He’s All That&lt;/em&gt;, the gender-swapped remake of &lt;em&gt;She’s All That, &lt;/em&gt;which&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433195/tiktok-influencer-addison-rae-miramax-gender-swapped-shes-all-that-remake"&gt;first announced in September 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The company projects the film will be watched by more than 55 million households in the first month of release and says it reached #1 on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21151327/netflix-top-10-list-homepage-subscribers-originals-licensed-movies-tv-shows"&gt;the company’s chart&lt;/a&gt; “in 78 countries, including Brazil, France, and Saudi Arabia.” Critical reception to&lt;em&gt; He’s All That&lt;/em&gt; has been mixed, from &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22643642/hes-all-that-review-netflix-remake"&gt;surprisingly...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The LAPD built collecting social media info into its interview process for civilians</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zANvuB"&gt;The Los Angeles Police Department asked officers to gather social media information as a standard part of their interviews with civilians, whether or not the people were implicated in a crime. The practice, revealed in public records &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/lapd-documents-reveal-use-social-media-monitoring-tools"&gt;obtained by the Brennan Center for Justice&lt;/a&gt;, is part of a larger LAPD social media monitoring strategy — one that’s similar to other US police department policies but may go beyond them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JigbTU"&gt;As the Brennan Center notes, &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/D.%20Beck%20FI%20Memo%202015.pdf"&gt;a 2015 memo&lt;/a&gt; from LAPD Police Chief Charlie Beck told the department that “similar to a nickname or an alias, a person’s online persona or identity used for social media and communication can be highly beneficial to investigations and possibly even future outreach programs.” Beck said that officers...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund pledges $150 million to climate justice groups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v96T8M"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ $10 billion Earth Fund just doled out millions more in funding to groups fighting off climate change. This time, a lot of the cash is going to groups that advocate for communities of color and low-income neighborhoods, which often face the first and worst effects of climate change and fossil fuel pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmBMCI"&gt;The fund &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-grants-from-the-bezos-earth-fund-emphasize-climate-justice-pro-jobs-climate-action-and-innovation-in-decarbonization-301370952.html?tc=eml_cleartime"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a total of $203.7 million in new grants today. Of that, more than $53 million will go toward communications on climate change and efforts to cut emissions from businesses. Another $20 million will go to groups focused on climate justice — a movement to stop climate change from taking a disproportionate toll on already marginalized communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mbgybv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A movement to stop climate change from taking a...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id="0b7sTV"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;lots of expectations for a new Series 7 model&lt;/a&gt; ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event on September 14th&lt;/a&gt;, however, the new editions might bring larger sizes in addition to higher price points than we often see with the current models. Each Apple Watch offers ample functionality, and has seen more than its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>NASA sets new date for James Webb Space Telescope launch</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JxScVZ"&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope, humanity’s next big space-bound eye on the cosmos, has a new launch date of December 18th, NASA announced on Wednesday. It’s the latest among dozens of other delays for a telescope that was originally planned to go to space as early as 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HK0luF"&gt;The $8.8 billion observatory, named after NASA’s second administrator, is a tennis court-sized successor to NASA’s famed Hubble telescope. Its 18 hexagonal gold-plated mirrors will allow the spacecraft to view distant planets and the far reaches of the universe with a level of detail that far surpasses Hubble’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeY4hp"&gt;Astronomers have been looking forward to the telescope’s launch for years, but its development has been set back by years of delays, development...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Whoop’s new fitness tracker is better thanks to a battery breakthrough</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xbxLslNmTUuEVtEf83IsE90XYg=/189x0:2211x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831427/WHOOP_SILA_2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1TIDKy"&gt;Fitness company Whoop has a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/introducing-whoop-4-0-and-whoop-body-featuring-any-wear-technology-301371503.html"&gt;new tracker&lt;/a&gt; that squishes five LEDs, four photodiodes, a pulse oximeter, skin temperature sensor, and more into a package that is 33 percent smaller than its predecessor — all while still offering five days of battery life. But a particular change to the tracker’s battery chemistry is one of the biggest reasons Whoop was able to do all this in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzdMa6"&gt;The change was pioneered by a Silicon Valley company called Sila Nanotechnologies, which was co-founded in 2011 by Gene Berdichevsky, one of Tesla’s earliest employees. And it’s one that, if it scales up, could help break some of the biggest limitations currently facing lithium-ion technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXy9i0"&gt;On paper, it’s a simple change: the battery’s anode is now...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase says SEC threatened lawsuit over Lend feature</title>

  &lt;p id="uFYqWA"&gt;Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase seems to have some issues with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over a planned feature that lets people lend cryptocurrency through its platform. &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009"&gt;In a Medium post&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, Coinbase’s chief legal officer wrote that the regulatory agency threatened to sue the company if it launched the feature. Coinbase’s CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439291715358721?s=20"&gt;posted a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday evening saying that the SEC wasn’t clear about what it wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSmRbh"&gt;According to Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, the company told the SEC about its new Lend feature as a courtesy but didn’t anticipate pushback, based on his impression that similar features exist on other platforms. However, according to Armstrong, the SEC informed the company that the lend...&lt;/p&gt;
