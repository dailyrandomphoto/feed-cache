    <title>Apple Music might be coming to PS5</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KPD4mi"&gt;Spotify has been a music streaming option on the PS5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528372/ps5-streaming-apps-support-day-one-netflix-disney-plus-twitch"&gt;since it launched in November&lt;/a&gt;, giving you the option to listen to your favorite music when playing games. Soon, though, the console might get support for another service: Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CNfL8"&gt;The first clue came earlier this week when a Reddit user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/q68jxg/since_when_was_this_a_thing_i_made_a_new_account/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link"&gt;posted a picture&lt;/a&gt; of Apple Music appearing in the PS5’s music menu. The option apparently showed up after they made a new account and tried to link it with Spotify. It seems the app didn’t work, though — the Reddit user also shared a photo of a message that said, “This app is playable only on PS4,” which &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; says is a standard error message when an app isn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>IndiEV reveals electric car with a built-in gaming PC but not much else</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b0rCy1P2xWOxn5E_lfo9k4yWpB0=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69996587/EV3A4269.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nm04mj"&gt;There’s a new electric vehicle startup breaking cover in California, making bold claims and teasing pie-in-the-sky ideas while remaining guarded about its founder and origin story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afXIPa"&gt;If that sounds familiar, it’s because it’s a story that’s been playing out on repeat the last half-decade. This time, it’s a company called IndiEV, which emerged from stealth mode Thursday with a small prototype electric car called the Indi One that it says will start at just $45,000 — a car it boldly says will launch at the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM56Pb"&gt;Parts of the script are the same: IndiEV wants to power the Indi One with a scalable lithium-ion battery pack (that can be adapted to fit more affordable or expensive models or future vehicles); It wants to take advantage of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deathloop’s huge new update brings DLSS, DualSense audio for PC, crash fixes, and more</title>

Now, it appears Arkane Studios is coming fast and furious with the fixes and a little something extra as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esTha6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/5PwYCbups6Rw217NBm46gw/deathloops-game-update-1-now-available"&gt;A new 11GB update&lt;/a&gt; can add extra immersion to PC by letting you hear Julianna’s radio transmissions through a connected PS5 controller. Plus there’s brand-new support for Nvidia DLSS, letting you potentially eke out a substantial amount of extra performance if you’re willing to exchange your native resolution for a slickly AI-upscaled version. (The game supported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;AMD’s rival FSR&lt;/a&gt; from the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pressure mounts on Amazon and App Store discrimination in new bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Judiciary&amp;amp;nbsp;Hearing Examining Texas Abortion Law" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EAgY24Qll4PShIsoqKrUHnwBqfQ=/2x0:4325x2882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69996120/1235582856.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23lhwP"&gt;After months of hearings and negotiations, pressure is growing in the Senate to pass new laws banning online platforms from giving preference to their own products and services over those of their competitors. On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators announced plans to introduce a nondiscrimination bill that could reshape Amazon’s online marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nC5IJK"&gt;The American Choice and Innovation Online Act, led by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), would prevent platforms like Amazon, Apple, and Google from using their dominance to disadvantage other companies and competitors that use their platforms. In June, House lawmakers voted out a bill sharing the same name from the Judiciary Committee. Klobuchar’s Senate version isn’t...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I have a hard time believing your wearable is good if you had to Photoshop it onto a model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KGvbmEKJq6-eGyqTxZfri_UVOvs=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69996004/me_time_1_1920.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wqhndD"&gt;Wearable gadgets live or die on whether they’re actually comfortable to &lt;em&gt;wear — &lt;/em&gt;it’s tough to recommend a fitness tracker that gives me a rash or a headset constantly dragging my head down. So, for HTC’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22713276/htc-vive-flow-vr-headset-launch-price-hands-on"&gt;new, exceptionally light Vive Flow VR headset&lt;/a&gt;, the company wanted to show just how effortlessly it might fit into your life, commissioning pictures of men and women wearing it in their cozy living rooms without a care in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9wG4J"&gt;One rather important reason &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they don’t seem to care: they’re not&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;wearing it at all. It’s photoshopped. The woman in the photo above was actually photographed with a bowl of popcorn, not a headset or a phone. Here’s what the original looks like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.istockphoto.com%2Fphoto%2Fgirl-on-the-sofa-in-the-living-room-eating-popcorn-gm1199696793-343351767&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F10%2F14%2F22726604%2Fhtc-vive-flow-wearable-photoshopped-wearable-models-stock-images" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at istockphoto.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook starts rolling out end-to-end encrypted backups to WhatsApp</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aohsGf"&gt;WhatsApp’s end-to-end encrypted chat backups for iOS and Android are available starting Thursday, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/end-to-end-encrypted-backups-on-whatsapp/"&gt;Facebook announced&lt;/a&gt;. The company has offered end-to-end encryption for chats for years, but with this new change, you can get that same level of encryption with your backups. The feature will be rolling out “slowly” for people on the latest version of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAnc07"&gt;WhatsApp backups are stored in iCloud or Google Drive, but that means that Apple or Google could hand over the backups to governments or law enforcement if compelled. With the change available on Thursday, you can secure your WhatsApp cloud backups with a password or a 64-digit encryption key, which theoretically means that no one else but you will be able to access the backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9UODV"&gt;You can...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal’s founder is trolling with an NFT that’ll turn to shit if you buy it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ygwQr6"&gt;Secure messaging app Signal’s founder Moxie Marlinspike is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/moxie/status/1448066579611234305"&gt;doing a bit of trolling&lt;/a&gt; by releasing an NFT that shows up differently depending on what platform you’re looking at it on — and that will, allegedly, display as a poop emoji in your wallet if you actually buy it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htTl2i"&gt;He seems to be doing this to point out the potential fragility of NFTs, which are supposed to act as a sort of permanent record of owning a piece of art or media. They’re unique digital tokens that are stored on the blockchain, but in most cases, it’s actually just the record that lives on the chain — the image is stored elsewhere. That means that people shelling out hundreds of thousands of dollars for them could be at the mercy of image hosts who are operating...&lt;/p&gt;
