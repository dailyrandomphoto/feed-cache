    <title>Twitter permanently bans Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Donald J. Trump..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UtfFFpp7jfX6inoUrkzkGj_tSM=/0x0:5505x3670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68641193/1223057457.10.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9BWTi"&gt;Twitter permanently banned President Donald Trump on Friday, days after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol leaving five dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uXIs8"&gt;“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?s=20"&gt;in a statement Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="au8oLY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;After close review of recent Tweets from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@realDonaldTrump&lt;/a&gt; account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.&lt;a href="https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y"&gt;https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkSCC2"&gt;The ban comes after the president incited a mob that broke into the US Capitol building, disrupting Congress’ certification of Joe Biden as the President Elect. Twitter initially put a 12-hour ban on Trump’s account for “repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy” after he posted messages repeating lies that the election was stolen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygTtKY"&gt;At the time, Twitter said Trump would be banned permanently if he continued to violate its rules, including those around civic integrity or violent threats. Twitter said in a statement Friday that two new tweets posted since Trump’s initial suspension violated the platform’s rules, prompting the permanent suspension. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAzEDjOtMBq8lFfqzrh2uLiV0Mo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223529/Screen_Shot_2021_01_08_at_3.22.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter permanently suspending President Donald Trump’s Twitter account Friday evening.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OBmP9k"&gt;“Due to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html"&gt;in its Friday blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYjq67"&gt;Twitter decided the new tweets were “highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts” at the Capitol, and shared its reasoning in five parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UOHV0r"&gt;President Trump’s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103015493361664"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103016311259136"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an “orderly transition” on January 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A91mvh"&gt;The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a “safe” target, as he will not be attending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtqrZ8"&gt;The use of the words “American Patriots” to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXDAjH"&gt;The mention of his supporters having a “GIANT VOICE long into the future” and that “They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an “orderly transition” and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VbraO"&gt;Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jFrZa1"&gt;Earlier Friday, more than 300 Twitter employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221386/twitter-employees-trump-ban-internal-letter-capitol-attack"&gt;signed onto an internal petition&lt;/a&gt; calling for Trump to be permanently banned following the January 6th Capitol riots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVBVy8"&gt;“We must examine Twitter’s complicity in what President-Elect Biden has rightly termed insurrection. Those acts jeopardize the wellbeing of the United States, our company, and our employees,” the employees wrote in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltCwtD"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook put an “indefinite” ban on Trump&lt;/a&gt; that it said would last at least through Inauguration Day. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the risks “are simply too great” to allow Trump continued access after he used the platform to “incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwGgn6"&gt;The suspension has been a long time coming. For years, Twitter has faced pressure to remove Trump from its platform due to the large megaphone it’s offered him to spread hateful language and lies. The company justified his continued presence on the platform as being in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John Legere is considering becoming the Un-Candidate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xg6u0TRkhDWfxnBQf1GFY7rWTSs=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640329/JohnLegere_batman.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: John Legere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U6Gzx8"&gt;John Legere, former T-Mobile CEO and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/7/10729714/john-legere-carrier-bullshit"&gt;aspiring Batman&lt;/a&gt;, has reacted to the mob that attacked the Capitol like many other political and business leaders by calling for President Donald Trump to step down. But he’s also going a step further by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1347374021495681024?s=19"&gt;considering a run for political office himself&lt;/a&gt;. Legere left his post as CEO and member of T-Mobile’s board after successfully negotiating the merger between the company and Sprint, so he very well could be looking far and wide for his next gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzfrsy"&gt;Legere’s time as T-Mobile’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/mobile/2013/3/26/4149204/tmobile-new-direction-no-contracts-lte-uncarrier"&gt;turned the company into the “Un-Carrier,”&lt;/a&gt; a plan that came with an end to contracts, revamped mobile plans, and a variety of freebies and perks for customers designed to set T-Mobile apart from its longtime rivals AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon. But what would political candidacy — or un-candidacy — look like for Legere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sPHao7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For the first time in my life I am actually considering the possibility of running for office. It’s clear somebody needs to help real Americans find change. I’m not sure I’m capable, but I can’t stand by simply watching this craziness.&lt;/p&gt;— John Legere (@JohnLegere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1347374021495681024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8XygjM"&gt;Well, if it’s anything like his Un-Carrier moves, it could be a mixed bag. Legere &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/6/3/11852870/t-mobile-legere-montage"&gt;was brash and unafraid to roast the competition&lt;/a&gt;, and his attitude and leather jackets lean more un-presidential (or Cool) than anything else. But given the last four years we’ve had, we’re probably all used to the unconventional at this point. Tone matters less than not attempting to dissolve democracy, so the bar is low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFWyyr"&gt;In terms of policy, popular proposals like &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/24/21151143/bernie-sanders-2020-polls-medicare-for-all"&gt;Medicare-for-all&lt;/a&gt; fit nicely within the logic of Legere’s Un-Carrier programs. A large part of Un-Carrier’s offering was zero-rating data from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/18/5822996/t-mobile-music-freedom-net-neutrality"&gt;certain music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9704482/t-mobile-uncarrier-binge-on-netflix-hbo-streaming"&gt;video streaming services&lt;/a&gt; so it wouldn’t count against T-Mobile customers’ bills. Why not do the same thing with costly medical expenses? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Vj3ug"&gt;Of course, this opens up another can of worms. Legere was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/10/7190109/do-you-want-net-neutrality-or-not-john-legere"&gt;publicly in support of net neutrality&lt;/a&gt; while he was CEO but pushed programs that flaunted it. Those zero-rating schemes, like Binge On and T-Mobile’s other perks, actively favored the services that struck a deal with the company. A healthy internet and a strong Federal Communications Commission might not be at the top of Legere’s priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBl3s7"&gt;There’s no telling how serious Legere actually is or if a run would involve him appearing as the heightened version of himself that made him the unofficial mascot of T-Mobile, but there is a precedent. Executives from the wider world of the tech industry, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-feb-10-me-whitman10-story.html"&gt;like former HP CEO Meg Whitman&lt;/a&gt;, have made attempts to hold a political office, and a businessperson thinking they could fix the country or a state in the same way they juice quarterly revenue is a common theme in modern US politics. I’m not holding my breath for a T-Mobile magenta paint job for the White House or press briefings styled as keynotes, but god it would make a good story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Looks like Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro and SmartTags are a lock for January 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SbbyOY1_iDrZfzRaeGwmNzlwzwg=/457x0:2043x1057/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639957/e31b969143b271229f5243aae0fc864fd5f050c10f701deba1a172fab2d354f7.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The upcoming Galaxy Buds Pro collection.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/profile/evan" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="liR6Ii"&gt;Samsung is widely expected to announce its Galaxy S21 lineup of phones at its upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;January 14th event&lt;/a&gt;, and now it looks like we can safely assume that Samsung will launch its next true wireless headphones and its Tile competitor at the event as well. A leaked marketing render of a promotion offering either the unannounced Galaxy Buds Pro or a Galaxy SmartTag alongside a preorder of the Galaxy S21 Ultra was shared by leaker Evan Blass &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/61Ghy7SP8QWvqhfLP7I1ZZldNbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223025/ErOyNTuXcAAjdh8__1_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The leaked marketing image of the promotion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JncsUe"&gt;A lot of information about both the Galaxy Buds Pro and the Galaxy SmartTags have hit the web recently, so it’s not a big surprise that we can expect to see them announced on January 14th. Details about the Galaxy Buds Pro have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/24/22198622/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-price-specs-active-noise-cancelation"&gt;leaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193235/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-3d-spatial-audio-leak"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;weeks&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212894/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-leak-hands-on-video-specs-features-battery-life-sound-quality"&gt;YouTuber even posted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/VAGUMP0xsio"&gt;a hands-on&lt;/a&gt; with the true wireless headphones on January 3rd. We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/1/22209216/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-tile-item-tracker-leak"&gt;also seen photos&lt;/a&gt; of the SmartTag tracker, which is rumored to be a Tile-like tracker that uses Bluetooth to connect with nearby devices, thanks to filings spotted on Taiwan’s telecom regulator’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPw2uc"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro may be a preorder gift that’s exclusive to the (presumably more expensive) Galaxy S21 Ultra, though. If you opt to preorder the Galaxy S21 or S21 Plus, you’ll be able to get a free pair of Samsung’s bean-shaped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; instead, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1347506216596086785"&gt;Twitter user @TheGalox_&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zdujsb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In most countries, Samsung will also have the same pre-order gifts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Galaxy Buds Live &amp;amp; Smart Tags when you pre-order the S21 or S21+&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro &amp;amp; Smart Tags when you pre-order the Galaxy S21 Ultra &lt;a href="https://t.co/vnbucTbmPQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vnbucTbmPQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Anthony (@TheGalox_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1347506216596086785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPoa6V"&gt;We’re just under a week away from Samsung’s January 14th event, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering everything from the big day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Successor to HMD’s Nokia 6.2 leaks with side-mounted fingerprint sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/afb8Zcj6DtxEHhoztues6VpTWFo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639112/d3288e72a4fef4453a86cd253218179b1b80e192eb9c16d05a402079e57cb971.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new phone has an extra rear camera compared to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-the-new-and-affordable-nokia-63-64—1610066614-289532428" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Hemmerstoffer / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="abYfuu"&gt;Renders of what’s believed to be the Nokia 6.3 or 6.4 have leaked online, giving us our best look yet at HMD Global’s upcoming affordable handset. The renders come to us via Steve Hemmerstoffer &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-the-new-and-affordable-nokia-63-64--1610066614-289532428"&gt;over on Voice&lt;/a&gt;. New for this model is a side-mounted fingerprint sensor embedded in the power button, which replaces the rear-mounted sensor on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/5/20850871/nokia-6-2-7-2-phones-revamp-hmd-midrange-lineup-camera-features-specs-ifa-2019"&gt;2019’s Nokia 6.2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zENob4"&gt;Beyond this, there’s not a lot separating the Nokia 6.3 / 6.4 from the 6.2, which &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XW1G6NB?tag=gsmarena093-20&amp;amp;linkCode=osi&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently retails for $249 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still got a screen with a small teardrop-shaped notch, a headphone jack, and a circular camera array on its rear. However, Hemmerstoffer reports that the screen could be bigger at 6.45 inches rather than 6.3 inches, and it has four cameras on its rear, up from three last time. &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_6_3_6_4_renders-news-47095.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; the fourth sensor is likely to be for macro shots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MxCQCU5dmtOGtEyiaMbs7ySeQBE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22222482/b0d4d9df850430313741c41b1bf3886db650a9f8912d944983c523399d12371b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-the-new-and-affordable-nokia-63-64%E2%80%941610066614-289532428" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Hemmerstoffer / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Otherwise, it’s a very similar phone to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2ldJ8S"&gt;There isn’t any indication of how much the phone is likely to cost as part of this latest leak, but &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; reports that it was previously rumored to be priced at €249 (around $306). Hemmerstoffer notes that we should see an announcement before April.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 2021 Moto G Stylus, Power, and Play focus on big batteries, bigger screens, and low prices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HhVmEsZiIWiYSTFvxd9za-92OnQ=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68637858/moto_phones.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Left to right) The Moto G Play, G Stylus, and G Power.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aYxogU"&gt;Motorola is kicking off 2021 with refreshes for its midrange Moto G lineup of phones with new versions of the Moto G Power, Moto G Stylus, and Moto G Play that promise low prices and days of battery life across the board. There’s also a new member of the Motorola One family called the Motorola One 5G Ace, which, at $399, takes the crown as Motorola’s cheapest 5G phone yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcDY5p"&gt;Once again, Motorola is set on offering an almost dizzying amount of low-priced phones that differ in price by just $30 to $50. The new Moto G Play will cost $169.99; the Moto G Power will offer $199.99 (for a 3GB of RAM / 32GB of storage model) $249.99 (for 4GB / 64GB) configurations; the Moto G Stylus will cost $299.99; and the Motorola One 5G Ace will cost $399.99. It’s a strategy that ensures there’s a phone at nearly every price point you could imagine, although it does make it slightly harder to choose between similar devices at such similar prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxL49Q"&gt;Motorola is sticking with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;same names&lt;/a&gt; for its new 2021 lineup — sadly, the days of the numerically differentiated Moto G models appear to have ended for good with 2019’s Moto G7 lineup. But the new phones do offer improvements big and small compared to their 2020 predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0FZt5Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10271765"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uDNUTA"&gt;The Moto G Play seems like the toughest sell of the bunch. While the $169 price tag is intriguing, the paltry 720p resolution — stretched across a comparatively huge 6.5-inch panel — raises concerns, as does the year-old Snapdragon 460 processor that’s markedly less powerful than either of the other two new 2021 Moto G phones. That’s especially true given that Qualcomm has already announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Snapdragon 480&lt;/a&gt;, which promises to be twice as fast and adds more premium features like 5G to the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fC1P55"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A midrange phone at every price point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PLMt53"&gt;There are some bright spots, too. The 2021 G Play has 3GB of RAM (putting it in a better position performance-wise than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286687/motorola-moto-e-2020-g-fast-review-price-specs-features"&gt;last year’s $149 Moto E&lt;/a&gt;) and a massive 5,000mAh battery that Motorola says should be good for up to three days on a charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bgeixj"&gt;The new G Power and G Stylus aren’t as similar as last year’s models. Where the 2020 models offered the same processor, screen, and design, the new models are distinctly different phones. The G Power offers a 5,000mAh battery, a 720p 6.6-inch display, and weaker Snapdragon 662, but the G Stylus makes an argument for its higher price tag with a stylus, a larger and higher-resolution 1080p 6.8-inch panel, and a more powerful Snapdragon 678 processor. (It does go down a notch in battery, only offering a 4,000mAh battery that’s good for up to two days off a charge.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVKMcD"&gt;The larger G Stylus also offers 4GB of RAM by default (unlike the G Power, which has both 3GB and 4GB models) and has more storage (128GB versus the G Power’s choice of either 32GB or 64GB). You also get some camera improvements on the G Stylus — while both phones feature a 48-megapixel main sensor (which shoots quad-pixel 12-megapixel shots), a 2-megapixel macro camera, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, the G Stylus also adds an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a better selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5yCvpYhyX9jjiomXuamGFMUeLMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220797/moto_one_5g_ace.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LGWjIi"&gt;Lastly, there’s the Motorola One 5G Ace, which (as the name indicates) isn’t quite in the same category as the other phones here. At $399, it’s Motorola’s cheapest 5G phone yet. And the weaker Snapdragon 750G 5G, downgraded cameras, and slower refresh rate display leave the One 5G Ace as more of a lower-priced version of the $499 Motorola One 5G that the company released last year than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k83wLD"&gt;All four new phones will be available unlocked through direct retailers on January 14th, with preorders starting today. Additionally, several of the new phones will also be released through major carriers in the future: the Moto G Play and Motorola One 5G Ace through AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, while the G Power will be sold by just Verizon. The G Stylus, meanwhile, will skip the major US carriers entirely, although Boost Mobile, Cricket, Consumer Cellular, and Republic Wireless will offer it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump returns to Twitter and promises a smooth transition of power</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Holds Campaign Rally For GOP Senate Candidates Ahead Of Runoff Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bn1-0MmJnhaEsmo-vqdcVGpaOew=/0x0:8192x5461/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635509/1294537766.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRutCc"&gt;Twitter has lifted its ban on President Donald Trump, and his latest tweet is very different than the ones we’ve seen for many months. Though he does not say he lost, his latest video feels like a concession speech. “Now that Congress has certified the results, a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th,” he says. “My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.” Trump had issued a similar statement about “an orderly transition” this morning &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103015493361664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1347103015493361664%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2021%2F01%2F07%2Ftrump-says-there-will-be-an-orderly-transition-of-power.html"&gt;through a surrogate account&lt;/a&gt; — that of White House social media director Dan Scavino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ5NaA"&gt;The president’s own account was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;locked on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; after a mob of his supporters broke into the US Capitol, and Twitter said it would stay that way until he deleted several tweets and then waited 12 hours. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed Thursday morning that the tweets in question had been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pgnNgK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/csX07ZVWGe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/csX07ZVWGe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1347334804052844550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xI8MDi"&gt;Trump returns to Twitter in a more tenuous position than ever before. The company said he’s now at risk of a permanent ban if he continues to violate Twitter rules around misinformation and incitement of violence. Once Trump leaves the White House on January 20th, he’ll also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21552606/trump-twitter-world-leader-public-interest-exception-ends-january-loss"&gt;lose special “public interest” protections&lt;/a&gt; that applied to his account while he was in office, which could make it easier for the company to enforce its rules over Trump tweets that cross the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMVCua"&gt;Twitter banned Trump on Wednesday over a series of tweets spreading lies about the election outcome and a video the company said posed a “risk of violence.” In that video, Trump reiterated his false claims that the election was stolen, praised the mob that broke into the US Capitol, and told them it was time to “go home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cG88Ns"&gt;Facebook and YouTube removed the same video from Trump. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook later “indefinitely” banned Trump&lt;/a&gt; due to his use of the platform to “incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government,” saying the risks are “are simply too great” of allowing him to remain. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the ban would remain in place at least through Inauguration Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IbUNaU"&gt;Trump’s new video still includes misinformation, specifically a lie that he “immediately” deployed the National Guard to the Capitol. However, Twitter says that it won’t be placing a label on the tweet due to that, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1347339743940419584"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;’ Ryan Mac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XeTwZ"&gt;Five people died during the Capitol riot, according to reports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s unlocked Pixel 4A 5G will soon be available in white</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lsm8XRv9v47E2sr0kORo1lLksKA=/0x3:1710x1143/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68634458/Screen_Shot_2021_01_07_at_3.35.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lj5MDZ"&gt;Up until this point, Google’s unlocked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt; has only been available in black for those who want the unlocked phone. A white option was exclusive to Verizon’s more expensive version of the device — more expensive because it includes millimeter-wave 5G. But soon, Google will be releasing a white model of the standard $499 unlocked Pixel 4A 5G for people who don’t want to pay the mmWave tax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1OeAu"&gt;I was browsing B&amp;amp;H Photo earlier today when I noticed &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1595334-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02294_us_pixel_4a_128gb_5g.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F7%2F22219305%2Fgoogle-pixel-4a-5g-unlocked-white-price-specs-release-date#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a listing for it&lt;/a&gt;, clearly labeled as a “new release.” Since there are photos of the phone, this didn’t seem to be a mistake — and Google has since confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the unlocked white Pixel 4A 5G will begin shipping on January 28th. Aesthetically, it’s identical to the Verizon version with a mint green power button. But you’re still only getting sub-6 5G — no surprise considering it’s the regular price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fv4Fh4"&gt;There were some decent discounts and sales on the Pixel 4A 5G over the holidays, so some of you might be bummed about making a purchase before this one came around. But at least you saved some cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PgxTx"&gt;If you’re keeping score, with the release of this version, that means the 2020 Pixel lineup will now be available in these color choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3irrJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 5, $699&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Green&lt;br&gt;Black&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdJZzR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 4A 5G UW, $599&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Black (with millimeter-wave 5G), &lt;em&gt;Verizon exclusive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;White (with millimeter-wave 5G), &lt;em&gt;Verizon exclusive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gV52W0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 4A 5G, $499&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Black (unlocked, sub-6 5G only)&lt;br&gt;White (unlocked, sub-6 5G only)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Aht4z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 4A, $349&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Black&lt;br&gt;Blue, &lt;em&gt;Google Store exclusive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal sees surge in new signups after boost from Elon Musk and WhatsApp controversy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Messenger apps on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ERlWDP9B9EUgH9dB9zDdzOHIc_U=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633906/1229931679.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Christoph Dernbach / picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ttWatW"&gt;Encrypted messaging app Signal says it’s seeing a swell of new users signing up for the platform, so much so that the company is seeing delays in phone number verifications of new accounts across multiple cell providers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pM3kHW"&gt;As for what or who is responsible for so many new users interested in trying the platform, which is operated by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, there are two likely culprits: Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Signal competitor WhatsApp.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eAVSUh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Verification codes are currently delayed across several providers because so many new people are trying to join Signal right now (we can barely register our excitement). We are working with carriers to resolve this as quickly as possible. Hang in there.&lt;/p&gt;— Signal (@signalapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1347240006444675072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bLpilt"&gt;Musk, who is now the world’s richest person &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;after surpassing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in net worth&lt;/a&gt;, tweeted a meme last night criticizing Facebook for its role in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217601/congress-capitol-building-takeover-coup-photos-pro-trump-mob"&gt;helping members of the mob that stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; organize online. The tweet, an image of a series of ever-larger dominos, juxtaposed the start of Facebook as a hot-or-not women-rating website on the campus of Harvard University all the way into a platform that in one way or another helped facilitate the attack on Congress on Wednesday while it attempted to certify Joe Biden as the president-elect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Aa37Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is called the domino effect &lt;a href="https://t.co/qpbEW54RvM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qpbEW54RvM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347031803987599360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UbZ1Ls"&gt;Musk, who has been more vocal in his criticism of Facebook in recent years, followed up the meme with a suggestion to his 41.5 million followers: download Signal, presumably instead of using a Facebook product (although Musk didn’t call out Facebook or WhatsApp specifically by name in either of his posts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6Ab0st"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Use Signal&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mDolUr"&gt;As for the WhatsApp controversy, that’s a bit more complicated. While it’s not immediately clear whether Musk was referencing or is even aware of the current WhatsApp privacy dustup, there is a growing backlash against the Facebook-owned messaging app resulting from the company’s plans to implement a new privacy policy on February 8th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9kFoy"&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/"&gt;great explainer from &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but the short version is that WhatsApp has outlined a new privacy policy going into effect next month that no longer includes language indicating it will allow users to opt out of data sharing with parent company Facebook. Instead, the new policy expressly outlines how WhatsApp will share data (stuff like your phone number, profile name, and address book info) with Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62cVrl"&gt;“As part of the Facebook family of companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information with, this family of companies,” the &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy"&gt;new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; says. “We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OtVAcJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook says its new privacy policy changes nothing about consumer data sharing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZsXFw"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;reports, the opt out hasn’t actually existed in the app for some time — it was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/26/12655518/how-to-stop-whatsapp-sharing-phone-number-facebook"&gt;one-time option introduced back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and WhatsApp’s privacy policy has kept language referencing it since. A Facebook spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the changes going into effect next month are designed to address data sharing between Facebook and WhatsApp with regard to messaging with businesses, and that nothing is effectively changing with regard to consumer chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7xm7V"&gt;Facebook says it disclosed these changes back in October with the announcement of &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;new WhatsApp customer service and shopping features&lt;/a&gt;, some of which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163106/whatsapp-carts-feature-shopping-in-app-ecommerce"&gt;went live last month&lt;/a&gt;. It also says it will honor any WhatsApp user’s opt-out preference, even though the option to opt out hasn’t been available for new users for years, &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/whatsapp-to-require-users-to-share-data-with-facebook-via-new-privacy-policy"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And if you live in Europe, WhatsApp won’t share data with Facebook for ad-targeting purposes under any circumstances, as clarified by Niamh Sweeney, WhatsApp’s director of policy for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa market, in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NiamhSweeneyNYC/status/1347183889995935744"&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o9WDi7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2/5 It has been incorrectly reported that WhatsApp's latest Terms of Service and Privacy Policy update requires users in the European Region to agree to the sharing of data with Facebook for ads purposes in order to continue using the service. This is false.&lt;/p&gt;— Niamh Sweeney (@NiamhSweeneyNYC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NiamhSweeneyNYC/status/1347184836323237889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ALsdXk"&gt;But what’s happening now appears to be a bit of context collapse on social media, as WhatsApp users think they’re now being forced to share data with Facebook even though that’s been happening all along if they didn’t opt out back in 2016. None of this is helped by Facebook and WhatsApp’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165152/whatsapp-privacy-apple-first-third-party-app-store-nutrition-labels"&gt;recent attacks on Apple&lt;/a&gt; for the iPhone maker’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;mandate new self-reported labels on iOS apps&lt;/a&gt; and its future plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;force app makers to request permission&lt;/a&gt; to track Apple device owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b54dxr"&gt;The new privacy policy notice doesn’t help Facebook’s cause, either, considering it tells users displeased with the changes — which, again, are about how businesses manage their chats on WhatsApp using Facebook’s backend — to “delete their account,” with no other remedies provided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obnfMl"&gt;All of this has created a perfect storm on social media in which WhatsApp users appear to be fleeing the platform in large numbers to join Signal, a nonprofit-run encrypted messaging app not owned by the largest social network on the planet. It’s worth mentioning too that Signal Messenger, LLC, the software organization that manages product development from Signal, was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/21/signal-expands-into-the-signal-foundation-with-50m-from-whatsapp-co-founder-brian-acton/"&gt;co-founded and funded by Brian Acton&lt;/a&gt;, the disillusioned WhatsApp co-founder who has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17145200/brian-acton-delete-facebook-whatsapp"&gt;publicly slammed his former employer’s privacy practices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmiL6X"&gt;The silver lining for Signal is that this combination of events is generating a whole lot of interest for its platform as both a viable mobile messaging app and alternative to the Facebook ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gWSrM"&gt;In response to the controversy, WhatsApp has issued a lengthy statement clarifying that the updated privacy policy “does not change WhatsApp’s data sharing practices with Facebook”: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UQjw5C"&gt;As we announced in October, WhatsApp wants to make it easier for people to both make a purchase and get help from a business directly on WhatsApp. While most people use WhatsApp to chat with friends and family, increasingly people are reaching out to businesses as well. To further increase transparency, we updated the privacy policy to describe that going forward businesses can choose to receive secure hosting services from our parent company Facebook to help manage their communications with their customers on WhatsApp. Though of course, it remains up to the user whether or not they want to message with a business on WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPHPbY"&gt;The update does not change WhatsApp’s data sharing practices with Facebook and does not impact how people communicate privately with friends or family wherever they are in the world. WhatsApp remains deeply committed to protecting people’s privacy. We are communicating directly with users through WhatsApp about these changes so they have time to review the new policy over the course of the next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UZ9vuQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 7th, 4:42PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from WhatsApp. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new app allows teachers to use their iPhone or iPad as an overhead camera on Zoom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the app that shows it acting as an overhead camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4PLvwcOTk0J0iTFrJEFy5eVDh-Y=/0x1733:1600x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68629107/iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABkAAAArwCAYAAAD8ZvemAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAJ8WlUWHRYTUw6Y29tLmFkb2Jl_2_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gD8eq4"&gt;Teachers who have found themselves holding class over Zoom have probably already figured out clever hacks to show their students documents, but there’s now an app designed specifically for that purpose (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/06/iphone-document-camera-overviewer-zoom"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Overviewer was made by developer Charlie Chapman, and it allows teachers (or anyone, really) to easily use their phone’s camera as a replacement for an overhead document viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyB2Z3"&gt;If it’s been a minute since you were a student, or if your school didn’t have these overhead devices, they’re basically webcams pointing straight down that allow teachers to show students a printed document, book, hand drawing, or other piece of writing or image. It’s a useful ability to have, but many teachers are working from home because of COVID and may not have access to one like they would in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Top-down view of a printed book, shown in a Zoom call" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lOMkD7BgbF4qsARgKTu2WSOXNC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217793/Screen_Shot_2021_01_06_at_9.24.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participants in the Zoom call only see what your phone’s camera sees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wdoQAj"&gt;Overviewer works as a replacement by taking advantage of Zoom’s built-in screen sharing feature that &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201379235-Sharing-your-screen-iOS-with-the-Zoom-Desktop-Client"&gt;works with the iPhone when its connected to a computer&lt;/a&gt; with a Lightning cable, or wirelessly through AirPlay (at the moment, it doesn’t seem like Zoom offers this feature for Android users). It shows a feed from your phone’s camera on the screen, with nothing else getting in the way. The feature also offers the ability to turn your phone’s flashlight on if your lighting situation isn’t ideal, as well as the option to change which camera is being displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLQyQW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2021/6/overviewer/"&gt;In a heartwarming blog post&lt;/a&gt; about how he developed the app for his wife, who works as a kindergarten teacher, Chapman explains how he saw his wife using iOS’s built-in camera app to do the same thing, and how she was frustrated by the lack of landscape support and all the buttons overlaid on-screen: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yr4Ppv"&gt;So being the dorky husband that I am, I quickly built an app that does nothing other than show what the phone camera sees with zero chrome, and properly rotates the whole app so that you can share it in landscape on zoom. This did the trick and she actually used it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y6IyY"&gt;It’s pretty tailor made for exactly my wife’s use case but I would think that would be a pretty common one for teachers to be in right now in our current virtual teaching world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3EdVoS"&gt;If you’re a teacher, or are thinking of some other use for the app, it’s &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1528900395"&gt;available for free on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth noting that if you’re using a Mac, Zoom will ask for permission to record your screen and have to be restarted in order to share your phone’s screen (this is because Zoom is just displaying your phone’s screen on your computer, and then capturing that window).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52K48v"&gt;For more information on how the app works, the developer has made a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fadOMMpQErg&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;how-to video&lt;/a&gt;, which you can watch below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IBH0TN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fadOMMpQErg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Verizon is pausing its 3G shutdown indefinitely</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yc-MECnplWZx7mqEH4gntj_KZC8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623912/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQDhUA"&gt;Verizon is indefinitely delaying the shutdown of its 3G network, pushing back the original plan for the network to shutter at the end of 2020 to an as-yet-undetermined point in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VjPhE"&gt;The news comes from Verizon spokesperson Kevin King, who &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ossbss/verizon-indefinitely-delays-3g-network-shutdown/d/d-id/766399?_mc=RSS_LR_EDT"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Our 3G network is operational and we don’t have a plan to shut it down at this time. We’ll work with customers to move them to newer technology.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qLqyX"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;, Verizon previously announced that it planned to shutter the 3G network at the end of 2020, which was already a delay. (The company originally intended to close the network at the end of 2019.) Now, it seems that Verizon is once again punting that decision down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKZsQA"&gt;The interesting part of this decision is that Verizon is making it solely for customers who are still using their existing 3G devices. The company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsupport%2Fknowledge-base-218813%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F5%2F22215453%2Fverizon-3g-shutdown-paused-delay-network-old-phones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;no longer allows&lt;/a&gt; customers to activate new 3G phones on its network (as of 2018), nor does it offer prepaid 3G service (as of 2019). Obviously, Verizon would prefer that its customers upgrade to new 4G LTE — or, at this point, 5G — plans (presumably with new phones that they’ll buy through the carrier). But the repeated delays in shutting down the 3G network seem to suggest that the transition isn’t going as fast as the company would like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OhRse"&gt;Verizon isn’t the only network working to move customers off of its legacy 3G network. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;recently advised&lt;/a&gt; its customers using 3G phones that it plans to shut down its 3G network sometime in early 2022, while T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21336397/t-mobile-require-support-volte-2021-5g-lte"&gt;reportedly looking&lt;/a&gt; to make voice over LTE (VoLTE) a requirement early this year. &lt;/p&gt;
