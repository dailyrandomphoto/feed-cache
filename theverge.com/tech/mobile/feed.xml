    <title>AT&amp;T is reportedly in talks to merge its media business with Discovery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vlDm8s"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery are in talks that would combine AT&amp;amp;T’s media business with Discovery’s reality-TV dynasty to create a massive new entertainment entity, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/at-t-is-said-in-talks-to-combine-content-assets-with-discovery-kor6r2uj?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources. Neither company confirmed the deal, but if it came to pass, the combined company would be a potentially significant competitor for streaming brands like Netflix and Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gm5ih"&gt;But as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, AT&amp;amp;T only recently added some major entertainment brands to its portfolio when it &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-m-a-at-t/att-closes-85-billion-deal-for-time-warner-idUSKBN1JA36U"&gt;acquired Time Warner for $85 billion&lt;/a&gt;, a deal that was finalized in 2018. And while AT&amp;amp;T’s streaming channel HBO Max has performed relatively well since its somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21268490/hbo-max-launch-price-warnermedia-att-dc-harry-potter-friends-disney-netflix-peacock"&gt;messy launch last May&lt;/a&gt;, it’s still not quite as robust as older streamers like Netflix. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212963/new-discovery-plus-streaming-channel-roku-hbo-peacock"&gt;Discovery launched its own streaming platform&lt;/a&gt; Discovery Plus, which launched with shows spun off from its Discovery Channel catalog, including a new &lt;em&gt;House Hunters&lt;/em&gt; series and new series from the creators of &lt;em&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUuVmy"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s WarnerMedia unit owns cable channels CNN, HBO, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and the Warner Bros. movie studio. Discovery’s offerings include cable networks HGTV, Food Network, and TLC. But as more people migrate away from traditional cable TV and to streaming options, most media companies are trying to find new ways to reach audiences.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODc2pC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s sources indicated a deal could be announced as early as this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter politely asks you to protect its targeted ad dollars in new iOS 14.5 prompt</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ubKsTG_gcfxb7B5-IGw6T3eiUqI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69290632/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="shKhfk"&gt;As part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; forces developers to ask permission for something they used to be able to do for free: track iOS users. Today, Twitter is joining the ranks of other developers and adding a prompt that asks users to enable tracking on iOS (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/14/twitter-app-tracking-transparency-support/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJ2nR0"&gt;Twitter’s main justification for listening to its request is straightforward — having the feature enabled allows it to serve “better” ads. The company includes a link to settings so you can make those changes, but read Twitter’s explanation before you decide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZXbtIX"&gt;Keep ads relevant to you by allowing Twitter to track data from other companies on this device, like apps you use and websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gEzkzL"&gt;The company also includes a link to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/about-ios-tracking"&gt;a support post&lt;/a&gt; in the Twitter help center which explains why it has to ask for permission, includes a link to its current App Privacy Policy, and goes over what enabling or disabling tracking does in iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SHLWi8XOwvk6Hm6F5shHPFyKnow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22515698/Image_23.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Twitter ad tracking prompt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bHoO3K"&gt;It’s a surprisingly low-key attempt to get users to allow Twitter to track them, considering the company highlighted Apple’s addition of App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14.5 as a potential risk in its recent &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1'21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;earnings statement (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KRFfUZ"&gt;We continue to expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021, assuming the global pandemic continues to improve and that we see modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14.5. How much faster will depend on various factors, including our execution on our direct response roadmap and macroeconomic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2fOfnN"&gt;Facebook and Instagram took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking"&gt;a far more aggressive approach&lt;/a&gt; to convince users its use of ad tracking is on the up-and-up — even going as far as including a vague threat that enabling tracking will “help keep Facebook/Instagram free of charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syShzs"&gt;Companies like Twitter and Facebook rely on tracking users to support their separate, often very lucrative ad businesses. After all, it’s usually ad sales that pay for free social networks,  and customer data helps to target those ads. As a company that’s more interested in selling hardware and subscription services, Apple doesn’t really have to worry about things like that, but brash changes like the new tracking permissions can leave developers scrambling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8Qksg"&gt;App Tracking Transparency has proven popular, though — around &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/"&gt;96 percent of US users&lt;/a&gt; are opting out of tracking according to some recent surveys. And with Google considering developing its own methods for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266823/google-anti-tracking-feature-android-privacy-apple-ios-app-tracking-transparency"&gt;blocking tracking on Android&lt;/a&gt;, we might just have to get used to apps coming to us and begging for free data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked renders reveal an even more affordable 5G Samsung phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ZAfjACwY8f9NyWLvRz0TSI92Eg=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69288778/a22_5g_render_91mobiles.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Images show what could become Samsung’s least expensive 5G phone, nabbing the A32 5G’s title.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: 91mobiles&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0akzLd"&gt;A new batch of leaked images shows what could become Samsung’s least expensive 5G phone yet: the Galaxy A22 5G. The Galaxy A32 5G currently holds that title at an already low $279. The images come from &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-a22-5g-4g-renders-specs-exclusive/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and match up with previous leaks hinting that the phone might be on its way with a 200,000 KRW price (~$180), though it may be only destined for India and parts of Asia in the immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNeDqF"&gt;The leaked images show two variants — 5G and 4G versions — with two slightly varied sets of specs. The 5G model will allegedly have a 6.4-inch LCD and a rear triple-camera array (probably a 48-megapixel main / macro / depth sensor combo). A MediaTek Dimensity 700 chipset looks likely, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/samsung-galaxy-a22-5g-spotted-on-geekbench/"&gt;previous &lt;em&gt;Geekbench&lt;/em&gt; leak&lt;/a&gt;, plus a substantial 6GB of RAM. The 4G model includes one additional rear camera and an OLED rather than LCD. They’re both expected to offer large 5,000mAh batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qWEWzJht9WJPHWtWQrDOCXNTW3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22515022/galaxy_a22_5g_image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 91mobiles&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaks suggest that the A22 5G will offer a 6.4-inch LCD, rear triple-camera array, and 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ95qB"&gt;There are a few other budget phones between the $200 and $300 mark offering 5G, including the Realme 8 5G for €199 (~$240) and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; for $300, but the A22 5G stands to become one of the first in the sub-$200 range, depending on how things shake out. In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;5G is still in a sorry state&lt;/a&gt;, but wireless carriers are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425022/verizon-t-mobile-att-phone-promotion-magenta-max-5g-c-band"&gt;racing to improve their networks&lt;/a&gt; and may be eager to stock their shelves with more aggressively priced 5G devices like the A22 5G soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1uOtk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maker of expensive Japanese toaster gets into smartphone business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Balmuda, the $230 Toaster From Japan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NeCaoMZFTxhN_weahLHvEaIx1uQ=/0x46:4000x2713/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69285400/544949442.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZjDnaN"&gt;Balmuda, a Japanese design company known for its stylish appliances, has &lt;a href="https://www.balmuda.com/jp/news/997"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to make a smartphone. There aren’t many details on the device itself yet, but it’ll be a 5G handset that’s expected to be released in November. SoftBank will sell it as a carrier model, while Balmuda will also offer an unlocked version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFJ85s"&gt;In its announcement, Balmuda notes that since the smartphone business is getting increasingly commoditized, the company wants to provide an experience that only it can. However, the actual manufacturing is out of Balmuda’s wheelhouse, so it’s partnering with Kyocera on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AVbR7V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Balmuda’s toaster sells for about $235 in Japan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X1ePyZ"&gt;Balmuda has a fairly limited product line for the home including air purifiers, humidifiers, lights, speakers, rice cookers, and so on. Its best known product is a toaster called “Balmuda The Toaster,” which sells for 25,850 yen (about $235, though it’s &lt;a href="https://store.moma.org/for-the-home/kitchen-dining/cookware-kitchen-tools/balmuda-the-toaster/13327.html"&gt;available in the US for $329 through the MoMa Design Store&lt;/a&gt;) and uses steam to ensure your &lt;em&gt;shokupan&lt;/em&gt;, among other things, is perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-03/meet-balmuda-the-230-toaster-from-japan"&gt;Bloomberg reported five years ago&lt;/a&gt; that it had become a cult hit in Japan with a three-month waiting time to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUPHwg"&gt;I have the toaster, and while I’m not sure I would necessarily recommend anyone spend $235 or $329 on a toaster, it is a pretty great toaster. The neat design touches everywhere, from the tiny little mug you use to pour in water for the steam to the cute noises it makes when you turn the timer dial, do make me somewhat curious as to what Balmuda could bring to a phone. We’ll let you know when we find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get an unlocked Google Pixel 3 for $160 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFj59s7JBVL0bYJjCB6kT3SYJbI=/0x0:1720x1147/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283574/Google_Pixel_3_Front_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fv8hjQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;Google Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; was one of the best Android phones of 2018, and though it might not be the showstopper it once was, it’s a standout if you can find it for the right price. Thankfully, if you’re looking to upgrade or take the plunge into the Android ecosystem, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=UnlockedGooglePixel3Woot051321&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgoogle-pixel-3-64gb-unlocked%3Fref%3Dw_ngh_dd_el" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is currently offering&lt;/a&gt; a 64GB, unlocked version of the Pixel 3 for $160 — a discount of $240.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvEh6q"&gt;Despite its age, the Pixel 3 remains more than capable with its Snapdragon 845 processor. The phone lacks a headphone jack and its bezels aren’t exactly small, but it packs a 5.5-inch OLED display and a terrific 12-megapixel rear camera, one capable of capturing vibrant shots and decent low-light photos. The Pixel 3’s dual front-facing cameras even churn out wide-angle selfies, while its support for wireless charging makes it one of the cheapest phones outside of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22425011/zte-blade-11-prime-review-price-specs-screen"&gt;ZTE Blade 11 Prime&lt;/a&gt; to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N2Vpz4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498496"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cu6NGw"&gt;Right now, Woot is selling the pink Verizon model, however, it’s compatible with most other US carriers, including AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;despite Google discontinuing the Pixel 3 in March&lt;/a&gt;, the phone will continue to receive software updates — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; — through October 2021. If you’re looking for a budget phone and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt; is still outside your price range, it’s hard to go wrong with the Google Pixel 3.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nokia’s nostalgia-invoking 2720 Flip is coming to the US on Verizon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qkXUUsZjtBn0NvNApvxQgmXBE0Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69282174/jporter_191001_3703_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2720 Flip is a feature phone with a classic design and access to modern apps.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RKpZG0"&gt;Have you been dreaming of consciously uncoupling from your smartphone? Ready to embrace a digital detox lifestyle but want to stay connected to your friends? Are you nostalgic for the days of tapping out messages in T9? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdxuST"&gt;Dream no more — HMD’s Nokia-branded 2720 Flip is arriving in the US soon. It’s an updated take on the classic flip phone, offering 4G connectivity and compatibility with modern apps like WhatsApp, Google Maps, and Facebook. Two years after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/5/20850793/nokia-2720-flip-phone-hmd-800-rugged-110-feature-phones-ifa-2019"&gt;launch in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, it’s coming to the US on Verizon on May 20th for $80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Pgrvw7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nokia 2720 Flip review: proof you can’t opt out of the smartphone generation","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20896976/nokia-2720-flip-phone-review-specs-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QUVsIM"&gt;While in concept the 2720 Flip sounds appealing if you’d like to spend less time staring at your smartphone, in practice we found it to be more frustration than it’s worth. Keeping up with WhatsApp conversations via T9 is difficult, and lack of compatibility with password managers and banking apps make it challenging to live with the Flip as your primary phone in 2021. Still, HMD and Verizon have reason to think that there are US customers for this phone, so nostalgia lives on for now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is the latest major company to skip MWC’s in-person show this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4IywQI3xUz-250OpuDNYG9PZtnA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280917/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zwVjAq"&gt;Qualcomm has announced that it will skip Mobile World Congress’ in-person show in Barcelona this year, making it the latest major company to announce that it will miss the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;potential COVID-19 superspreader event&lt;/a&gt; in June in favor of an online presence at the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ac822a"&gt;“While we appreciate the health and safety measures being put into place by the GSMA for MWC Barcelona, we have decided that it is in the best interest of our employees and customers for Qualcomm’s participation to be virtual this year,” the company said in a statement &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/qualcomm-wont-be-exhibiting-in-person-at-mwc/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAVkG2fo1pR2bTqIZSfKZd5kxZ9e2u3fNw5XNOikLFfzwDpFDDSR5ulJ9J4Dw_6DQwlpcS1II1EBJ-bdsmKcC-S6dgBjCDb6g3nQtVFinKW_ZUziSHkrdXCMbDpqsVpvX0D9bgpJkZHBWFqEvLCwXS_0NaOjmzdQxv_Tnxpe0wIP"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6K9zHH"&gt;Qualcomm is by no means the only major company opting for a digital appearance at MWC this year: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360692/google-mwc-mobile-world-congress-phone-2021-nokia-ericsson"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, Nokia, Ericsson, Sony, and Oracle have all pulled out of this year’s show entirely, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;Samsung and Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; have announced that they will also attend digitally instead of their traditional in-person appearances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ECaHxk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"MWC insists on holding potential COVID-19 superspreader event in Barcelona","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aChfGB"&gt;MWC 2020 was one of the first major conferences to shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123846/mobile-world-congress-gsma-coronavirus-lg"&gt;despite the GSMA’s attempts&lt;/a&gt; to try to put on the show, even with rapidly increasing case numbers around the world and new travel restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2JevQ"&gt;The GSMA is still insisting on holding this year’s event with only minimal COVID-19 mitigation policies, including asking attendees to have had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of their arrival and plans for “controlling crowd density” — neither of which is expected to be enough to prevent the spread of the coronavirus at an event this large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlRm5e"&gt;In 2020, MWC was only canceled after numerous major companies (like LG, ZTE, Sony, and Amazon) pulled out of the event. And while the GSMA has given no indication that it’ll be looking to adjust its plans for this year’s show yet, it’s possible the increasing number of  exhibitors that won’t be attending could change that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE’s S21 competitor arrives in June for $749</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKZwv8yTx3fMFytg5qxO3WiG2YI=/164x0:1373x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69279578/Axon_30_Colors_1536x806.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra features a large 6.67-inch screen with 144Hz refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="anuhJR"&gt;ZTE announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22384596/zte-axon-30-ultra-5g-specs-launch-us"&gt;Axon 30 Ultra alongside two other devices&lt;/a&gt; last month, and today reveals that the Ultra will go on sale June 4th starting at $749 / €749. Preorders begin &lt;a href="https://ztedevices.com/"&gt;directly through ZTE’s website&lt;/a&gt; on May 27th and include a free pair of ZTE’s Livebuds TWS earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSwaoC"&gt;While ZTE has tried some more adventurous things in its other devices that have missed the mark — an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16667508/zte-axon-m-dual-screen-smartphone-review"&gt;early attempt at a dual-screen phone&lt;/a&gt; and the world’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;under-display selfie camera&lt;/a&gt; for starters — the company is playing it straight with the Axon 30 Ultra. The phone is outfitted with cameras aplenty and high-end features, including a top-shelf Snapdragon 888 processor and a large 144Hz fast refresh rate display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAKyR5"&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra’s sub-$800 price tag positions it to undercut the $800 Samsung S21 and $1000 S21 Plus by a little or a lot, depending on which model you’re looking at and how deeply it’s discounted. Buyers in the US should be aware, though — the Axon 30 Ultra will only work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile, not Verizon, and its 5G connectivity is limited to one band (B41) on T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ZenFone 8 review: an Android iPhone mini</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The ZenFone 8 delivers flagship-level build quality and performance in a small package&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4C38dH"&gt;After a couple of generations making phones with flip-out cameras and increasingly large displays, Asus has taken the ZenFone 8 in a totally different direction: small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSrT9H"&gt;The flipping camera concept lives on in the also-new ZenFone 8 Flip, but it’s no longer a standard feature across this year’s ZenFone lineup. Instead, priced at €599 (about $730), the ZenFone 8 lands in the upper-midrange class with a conventional rear camera bump and a much smaller 5.9-inch display. As a side note, final US pricing is TBD — Asus says somewhere between $599 and $799 — but it will be coming to North America, unlike last year’s model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwwRdC"&gt;Rather than an attention-grabbing camera feature, the focus of this design has been to create a smaller phone that’s comfortable to use in one hand, which Asus has done without skimping on processing power or higher-end features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1hmwn"&gt;It’s an Android iPhone mini, and it’s fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u3cT9V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10494874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Go0J86tAcMmzjPPXSpyPncCJlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499353/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus designed the ZenFone 8 with one-handed operation in mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FW7hIJ"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 screen and design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IhH9SM"&gt;The ZenFone 8 may be small, but that hasn’t kept it from offering the latest flagship processor: a Snapdragon 888 chipset, coupled with 6, 8, or 16GB of RAM (my review unit has 16GB). I can’t find fault with this phone’s performance. It feels responsive, animations and interactions are smooth, and it keeps up with demanding use and rapid app switching. This is performance fitting of a flagship device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cElERS"&gt;The display is a 5.9-inch 1080p OLED panel with a fast 120Hz refresh rate that makes routine interactions with the phone — swiping, scrolling, animations — look much more smooth and polished than a standard 60Hz screen or even a 90Hz panel. By default, the phone will automatically switch between 120 / 90 / 60Hz depending on the application to save battery life, but you can manually select any of those three refresh rates if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EFkcZ"&gt;The display’s 20:9 aspect ratio was carefully considered by Asus. The company says it settled on this slightly narrower format so the phone would fit more easily into a pocket, and it does. I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits. More importantly, it fits well inside a jacket pocket and doesn’t feel like it’s going to flop out if I sit down on the floor to tie my shoes. The ZenFone 8 is rated IP68 for dust protection and some water submersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2grdcK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o69ULu"&gt;The front panel is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus and houses an in-display fingerprint sensor, while the back uses Gorilla Glass 3 with a frosted finish that’s on the matte side of the matte / glossy spectrum. The front panel is flat, but the rear features a slight curve on the long edges for an easier fit in the hand. At 169 grams (5.9 ounces), it’s heavy for its size, and it feels surprisingly dense when you first pick it up. The phone’s frame is aluminum, giving the whole package a high-end look and feel. There’s even a headphone jack on the top edge as a treat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8XM4b"&gt;The power button (an exciting shade of blue!) is well-positioned so my right thumb falls on it naturally with the phone in my hand. Same for the in-screen fingerprint sensor: the target appears to be positioned higher on the screen than usual, but that actually puts it within a comfortable reach of my thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w8VC5"&gt;I’ll admit up front that I have a personal bias toward smaller phones, but the ZenFone 8 just feels great in my hand. I’ve spent a lot of time using big devices over the last six months, and I’ve gotten used to it. But the ZenFone 8 is the first device that feels like it was adapted to &lt;em&gt;me,&lt;/em&gt; not something I’ve had to adapt to using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UuUZnwxRe3j921AYa4ifsE1k5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499355/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A smaller phone means a smaller battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kpaymP"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 battery and software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8mbHH8"&gt;The phone’s small size makes a smaller battery a necessity — 4,000mAh in this case, much smaller than the ZenFone 6 and 7’s 5,000mAh. I felt the difference in using this phone versus a battery-for-days budget or midrange phone, but I had no problem getting through a full day of moderate use. I even left Strava running for 20 hours by accident, and the battery still had some life in it the next morning. The ZenFone 8 supports 30W wired charging with the included power adapter, which takes an empty battery to 100 percent in a bit more than an hour. Wireless charging isn’t supported, which makes the ZenFone 8 a bit of an outlier in the flagship class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPNxId"&gt;Asus offers a ton of options to help stretch day-to-day battery life as well as the overall lifespan of your battery. There are no fewer than five battery modes to optimize phone performance or battery longevity on a daily basis, and different charging modes let you set a custom charging limit or stagger charging overnight so it reaches 100 percent around the time of your alarm for better battery health. You won’t find class-leading battery capacity here, but rest assured if you need to stretch the ZenFone 8’s battery, there are plenty of options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kj8abO"&gt;The ZenFone 8 ships with Android 11, and Asus says it will provide “at least” two major OS with security updates for the same timeframe. That’s on the low side of what we’d expect for a flagship phone, especially compared to Apple’s typical four- or five-year support schedule. An important note for US shoppers is that the ZenFone 8 will only work with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s LTE and Sub-6GHz 5G networks; you can’t use this phone on Verizon, and there’s no support for the fast, but extremely limited, millimeter-wave 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctgUaWF69tS9vSVEdPG5w8MwvQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507533/DSC00661_rear.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 offers standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8l2mPu"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MbIlch"&gt;There are just two cameras on the ZenFone 8’s rear camera bump, and they are both worth your time. Rather than cram in a depth sensor, macro, or some monochrome nonsense, Asus just went with a 64-megapixel main camera with OIS and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. They’re borrowed from last year’s model, minus a telephoto camera and the flipping mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5utE4G"&gt;As in the ZenFone 7 Pro, the 8’s main camera produces 16-megapixel images with vibrant color and plenty of detail in good light. Images can lean a little too far into unnatural-looking territory, and some high-contrast scenes look a little too HDR-y for my liking. But overall, this camera does fine: it handles moderately low-light conditions like a dim store interior well, and Night Mode does an okay job in very low light, provided you can hold the phone still for a few seconds and your subject isn’t moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bFBXWG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10494947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xx4klZ"&gt;A skin-smoothing beauty mode is on by default when you use portrait mode, and it is not good. Skin looks over-smoothed, unnaturally flat, and brightened, like your subject is wearing a couple of layers of stage makeup. Turning this off improves things significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBkFNw"&gt;The ultrawide camera also turns in good performance. Asus calls it a “flagship” grade sensor, and while that might have been true in 2018, it’s at least a step up from the smaller, cheaper sensors often found in ultrawide cameras. Likewise, the front-facing 12-megapixel camera does fine. Beauty mode is turned off by default when you switch to the selfie camera, and thank goodness for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maIBzp"&gt;There’s no telephoto camera here, just digital zoom. On the camera shooting screen, there’s an icon to jump to a 2x 16-megapixel “lossless” digital zoom to crop in quickly, which works okay, but it isn’t much reach, and it just makes the limitations of the small sensor and lens more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wAwwx"&gt;On the whole, the camera system is good but not great. The lack of true optical zoom or a telephoto camera is a disappointment, but you can’t have everything on such a small device, and I’d personally take an ultrawide before a telephoto any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2yyJwz2m9mIkB8t4cUpzDgDLbuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499354/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 doesn’t sacrifice a flagship experience to achieve its small form factor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZDiMQY"&gt;The ZenFone 8 fills a void in the Android market for a full-specced, small-sized device. The Google Pixel 4A is around the same size, but it’s decidedly a budget device with a step-down processor, plastic chassis, and fewer niceties like an IP rating or a fast-refresh screen. Aside from battery life, which is manageable, you give up very little in the way of flagship features to get the ZenFone 8’s small form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzbIbh"&gt;You have to look to iOS for this phone’s most direct competition: the iPhone 12 mini, which it matches almost spec-for-spec from the IP rating down to the camera configuration. The 12 mini is actually a little smaller than the ZenFone 8, and when you factor in storage capacity, it’s likely to be the more expensive choice at $829 for 256GB. However, when you consider that the 12 mini will probably get a couple more years of OS and security support, it may be the better buy in the long run, if you’re flexible in your choice of operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jc0CEI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEL2JQ"&gt;I like the ZenFone 8 a lot, but I’m not sure it’ll find a big audience, at least in the US. Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;having trouble selling the iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, and if there’s one thing Apple is good at, it’s selling phones to US customers. As much as I hate to entertain the idea, maybe we’ve gotten used to giant phones. I love how the ZenFone 8 feels in my hand and in my pocket, but I do notice how much smaller the screen and everything on it seems compared to the bigger phones I’ve used recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Etfrj"&gt;There are also a few important considerations, like the lack of compatibility with Verizon and the comparatively short support lifespan of the phone. If you need the absolute best in battery life the ZenFone 8 can’t offer that, and if you want a class-leading camera, you’ll need to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OIO7v3"&gt;All that said, the ZenFone 8 will be the right fit for a specific type of person, and I can heartily recommend it to my fellow small phone fans. You’ll get flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The T-Mobile / Sprint merger hasn’t created jobs — it’s ended them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0jsesPQ0YdAAwvd6TmSd7bniQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69271585/acasatro_180430_1777_sprint_Tmobile_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="84BbK6"&gt;T-Mobile promised its $26 billion merger with Sprint would add new jobs to the economy literally every single day, but a report from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobiles-hiring-pledge-is-off-to-a-slow-start-11620639002"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;confirms the newly combined company actually employs fewer people now than it did before the merger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkS7F9"&gt;Here’s how specific &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fnew-t-mobile-creating-jobs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F11%2F22429587%2Ft-mobile-sprint-merge-jobs-promise-pandemic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile’s promise was&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NkdxSM"&gt;So, let me be really clear on this increasingly important topic. &lt;strong&gt;This merger is all about creating new, high-quality, high-paying jobs, and the New T-Mobile will be jobs-positive from Day One and every day thereafter.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s not just a promise. That’s not just a commitment. It’s a fact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ny04YG"&gt;“Jobs-positive” would not be how I’d describe T-Mobile’s employment practices. The company employed 5,000 fewer people by the end of 2020 than it did before the merger, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; writes. And before you blame the COVID-19 pandemic, you should know that  wireless executives who spoke to &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; said that shrinking the number of jobs was always part of the plan — the pandemic just sped up planned &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/coronavirus-retail-workforce-faces-permanent-decline.html"&gt;job loss on the retail side&lt;/a&gt; of T-Mobile’s business. In fact, T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293293/tmobile-sprint-merger-layoffs-hundreds-biso-jobs-cut"&gt;laid off hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of Sprint’s inside sales team just a few months after its merger was completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqaabC"&gt;In addition to the “jobs-positive from day one and every day thereafter” claim, which now appears to have been a blatant lie, T-Mobile also specifically promised it would add 11,000 jobs by 2024. Instead, it appears to be moving in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYQ9p5"&gt;We were warned this would happen. &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-sprint-t-mobile-merger-jobs-20171010-story.html"&gt;Wall Street analysts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/sprint-t-mobile-merger-could-lead-thousands-job-losses-despite-n1134956"&gt;labor unions&lt;/a&gt; both predicted anywhere between 24,000 to 30,000 jobs could be lost if T-Mobile and Sprint got what they wanted. Telecom industry watcher Karl Bode wrote multiple articles for &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;highlighting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634195/t-mobile-sprint-merger-conditions-access-coverage"&gt;how meaningless&lt;/a&gt; the merger promises looked, comparing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962739/t-mobile-sprint-nextel-merger-prices-rural-coverage-promises"&gt;Sprint’s own history&lt;/a&gt; of post-merger layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v096vD"&gt;For some context, when Sprint was given the go-ahead to merge with Nextel in 2005, it made its own claims about how great its merger would be for the economy. Bode writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Lg96K1"&gt;Government filings had promised the FCC that the deal would “generate economic growth and jobs in the United States.” Then-Sprint CEO Gary Forsee told media outlets in 2005 that employees “shouldn’t expect to see a headline that there’s thousands of jobs that are going to be cut on the first of November or any time along the way.” By the end, more than 8,000 employees would lose their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OTOPMm"&gt;Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xre29K"&gt;T-Mobile’s other merger obligations, like helping Dish become a viable fourth carrier option, also seem like they might just be talk. Dish CEO Charlie Ergen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;recently told the FCC&lt;/a&gt; that if T-Mobile moves forward with its plans to shut down its older 3G CDMA network, Dish’s Boost Mobile customers (who rely on Sprint’s network for service) would be greatly harmed. Ergen stresses that for customers who need the less expensive phone plans Boost provides, upgrading to a 4G or 5G-capable phone isn’t a small expense — it could force some people to go without.&lt;/p&gt;

That might possibly bring T-Mobile/Sprint back up to its pre-merger numbers, but it’s now even harder to believe the company will add an additional 11,000 jobs by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
