    <title>HMD has five new sub-$250 Nokia phones coming to the US soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dXioUsd6x8fR5-uUDFXezX04piM=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70349795/HMD_New2022_Packshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, the Nokia 2760 Flip, C100, G400, C200, G100.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bvnagr"&gt;HMD, the company behind modern Nokia-branded phones, has announced five new “US exclusive” phones coming in the first half of this year. None of these are flagships: there’s only one 5G device, and all five are set to retail for under $250. HMD has also revived a classic Nokia design as a modern feature phone — the Nokia 2760 — a flip phone that inherits its name from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_2760"&gt;original 2007 handset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytpmPp"&gt;The company isn’t fully detailing the specs of the five phones today and says it plans to release this information closer to each handset’s launch. Instead, it’s emphasizing that the phones will be available across a wider range of US wireless providers, which now include Dish Wireless and Consumer Cellular in addition to T-Mobile and TracFone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hY2SVP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The original Nokia 2760 was released in 2007&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="czU073"&gt;In descending order of price, there’s the $239 G400, which is due for release in Q2. It’s a 5G phone with a triple rear camera array consisting of a 48-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro. Interestingly, its 6.6-inch display has a 120Hz refresh rate, which is relatively uncommon at this price point. It has a 5,000mAh battery and comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsgOp5"&gt;Then there’s the $149 G100, a 4G phone with a 6.5-inch display, 5,000mAh battery, and a fingerprint sensor built into the power button that’s also due for release in Q2. Both the G100 and G400 are part of HMD’s midrange G-series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAnGIm"&gt;HMD’s also bringing two phones to the accessible, value-focused Nokia C-series range. There’s the $99 C100 (due in Q1) and $119 C200 (releasing in Q2). The C100 has a relatively compact 5.45-inch display, a relatively low-resolution 8-megapixel rear camera, and a 3,000mAh battery. The C200 is slightly larger with a 6.1-inch display and has a bigger 4,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbvOIW"&gt;Finally, there’s the $79 Nokia 2760 Flip, a clamshell feature phone releasing in Q1. It’s running KaiOS, which offers a limited amount of smartphone-style services like Google Maps, and its focus is on durability and reliability with a target customer age of mainly 55 and above. There’s also an emergency button on its side that can be configured to call a contact and share your location, and a small external screen for notifications. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vivo launches ‘color-changing’ V23 Pro with dual-camera notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1YJxQIx9CTDImK8kNsOBLzSMtVw=/0x0:2304x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70349280/V23_Series_Lifestyle_CGI___10.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GkhF8b"&gt;Vivo has announced the V23 and V23 Pro, the latest phones in the company’s mainstream V series that sells a ton in India and other Asian countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMQbem"&gt;The most unusual feature is the Sunshine Gold model’s ‘color-changing’ exterior that apparently shifts colors completely when exposed to sunlight. Vivo says the material took two years to research and develop; if you leave it in the sun for about thirty seconds, the phone will turn to blue-green before gradually returning back to the original gold.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VUSS3HXrMnCwBE394n4QxqjPdkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146721/V23_5G_Gold.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Plot twist: these phones are both gold.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CN50eX"&gt;The other standout feature is the display’s notch that houses two selfie cameras, a 50-megapixel main unit and an 8-megapixel ultrawide on both phones. The selfie camera system also supports eye-based autofocus. The V23 Pro has a 108-megapixel main camera on the back while the V23’s is 64 megapixels; both are joined by 8-megapixel ultrawide and 2-megapixel macro sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ja5bB6"&gt;The V23 Pro’s screen is a 6.56-inch 90Hz 1080p OLED panel with curved edges. The V23, however, has a flat 6.44-inch 90Hz 1080p panel, and the sides of the phone itself are also flat, similar to an iPhone 12 or 13. The other main difference between the two phones is the processor — the V23 has a MediaTek Dimensity 920, while the V23 Pro has a Dimensity 1200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pb2sS"&gt;In India, the V23 will sell for Rs. 29,990 (~$400) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, or Rs. 34,990 (~$470) for 12GB/256GB. The V23 Pro costs Rs. 38,990 (~$520) for 8GB/128GB and Rs. 43,990 (~$590) for 12GB/256GB. The phones are also launching in countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, and will come to other markets in APAC, the Middle East, and Europe “over the next few months.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 10 Pro’s official specs are not the least bit surprising</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aECyOaqUHp_yzswqP9Z10n-wxb4=/0x0:6750x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348558/OnePlus_10_Pro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OnePlus 10 Pro | OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O5xlWi"&gt;Rather than announce all of the details of the OnePlus 10 Pro flagship, OnePlus is choosing to space out the details in drips and drabs. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22613909"&gt;First, it released an official teaser image&lt;/a&gt; that revealed the design of the phone alongside a China release date of January 11th. Now, it’s announcing the phone’s specs, which include the newest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, ultra fast charging, and a 5,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpZFls"&gt;If you’ve been keeping up on Android news the past few months, none of these details will come as a surprise. Flagship Android phones in the US all tend to feature Qualcomm’s most powerful processor and if there’s any interesting news here, it’s that OnePlus is getting a small jump on Samsung and becoming the first major smartphone to use the new chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zY2nCD"&gt;The rest of the specs are exactly what you’d probably expect. Though, unfortunately, OnePlus is still leaving out a few key details like the amount of RAM on each model, prices, precise screen sizes, and release dates outside of China. In any case, here are a few of the specs it’s revealing today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="w5kB6W"&gt;Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IMUVv3"&gt;Rear camera: 48MP + 50 MP + 8MP, Dual OIS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nUJbSy"&gt;Front camera: 32MP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O8Gz5l"&gt;Display: 120Hz “Fluid AMOLED with LTPP”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HcdE8s"&gt;Battery: 5,000mAh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MWFiwr"&gt;Wired charging: 80W SuperVOOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9uHOIw"&gt;Wireless charging: 50W AirVOOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NxpCD9"&gt;OS: OxygenOS 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ogvvID"&gt;Dimensions: 163 x 73.9 x 8.55mm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="dVNg1T"&gt;There are a few things to note in that list. Along with picking up Oppo’s operating system, the OnePlus 10 is also using Oppo’s branding for its fast-charging system. Until now OnePlus had the same system but used its own Warp Charge brand. Branding aside, the rated speeds are still ridiculously fast. The dimensions also tell us that the OnePlus 10 Pro is a very large phone, nearly the size of a Galaxy S21 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMJ3MD"&gt;As with any Android phone these days, there have been plenty of rumors to fill in the gaps. We’re expecting RAM options to either be 8GB or 12GB, with 128GB or 256GB of storage. As for the rest of the details, including a rumored April release, we’ll need to wait for OnePlus to provide more details in its next announcement — or the one after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHZOgA"&gt;Why do companies like OnePlus and Google space out the details on their new phones instead of giving us a single announcement? Your guess is as good as ours, but the obvious one is probably the right one: it gives them multiple bites at the Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OGyFk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon joins T-Mobile and AT&amp;T by offering a truly unlimited mobile plan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RioKII8rw-_HAUG5yHKi7ZJVcYs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347981/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon is the latest carrier to offer a mobile data plan without monthly caps on its fastest network speeds.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VkTGlc"&gt;Verizon has &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/power-verizon-5g-ultra-wideband-coming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;updated its unlimited plans&lt;/a&gt; in anticipation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;new 5G spectrum coming online &lt;s&gt;tomorrow&lt;/s&gt; soonish&lt;/a&gt;. The new plans cost the same and include the same level of access to the carrier’s Nationwide and Ultra Wideband 5G networks, but the priciest Get More plan receives a notable upgrade: unlimited monthly “premium data.” That puts it on even terms with the other major carriers’ top-tier unlimited plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llbC6h"&gt;The plans previously known as Start, Play More, Do More, and Get More Unlimited are now called 5G Start Unlimited, 5G Play More Unlimited... you get the idea. The Get More plan ($90 / month for one line with autopay) previously included 50GB of premium data each month — once customers reached that limit, they’d be subject to slowdowns during times of network congestion. The new 5G Get More plan does away with that monthly cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XnOv32"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cellphone plan fine print, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"},{"title":"The best phone plans in 2021 (and how to pick one)","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22606623/best-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8IZGUr"&gt;Verizon is playing a little bit of catch-up here; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573847/att-unlimited-elite-data-cap-4k-streaming-phone-plan"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s Unlimited Elite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;T-Mobile’s Magenta Max&lt;/a&gt; already offer all-you-can-eat premium mobile data. The new 5G Get More plan also includes a boost in premium mobile hotspot data: 50GB, up from 30GB. The Play More and Do More plans now offer 30GB compared to 15GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKZTDq"&gt;One thing remains the same, though: customers on the basic Start Unlimited plan won’t have access to the faster Ultra Wideband network at all — just slower Nationwide 5G. That’s no great loss at the moment, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;when C-band joins the call&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll be a real bummer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why AT&amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cell tower stock 1024" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UFQfQXD93XobDDTim67oWSDgmfY=/0x0:1008x672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347426/cell-tower-san-jose-3-stock-1024.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A long-brewing battle between wireless carriers and airlines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="r0Xcn7"&gt;The day after New Year’s, the CEOs of the two biggest wireless carriers in America sent &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145232/att_letter.pdf"&gt;a very angry letter&lt;/a&gt; to Pete Buttigieg. The companies had been working for years to launch a new portion of their 5G networks, a launch that had been scheduled for December and then unexpectedly pushed back due to vague air safety concerns. Now, the Department of Transportation was asking for more time, just days before the scheduled launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MQLVp"&gt;“In addition to the tens of billions of dollars we paid to the U.S. Government for the spectrum and the additional billions of dollars we paid to the satellite companies to enable the December 2021 availability of the spectrum,” the CEOs wrote, “we have paid billions of dollars more to purchase the necessary equipment and lease space on towers. Thousands of our employees have worked non-stop for months to prepare our networks to utilize this spectrum.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SACOGz"&gt;As of yesterday, the spectrum launch is back on — pushed first to January 5th, then two weeks later to January 19th — but it’s been an unusually rocky road for US wireless carriers, bouncing between regulators at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and increasingly vocal unions for pilots and flight attendants. At the heart of all of it is a nagging fear that the latest round of 5G spectrum will pose a threat to commercial airlines and their passengers. But it’s such a complicated issue that it’s best to unpack it one piece at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OPgr75"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="hAHNLt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is actually getting delayed here? I already have 5G on my phone. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="STgrVH"&gt;Carriers and airlines are fighting over a particular chunk of spectrum from 3.7 to roughly 4.0 GHz – primarily used by AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon, sometimes referred to as C-band. (T-Mobile is using a separate mid-band patch at 2.2GHz, so it is largely sitting this fight out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AduITk"&gt;This isn’t all the 5G spectrum, but it’s some of the best parts. The most powerful thing about 5G is the ability to transmit huge volumes of data over these mid-band frequencies, and this spectrum is the main way AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are planning to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jvxMDW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a reason they paid $65 billion for this. They don’t have sufficient mid-band spectrum without it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOOHot"&gt;“There’s a reason they paid $65 billion for this spectrum,” says Public Knowledge’s Harold Feld, who &lt;a href="https://wetmachine.com/tales-of-the-sausage-factory/what-the-eff-faa-my-insanely-long-field-guide-to-the-faa-fcc-5g-c-band-fight/"&gt;wrote about the issue at length in November&lt;/a&gt;. “They don’t have sufficient mid-band spectrum without it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPXPMz"&gt;Crucially, we’re at the last step in a very long process. If you bought a 5G-capable phone, you already own a device that can send and receive on those wavelengths, and there are already cell towers that can manage those signals. All that’s left is to turn them on, at which point the C-band airwaves will get a whole lot busier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="J9Bs6A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So… why didn’t they switch them on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="iooyzZ"&gt;Airlines are worried those busier C-band airwaves will interfere with their equipment. In particular, they’re worried about radar altimeters — a device that bounces radio waves off the ground to give extremely precise altitude readings. It’s a crucial device for landings, particularly in conditions with limited visibility, and relies on having an empty patch of spectrum to work in. Faulty altimeter readings can also trigger automated responses from autopilot systems, as in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines_Flight_1951"&gt;a 2009 Turkish Airlines crash&lt;/a&gt; that left nine dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KawXA9"&gt;As a result, the entire industry is deeply uncomfortable with anything that might interfere with altimeters. As an airline pilot’s association put it &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10531182083849/ALPA%20Comments%2017-183%2018-122.pdf"&gt;in a 2018 filing to the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, “the public interest would not be served if tens of thousands of existing aircraft worldwide were inadvertently no longer provided the safety protection enabled by radio altimetry equipment due to interference from adjacent bands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ROUPWl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But they’ve tested this, right? Does it actually cause problems?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="wxLLKc"&gt;This is the 65-billion-dollar question! As one tech trade group is &lt;a href="https://www.5gandaviation.com/"&gt;fond of pointing out&lt;/a&gt;, this spectrum has already been rolled out in 40 different countries without any resulting altimeter failures, although some of those countries are operating it at lower power levels. But the FCC has spent three years going back and forth with various airline groups on this question, and a lot of them are still worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MRw5TF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s not clear how many faulty altimeters are out there or how they’ll respond to a flood of 5G traffic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7sev5I"&gt;The FCC has a number of measures in place to prevent interference. There’s a full 220 MHz of clearance between the spectrum used by the radio altimeters (which starts at 4.2GHz) and the new 5G spectrum (which ends at 3980MHz). The FCC even carved an extra 20MHz from the 5G holdings when this issue was raised in 2018 to give aircraft extra space. There are also several restrictions on how 5G towers should be configured near airports to avoid flooding the airwaves in areas where planes are landing. In a modern plane with a modern radar altimeter, it should be easy to avoid interference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZveuk"&gt;The problem is, not every aircraft has a modern radar altimeter. Both sides acknowledge that at least some altimeters are affected by signals from outside the intended spectrum bands. To be clear, this is a malfunction — but it’s a malfunction that wouldn’t have been relevant before C-band came online. As things stand now, it’s not clear how many faulty altimeters are out there or how they’ll respond to a flood of 5G traffic. And because even a single interference-related crash would be tragic, it’s hard for airlines to feel secure about the rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNOZuy"&gt;For the FCC and wireless industry, the ideal solution would be for the FAA to launch some kind of industry-wide effort to find and replace faulty altimeters. In fact, they would have liked it to launch in 2019, when the rulemaking for the spectrum first began. But that didn’t happen, and it’s unlikely to happen in the next two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="sR7WOS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why don’t carriers give airlines more time to test their equipment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ttkajB"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are coming up against a deadline of their own. 5G-capable phones have been available in the US for two years now, and carriers are expecting a flood of new customers as holiday devices come online. Both networks have some 5G capacity already in place, but without the C-band spectrum, their networks are increasingly stretched thin. In February, AT&amp;amp;T plans to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/offers/network/3g-network-sunset/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shut down its 3G network entirely&lt;/a&gt; as part of the transition to 5G. All that traffic has to go somewhere — and without new spectrum, the result will be spotty, inconsistent service. At the same time, T-Mobile is skating by without any of these problems and has been aggressively marketing its 5G network to draw away customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdvCdf"&gt;Another two weeks isn’t too big of a deal for the carriers, which is part of why they were so eager to accept the deal, but further delays could start to do serious damage to their business plans. With each passing month, the drag on the network gets a little more severe, and the damage from a $65 billion dead asset gets a little harder for shareholders to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlByj9"&gt;“The thing the carriers were really worried about was, how long is this going to go on?” Feld says. “You have this combination of surging demand and concern that you won’t ever be able to use the spectrum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4OymzH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what happens now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="5rq6zO"&gt;One way or another, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are planning to switch on their networks on January 19th, and the airlines and pilots will be on high alert for the first sign of any interference. The FAA has promised to use the extra two weeks to craft &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/continued_operation/ad/alt_moc/"&gt;an airworthiness directive&lt;/a&gt; for any planes that might be affected, which will stave off the most severe shutdowns or delays. Given the tight timeframe and mounting pressure, it’s very likely the best the agency can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="elxW5Y"&gt;But for observers like Feld, the most frustrating thing is how much time agencies have already wasted without addressing the issue. “This shouldn’t have been a problem. Since the FCC started this rulemaking in 2019, we’ve known this was coming. The steps that are necessary to address this are fairly straightforward,” he told me. “It’s unfathomable.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China launches iPhone and Android apps for its digital currency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="E-CNY App" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4e_BYJTjmcR5EJVt5qnFHmWhzg=/0x30:4536x3054/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347284/1237534100.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Liu Junfeng / Costfoto/Future Publishing via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A2PvGd"&gt;China has rolled out a pilot version of an app that allows users to store and pay with digital yuan, also known as e-CNY, as reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3162094/china-digital-currency-e-cny-wallet-lands-app-stores-ahead-winter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And no, the digital yuan isn’t a cryptocurrency — it was developed by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to replace banknotes and coins; thus, it isn’t a decentralized form of payment, nor will it operate on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnnz0d"&gt;Although it might sound like we already pay with digital cash when we use a credit card or an online payment service like PayPal and Apple Pay, the digital yuan isn’t anything like that. e-CNY is essentially physical cash converted into a digital form, and it’s been in the works since 2014. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/chinas-digital-yuan-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, distribution of the digital currency will take place using a two-tier system that transfers e-CNY from the PBOC to commercial banks. Banks will then distribute the currency directly to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ROAvbN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As we get closer to the Beijing Olympics, China may use the currency as a way for visitors to easily make payments&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5lvPyq"&gt;Since the e-CNY isn’t a decentralized currency like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it doesn’t promise the same kind of privacy. The &lt;a href="https://www.db.com/news/detail/20210714-digital-yuan-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work"&gt;Deutsche Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; s&lt;/em&gt;ays it will have “controlled anonymity,” meaning users can choose to conceal their identities from counterparties, but it will still let the authorities monitor transactions for illegal activities like money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdVLGG"&gt;Digital payment apps like WeChat and AliPay already have a strong foothold in China, with around &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17409/most-popular-digital-payment-services-in-china/"&gt;nine in 10 Chinese people&lt;/a&gt; saying they used either app within the past year. It might seem unlikely for the Chinese to want to switch over to the digital yuan, but China has been working hard to promote it. Within the past two years, cities throughout China have even been holding lotteries, distributing a total of &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3104832/chinas-shenzhen-giving-away-millions-sovereign-digital-yuan"&gt;10 million digital yuan (worth about $1.47 million USD at the time)&lt;/a&gt; to people in Shenzen in October 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3112724/chinese-city-hand-out-virtual-red-packets-part-digital-yuan"&gt;20 million digital yuan (or ~$3 million USD)&lt;/a&gt; in Suzhou in December 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/chinese-city-chengdu-launches-6-million-digital-currency-test.html"&gt;40.2 million digital yuan (or ~$6.2 million)&lt;/a&gt; in Chengdu in February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJDOyi"&gt;Last September, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/digital-yuan-goes-head-to-head-with-alipay-wechat-in-beijing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; covered a trade fair in Beijing, where attendees were shown how to sign up for an account, as well as the many ways to use the digital currency — this includes wearables that users can tap against scanners to pay with e-CNY. As noted in the report, users can fill up their AliPay account with the currency, which suggests both forms of payment might have more of a symbiotic relationship rather than a competitive one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrnIQy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; even describes how some banks at the event demonstrated how foreigners could sign up for an e-CNY account using their passport and phone number, as well as convert foreign currency to e-CNY. As we get closer to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, this may be a way for China to leverage the currency as a way for visitors to easily make payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGs3Jr"&gt;The new e-CNY app is available on both China’s Android and Apple app stores, but only people in 10 specific cities, including Beijing, Shenzen, Chengdu, and Shanghai, can use it. And as pointed out by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/china-launches-digital-currency-app-to-expand-usage.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the app will be available to use during the upcoming Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T will offer a 5G phone with wireless charging for $220</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nvp5_lfHUukmPVyvMz8jWAC5ehY=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346205/ATT_Fusion_5G_resize.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fusion 5G arrives on AT&amp;amp;T’s shelves this Friday, January 7th.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lDLnWO"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/aboutus/pressrelease/2022/fusion-5g-arrives-january.html"&gt;has announced the Fusion 5G&lt;/a&gt;, a budget phone with a couple of features previously reserved for much more expensive devices: sub-6GHz 5G and wireless charging. It will cost $219 (or $6.12 per month if you’d rather go that route) when it goes on sale this Friday, January 7th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5WwQZ"&gt;It’s been a few years since 5G started appearing in smartphones — back in those early, heady days the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/22/18236380/samsung-galaxy-s10-5g-verizon-network-phone-missing-launch-release-date"&gt;devices were costly&lt;/a&gt; and the networks were practically non-existent. Today, the price of entry is clearly much lower. While 5G networks in the US still lag behind much of the world, that might start changing soon if the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;FAA and FCC can get their acts together&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxyQHv"&gt;The Fusion’s inclusion of wireless charging is notable, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22425011/zte-blade-11-prime-review-price-specs-screen"&gt;not entirely unheard of&lt;/a&gt; in a budget phone. Like 5G, it’s a formerly flagship-only feature that’s still somewhat uncommon even in midrange devices. Other specs include a 6.82-inch display, 4,750mAh battery, 48-megapixel rear main camera, and 64GB of built-in storage. It ships with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saRmrX"&gt;The Fusion 5G only offers slower sub-6GHz 5G — not the faster mmWave — and realistically that’s the network most Fusion 5G owners will be connecting to. Unless you spend a significant amount of your time in NFL stadiums or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577093/att-5g-plus-mmwave-boingo-airport"&gt;certain parts of certain airport terminals&lt;/a&gt;, you may never come across a mmWave signal. In any case, sub-6GHz 5G will slowly get better when AT&amp;amp;T begins lighting up its new, faster C-band spectrum — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;won’t happen for a couple more weeks&lt;/a&gt; at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51NKUJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction January 4th, 4:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fusion 5G includes sub-6Ghz 5G only. A previous version of this story, based on information from AT&amp;amp;T PR, stated that it includes mmWave 5G. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Version two of TCL’s wearable display glasses are lighter and less dorky-looking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IFNxfk_TpazNRLm7mVLJt51Nf4U=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345514/__13.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NxtWear Air is a personal secondary display for your phone or laptop embedded in a pair of glasses frames.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEnFQD"&gt;TCL is preparing to launch a second iteration of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22221389/tcl-wearable-display-glasses-moveaudio-s600-pet-tracker-ces"&gt;wearable personal display&lt;/a&gt; it released in limited supply last year. Version two, called NxtWear Air, offers the same secondary-display-in-a-pair-of-glasses function as the original but has been made 30 percent lighter — down to 75g compared to 130g. TCL has made some adjustments for the style-conscious, too, tweaking the design to look more like a normal pair of sunglasses and less like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545583/tcl-nxtwear-g-wearable-display-glasses-availability-price"&gt;something you’d be embarrassed to wear in public&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvbDqj"&gt;NxtWear Air, like its NxtWear G predecessor, offers two 1080p Micro OLEDs embedded in a pair of glasses frames that should give the wearer the effect of viewing a 140-inch screen from about 13 feet away. Its lenses are opaque, and the glasses don’t offer AR or VR functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-HaUch8sOBSMyPS9eV8Qz6Rjeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131389/___11.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swappable plates attach to the front of the frames via magnets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tkE34P"&gt;Instead, it acts as a secondary display that you wear on your face, using USB-C to connect to a DisplayPort-compatible phone, tablet, or laptop. Stereo speakers are built in, but if you don’t want to annoy everyone in earshot, you should connect Bluetooth or wired headphones instead. This year’s model also comes with two magnetic interchangeable plates that attach to the front of the frames to change up the style of the glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoBjI2"&gt;TCL says NxtWear Air will launch in Q1 of 2022. There’s no word on which regions it will be available in, and TCL hasn’t revealed a price for them yet. NxtWear G went on sale in a limited run in Australia last year priced at $899 (about $680 US), so expect to spend a little money for the most private monitor you can use on a plane.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL is bringing two new budget 5G phones to US carriers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DaVVvoLFzwZnegeDZgz5zizsXMI=/0x49:2480x1702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345550/TCL_30_V_5G_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NPQoRa"&gt;TCL will debut a total of eight new phones globally in 2022, but it’s kicking the year off by introducing two models coming exclusively to the US: the TCL 30 XE 5G and TCL 30 V 5G. The 30 XE 5G offers a 6.52-inch 90Hz display and will be sold initially at T-Mobile with other carrier availability later in the year. The 30 V 5G will be exclusive to Verizon, with sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G connectivity. With these new devices, TCL looks to be playing to its strengths in the budget market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfYUKd"&gt;The TCL 30 V 5G boasts a slightly bigger 6.67-inch 1080p display with a standard 60Hz refresh rate. It uses a Snapdragon 480 5G chipset with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The 30 V includes a 50-megapixel main rear camera and a 5-megapixel ultrawide, alongside 2-megapixel macro and 16-megapixel selfie cameras. It offers a 4,500mAh battery and comes with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fPmZW3aeJ9K2i3CK8Bra7xa8O1g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130731/TCL_30_V_5G_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 30 V 5G is a Verizon exclusive with all flavors of 5G connectivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L52BGC"&gt;The TCL 30 XE is positioned as an entry-level 5G device with a 720p display, MediaTek Dimensity 700 chipset, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of built-in storage. It offers a 13-megapixel rear main camera and an 8-megapixel selfie cam, plus rear depth and macro sensors. The 30 XE also includes a 4,500mAh battery and ships with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8KWHCw7s7t4hTixLDCFXFaUAVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130743/TCL_30_XE_5G_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 30 XE 5G includes a 90Hz display for smoother animations and scrolling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wbO3JT"&gt;The 30-series marks TCL’s third generation of devices bearing the display maker’s own branding — previously, it produced phones for other brands. While last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22560849/tcl-20-pro-5g-review-screen-battery-price-specs"&gt;upper midrange 20 Pro 5G&lt;/a&gt; didn’t quite hit the mark, we thought its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;sub-$300 devices&lt;/a&gt; were a great bargain with their big, vibrant screens and low price tags. TCL appears to be leaning into the US budget market with its devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41NjJh"&gt;TCL says both phones will launch “in the coming weeks.” There’s no pricing announced yet, but it’s a fair bet that the Verizon phone will cost more and require a premium unlimited plan to get the most out of it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and AT&amp;T cut a deal with the FAA, will hit the brakes on 5G C-band rollouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WJ8yHk"&gt;In a standoff that’s pitting Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and the FCC versus the FAA and the airline industry over the two carrier’s plans to upgrade their 5G wireless services, the mobile companies now say they’ve reached an agreement with the Department of Transportation. For Verizon, delaying the launch of the “C-band” spectrum means canceling a celebration scheduled for 1PM ET on Tuesday, marking the beginning of its spectrum upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="13Jh1R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rMYxwM"&gt;We’ve agreed to a two-week delay which promises the certainty of bringing this nation our game-changing 5G network in January, delivered over America’s best and most reliable network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="IuoOgm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="S6Cpgi"&gt;At Secretary Buttigieg’s request, we have voluntarily agreed to one additional two-week delay of our deployment of C-Band 5G services. We also remain committed to the six-month protection zone mitigations we outlined in our letter. We know aviation safety and 5G can co-exist and we are confident further collaboration and technical assessment will allay any issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="e5TVMG"&gt;FAA Communications deputy assistant administrator Jeannie Shiffer provided a statement to The Verge saying, “Safety is the core of our mission and this guides all of our decisions. The FAA thanks AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon for agreeing to a voluntary delay and for their proposed mitigations. We look forward to using the additional time and space to reduce flight disruptions associated with this 5G deployment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFugOD"&gt;She also says that the agreement will see the companies use mitigations similar to those already in place in European countries. The deal will see those mitigations put in place around 50 airports for six months, and now the FAA says, “While U.S. standards and operating environments are unique, we believe this could substantially reduce the disruptions to air operations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F09yQ"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey and Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg wrote, “Agreeing to your proposal would not only be an unprecedented and unwarranted circumvention of the due process and checks and balances carefully crafted in the structure of our democracy, but an irresponsible abdication of the operating control required to deploy world-class and globally competitive communications networks that are every bit as essential to our country’s economic vitality, public safety and national interests as the airline industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1amsgq"&gt;The companies said they would not give in to the FAA and DOT’s request to delay their (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;already delayed by 30 days&lt;/a&gt;) C-band spectrum upgrades for an additional two weeks. The executives continued to propose mitigations like the ones used in France, creating a buffer zone around certain airports and lowering power levels nationwide.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh1Ukl"&gt;According to the FAA, the controversy exists because of “concerns that the 5G signal could interfere with the accuracy of an airplane’s radio altimeter, without other mitigations in place,” according to the FAA. Those altimeters are crucial for automated landings, and the FAA claims that rolling out the changes could disrupt air travel or impact safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXV9sV"&gt;Earlier this year, an FCC auction &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;sold the two carriers rights to use so-called “C-band” frequencies at a price of nearly $70 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are eager to roll it out so that in addition to offering ultra-fast 5G connectivity in specific areas using high-band millimeter-wave technology and much slower 5G over low-band frequencies, the new spectrum will provide in-between performance over much wider areas. T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;currently uses mid-band spectrum that isn’t in the C-band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMGE1k"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 3rd, 9:59PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added a statement from FAA, information about the agreement, and confirmation that Verizon has canceled its launch event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
