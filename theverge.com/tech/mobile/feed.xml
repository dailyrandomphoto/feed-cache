    <title>T-Mobile’s long-promised 5G home broadband will launch later this month</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d8ZTO1"&gt;At an analyst event on Thursday, T-Mobile revealed that its long-awaited 5G home broadband service will launch later this month, which it confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; A 4G version of the service is currently in pilot testing with 100,000 households. By the end of the year, T-Mobile says it hopes to extend the service to 7–8 million customers within five years. There’s no confirmed launch date for the service yet, but we’ll know more later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCrFgl"&gt;The company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254853/tmobile-sprint-merger-5g-home-internet-service-promises"&gt;promising 5G-based wireless broadband&lt;/a&gt; since before its acquisition of Sprint, saying that the merger would make it possible to offer service that would challenge the dominant cable companies. Before the deal was approved, T-Mobile went ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;started testing out the service&lt;/a&gt; with a limited group of customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0z9D8s"&gt;The self-styled Uncarrier isn’t the only one testing the waters of fixed wireless internet. Verizon &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fc-band-verizon-expands-5g-home-internet&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325833%2Ft-mobile-5g-home-broadband-internet-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just expanded&lt;/a&gt; its 5G home internet service to ten more cities, though in testing last year &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/for-now-verizons-5g-home-internet-service-offers-very-little-coverage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; that actual availability in the cities Verizon serves is scarce. If nothing else, both companies seem plenty motivated to get 5G home internet up and running. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pakistan is again banning TikTok, this time for ‘peddling vulgarity’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufLIkvf3ZyakkULTvro5-1pWqgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951763/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hGrOzk"&gt;Pakistan has banned TikTok yet again, citing objectionable content on the shortform video app. This is the second time the ByteDance platform has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509817/tiktok-pakistan-ban-immoral-indecent-content"&gt;banned in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, following a brief 10-day shutdown in October of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONMcK"&gt;Last fall, TikTok was banned for hosting “immoral” and “indecent” videos, but the company was able to assure the Pakistani government that videos would be moderated “in accordance with societal norms and the laws of Pakistan,” and the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523094/pakistan-tiktok-ban-lifted-after-10-days"&gt;resumed operations&lt;/a&gt; a week and a half later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kgMTQd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In respectful compliance to the orders of the Peshawar High Court, PTA has issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok App. During the hearing of a case today, the PHC has ordered for the blocking of App.&lt;/p&gt;— PTA (@PTAofficialpk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PTAofficialpk/status/1370044117678444544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s4pyxu"&gt;The company has tens of millions of users in Pakistan, and yet a high court in the city of Peshawar ordered the government’s telecom regulatory body, the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority, to ban the app in order to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOV0rz"&gt;“In respectful compliance to the orders of the Peshawar High Court, PTA has issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok App,” reads the announcement. “During the hearing of a case today, the PHC has ordered for the blocking of App.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnTr1J"&gt;It’s not entirely clear why TikTok’s legality in Pakistan is again in question and whether any one video or trend on the app is the culprit. Yet, &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/11/pakistani-court-orders-tik-tok-banned-over-obscene"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that complaints were made from Peshawar High Court Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan, who accused TikTok of hosting content “unacceptable for Pakistani society.” &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/90df50e4-7fd9-4def-86e3-db256882140d"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Khan said the platform engaged in “peddling vulgarity” and ordered the ban take effect immediately during a hearing on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n1gtY3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the second ban for TikTok in Pakistani in the last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9vyZs6"&gt;“TikTok is built upon the foundation of creative expression, with strong safeguards in place to keep inappropriate content off the platform,” TikTok said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In Pakistan we have grown our local-language moderation team, and have mechanisms to report and remove content in violation of our community guidelines. We look forward to continuing to serve the millions of TikTok users and creators in Pakistan who have found a home for creativity and fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wCZ8I"&gt;TikTok has endured a number of contentious government bans and other restrictions around the world — most notably, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262940/tiktok-leaves-india-ban-app-china-government-security-privacy"&gt;countrywide ban in India since last summer&lt;/a&gt; and the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;hamfisted attempt&lt;/a&gt; to force the company to partner with a US tech firm to assuage fears of Chinese government influence over the platform. (That deal, with cloud giant Oracle, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276090/tiktok-oracle-deal-biden-trump-ban-china-bytedance-white-house"&gt;apparently on life support&lt;/a&gt; under President Joe Biden.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OJcgI"&gt;The app has faced its most serious opposition in and around Southeast Asia, where governments have extended existing control over the media to the video-centric social network using laws and regulations around what constitutes obscene or immoral content. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile plans to turn up 5G speed this year, cover 90 percent of Americans with fast 5G by 2024</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d1ALIQN-zGC7S5F5hxvsqxiV0yk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951303/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile is keen to stay ahead of the 5G competition | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5066wz"&gt;During its &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/T-Mobile-Virtual-Analyst-Day/default.aspx"&gt;virtual analyst event&lt;/a&gt; today, T-Mobile outlined &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eliblumenthal/status/1370098384816779265?s=20"&gt;some bold plans&lt;/a&gt; for expanding its 5G coverage and speeding up its current offerings. The company says that by the end of 2023, it will cover 90 percent of Americans (about 300 million) with what it calls Ultra Capacity 5G (its faster mid-band and mmWave service). It also plans to cover 97 percent of Americans (approximately 320 million) by the end of 2022 with its slower low-band 5G, which it calls Extended Range. Currently, 125 million are covered by Ultra Capacity, with Extended Range covering 287 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHYsUO"&gt;Additionally, those currently covered by Ultra Capacity 5G will see an increase in average speeds from 300Mbps up to 400Mbps, thanks to additional megahertz devoted to 5G, and T-Mobile says that more speed increases are on the way. This portion of T-Mobile’s 5G service is largely based on spectrum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202726/tmobile-sprint-acquisition-ceo-finished-john-legere-steps-down"&gt;acquired from its Sprint merger&lt;/a&gt;, with mid-band frequencies well-suited to faster speeds and broad coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sfFCloG7qNYmJkL-vz7n6C2PeQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363649/slack_imgs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s C-band acquisition figures into expansion plans starting in 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S1S5xW"&gt;Already having access to those mid-band frequencies allowed T-Mobile to take a less aggressive approach to the recent FCC C-band auction, a fact it celebrated throughout its investor call today. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Ft-mobile-further-solidifies-5g-leadership-position-with-successful-c-band-auction&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325857%2Ft-mobile-5g-coverage-ultra-capacity-extended-range" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile says its comparatively low bid&lt;/a&gt; of $9.3 billion (Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T bid $45.4 and $23.4 million, respectively) went toward spectrum that would strategically supplement its current 2.5GHz holdings. Those frequencies will become available in 2023 and likely figure into the latter part of the company’s aggressive expansion plans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo announces Find X3 Pro flagship with microscope camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OP9PQ9ME_gfB9dweKHvjtlEq0RE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947568/DSCF7577.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="26hpQt"&gt;After a drawn-out series of leaks and teases, Oppo has announced its 2021 flagship in full. The Find X3 Pro is a sleek, powerful phone with an unusual design and some unique features to match. It’s also an important device for Oppo, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318941/china-smartphone-market-share-oppo-huawei-vivo-apple-xiaomi-january-2021"&gt;recently overtook Huawei&lt;/a&gt; in the Chinese smartphone market and will be looking to capitalize on its rival’s troubles this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNJdHd"&gt;The Find X3 Pro’s most arresting visual element is its camera bump, which almost looks organic in the way it seamlessly rises from the same piece of glass as the rest of the phone’s back panel. Combined with the finish, which on my unit is aggressively shiny and glossy, the phone looks sort of like it was forged out of &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2-&lt;/em&gt;style liquid metal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/li_PZuoMOeFQdhkYRQU8RIWZ1lY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362260/DSCF7572.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Sbic"&gt;The camera system itself is no less unusual. There’s a primary camera and an ultrawide that both use 50-megapixel 1/1.56-inch Sony IMX766 sensors, meaning the image quality should be comparable across both, though we’ll have to see how that bears out in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqWHj8"&gt;There’s also a 3-megapixel microlens, which shouldn’t be mistaken for the useless macro cameras found in some phones today. Oppo claims up to 60x magnification, and it’s more like a microscope than a macro lens — you can take pictures of things like subpixel layouts on screens, and there’s even a ring light to illuminate the subject. I’m not sure if this will be a selling point for many people, but in my early testing I can confirm that it’s pretty cool. Here’s a quick shot of my computer monitor:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BZdLCMaTM4xe51OWFwIKTXjA2t4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362255/IMG20210311143520_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ibrXP2"&gt;You’ll notice that the whole shot isn’t quite in focus, and that’s because depth of field is extremely shallow when shooting this close — you have to get within millimeters. I probably need more practice using the microlens, but my first impression is that it might be more useful for looking at things in real time than capturing them for sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQIVVq"&gt;One notable omission is a periscope zoom lens, even though Oppo did more than anyone to popularize the technology. There is a telephoto lens here, but it’s just a 13-megapixel sensor with 2x optical zoom over the primary camera. That’s not necessarily a downgrade, since it could improve image quality at mid-range shooting distances, but it does mean the Find X3 Pro won’t have anywhere near as much zoom reach as its 5x-telephoto-equipped predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2ZGfAfwu3JOBgQC-Q2ad5yxCmM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362261/DSCF7578.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tWxaBM"&gt;The Find X3 Pro’s display is another key feature; it’s a 3216 x 1440 LTPO OLED panel with a peak brightness of 1,300 nits and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Oppo is making a big deal out of the fact that it’s a 10-bit panel and that it’s integrated full-path color management into ColorOS; this means photos and videos captured with the cameras can be displayed with more than a billion colors, as opposed to the 16.7 million colors on conventional smartphone screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKe3mQ"&gt;The Find X3 Pro has typically flagship-tier internals: a Snapdragon 888 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The 4,500mAh battery can be fast-charged at up to 65W, and Oppo has finally embraced wireless charging on a flagship with a 30W system that can fully charge the phone in 80 minutes. The lack of wireless charging was my biggest knock against the Find X2 Pro, so Oppo’s off to a good start here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbpxC7"&gt;We don’t have pricing or release details for the Find X3 Pro just yet; Oppo plans to announce that next week. Stay tuned for more information and a full review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon decrees only ‘premium’ customers can escape its slowest 5G speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wfNicsIBDiN9I_ObyseevKZKQ64=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68945901/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Verizon wants to funnel more customers into its more expensive unlimited plans. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7u1DyK"&gt;If you’re on a basic Verizon plan, you’re going to be stuck with the company’s poor performing “nationwide” 5G network — even after critical C-band spectrum comes online. The company revealed in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0JNCwmCmCg"&gt;presentation to investors&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that C-band frequencies, and their faster speeds, will only be available to customers on “premium” unlimited plans. Those on metered or the basic Start Unlimited plan will be relegated to slower, low-band 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CiFr0q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Verizon confirms that to access C-Band you will need a premium unlimited plan like its Play More, Do More and Get More. If you have an older plan you'll only have access to its DSS "nationwide" 5G, not this newer and faster flavor.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/JH1uTixZaI"&gt;https://t.co/JH1uTixZaI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eli Blumenthal (@eliblumenthal) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eliblumenthal/status/1369798985016373251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="919wxO"&gt;This is essentially how the company already treats its ultra-fast mmWave 5G: customers on the base-level unlimited plan don’t have access to this network, while Play More, Do More, and Get More Unlimited subscribers do. Customers on metered plans don’t have mmWave access either, and likewise won’t have C-band, though they can add access to both for an additional fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1HI3Uz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company is extremely keen to funnel customers into “step up” plans and is using that C-band spectrum as incentive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vA0agR"&gt;That’s bad news for Verizon customers hoping that C-band would improve the poor performance they’re seeing on the company’s nationwide 5G. The network currently uses narrow low-band channels not well suited for 5G, and relies on a technology called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing to accommodate 4G and 5G traffic on the same frequencies. As a result, Verizon’s 5G speeds are closer to 4G — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196060/verizon-5g-slower-than-lte-speed-test"&gt;and at times even slower&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gG3daF"&gt;Verizon has been limited by the spectrum it has access to, and so it spent big in the recent FCC auction of mid-band frequencies known as C-band. This chunk of spectrum is ideal for 5G, offering faster speeds than LTE with coverage that’s broader than range-limited mmWave. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;The company bid $45.4 billion on C-band licenses&lt;/a&gt; — more than double what AT&amp;amp;T spent. When these blocks of frequencies start becoming available at the end of the year, it should significantly boost the network’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gmzDf5VcpUEMbWWLSRqpjNa1ac0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361438/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_5.41.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon predicts premium unlimited plans will make up 50% of its postpaid account mix by the end of 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XITILH"&gt;And that $45 billion is just the start. Verizon revealed on its investor presentation that it plans to spend an additional $10 billion over the next three years on C-band deployment, above and beyond its expected capital expenditure. That’s likely why the company is extremely keen to funnel customers into “step up” plans, and is using that C-band spectrum as incentive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49XVIf"&gt;Verizon also says that going forward, all new phones that it sells will be C-band compatible. That’s already the case for flagships like the Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12 series, but not all budget or midrange phone are C-band compatible in the US. That’s one less thing for phone shoppers to have to think about when buying a phone with Verizon, but it also makes Verizon’s job of talking you into a more expensive plan easier, too. And if you’re on one of their basic plans, you might be hearing that sales pitch sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked OnePlus 9 Pro and OnePlus 9 renders leave little to the imagination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Ju1cBmowIpZypZy9QCMvxTlBOE=/202x0:1822x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68945213/oneplus_leak.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images of OnePlus’ upcoming 9-series phones show prominent branding from camera partner Hasselblad. | Image: WinFuture&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gGsXN9"&gt;We have a very clear picture of what the upcoming OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro will look like thanks to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture &lt;/em&gt;— the site has &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,121663.html"&gt;published a whole bunch of official press renders&lt;/a&gt; of the upcoming phones well ahead of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22315517/oneplus-9-launch-date-hasselblad-camera"&gt;March 23rd launch&lt;/a&gt;. We got our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319657/oneplus-9-charger-in-box-pete-lau-announcement"&gt;first official look&lt;/a&gt; at the upcoming flagship in a teaser video from OnePlus earlier this week, but this latest leak features both regular and Pro models from multiple angles in a variety of colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QodKHK"&gt;These renders align with what OnePlus has already shared, and they also resemble an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174437/oneplus-9-photos-leak-2021-flagship"&gt;alleged prototype device&lt;/a&gt; that was leaked late last year. It appears that the OnePlus 9 Pro will come with a slightly curved 6.7-inch display, and the OnePlus 9 will feature a flat 6.5-inch screen. That’s about the extent of the spec details in this leak; &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; speculates that the 9 may use a plastic chassis rather than metal, but it’s hard to say for sure based on these images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xusBIS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10385194"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1pZUzb"&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; evident is the Hasselblad branding on both devices’ camera bumps, thanks to a new partnership. Both phones include a Sony IMX789 sensor in the main camera, and as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369304680241762311"&gt;confirmed by OnePlus CEO Pete Lau&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, an ultrawide camera will be included with a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor. That’s an unusually high resolution count for an ultrawide, but as Lau demonstrates with some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369505640771633157"&gt;side-by-side images&lt;/a&gt;, those extra pixels might allow for more aggressive distortion correction and cropping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZ85vg"&gt;Outside of camera lenses, these renderings show the range of color options we can likely expect from the 9 and 9 Pro. The 9 Pro is shown in sturdy black, olive green, and metallic silver. The 9 looks to be offered in black, with more laid-back blue and purple options available, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A YouTuber has already posted a full Galaxy A52 5G unboxing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SefcI2MdrvWvu0FJjNfLlRMxlOs=/267x0:1842x1050/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944216/galaxya52_unboxing_leak.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;New A-series phones, including the A52 5G seen here, are expected to debut on March 17th. | Image: Moboaesthetics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1uGRyb"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G will likely be announced next week at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322232/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-unpacked-event-awesome"&gt;Samsung’s second Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt; of the year, but thanks to an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/gKPSqrWtAKc"&gt;early unboxing&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a52_5g_appears_in_unboxing_video-news-48142.php"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we won’t have to wait that long to see it in action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcfms9"&gt;The upcoming midrange device has been subject to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;plenty of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309330/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-security-updates-leak"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt; over the past few weeks, and the video from YouTuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh1fruDeJL4QcVgFUULX_cQ"&gt;Moboaesthetics&lt;/a&gt; seems to confirm many of them. The device in the video matches up with previously leaked renders and appears to be fully functional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbnzcg"&gt;Specs featured in the lengthy video include a 64-megapixel main camera with OIS, a 120Hz display, IP67 dust and water resistance, under-screen fingerprint sensor, and a 4,500mAh battery. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230868/samsung-galaxy-s21-storage-microsd-support-slot"&gt;Unlike the S21 series&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a microSD card slot for memory expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dQsP3w"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKPSqrWtAKc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tolgqU"&gt;The A52 5G and also-rumored A72 5G are both expected to be accompanied by cheaper non-5G variants with other slightly downgraded specs, like a 90Hz screen rather than 120Hz. All told, they’re shaping up to look like highly competitive midrange phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAegLA"&gt;Samsung has not confirmed exactly what it’s announcing at next week’s event, but given the appearance of this video and the recent leaks, it seems certain that the A52 5G will be making its debut soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter tries to fix problematic image crops by not cropping pictures anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4gOvrR0-X2nZdOI9bHzEx72IW3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942725/akrales_180620_1777_0282.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HE8qby"&gt;Twitter has devised a potential solution to its problematic image cropping issue: no more cropping. The company said on Wednesday it’s now testing a “what you see is what you get” image preview within the tweet compose box and experimenting with displaying full-frame images. That way, images will show up in the Twitter timeline looking just as they did when the user was composing the tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPy8CD"&gt;“Now testing on Android and iOS: when you Tweet a single image, how the image appears in the Tweet composer is how it will look on the timeline –– bigger and better,” the company wrote in its announcement tweet on the new feature test. Twitter also says its testing new 4K image uploading on Android and iOS as part of a broader push “to improve how you can share and view media on Twitter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gs69cb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now testing on Android and iOS: when you Tweet a single image, how the image appears in the Tweet composer is how it will look on the timeline –– bigger and better. &lt;a href="https://t.co/izI5S9VRdX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/izI5S9VRdX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1369680667886444548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zh1e8t"&gt;With the new image preview change, there should be less algorithmic surprises — like the ones several users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;brought attention to last fall&lt;/a&gt; that showed how the company’s automated cropping tool quite often favored white faces over Black ones. In many of those cases, irregularly sized images shared on Twitter were automatically cropped behind the scenes using an AI-powered algorithm, but in ways that raised some troubling questions about how the software prioritized skin color and other factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k1sqTZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Trying a horrible experiment...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which will the Twitter algorithm pick: Mitch McConnell or Barack Obama? &lt;a href="https://t.co/bR1GRyCkia"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bR1GRyCkia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tony “Abolish ICE” Arcieri   (@bascule) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bascule/status/1307440596668182528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 19, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BvAmEm"&gt;Twitter at the time said the neural network it uses for automated image cropping was tested for racial bias, and the company claims it found none. But it also admitted it needed to perform more analysis and refine its approach to avoid situations like this where even the appearance of bias was a possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaGZrA"&gt;“It’s clear that we’ve got more analysis to do. We’ll open source our work so others can review and replicate,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lizkelley/status/1307742267193532416"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; Twitter communications lead Liz Kelley in the aftermath of the controversy going viral. “Just because a system shows no statistical bias, doesn’t mean it won’t cause harm.” Kelley said Twitter would rely “less on auto-cropping so more often the photo you see in the Tweet composer is what it will look like in the Tweet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aPUBWa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;we are going to rely less on auto-cropping so more often the photo you see in the Tweet composer is what it will look like in the Tweet   =  &lt;/p&gt;— liz kelley (@lizkelley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lizkelley/status/1311796809652555776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 1, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bjw06K"&gt;Twitter’s Parag Agrawal, the company’s chief technology officer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498619/twitter-image-cropping-update-racial-bias-machine-learning"&gt;later wrote a blog post delving into the issue at length&lt;/a&gt;, saying at the time that Twitter would be conducting “additional analysis to add further rigor to our testing” and that it was “committed to sharing our findings and... exploring ways to open-source our analysis so that others can help keep us accountable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01NJCK"&gt;Now, it looks like Twitter’s proposed solution is here, at least in a test phase. While tweets in standard aspect ratios will be identical when previewed in the compose window and displayed in the timeline, Twitter’s design chief Dantley Davis says extra-wide or tall images will be center cropped for those included in the test. Twitter has not shared a concrete timeline for when this change may be pushed live for all users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eAGrtv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;With this test, we hope to learn if this new approach is better and what changes we need to make to provide a “what you see is what you get” experience for Tweets with images.&lt;/p&gt;— Dantley Davis (@dantley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dantley/status/1369682378730389506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L3fH5t"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ new ROG Phone 5 Ultimate has 18GB of RAM and a rear-facing OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xU7BKq-g8xVhFCvkMdSg7K2Fa6Q=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940445/cfaulkner_210228_4452_00010.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7O1TxR"&gt;Asus is going big with its latest gaming phones. The ROG Phone 5 lineup will start shipping this month across the globe, costing 799 euros (around $950) for the base configuration with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of fast UFS 3.1 storage. Every configuration has a 6.78-inch FHD+ OLED screen with a 144Hz refresh rate and a 300Hz touch sampling rate. Also, the headphone jack has made a comeback after being absent from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21332716/asus-rog-phone-3-gaming-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-airtriggers-oled-ram"&gt;ROG Phone 3&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a quad DAC in tow for hi-res audio. (In case you’re wondering where the ROG Phone 4 went, Asus skipped over the number four, like OnePlus did, due to its similarities with the word “death” in some Asian languages.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hemsoR"&gt;The most notable changes from the last generation are exclusive to some even more expensive configurations, the ROG Phone 5 Pro and Ultimate (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22085537"&gt;which I published a review of&lt;/a&gt;) that release in April for 1,199 euros (approximately $1,420) and in May for 1,299 euros (about $1,583), respectively. Both of these models have double the storage and more RAM (starting at 16GB in the Pro and going all the way up to 18GB in the Ultimate); come in limited edition colors; and have two additional ultrasonic touch sensors than the standard model, located near where your ring fingers might rest while holding the phone in landscape mode. You’ll also get a case and a clip-on AeroActive Cooler 5 fan attachment with purchase with either the Pro or Ultimate phone (which adds two more buttons attached to the fan.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/702SiKs875OMZ6GWr4U0CZDa5Us=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357713/aeroactivecooler.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IG0kJe"&gt;The new Asus gaming phones aren’t huge departures from their predecessors, though the hardware and software are more refined. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22085537"&gt;I reviewed the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, and while it delivers on its promises to be a spec and feature juggernaut in some clever ways, paying $1,580 for it seems steep. Even the $950 base configuration isn’t what I’d consider affordable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMz3EQ"&gt;The Ultimate and Pro include “ROG Vision,” a feature that pushes premade or custom text or graphics to its rear-facing OLED screen. It’s a spin on Asus’ “Anime Matrix” effect used in the Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop, allowing you to personalize your phone if you want. The standard ROG Phone 5 simply has a backlit ROG logo, which some might find to be just enough pizazz.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r0hESauBGwuXXO05RRb5bE2v-xY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354178/cfaulkner_210228_4452_00012.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pIhpxO"&gt;I go into all of the features in the review. But if you’re just passing by and want to know all about the specs, I’ve attached a handy table just for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate review: overkill</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a mystifying phone with a steep price tag&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FWmeum"&gt;It’s reductive to refer to the Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate as &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;a phone, even if it is one. Sure, it runs Android 11, and it can take calls, snap pictures, and do all of the other stuff every other phone can do. But if its edgy looks and tiny monochromatic OLED screen mounted on its back didn’t already give it away, this phone is &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lm7OXX"&gt;This is Asus’ latest attempt (technically its fourth, but it’s skipping that number in the name for superstitious reasons) at building a console-like experience into a phone for a niche but thriving global crowd of mobile gamers. It offers more power and customization than other large-screened phones, both in terms of hardware and software. It’s a real spec sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5c0Dw"&gt;For example, it has multiple USB-C ports to let you charge it in either landscape or portrait mode. This model also includes a snap-on fan cooler (its sole job is to keep the phone from overheating when you overclock it), and the fan packs USB-C passthrough charging, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and two remappable trigger buttons. In addition to that, there are some ultrasonic sensors around the phone that can replace some touch controls to make games feel more like you’re using a controller. And for this year’s model, its Armoury Crate app can boost its processor and graphics speed, increase the screen’s refresh rate, and more on a per-game basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BL7tXd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10382537"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XsosXV"&gt;The Ultimate is Asus’ highest-end ROG Phone 5 coming in May for 1,299 euros (which is around $1,583). But other less expensive options will ship before then, starting in March for around $950. How does Asus justify the $600 price delta? This is the only configuration that has a matte white colorway with a few blue details sprinkled around the phone. And it’s the only one in the lineup — and perhaps the only phone other than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314911/redmagic-6-tencent-edition-specs-price-launch-date-announced"&gt;RedMagic’s new 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; — that has 18GB of RAM. It’s an impressive spec to find in a phone, but I’m still searching for a use case that requires having this much RAM. The cheaper versions of the ROG Phone 5 ship with 16GB and 12GB of RAM, respectively, which I’m betting doesn’t make a huge difference in performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l1DHHm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10382540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rG56aG"&gt;The Ultimate, in particular, seems to be made for only the most diehard of ROG fans. The phone comes with a laptop-sized box filled with a ROG-themed ball cap, towel, face covering, stickers, and more goodies. Aside from the aforementioned specs, the ever-so-slightly less expensive (but still around $1,420) ROG Phone 5 Pro, coming in April 2021, is very similar to the Ultimate. Both phones include two additional ultrasonic sensors on their backs near where your ring fingers might rest while holding them in landscape mode, as well as the rear-facing OLED screen I mentioned earlier called “ROG Vision.” It’s a thumb drive-sized display that’s a spin on Asus’ “Anime Matrix” effect used in the Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop, possibly attracting even more eyeballs at this bizarre-looking phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f8BuFXAogjiciePCr5tO1d9IoN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357615/mask_up.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I couldn’t really think of what else to do with ROG Vision, so I made a PSA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxl0z"&gt;Asus provides preloaded messages and graphics to use for the display that are situational depending on whether you’re gaming, charging the phone, or getting a call on your phone, to name a few, but you can crop your own images to fit within the display, as I did. Anything from a scrolling message with emoji to an image will work, and you can customize it further with an animation, like a static fade or fireworks. It’s like a souped-up version of the LEDs that companies put on the outside of flip phones, or even on Samsung’s Z Flip. The standard ROG Phone 5 has an RGB-backlit ROG logo instead. Some might actually prefer that to having the extra screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jUs82o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10382527"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i9KsE5"&gt;The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is a better gaming phone than its predecessors, as well as the competing devices I’ve tried so far from Xiaomi’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/15/18678066/black-shark-2-xiaomi-gaming-phone-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;Black Shark&lt;/a&gt;. For one, it’s the most powerful option out there with the Snapdragon 888 processor and its 18GB of RAM. Every device in the lineup starts with 512GB of fast UFS 3.1 storage, so it flies with opening apps, switching between them, and for other tasks that access storage. Its 6.78-inch FHD+ (2448 x 1080) OLED screen is one of the best I’ve ever used, even if it’s far too large to be my ideal size. Asus kept the 144Hz refresh rate (which automatically adjusts per app for efficiency by default) from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21332716/asus-rog-phone-3-gaming-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-airtriggers-oled-ram"&gt;ROG Phone 3&lt;/a&gt;, but its touch latency is down to 24 milliseconds here with a 300Hz touch sampling rate, meaning it checks 300 times per second to see where you’ve touched it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063061/oneplus-8-120-hz-high-refresh-rate-screen-pete-lau"&gt;The OnePlus 8 Pro has a 240Hz sampling rate&lt;/a&gt;, for context. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314911/redmagic-6-tencent-edition-specs-price-launch-date-announced"&gt;The new RedMagic 6&lt;/a&gt; that’s expected to be far more affordable than the base ROG Phone 5 configuration uses similar display tech, but with a faster 165Hz refresh rate and a faster 500Hz touch sampling rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veyvt9"&gt;The specs and display used in each ROG Phone 5 make playing games look sharp and run smoothly, and some other features elevate the experience further, whether you’re gaming or watching movies. I particularly love the dual front-facing speakers. They offer the best stereo separation I’ve heard from a phone — to the point where, in most situations, I’m just as pleased to listen to audio aloud at home as I am through headphones. Speaking of, this year’s device sees the return of a 3.5mm audio jack that was missing from the 2020 ROG Phone 3. Asus brought it back with a vengeance, too, equipped with an ESS ES9280AC Pro quad DAC for hi-res audio. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/joa1UySTEX9Ia-WFeaS_O8GGpDs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357064/gamegenie.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Game Genie overlay offers instant access to system info and settings with a swipe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2TSpkT"&gt;Asus has spent the year refining its Armoury Crate game launcher-meets-dedicated console UI. Its looks haven’t changed dramatically since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20896952/asus-rog-phone-ii-review-android-gaming-phone-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Phone II&lt;/a&gt;, but in case you’re hearing about this for the first time, it’s filled with so many useful features for gamers. It lets you make a “scenario profile’’ for each game, where you can tweak settings to get more out of each game and, in turn, squeeze more performance from the ROG Phone 5. A profile consists of things like what refresh rate you want the screen to run at, and how much you want to amp up the power of the processor, graphics chip, and RAM. It even lets you turn off network switching, as well as background data and app syncing on a per-game basis. If you’re familiar with gaming on PC, the closest parallel is Nvidia’s GeForce Experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sD1CH1"&gt;A big part of this software — and one of the more compelling features of the phone itself — is configuring AirTriggers. These ultrasonic sensors embedded within the phone can be mapped to emulate buttons so you don’t need to use the touch screen as often. All of the ROG Phone 5 models have sensors along the right edge, so they feel like triggers when you’re holding them in landscape mode. The Ultimate and Pro models add two additional touch sensors near where my ring fingers rest on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZLYieS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10382549"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C9a4qX"&gt;As a way to avoid using clumsy touch controls, AirTriggers are still as handy and clever as ever. Being able to map the jump and attack commands in games like &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt; actually makes those mobile ports fun to play for me. What’s great is that games don’t need to support controllers for the feature to work. While a game is running, you can move an AirTrigger cursor onto whichever command you’d like to create a “button” for on the phone. In the settings, you can choose whether you want to tap or swipe to issue the command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVb21X"&gt;I’ve barely scratched the surface in terms of the settings you can tweak. In addition to AirTriggers, you can map motion controls to execute commands. And by clamping the included AeroActive Cooler 5 fan onto the phone, it affords two extra trigger buttons that can be mapped to your liking, plus a kickstand. There’s just &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; customization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/702SiKs875OMZ6GWr4U0CZDa5Us=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357713/aeroactivecooler.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AeroActive Cooler 5 snapped on. I have my middle fingers resting on the mappable triggers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QZpaJR"&gt;Outside of gaming on a PC, I’m in the “controller or bust” camp, and thus, I don’t usually want to suffer through touch controls to play the latest Android games. AirTriggers makes the experience better, no doubt, but it’s still not enough to convert me. Thankfully, for people like me, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate (and the other new models) supports some modern controllers, like Microsoft’s Xbox One controller, Sony’s DualShock 4, or Google’s Stadia controller. Impressively, the software lets you remap the controls for any mobile game onto those controllers. It detected my Xbox controller immediately when I connected it with an OTG adapter, and mapping the buttons was simpler than I expected. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bauGjkOzCSny8HLoDmof6GV1c-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357258/genshinmapping.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s easy to map on-screen controls to a controller through the Game Genie function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lmyjhj"&gt;As for the actual phone stuff, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is a high-end phone through and through. It has responsive haptic feedback at every turn, whether you’re getting text messages, tapping your way through Asus’ ROG UI interface (its game-themed twist on Zen UI, which is refined as ever), or using the AirTriggers in a game. Asus told me that it tuned its haptics in-house, and compared to some other Android phones I’ve used, it doesn’t buzz loudly or rattle the phone. It’s what I hope more phone haptics feel like once &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297285/qualcomm-lofelt-haptics-vibration-snapdragon-888-api-software"&gt;Qualcomm and Lofelt roll out their haptics framework for other devices running the Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt;. But as Asus proved with this phone, a company can make good haptics if it wants to. This device has a 6,000mAh battery inside that’s split into two 3,000mAh cells, which Asus says helps with lower charge and discharge temperatures. Additionally, it allows the phone to recharge at 65W speeds, but it lacks wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The selfie cam is fine, but there’s some lens flare above Becca’s head, and the details are a little soft. Some people may like that, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ri3Fy1J78DFStaUnhPxWOh7lfVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357250/rogphone5ultimateportrait.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portrait mode is totally serviceable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xu9pgX"&gt;Asus has committed to launching the ROG Phone 5 lineup globally, but it hasn’t shared a specific launch date in the US or official pricing, which is why I’ve been going off a euro conversion. However, the company told me that all of these phones will work on T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T, and to that end, they support these carriers’ sub-6GHz 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="PB9gZC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10382481"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="evccUQ"&gt;It’s amazing to see what a manufacturer can do when it isn’t worried about making the thinnest design with the best cameras, or stuck on meeting an ultra-competitive price point as the likes of Samsung, Apple, and Google are. Asus wasn’t afraid to get weird here, and that weirdness comes through in several ways that make it a good fit for gamers chasing after the most powerful phone in existence at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vK1VPu"&gt;Though, the value here falls apart completely if you think about it too much. For the $1,580 that this phone costs, you could build a very good PC or get a PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch together with change left over. Outside of paying for a phone data plan, this would add about $65 to that if you finance it with monthly payments over a two-year period. While this phone definitely has a leg up on the competition when it comes to power and software features, it’s not worth paying this much to get them. And if you just want to stream games via the cloud with Microsoft’s xCloud service or with Google Stadia, you only need to spend a fraction of this cost to get a phone that can do game streaming well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdgHOlLWcRVY9Rb32zyALR7BehM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354177/cfaulkner_210228_4452_00010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stock wallpapers are actually great this time around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qYdOzO"&gt;Like every gaming phone I’ve checked out yet, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is stuck in this weird place of being a very capable device that somehow delivers on its many promises, yet it still doesn’t feel worth the money. For average people who play the occasional game, either directly from their phones or through game streaming services, buying a cheap clip to fasten a controller to your phone will probably be a good enough solution. There are also some comfortable controller setups for iPhone and Android (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbones-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone’s Go&lt;/a&gt; and Razer’s Kishi for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431952/razer-kishi-controller-iphone-ios-review"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) that can turn most phones into more of a Nintendo Switch-like experience that requires less fuss and far less of an investment than Asus’ ROG Phone 5 Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;
