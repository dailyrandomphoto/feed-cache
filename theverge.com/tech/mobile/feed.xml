    <title>Samsung refreshes two budget A-series phones with 5G and higher prices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy A13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fMVe7Us2BfT5wo5TScRlxJDJnaU=/120x0:4620x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214532/GalaxyA13_5G_Green_Lockup_RGB_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A13 will be an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive starting December 3rd, 2021, before being available on T-Mobile and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://Samsung.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in early 2022.&lt;/em&gt; | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ArTaVC"&gt;With 2022 and CES just around the corner, Samsung is ready to introduce new updates to its popular and budget-friendly A-series, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749880/samsung-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-memory-mobile"&gt;helped keep sales strong&lt;/a&gt; for the Korean company despite supply woes for the flagship Galaxy S21. This time around, both the Galaxy A13 5G and A03S are getting a bit more expensive while confirming some new hardware and 5G connectivity for the A13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r26Tc7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy A13 5G&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pC9P83"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21628573/samsung-a12-a02s-phones-budget-price-specs-2021"&gt;4G-only Galaxy A12&lt;/a&gt;, the new A13 will be able to access 5G networks, specifically, with the sub-6GHz bands available on T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T. The A13’s 5G readiness partly explains its new $249.99 price. That’s a whopping $70 increase from its $179.99 predecessor and slightly cheaper than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$279.99 Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; with similar specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PE9zXH"&gt;Its higher price makes it possible to bring some premium features to the A13, as the relatively low-resolution 6.5-inch Infinity-V HD Plus display will feel smoother with its 90Hz adaptive refresh rate. This is up from the standard 60Hz of the A12 and keeps pace with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;$239.99 OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; that offers a 1080p display with 90Hz refresh. Thanks to its more up-to-date MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor, the A13 is better equipped to multitask and handle various mobile games than the &lt;a href="https://nanoreview.net/en/soc-compare/mediatek-helio-p35-vs-mediatek-dimensity-700"&gt;A12, which shipped last year with a chipset from 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The A13 also promises an updated triple-camera system with a 50-megapixel main camera, plus a macro and a depth sensor for bokeh effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy A13 5G’s side fingerprint sensor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yKa0PfMZkzh5p2eF9xR6aNNf5MQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055054/GalaxyA13_5G_Black_RSide_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A13 5G features a fingerprint sensor embedded into its power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wxgMx2"&gt;It’s a bit disappointing that the A13 will only have 64GB of internal memory — yes, its microSD slot will support up to a 1TB card — and Samsung has not specified how much RAM this model has (the A12 had 3GB RAM). That said, you’ll be able to plug wired headphones into its 3.5mm audio jack, make contactless payments via NFC, enjoy a 5,000mAh battery, and use the side fingerprint sensor to unlock your phone (there is no face unlock option). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3iXvD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy A03S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fP8FvF"&gt;Samsung is not revealing nearly as many details about the upcoming Galaxy A03S, only confirming that the A03S will cost $159.99 when it ships in 2022, while the base A02S debuted at just $109.99 last year. With scant details about the A03S’s new hardware to justify this $50 price increase, the press release hints that it’ll have “a long-lasting battery, triple camera system, and fingerprint security.” You can probably expect an updated processor from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21628573/samsung-a12-a02s-phones-budget-price-specs-2021"&gt;A02S&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps 32GB of storage in the base model, but you’ll have to wait for CES or a potential Samsung Unpacked event to find out more, including what it looks like because we don’t have pictures of it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWXuoD"&gt;Both phones will ship with Android 11, but it’s unclear whether they will receive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of regular security updates&lt;/a&gt; like Samsung has guaranteed for some A-series phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3zlTZ"&gt;The new A13 5G will be an AT&amp;amp;T online exclusive starting on December 3rd, 2021, with T-Mobile and Samsung.com following suit in early January 2022. If you prefer the ultra-budget A03S, you’ll need to wait until early January 2022, when it’ll be available on AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Samsung.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3KejH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip is here to power the Android flagships of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-FP9dyJyaIVdY_TvNUruvjV_Cx0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70212202/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Mobile_Platform__Key_Visual__Angle_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SuNSYq"&gt;Qualcomm has a new flagship smartphone processor: the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, announced at the company’s annual Snapdragon Tech Summit, giving an early preview at the brains behind the most powerful smartphones of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9IvvH"&gt;The successor to last year’s Snapdragon 888, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is the first chipset to bear Qualcomm’s new naming scheme (which the company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796541/qualcomm-snapdragon-branding-naming-scheme-changes-updates"&gt;previously teased last week&lt;/a&gt;), ditching the triple-digit numbering system that Qualcomm has previously used for new, generation-based monikers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cB2M3v"&gt;As is the case every year, Qualcomm is promising some major improvements in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, with better performance, camera technology, AI capabilities, security, and 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u2juAI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;20 percent better CPU performance and up to 30 percent CPU power efficiency&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Od6QyN"&gt;Let’s start with the hard specs. As expected, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is the first chip from Qualcomm to use the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22448107/arm-armv9-architecure-cortex-x2-a710-cpu-mali-g710-gpu-android-2022-designs"&gt;latest Armv9 architecture from Arm&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the new eight-core Kryo CPU will feature a single prime core based on the Cortex-X2 at 3.0GHz, along with three performance cores based on Cortex-A710 at 2.5GHz, and a quartet of efficiency cores based on the Cortex-A510 design at 1.8GHz. Additionally, the new chip jumps to a 4nm process, from the 5nm process on which the Snapdragon 888 was built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJ3LTB"&gt;All told, Qualcomm promises that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 will offer up to 20 percent better performance and up to 30 percent more power efficiency over last year’s model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYm24t"&gt;Meanwhile, the new Adreno GPU (much like the Gen 1’s Kryo CPU, Qualcomm didn’t give a specific number for the updated hardware here) promises to offer 30 percent faster graphics rendering, in addition to 25 percent better power efficiency compared to the Snapdragon 888. It’ll also offer a new GPU control panel for fine-tuning how games are running on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X4juexRZOAnmC4QbR2ZCXAq0eqc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053637/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Block_Diagram.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OkrJfj"&gt;Making its debut on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274127/qualcomm-x65-5g-modem-10gbps-speeds-ai-tuning-software-updates"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X65 modem&lt;/a&gt;, which promises a whole suite of 5G features and firsts. As Qualcomm’s fourth-generation 5G modem, it builds on the existing mmWave and sub-6GHz compatibility that came before, adding support for up to 10Gbps speeds and the latest 3GPP Release 16 specification. As is always the case, you almost certainly won’t actually see that kind of speed in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5nkUO"&gt;The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 also supports Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth LE Audio (a first for Qualcomm), and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652655/qualcomm-aptx-lossless-announced-snapdragon-sound"&gt;company’s Snapdragon Sound technology&lt;/a&gt; for enabling AptX Lossless wireless audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wzUiT6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;18-bit RAW photos and 8K HDR video — if your camera can handle it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9bnlut"&gt;As is traditional for Qualcomm’s top-tier processor, the company is putting a big emphasis on its beefed-up camera capabilities, which the company is bundling together for the first time under a new “Snapdragon Sight” brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMw4vp"&gt;While the Spectra ISP is once again a triple ISP system, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 upgrades things up to an 18-bit system (up from 14 bits on the 888). That translates to 4,096 times more camera data and up to four additional stops of dynamic range for very bright or very dark scenarios. The triple ISP (image signal processor) also allows for things like shooting 240 12-megapixel photos in a single second or simultaneously shooting in 8K with HDR while snapping 64-megapixel stills thanks to an increased 3.2-gigapixel per second throughput.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxZitX"&gt;Qualcomm is also offering more high-end camera features out of the box, including support for shooting in 8K video with HDR 10 Plus and shooting in 18-bit RAW (assuming your phone has the camera hardware to actually pull it off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxU45a"&gt;The 8 Gen 1 also features a variety of other imaging improvements, including better dark mode pictures that can use data from up to 30 images in a single shot (up from six images on the 888). There’s also a host of better AI processing techniques, with improved auto-exposure, auto-focus, and auto-face detection technology, a dedicated “bokeh engine” for adding portrait effects to 4K video, and an “ultrawide engine” that can de-warp and remove chromatic aberrations from shots. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WcfdqVR73HgJz6eUJCWh9VGLo2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053641/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Chip_Image.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3IESWU"&gt;Qualcomm is also adding a &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; ISP, located in the dedicated sensing hub on the SoC: unlike the triple ISP for the primary camera, the new ISP is designed specifically to power an always-on camera that’s active at all times. Qualcomm has some big ambitions for what developers can do with the always-on camera, like automatically shutting off your screen when you put your phone down or if it detects someone trying to read over your shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MR5cbn"&gt;And while the idea of an always-on camera raises some obvious security concerns, Qualcomm argues that the feature is intended to help make using your device &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; secure, with any camera data for the always-on camera staying locally on-device in the chip’s secure enclave. Additionally, customers will be able to opt in to using the always-on camera, much in the same way that they can choose whether to use an always-listening microphone feature for voice assistants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w34JYb"&gt;Still, though, the added capability — and how manufacturers implement it into their devices, if they do at all — will be something to watch when the first chips with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 roll out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O377mH"&gt;On the AI side of things, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 features Qualcomm’s latest Hexagon processor, with its seventh-generation AI engine, which the company says is four times faster than its predecessor and up to 1.7 times more power efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wTFjT"&gt;The company showed off a variety of use cases that the boosted AI performance can enable, including the aforementioned camera functionality, a “Leica Leitz Look mode” that emulates Leica lens effects, and improved detection of where you’re holding your phone for optimizing antenna performance. Additionally, Qualcomm is adding AI-powered sampling to offer a DLSS-style effect for improving mobile games, something that it says will happen automatically when gaming on the 8 Gen 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VpVaCh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Four times better AI performance compared to last year’s model&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IyRwV5"&gt;Lastly, there are security improvements. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 adds a new hardware-level layer of security with a “dedicated Trust Management Engine,” in addition to offering support for the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/security/android-ready-se"&gt;Android Ready SE standard&lt;/a&gt;, enabling support for digital car keys, driver’s licenses, IDs, and e-money wallets. There’s also built-in iSIM support for directly connecting to cellular networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9agPT"&gt;Despite the new branding, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 doesn’t appear to break the mold for Qualcomm’s chips, offering the usual generational upgrades we’ve come to expect from the company’s annual flagships. Still, in a world where bespoke chips like Google’s Tensor or Apple’s A-series processors are becoming increasingly popular, it’s good to see that Qualcomm has no intention of slowing the pace on its own top chips, even as the competition heats up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ouwCZ"&gt;And with the first Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 smartphones expected before the end of 2021, it won’t be long before we’ll be able to see just how powerful Qualcomm’s latest chip is for ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket League’s mobile spinoff is now available worldwide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOSllyutfYuou4i0YGiHSCVd-K4=/0x0:1998x1332/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70208606/msedge_IPE3MxMO6w.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Px9y0k"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt;, a mobile version of the popular car-based soccer game, is now available on iOS and Android. The game started &lt;a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-league-sideswipe-preseason-begins-today/"&gt;rolling out on November 15th&lt;/a&gt; in Oceania, but is now available worldwide, albeit in a “pre-season” mode ahead of Season 1’s kickoff at an unannounced later date, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/29/rocket-league-sideswipe-android-ios-launch/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQxQ2n"&gt;The free to play game, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22345184/rocket-league-sideswipe-android-ios-announced"&gt;first announced in March&lt;/a&gt;, is a simplified version of the original &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; released in 2015. The biggest change is that the mobile version is played in 2D, rather than offering a fully three-dimensional stadium to drive around. You control your car with a virtual joystick on the left side of the screen, while buttons on the right handle jumping and boost. with touch controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="O1fs8k"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Rocket League Sideswipe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Available Worldwide on iOS and Android. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LL5qUjdoCl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LL5qUjdoCl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rocket League Sideswipe (@RLSideswipe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RLSideswipe/status/1465446286841331715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="teQGbr"&gt;Unlike in regular &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, the car’s boost auto-regenerates, so there’s no need to seek out recharging pads, and teams are limited to a maximum of two players per side. Available game styles include the game’s standard soccer mode as well as a basketball-style “Hoops” version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNQed9"&gt;If that sounds tempting, you can download &lt;em&gt;Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rocket-league-sideswipe/id1549027048"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Psyonix.RL2D&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Many T-Mobile customers report they can’t call Verizon, AT&amp;T, or other T-Mobile numbers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8VCvk2"&gt;T-Mobile customers have been reporting issues making and receiving calls all afternoon, with problems frequently linked to Verizon numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nrdSdS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon and T-Mobile both say their networks weren’t at fault&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ddNNO"&gt;This all started around 2PM ET this afternoon, with hotspots showing in most major metro areas on &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;Downdetector&lt;/a&gt;. Initial reports suggested Verizon might be having issues, but Verizon spokesperson Kevin King tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its network is operating “business as usual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCDgao"&gt;T-Mobile declined to provide a quote from a named spokesperson, but a representative sent the following message from the company’s media relations address: “We have no indication that this is a T-Mobile network issue but we have taken steps to reroute our customers and have been in close contact with Verizon throughout the day as they work to resolve this. We apologize to any customers who were impacted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8wFwb0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;User reports indicate T-Mobile is having problems since 1:49 PM EST. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LExjRid785"&gt;https://t.co/LExjRid785&lt;/a&gt; RT if you're also having problems &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TMobiledown?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TMobiledown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Downdetector (@downdetector) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/downdetector/status/1465392459878473745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

The reported problems range from instantly dropped calls, to “all circuits are busy” messages, to lag even when people are able to get a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHG3kC"&gt;A test call between one T-Mobile prepaid number and a Verizon number worked for us, but posts across social media continue to note issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDPT6G"&gt;We haven’t seen widespread reports of AT&amp;amp;T issues, other than from T-Mobile customers who are having problems calling out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U4NUP8"&gt;It’s still unclear precisely what was causing the issues, or even who felt its impact. However, as T-Mobile indicated, by later in the evening the number of reported issues dropped sharply and things seem to be returning to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2jyzK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 29th, 11PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from T-Mobile and notes that the issue seems to be going away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 3 is up to $500 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1vJ1e6XX8032Pqgdd0I-F7Qm4Qw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70200959/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rQ5Rvk"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 3 is the company’s lowest-priced foldable yet at its normal $999.99, but today you can get the trendy phone for way, way less than that. In an early &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796645/cyber-monday-2021-early-deals-sales-tech-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"&gt;Cyber Monday 2021 deal&lt;/a&gt;, the unlocked Z Flip 3 is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf5XF4x8a5W" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available from Best Buy for $599.99&lt;/a&gt; if you activate service on the device with your purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UglclJ"&gt;That’s a colossal $400 discount from the Flip 3’s regular price and brings it on par with something like the Pixel 6. Google’s phone is terrific, but it certainly doesn’t have the cool factor of a folding screen. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers can both get that price for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Ya367"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10890426"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1nrHXB"&gt;In certain cases, you can save even more. Activating a new line of service on T-Mobile / Sprint brings the price down to $499.99 for the unlocked Z Flip 3. If you can deal with some carrier bloatware, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf5XSZjbTWp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Verizon model&lt;/a&gt; is also discounted to $499.99 if you’re eligible for an upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lllbdG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Cyber Monday deals happening now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22796645/cyber-monday-2021-early-deals-sales-tech-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KxuzHf"&gt;Take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review of the Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll find that my colleague Dan Seifert praised Samsung’s first truly mainstream foldable for its excellent screen, snappy performance, water resistance, and compact size when folded up. If there’s one weak point of the phone, its battery life is merely average among the competition. But there’s no denying the sleek look of this thing — and that cream color still looks just as fantastic now as when Samsung announced it, though the deal applies to the black, green, and lavender colors if those are more your style.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new A03 and A03 Core look like big bargains but we can’t quite tell yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EyhN7xDJsWS_BikbqX1GQu59JA=/0x27:650x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70195939/samsung_galaxy_ao03_core.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A03 Core has a 6.5-inch display. | Photo by Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v6gbQA"&gt;Samsung has quietly added two new devices to its entry-level A-series lineup: the Galaxy A03 and Galaxy A03 Core. And while both devices don’t yet have a set price, we can predict that they’ll both be pretty affordable, considering how Samsung prices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;the rest of its A-series devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4wU0s7lcMGKNc940UX4SlKDZqjg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23044852/samsung_galaxy_a023_standard.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A03 has a dual rear camera with a 48MP main sensor.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KhODGa"&gt;An infographic posted on &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/infographic-the-galaxy-a03-is-upgrading-core-mobile-features-to-make-your-day-to-day-more-convenient"&gt;Samsung’s site&lt;/a&gt; outlines the A03’s specs (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/26/samsung-quietly-launches-galaxy-a03-w-48mp-camera-5000mah-battery-more/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The device comes with a dual rear camera with a 48MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, which helps the camera focus on the main subject of the photo rather than giving you a different ultrawide or zoomed in perspective. Meanwhile, the front of the device comes with a waterdrop notch containing a 5MP selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIQK8L"&gt;The A03 sports a 6.5-inch HD Plus Infinity-V display, and a 5,000mAh battery. In terms of performance, it comes with an unspecified octa-core 1.6GHz chipset, as well as options for 3GB or 4GB of RAM and 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB of internal storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bTen8LmAMdC8L7Q7TchYiYigev8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23044615/samsung_a03_back.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A03 Core comes with an 8MP camera on its rear.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nkkMYk"&gt;Details for the separate Galaxy A03 Core can also be found on &lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/mediaresources/galaxy_a03_core/techspecs"&gt;Samsung’s website&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike the standard A03, it doesn’t have a fancy infographic. As its name implies, it seems like the A03 Core is a stripped-down version of the standard Galaxy A03.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4rS1x"&gt;The device has a single 8MP camera on its rear and a 5MP selfie camera, packing 2GB of RAM and 32GB of built-in storage. Aside from that, the device also has a 5,000mAh battery, and the same 6.5-inch display size as the A03. Like the base A03, Samsung has yet to reveal which company manufactures the A03 Core’s octa-core chipset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZTAeu"&gt;The Galaxy A03 will be available in blue, red, and black, while the Galaxy A03 Core just comes in blue and black. Samsung doesn’t provide any details on pricing, but judging by the A03s’ £139 (around $185 USD) price tag — which was &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/uk/samsung-adds-the-new-galaxy-a03s-to-the-galaxy-a-series"&gt;released outside of US markets in September&lt;/a&gt; — the A03 and A03 Core will likely have similar budget-friendly prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRLxHK"&gt;It’s unclear which version of Android these phones will ship with, or when Samsung will officially release the devices. Samsung also doesn’t explicitly state where the A03 and A03 Core will be available, but there’s a possibility that they’ll both reach the US, considering that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;the A02s and other A-series phones did earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and AT&amp;T offer to temporarily lower 5G’s power to avoid aircraft interference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z8gtqRmH0dQZtqHZHA7XQnJNd2c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70189166/DSCF1198-3.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5FdF8n"&gt;As the Federal Aviation Administration continues examining whether mid-band 5G spectrum could pose a risk to aircraft safety systems, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have offered to dial back the power coming from 5G cell towers for a period of six months to ease any industry concerns. Both carriers are preparing to launch crucial upgrades to their respective 5G networks using spectrum acquired in the C-band auction. This will lead to more robust 5G connectivity and faster speeds compared to the base-level 5G experience that Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T currently offer today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nq2jFU"&gt;In early November, both companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;agreed to push back the rollout by an additional month&lt;/a&gt; to January 2022. In a letter sent to the FCC today, they made clear that they’ll be moving forward with the planned mid-band 5G launch at that time. “This spectrum will be the backbone of our 5G networks for many years to come,” the companies said in the letter, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-verizon-propose-5g-limits-to-break-air-safety-standoff-11637778722?page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZwhKz"&gt;In support of the technology, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T point to years of research about potential interference and note that mid-band 5G hasn’t wreaked havoc for flights in other countries where mid-band 5G is already in place. “While we remain confident that 5G poses no risk to air safety, we are also sensitive to the Federal Aviation Administration’s desire for additional analysis of this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnmOzh"&gt;To help prevent a drawn-out conflict with the FAA, the two carriers say they’ll voluntarily take extra precautions through July 2022 “to minimize energy coming from 5G base stations — both nationwide and to an even greater degree around public airports and heliports.” That should be enough to “allay concerns about radio altimeter performance,” the companies said, while also maintaining strong performance for wireless customers. Altimeters can assist aircraft operators during landings, especially when dealing with poor visibility conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9sqaC"&gt;It’s not yet clear whether the proposal will be accepted by the FAA, which has warned pilots of the possibility that “interference from 5G transmitters and other technology could cause certain safety equipment to malfunction, requiring them to take mitigating action that could affect flight operations.” After July 6th, both carriers say they’ll set everything back to normal “unless credible evidence exists that real-world interference would occur if the mitigations were relaxed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig6lkc"&gt;“Our use of this spectrum will dramatically expand the reach and capabilities of the nation’s next-generation 5G networks, advancing US leadership, and bringing enormous benefits to consumers and the US economy,” Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T claimed in their joint letter sent to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746223/net-neutrality-fcc-jessica-rosenworcel-chair-gigi-sohn-ajit-pai-broadband"&gt;FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Protect your Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro with these unique cases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YoTIz4IU834I471hvdINIIqfYjo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70187556/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w240DX"&gt;As wonderful as the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are, their smooth glass backs are extremely slippery, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Dan Seifert mentioned in his review&lt;/a&gt;. And the official &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6_case?hl=en-US"&gt;Google frosted recycled plastic cases&lt;/a&gt; are not great solutions, thanks to their cheap feel and still slippery finish. So, where does that leave you, the new owner of Google’s flagship phone? You can’t just leave your pristine new phone naked. That’s why we’ve rounded up some third-party cases that befit the Pixel’s unique design, whether you’re looking for a case for yourself or gifting a case to a new Pixel 6 owner. Just be aware that cases may be out of stock or slow to ship, so you’ll need a lot of luck and patience to find your ideal case this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly switching to its own iPhone modem design in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro (left) and Pro Max (right)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/coOaqfrqsJvwUlP4fi3eX8G2Ipo=/0x0:2031x1354/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70186370/vpavic_210916_untitled_0058.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rM51ne"&gt;Apple is planning to partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for the production of its own 5G modems for future iPhones, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-taps-TSMC-to-build-custom-iPhone-5G-modem-in-2023"&gt;new report in &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is said to be planning to use TSMC’s 4nm process node, which hasn’t yet been deployed for any commercial product; the modem is apparently being designed and tested at 5nm before moving to mass production in 2023 at 4nm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYPkpa"&gt;Apple’s switch to modems of its own design is widely expected to happen in 2023, and TSMC is the natural manufacturing partner. Qualcomm, which is the dominant player in the industry and produces modem components for the entire iPhone 13 lineup, recently said that it expects to account for just 20 percent of iPhone modem orders in two years’ time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HhiBJg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="IAG1ZF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition"&gt;Apple bought Intel’s 5G modem division in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, foreshadowing the eventual switch. Earlier that year Qualcomm and Apple agreed to end a costly modem technology patent dispute, with Qualcomm receiving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525962/qualcomm-apple-settlement-4-5-billion-dollars-patent"&gt;more than $4 billion&lt;/a&gt; as part of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60SHji"&gt;TSMC is the manufacturer of all iPhone A-series processors and M1 systems-on-chip for Mac computers. According to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;, there are hundreds of TSMC engineers based in Cupertino to work with Apple’s chip development team. 2022 iPhone SoCs will reportedly use TSMC’s 4nm process, and some iPad models are said to be adopting 3nm processors in 2023. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;says the iPhone will make the 3nm jump “as soon as” next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y9aouK"&gt;Sustainable smartphone manufacturer Fairphone has released an Android 10 update for the six-year-old Fairphone 2, a device that originally launched with Android 5 in 2015. The update is in beta for the time being, but &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F11%2FFairphone-to-upgrade-six-year-old-Fairphone-2-to-Android-10-providing-users-with-unprecedented-seven-years-of-support.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F23%2F22798512%2Ffairphone-2-android-10-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; it hopes to release a stable version early next year. Alongside it, the company also plans to start beta testing an Android 11 update for the 2019 Fairphone 3 and 2020 Fairphone 3 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmzavO"&gt;Although getting an Android update two years after its original release wouldn’t normally be cause for celebration, it’s basically unheard of for an Android manufacturer to still be updating a handset six years after its original release. Only Apple comes close to these kinds of support periods and recently released its latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility"&gt;iOS 15 update for the 2015 iPhone 6S&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j3avgV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Beta testing of Android 10 for Fairphone 2 starts today, with the aim to be publicly available in early 2022. But the good news doesn’t end there – for Fairphone 3 and 3+ users, beta testing for Android 11 also starts this week.&lt;/p&gt;— Fairphone (@Fairphone) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fairphone/status/1463138305176973323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="98F8Or"&gt;Meanwhile, Samsung offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;three generational Android updates&lt;/a&gt; for its recent phones. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones%2Cpixel-pixel-pro-phones%2Cpixel-a-a-xl-xl-a-a-g-a-g"&gt;Google has promised&lt;/a&gt; to provide security updates for its latest Pixel 6 devices for five years and Android version updates for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaCOPo"&gt;Offering updates for this length of time isn’t easy, as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fen%2F2020%2F06%2F18%2Ffairphone-2-gets-android-9%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F23%2F22798512%2Ffairphone-2-android-10-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fairphone explained&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post when it released its public beta of Android 9 running on the Fairphone 2. One of the bigger challenges is that the chipset manufacturer Fairphone uses, Qualcomm, only offers support for its processors for a certain number of years. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/qualcomm-promises-three-years-of-android-updates-for-its-entire-soc-lineup/"&gt;As of last December&lt;/a&gt;, Qualcomm supports its chips for three major OS updates and four years of security updates. However, once this support ends, manufacturers like Fairphone are on their own if they want to continue keeping their phones updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNtusy"&gt;For the Fairphone 2’s Android 10 update, the company says it collaborated with its community to speed up the update process. Together with help from Indian software developer Bharath Ravi Prakash, Fairphone says the Fairphone 2’s Android 10 update took just 10 months to develop, compared to 18 months for Android 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQiaZt"&gt;Today’s news will be welcome for anyone still using a Fairphone 2 who wants to benefit from Android 10 features like gesture navigation and support for an OS-level dark mode. But it’s also reassuring for anyone thinking about picking up its latest phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716194/fairphone-4-review"&gt;Fairphone 4&lt;/a&gt;, which the company hopes to keep supported for six years until 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
