    <title>Honor announces its first post-Huawei phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNLv0oIpgCV-YYhA0_gtZBZP9uo=/0x0:1098x732/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68703668/hv40.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JMIZyw"&gt;Honor has announced the new V40 5G flagship phone, its first since Huawei sold the company off to a Shenzhen-based consortium of Chinese partners. The phone is exclusive to China for now, but Honor’s V-series usually makes its way to the rest of the world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21151055/honor-9x-pro-release-date-price-camera-google-apps-service-mwc"&gt;under “View” branding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qR5Qj"&gt;The V40 has a 6.72-inch OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 1000+ processor. The primary camera has a 1/1.56-inch 50-megapixel sensor. The 4,000mAh battery can be charged wirelessly at 50W or at 66W with a cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPGY4t"&gt;Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was selling off Honor in November due to “tremendous pressure” and a difficulty in securing an adequate supply chain. While Honor was operated independently from Huawei, it relied on the parent company for much of its technology, such as HiSense’s Kirin processors. That meant it was hit just as hard by US sanctions banning US companies from doing business with Huawei. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RVez89sFMcc4GyZJZiEFicb5yWg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251828/v40.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tejl7I"&gt;The V40 phones will of course have been in development since earlier than November, but now that Huawei has divested itself of Honor, the international “View 40” version of the V40 may be able to ship with Google services on board. That would allow Honor to sell phones in Western markets and beyond without the huge disadvantage of having to rely on Huawei’s AppGallery, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;still can’t compete with Google’s Play Store&lt;/a&gt; outside of China, where Google has no presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1aJcx"&gt;At the same time, Honor no longer has the advantage of relying on Huawei’s supply chain, so it’s going to have work to do in order to establish itself as a strong brand in its own right once the phones launch elsewhere. For now, it’s available in China with prices starting at 3,599 yuan (~$550) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. 3,999 yuan (~$620) doubles the storage to 256GB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grab an unlocked Google Pixel 3 XL for $300 at B&amp;H Photo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Z45hpI5e0M_Ov4XG_LnbFjt_BA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701428/jbareham_181011_2989_0486.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lhezox"&gt;If you are looking for a smartphone with a good camera but don’t want to spend a ton of money, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615542-REG%2Fgoogle_ga1296_us_pixel_3_xl_64gb.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is selling a 64GB unlocked Google Pixel 3 XL for $300&lt;/a&gt;. The phone was released in late 2018, but it is still a solid contender for people who prefer Google smartphones and want a camera that offers solid image quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIRiCl"&gt;The Google Pixel 3 XL includes a 6.3-inch QHD OLED screen display, a 12.2MP dual-pixel camera on the back, and two 8MP front-facing cameras. While this phone is almost three years old, it does come equipped with the latest Android 11 OS and will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;also receive Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, which will launch sometime this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4DpoXd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j9zaOm"&gt;The Google Pixel 3 XL was one of the tech giant’s two flagship smartphones released in October 2018, with both phones being praised at the time for their front and rear cameras, larger displays, and clean designs. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;discontinued both phones last March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aROE7p"&gt;For $300, the Pixel 3 XL seems like a great deal that delivers a ton of features and is ideal for people who are unconcerned about not having 5G support. If you’re looking for more information on the Pixel 3 XL, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Dieter Bohn gives an in-depth look &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 870 reheats the Snapdragon 865 for 2021 phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eX7yPnMfq5jFz2rX_XK0M0NPkjk=/149x0:1771x1081/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68688359/Snapdragon_870_5G_Mobile_Platform.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YZEDtY"&gt;Qualcomm has announced a new mobile phone processor: the Qualcomm Snapdragon 870, a successor to last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995562/qualcomm-snapdragon-865-5g-camera-gaming-artificial-intelligence-improvements"&gt;Snapdragon 865&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/8/21312035/qualcomm-new-snapdragon-865-plus-gaming-performance-faster-cpu-gpu-wifi"&gt;865 Plus&lt;/a&gt; models. To be clear, the 870 isn’t a new next-gen design — that title goes to the Snapdragon 888, which makes far more substantial improvements in performance and new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCoHLD"&gt;The 870, on the other hand, is virtually identical to the 865 and 865 Plus, with the same design right down to the Kryo 585 CPU and Adreno 650 GPU cores. The 870 is clocked at 3.2GHz, however, making it about 10 percent faster than the original 865’s 2.84GHz and about 3 percent faster than the 865 Plus (which offered 3.1GHz speeds). Think of it almost like a Snapdragon 865 Plus-plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wotbFe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Think of it almost like a Snapdragon 865 Plus-plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bmiTkY"&gt;Qualcomm says that the reason for the new chip is in response to manufacturer and market demands. The 870 is designed for companies that want to offer a top-tier processor but don’t need the absolute best features that the flagship Snapdragon 888 offers and the higher price tag that it demands. Instead, the company says that it expects that Snapdragon 870 phones should hit a sub-$800 price tag (although, confusingly, we’ve already seen Snapdragon 888 phones like the $799 Galaxy S21 start to bleed into that range).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Bk9nK"&gt;Presumably, there’s also a marketing aspect here: the Snapdragon 870’s new branding and modest (if still real) speed improvements over even the Snapdragon 865 Plus mean that companies using the chip in their phones get a “new” 2021 chip to boast about on spec sheets, without concerns of getting looked over by customers for having an “outdated” or “old” processor like the 865 or 865 Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r99Uf3"&gt;Qualcomm says that the first Snapdragon 870 phones should be available in Q1 of this year, with Motorola, OnePlus, Oppo, and Xiaomi among the list of manufacturers planning to use the new processor in their devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is reportedly prototyping foldable iPhone screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwkeUq48UTT1T633jq3bPiSLRco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68675881/vpavic_4243_20201018_0154.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4esEx0"&gt;Apple has started work on a foldable phone, and it’s begun prototyping foldable screens internally, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-considers-foldable-iphone-minor-changes-planned-for-2021-models"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A final device is likely still years away, the report says, and Apple is working on just the display for now — not the rest of the phone it would attach to&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrPm9a"&gt;The initial prototypes sound similar to the foldable screens we’ve seen used by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, and others. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says Apple is looking at making foldable screens with a “mostly invisible hinge” that could unfold to around the size of the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The report says that several screen sizes are being discussed, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9z7JXa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Under-display Touch ID is reportedly still in testing for 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HSC7fl"&gt;Apple hasn’t publicly indicated any interest in making a foldable phone, though the company rarely signals its interest before entering a new product category. Major competitors have a head start on foldable devices, with Samsung and Motorola already releasing multiple generations of folding phones. Samsung’s Galaxy Fold came out in April 2019 (albeit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;with some substantial issues&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q61LiJ"&gt;On a more immediate note, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;has some updates on Apple products coming in 2021. This year’s iPhone is expected to have “minor upgrades,” but one more substantial improvement is still a possibility: an in-screen fingerprint sensor. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;already said &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-05/apple-working-on-in-display-fingerprint-id-for-future-iphones"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that Apple was looking into the feature for as early as 2020, and it’d be an obvious addition in 2021 since the wide adoption of face masks has seriously hindered the ability to use Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvPtBM"&gt;It’s not clear how likely in-display Touch ID is to ship in 2021 (Apple tends to have iPhone features locked well in advance of production), but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;says Apple is “still testing” the tech for inclusion this year. On a worse note, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;also says that Apple has discussed removing the Lightning port in favor of wireless charging on “some” iPhone models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVN73K"&gt;Apple’s long-rumored Tile competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875341/apple-tags-location-rumor-roundup"&gt;AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, are finally planned to launch this year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports, and the iPad Pro could be refreshed with a Mini LED display. A thinner entry-level iPad is reportedly in the works as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp to delay new privacy policy amid mass confusion about Facebook data sharing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H4Ou6zEiXz4l_m0CuKUCG1iVlvg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674807/akrales_180215_2310_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ItYbS"&gt;WhatsApp on Friday announced a three-month delay of a new privacy policy originally slated to go into effect on February 8th following widespread confusion over whether the new policy would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;mandate data sharing with Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2zqvq"&gt;The update does not in fact affect data sharing with Facebook with regard to user chats or other profile information; WhatsApp has repeatedly clarified that its update addresses business chats in the event a user converses with a company’s customer service platform through WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nfZOsh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WhatsApp is trying to clear up confusion about its privacy practices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q26Fj9"&gt;“We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There’s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts,” the company wrote in a &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/giving-more-time-for-our-recent-update"&gt;new blog post published today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kxcse"&gt;Since 2016, WhatsApp has shared certain information with Facebook, including your phone number, unless you were one of the select few users who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/26/12655518/how-to-stop-whatsapp-sharing-phone-number-facebook"&gt;chose to opt out of data sharing while the option was still available that year&lt;/a&gt;. WhatsApp does not, however, look at people’s chat messages or listen to their phone calls, and WhatsApp conversations are end-to-end encrypted to protect against those abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb3iqi"&gt;Despite this, a pop-up informing users of the new change included mention of how WhatsApp partners with Facebook, and it also included an ultimatum instructing users to delete their account if they chose not to agree to the new terms. That gave people the idea they were being railroaded into new, more invasive terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9falaM"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;released a separate blog post this week&lt;/a&gt; trying to clear up the confusion, and it included a chart that specifies what information is protected and not shared when someone uses WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Gos4A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We want to address some rumors and be 100% clear we continue to protect your private messages with end-to-end encryption. &lt;a href="https://t.co/6qDnzQ98MP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6qDnzQ98MP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WhatsApp (@WhatsApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1348839600333049857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dQXH4t"&gt;But numerous media reports highlighting the addition of new, broad language in the privacy policy (language WhatsApp says has been misconstrued to imply mandated data sharing) and misinformation on social media have coalesced into a full-blown WhatsApp privacy backlash. The result has been a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;surge in sign-ups for messaging competitors&lt;/a&gt; like Signal and Telegram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWvOnh"&gt;Facebook executives, including Instagram chief Adam Mosseri and WhatsApp head Will Cathcart, used Twitter to try to clear up the confusion, it seems with little success. Facebook’s poor privacy track record, and the fact that WhatsApp has over time turned its sights on monetizing the platform for its large international user base, has eroded trust in the chat app, which, in turn, has had the effect of turning a relatively mundane update into a worldwide controversy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1ezUd"&gt;WhatsApp says it’s now going to use this three-month delay to better communicate both the changes in its new policy and its long-standing privacy practices around personal chats, location sharing, and other sensitive data. “We’re now moving back the date on which people will be asked to review and accept the terms,” the blog post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="RfvTGW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jbl556"&gt;WhatsApp says no one will be losing access to the app if they didn’t agree to the new terms of service agreement that communicated the changes earlier this month. “We’re also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp. We’ll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbF9Ht"&gt;WhatsApp tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the policy won’t be changing when it does come out. The intent of the update is communicating to users that messages with businesses on WhatsApp may be stored on Facebook servers, which necessitates data sharing between the two companies (that data, WhatsApp says, can be used for businesses for the purpose of advertising, but Facebook does not share it across its apps automatically). WhatsApp still intends to release the update on May 15th to coincide with new business chat features it &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;began previewing back in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjSmTD"&gt;But the company hopes the extra time will help it get a handle on the controversy and better improve its messaging around what’s actually changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Zz9V6"&gt;“The update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. While not everyone shops with a business on WhatsApp today, we think that more people will choose to do so in the future and it’s important people are aware of these services,” the blog post reads. “This update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzodJm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 3:26PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified how WhatsApp’s new privacy policy will treat data collected during chats with businesses as part of the upcoming privacy policy change, now going into effect on May 15th. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="IOacv4"&gt;Samsung’s future phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225930/samsung-galaxy-s21-no-charger-brick-headphones-price"&gt;will also&lt;/a&gt; not come with charging bricks, the company &lt;a href="http://www.samsungmobilepress.com/featurestories/answers-to-your-questions-about-the-galaxy-s21-series-from-samsung-mobile-executives"&gt;has revealed&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s leaving itself some wiggle room. In a Q&amp;amp;A about why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/14/22231102/samsung-apple-kill-charging-brick-obituary-eulogy"&gt;it’s no longer including headphones and a charging brick in the box&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung says it believes &lt;em&gt;gradually&lt;/em&gt; removing the accessories from its phones could help make them more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvvecV"&gt;This answer implies that, while the next generations of its phones may not come with the included accessories, some may. Samsung has other lines that it brands as Galaxy, from its folding phones to its more budget options, and it’s left itself room to keep including a charger in some of them for a little while longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxANF4"&gt;Maybe Samsung wants to keep the charger around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220858/samsung-a02s-us-unlocked-verizon-att"&gt;in cheaper phones&lt;/a&gt; so people who aren’t tech enthusiasts will have a higher likelihood of buying them, or maybe it doesn’t want to upset the people who buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21407750/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-2-price-release-date-hinge-screen-durability"&gt;its $2,000 phones&lt;/a&gt;. It could do both, either, or neither, and it would still count as “gradually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbGsMY"&gt;The company doesn’t appear, however, to be following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple’s route of pulling the plugs from its lineup of existing phones&lt;/a&gt;. The listings for the Note 20 Ultra and Note 10 still show a charger coming in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A “what’s in the box” image of the Note 20 Ultra, including a charging brick." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tC2N5qlU-eL6ocGQJh-WYOFKv9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236779/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_4.24.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Note 20 Ultra looks to still include a charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8adKhW"&gt;While a company shipping older products with something that’s no longer included in its latest and greatest might seem odd, it means Samsung doesn’t have to re-make all the boxes for its old products, and that consumers won’t end up in the awkward situation where they watch an unboxing from a phone’s launch on YouTube and then have a decidedly different experience. Which approach is correct really depends what you’re optimizing for, but this seems to be the one Samsung has chosen: slow and steady wins the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5lUFA"&gt;You can read the full answer down below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gWPCmn"&gt;We discovered that more and more Galaxy users are reusing accessories they already have and making sustainable choices in their daily lives to promote better recycling habits. To support our Galaxy community in this journey, we are transitioning to removal of the charger plug and earphones in our latest line of Galaxy smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mllep"&gt;We believe that the gradual removal of charger plugs and earphones from our in-box device packaging can help address sustainable consumption issues and remove any pressure that consumers may feel towards continually receiving unnecessary charger accessories with new phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1V567T"&gt;We’ve also been implementing standardized USB-C type charging ports since 2017, so older chargers can still be compatible with our newest Galaxy models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Samsung says S Pen support is coming to ‘additional device categories’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dC2DzBJIDf-ClQQwc6RWGK8-DCE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68670390/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fyaa1y"&gt;Samsung just revealed the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; would be its first Galaxy S phone to support the S Pen stylus, but the company is already saying that S Pen support will come to other devices in the future, according to a statement first given &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-confirmed-s-pen-more-galaxy-smartphones/"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkUdII"&gt;“We are committed to innovating new mobile experiences that flow seamlessly and continuously to make our consumers’ lives easier and better,” Samsung president of mobile TM Roh says in the statement, which the company shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’ve made the bold decision to expand the S Pen experience to Galaxy S21 Ultra, and plan to expand the S Pen experience across additional device categories in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DlTXe"&gt;“Additional device categories” is vague on its own. But given that S Pen is already compatible with some of Samsung’s smartphones and its Tab tablets, the next logical device category that could use the S Pen, to me, would be Samsung’s foldables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZGaw8F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t Samsung’s first suggestion that S Pen support will come to other devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V8jik2"&gt;This isn’t Samsung’s first suggestion that S Pen support will come to other devices. Back in December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;Roh said that the company&lt;/a&gt; has been “paying attention to people’s favorite aspects of the Galaxy Note experience and are excited to add some of its most well-loved features to other devices in our lineup,” though didn’t specify further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCsDOp"&gt;And Roh has even hinted toward the S Pen coming to foldables. In a Q&amp;amp;A during Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Z Fold 2 presentation from August, Roh left the door wide open to the idea that the S Pen would make its way to foldables in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECXOIM"&gt;“The S Pen has always been a well-loved feature of the Galaxy Note. And we are happy to hear that people want it so much, they even want it on the Fold,” Roh said. (You can hear his statement in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/CmS5rlX9cDA?t=5079"&gt;context here&lt;/a&gt;.) Later, after reiterating the features of the Galaxy Z Fold 2, he added, “and we will certainly to continue to listen to our customers’ feedback. So please stay tuned for what the future will hold.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy S21 doesn’t support Samsung Pay’s most convenient feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8fInbBkh7rTQvF1eJKfLxl7v_zE=/0x45:1067x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68669092/SamsungPayMST.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hW6Fdv"&gt;Samsung has confirmed that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; no longer support the convenient Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) feature of Samsung Pay. And based on &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/14/samsung-pay-is-losing-its-one-remaining-good-feature-on-the-galaxy-s21/"&gt;what the company told &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the same will be true for all phones that Samsung releases from here on out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sa4LC1"&gt;If you’re not familiar, &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/what-is/mst/#:~:text=Magnetic%20Secure%20Transmission%2C%20or%20MST,that%20helps%20power%20Samsung%20Pay.&amp;amp;text=Accepted%20at%20nearly%20all%20payment,Pay%20also%20supports%20NFC%20payments." rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MST is a very cool trick&lt;/a&gt; that allows Samsung phones to send out a magnetic pulse that made payment terminals think that you’d swiped a regular credit card. The most beneficial thing about it is that MST can work in scenarios where NFC payments aren’t available. It can send that magnetic signal to pretty much any payment terminal with a traditional card swiper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YI6mpl"&gt;MST is by no means perfect: getting a payment to go through on the first try can sometimes be a challenge, and it’s worthless in situations where you have to stick your card all the way into a slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTAnqH"&gt;But now it’s a goner, with Samsung believing that NFC adoption has reached a point where it can phase out the MST aspect of Samsung Pay. “Due to the rapid adoption of near field communication (NFC) technology by consumers and businesses, beginning with devices launched in 2021, Samsung Pay will focus its support on NFC transactions, across the Galaxy portfolio,” Samsung said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Android Police.&lt;/em&gt; “While future devices will no longer include magnetic stripe technology (MST), customers with previous, compatible Galaxy devices will be able to continue using Samsung Pay, including MST.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jR2kM"&gt;Samsung phones as recent as the Galaxy S20 FE still had MST capabilities built in, so you don’t have to go far back to find a compatible device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l67Tqb"&gt;This means with the Galaxy S21 family, Samsung has now gotten rid of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="W98UH5"&gt;The charging brick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jfuZL1"&gt;microSD storage expansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vZrE0Z"&gt;MST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3u7I9D"&gt;I get the sense that a lot of people won’t mind losing some (or all) of those things — especially with the lower starting prices on the S21 and S21 Plus — but there’s no denying that Samsung Pay just lost what was maybe its best standout trick. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S21 event: the biggest announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YV0RSC-rkbPJkorp0vY61wKO5E4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667564/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8rmWgJ"&gt;Samsung just finished its first Unpacked event of 2021. The headline announcements were the three new phones in its S21 lineup, but the company also announced new true wireless headphones, an item tracker, and a few other things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnCzZS"&gt;We’ve rounded up all of the biggest announcements from the event right here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nW1DZw2s8CszwwLruPWVY8PPGyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232924/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T6OKVx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21991813"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus will launch on January 29th&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Caz0kP"&gt;Samsung announced the $799 Galaxy S21 and $999 S21 Plus, which are available for preorder today ahead of availability on January 29th. They’re largely the same phones (except for their physical size), and their camera module takes up an entire corner of the phones, giving them a whole new look. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x1fJYPTkfuKz2n_hkJlD-KKe9uo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233315/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0005.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6QfS1q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21991813"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra is compatible with the S Pen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6iI9Bu"&gt;Samsung announced the $1,199 Galaxy S21 Ultra, its newest top-of-the-line flagship smartphone. It has a bigger screen and more cameras than the S21 and S21 Plus, and, in a first for Samsung’s S-line of smartphones, it has support for the S Pen stylus. It’s also available for preorder today and will launch on January 29th. Samsung is working on an S Pen Pro with Bluetooth, which is coming later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfeF9PeMncaIVpZwABYhZsorqEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235236/galaxy_s21_5g_highlights_box.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Plus box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IulYwV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21989971"&gt;Samsung’s S21 lineup won’t include a charger in the box&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4LZXZ"&gt;Samsung is following Apple in not including a charging brick in the box with its newest phones. The phones will come with a USB-C to USB-C cable, but you’ll need to own a compatible charging brick or buy a new one if you want to plug your brand-new phone into a wall. The S21 lineup also won’t include headphones in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n3CyMPp3keMhYFgIcFHra0jV7fU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233200/BudsPro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F1Gy1N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21992988"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro are Samsung’s most premium wireless earbuds yet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uBSCN7"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds Pro true wireless earbuds have improved active noise cancellation, a refined ambient sound mode, an IPX7 rating for water resistance, and more. They cost $199, are available for preorder today, and you’ll be able to buy them in stores on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gKwRvaFw-fWFLQvkCbcQcv5SigE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232918/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0003.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qKuu8e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21991662"&gt;Samsung announced the SmartTag and SmartTag Plus Tile-like item trackers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4Xqze9"&gt;Samsung announced a Tile tracker competitor called the SmartTag. It’s a small Bluetooth Low Energy dongle that you can attach to things, and you can pair it with Samsung’s SmartThings app. The SmartTag only works with Galaxy devices, though. The SmartTag will be available on January 29th and it will cost $29.99. Samsung also announced the Galaxy SmartTag Plus, which uses ultra-wideband for more precise tracking. The SmartTag Plus is launching later this year, and you’ll be able to buy one for $39.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how Samsung’s S Pen works with the new Galaxy S21 Ultra</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0TPXpD8cjqgxASTxtfF6epuoFmo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667023/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jkJS2j"&gt;Samsung’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21991813"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; supports the company’s S Pen stylus. Support for the accessory has been a staple of Samsung’s Galaxy Note smartphones for years, but this is the first time it’s been supported in the company’s Galaxy S-series. The new S Pen will be available as an optional $39.99 accessory, and Samsung says the S21 Ultra will also work with S Pens from other Galaxy Note or Galaxy Tab devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afNUJ4"&gt;As for what you can use the stylus to do on the S21 Ultra, Samsung has outlined a range of familiar use cases. These include drawing, note-taking, photo editing, and signing documents. Physically, the new S Pen stylus is a little bigger than previous Galaxy Note S Pens, but it retains the side button. Samsung is also releasing a bigger S Pen Pro later this year, which comes equipped with Bluetooth and support for air gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HYOCCVWTy8lcO03r4hsUFCm19mQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233313/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0004.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra with its stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RdEXJg"&gt;Unlike Galaxy Note phones, the Galaxy S21 Ultra doesn’t have a built-in slot for storing the stylus. Instead, Samsung is selling cases with S Pen carrying slots, which cost $69.99 when bundled with the stylus. Having to use a case to carry the accessory doesn’t sound as convenient as being able to slot it in the phone directly, but it’s a compromise given there’ll be plenty of Galaxy S21 Ultra owners who won’t bother with the optional accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDp54E"&gt;In the new lineup, stylus support is exclusive to the Galaxy S21 Ultra. You won’t be able to use an S Pen with either the Galaxy S21 or S21 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEPyMe"&gt;Rumors of the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s stylus support have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;around since last year&lt;/a&gt;, and the feature was essentially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;confirmed in an FCC filing&lt;/a&gt; at the end of December. Now that the Galaxy S series is inheriting one of the Note series’s biggest features, there are rumors that the latter could be discontinued. However, this has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22177972/galaxy-note-21-still-happening-yonhap"&gt;reportedly been disputed&lt;/a&gt; by one Samsung official.&lt;/p&gt;
