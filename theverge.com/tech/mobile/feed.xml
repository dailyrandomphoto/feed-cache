    <title>Trade-in site Gazelle is ending trade-ins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bnf7zuGsmcDZfvpAoMyJvczOgGU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68599613/akrales_190914_3628_0060.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ayb8pY"&gt;Gazelle, one of the longest-running used smartphone buyers in the US, has announced the end of its core trade-in program, which let phone owners mail in phones and other electronics devices in exchange for cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iw3O0x"&gt;The news, revealed in an email Gazelle sent to some customers on Wednesday and shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, means any prospective Gazelle customers will have to receive a quote and initiate the trade-in process by January 31st, 2021 (allowing 30 days to mail in the phone) if they want to take advantage of the program. The service will shut down officially on February 1st, while any active trade-ins will be honored, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Ugn2S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gazelle will still accept used smartphones through its ecoATM kiosks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nHFO9c"&gt;This isn’t the end of Gazelle’s business. Gazelle’s parent company ecoATM, which has been around since 2006, &lt;a href="https://www.ecoatm.com/a/devices"&gt;operates kiosks&lt;/a&gt; that let you get instant cash for a used device, and the Gazelle website is now used as a retailer for selling those devices at reduced prices after they’re then refurbished. (The catch is that ecoATMs may not pay out as much as the traditional Gazelle mail-in program, which typically has offered more than $300 or so for a prior year’s flagship like the iPhone 11 Pro.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTva5M"&gt;Gazelle doesn’t give a reason for the decision, but there are a few major trends in the US mobile business that point toward a general decline in the benefits of cash trade-in services. For one, many more people now than in years past lease their smartphones instead of buying them outright, a broad shift from the days when US carriers offered reduced price phones in exchange for firm two-year contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbPuot"&gt;Now, it’s quite easy to pay a modest monthly fee for a phone through a program like AT&amp;amp;T Next Up or Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program, with the option to trade that device in for a new one after a designated amount of time. Unless you decide to pay off your leased phone early, you can’t turn around and sell it to Gazelle — and you wouldn’t necessarily want to do that as it doesn’t make much financial sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7WgfZ"&gt;Additionally, Gazelle’s early business boomed on iPhone trade-ins back when selling your phone to get the latest Apple product was a popular strategy for early adopters. Now, Apple has a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in%3Fafid%3Dp238%257Cs4wibFo6O-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_427418702567_pgrid_80259604234_%26cid%3Daos-us-kwgo-brand--slid---product-&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F30%2F22206779%2Fgazelle-smartphone-used-trade-in-program-shut-down#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;robust trade-in program of its own&lt;/a&gt; (in addition to the leasing program) that pretty much gets you the same result. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s One UI 3.0 update starts rolling out to Galaxy Note 10 devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMIsb63bJ0PYoJlxpceku4NkzQ8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68597426/akrales_190827_3620_0175.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GwUp9e"&gt;Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437681/samsung-android-11-one-ui-3-0-update-first-look-screenshots-improvements"&gt;One UI 3.0 update&lt;/a&gt; has started hitting older Samsung devices, starting with the Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy Note 10 Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-note-10-one-ui-3-0-stable-update-released/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The update, which brings Android 11-specific feature changes and some small visual and interface tweaks to Samsung smartphones, is only arriving on last year’s Note 10 devices in Germany, Spain, and Switzerland for now, but a wider release is expected at some point early next year if not in just a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvdHNg"&gt;Samsung first began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505517/samsung-one-ui-3-0-s20-plus-ultra-android-11-update-t-mobile"&gt;beta testing One UI 3.0 this past fall&lt;/a&gt; following the release of Android 11, and it’s been at various stages of availability for different smartphones depending on your region. The Note 10 and Note 10 Plus versions have been available in beta since October, and in early December Samsung began its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150143/samsung-android-11-one-ui-3-update-rollout-announced"&gt;official rollout of the update&lt;/a&gt; to phones in its Galaxy S20 line, with plans to bring the update to its foldables and Samsung’s 2019 devices in the “coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDfxfq"&gt;That would imply we’ll see a One UI 3.0 release for the Z Fold, Z Fold 2, and Z Flip shortly, as well as wider availability of the update on the Note 10 line beyond Europe. We’ve reached out to Samsung to ask whether the company has a concrete timetable for this broader release outside the initial three markets. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google inexplicably takes away wide-angle astrophotography from Pixel phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The regular and ultrawide cameras" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJxqta9Egd54-qSYt-TzfF1WArQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68591078/akrales_201013_4137_0225.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ILFVCu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;4a 5G&lt;/a&gt; users can no longer use their ultrawide cameras to take pictures of the stars: Google apparently removed the lens’s astrophotography capabilities with the Google Camera 8.1 update. The feature was a selling point of the Pixel 4, and was available on the regular and telephoto cameras. When the 4a 5G and 5 were announced with new wide-angle lenses, the feature was added to those as well. Now it’s been taken away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAOoxZ"&gt;The astrophotography feature lets users capture the night sky by pointing their phone up and keeping it still, either by balancing it on a nearby object or putting it on a tripod. The feature is still available on the phones’ other cameras, but if you go to Night Sight mode and switch to the ultrawide camera, you’ll now get a warning saying “Zoom to 1x for astrophotography.” Before the update it would say “Astrophotography on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQhXLN"&gt;Google didn’t respond to our request for comment asking why it had made the change, but it did update its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlecamera/answer/9708795"&gt;low-light photography support document&lt;/a&gt; to add the following caveat: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="iUEaWQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;: On Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5, astrophotography only works on zoom settings equal to or greater than 1x.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FuOwKU"&gt;Taking a look &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://support.google.com/googlecamera/answer/9708795?hl=en"&gt;at the Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;, we can see that this change occurred some time between November 1st and November 7th. It’s slightly odd timing given that the update wasn’t released until &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/12/google-camera-8-1-redesign-older-pixel/"&gt;a couple of days later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a forum post comparing the two cameras’ results in astrophotography mode." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wfb47QYI6FZzfUdkNLdLBexrYEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22201553/Screen_Shot_2020_12_28_at_5.18.58_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Google Pixel Phone forum user’s posted comparisons of the ultrawide (top) and standard angle lenses shooting in astrophotography mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GkZWAI"&gt;For an explanation as to why the feature may have been cut, you can check out &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/83061074?hl=en"&gt;this thread on Google’s Pixel Phone Help forum&lt;/a&gt;. It has examples from two users, showing the results astrophotography mode produced on the Pixel 5’s regular camera, compared to what the ultrawide lens put out. I’ll let you judge the pictures for yourself. The forum post, however, is another bit of timing weirdness — it was made days after the update removing the feature had already started rolling out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HT4rtz"&gt;Given that the update was out for a month and a half before most people really started noticing that the feature had been removed, it may be obvious why Google thought it could get away without mentioning it in the changelog. Even if it’s a feature that won’t be missed by many, it still stands as a reminder that the software features you get used to on your phone may be subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSCFUc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 29th, 12:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article compared the feature being taken away to Google discontinuing the Pixel’s unlimited original quality storage in Google Photos. That change only applies to new Pixel phones, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6220791?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;amp;oco=1#storage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;as existing ones are keeping the level of Google Photos storage that was originally advertised&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, so it wasn’t a great analogy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can get a OnePlus 7T for $300 at B&amp;H</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBH7mo"&gt;The T-Mobile variant of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1600544-REG%2Foneplus_610214661821_7t_t_mobile_smartphone_frosted.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2020%2F12%2F28%2F22203289%2Foneplus-7t-sale-deal-b-and-h-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 7T is on sale at B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; for $300, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-7t-tmo%3Ffrom%3D7t&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2020%2F12%2F28%2F22203289%2Foneplus-7t-sale-deal-b-and-h-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;undercutting OnePlus’s own sale&lt;/a&gt; at $350. This matches the lowest price the phone has ever been, so if you’ve been looking for a flagship-specced phone at a budget price, this deal may be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnqpQD"&gt;This being the T-Mobile variant, there are some caveats that B&amp;amp;H lists on its site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WStSqS"&gt;The OnePlus 7T is an unlocked T-Mobile variant. It may be used in other parts of the world; however, LTE access may be limited or unsupported, depending on the network. Please choose your country/carrier above to confirm the network compatibility of this phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGLcV6"&gt;This phone may also be T-Mobile branded and come pre-loaded with T-Mobile firmware and applications. The phone was originally manufactured and locked for T-Mobile, but T-Mobile has since unlocked it for resale. The phone is new and not pre-owned, though the box has been opened in order to unlock the phone. The phone may be used on any compatible carrier; however, certain features like Wi-Fi tethering may not work on other carriers. The phone is also dependent on T-Mobile for software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Vqxk6w"&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540535/amazon-motorola-razr-fingerprint-folding-phones-screen-protection"&gt;don’t like the idea of the phone having previously been opened&lt;/a&gt;, you can also get a fully unlocked version for $350 from B&amp;amp;H, or the T-Mobile locked variant for $350 from OnePlus themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUJkAP"&gt;The 7T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20881638/oneplus-7t-review-specs-features-price-availability"&gt;was a good deal when it launched&lt;/a&gt; at $599, and has &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-7t-long-term-review-1164176/"&gt;only improved after a year of updates&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s worth remembering that you’ll be reliant on T-Mobile for those with this version). When compared to the market now, it does lack some features: it doesn’t have 5G, and its screen is slower at 90Hz &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"&gt;than its successor’s&lt;/a&gt;, which runs at 120Hz. But if you value savings more than those features, you may want to hop on the deal — it expires this Wednesday, December 31st, at 11:59PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s Mi 11 announced with Snapdragon 888 and 120Hz OLED display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAEq6xpraw7ojkKZx2URtoWIbOI=/0x0:678x452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68589222/Xaomi_Mi11_series.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7tA1G3"&gt;Xiaomi has announced their new flagship for 2021: the Mi 11. The Chinese variant of the phone sports a modified design and upgraded specs that give a good look at the kind of high-end features top Android phones will ship with in the coming year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16339/xiaomi-announces-mi11-first-snapdragon-888-device"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There’s bound to be some changes to the European and global versions of the Mi 11, but for now this is an early peek into what’s likely to be 2021’s first major Android flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaGmfR"&gt;The changes to the design of the Mi 11 in comparison to the Mi 10 appear minor. From the front, the display is slightly larger at 6.81 inches in comparison to the Mi 10’s 6.67-inch screen. That extra space seems to have come from shrinking the bezels of the device (always welcome), while increasing the height and maintaining the curved sides and hole-punch camera on the front. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3M3vWuAnyO7kt4x45XeYG4-LjsU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22200423/Xaomi_Mi11_frontback.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xiaomi Mi 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KpmSyt"&gt;What’s more exciting is the 3200 x 1440 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate on the new OLED display, two features that have fast become must-haves on modern flagships, though of course they’re sorely missed on the latest iPhones. In another notable difference, the Mi 11 will also feature an under-display fingerprint sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9GMNo"&gt;The back of the Mi 11 holds the more visible changes. The iPhone X-esque vertical camera “pill” of the Mi 10 is gone, and in its place is a thin glass “layer cake.” The Mi 11 features three rear cameras: a 108-megapixel main sensor, a 5-megapixel telephoto, and a 13-megapixel ultrawide. The Mi 11 also has faster 50W wireless charging (previously on the Mi 10 Pro) to pair with its 4,600 mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzbC8h"&gt;Moving from the battery to the rest of the internals, the Mi 11 is powered by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;the Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; and offers either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. Storage starts at 128GB or 256GB, which is unfortunately still generous in the smartphone world. Like most new smartphones, the Mi 11 also has Wi-Fi 6 and support for 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIZ8Om"&gt;Notably missing from the Mi 11 is a charging brick. The CEO of Xiaomi, Lei Jun, confirmed the Mi 11 will follow in Apple and (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197394/samsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt;) Samsung’s footsteps in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/26/22200610/xiaomi-ceo-phone-no-charger-mocking-apple-iphone"&gt;removing the charging brick from the box&lt;/a&gt; for environmental and cost-saving reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajmHSG"&gt;The Chinese version of the Xiaomi Mi 11 is available for preorder today, and will start shipping January 1st. The price for the entry level 8GB RAM/128GB of storage model is listed at ¥3,999 (around $611 USD). Details on the pricing and features of the other versions of the Mi 11 will come at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQTnro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T recovers from multi-state outage after Nashville bombing</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X9ClSY"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says its services &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/pages/disaster_relief/nashville.html"&gt;have mostly recovered&lt;/a&gt; from a bombing that caused multi-state internet outages on Christmas. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/26/us/nashville-bomb-explosion.html"&gt;The explosion of an RV in Nashville&lt;/a&gt; injured three people and destroyed a section of the city’s downtown, including “significant damage” to a key AT&amp;amp;T transmission facility. This brought down wireless and wired networks across parts of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama — disrupting cell service, some 911 networks, and communications at the Nashville International Airport, which briefly grounded flights as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATeyZA"&gt;The AT&amp;amp;T building, located blocks away from the company’s better-known office tower, provides a regional network connection point in addition to local service. The blast reportedly damaged the building’s structure and facade. Combined with water and fire damage, it disabled backup generators that were supposed to keep AT&amp;amp;T’s network functioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXDvFC"&gt;The result was days of partial service outages, mitigated partly by emergency cell sites. AT&amp;amp;T is also suspending data overage charges across parts of Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, and Missouri over the final five days of December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ycvaqx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T deployed portable cell sites around Nashville while rerouting regional network traffic and attempting to restore the building’s power. It reported on Sunday that it had restored 96 percent of its wireless network, 60 percent of business services, and 86 percent of consumer broadband and entertainment. As of today, “nearly all” consumer service had been restored. However, AT&amp;amp;T is maintaining 11 portable cell sites, and according to the company, it is still limiting power consumption in the building to avoid overloading its generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuhkYP"&gt;“We have begun to turn down portable sites that are no longer needed given the recovery of service,” said CEO Jeff McElfresh &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/pages/disaster_relief/nashville.html"&gt;in a statement on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, “but we will have resources standing by in the region as needed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYjc2k"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/27/us/anthony-quinn-warner-dead.html"&gt;Federal law enforcement named&lt;/a&gt; 63-year-old Anthony Quinn Warner as the bomber, and they’ve reported that Warner died in the explosion. Although Warner parked his RV close to the AT&amp;amp;T transmission building, investigators haven’t concluded whether he intentionally targeted it, nor have they declared a motive for the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVQIKs"&gt;Local news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.wsmv.com/news/fbi-agents-investigating-if-5g-paranoia-was-behind-nashville-bombing/article_952f937e-47f9-11eb-b1c3-bfda1689fb18.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSMV&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that law enforcement agents had asked an FBI tipster whether Warner might be motivated by 5G network paranoia — an unfounded conspiracy theory that has led people to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21276912/5g-conspiracy-theories-coronavirus-uk-telecoms-engineers-attacks-abuse"&gt;harass network engineers&lt;/a&gt; working on the tech. But the tipster, a real estate agent who had worked with a “Tony Warner,” said the man had not discussed 5G with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSGiPU"&gt;The FBI &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2020/12/27/downtown-nashville-explosion-terrorism-anthony-warner-motive/4055803001/"&gt;said on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that it was “still early in the investigation.” Whatever the motive, the bombing shook a significant section of American internet infrastructure for days — even if it’s now largely recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE Axon 20 5G teardown shows how the world’s first under-display selfie camera works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2SE8iGUcYuaSqb3Dwmvdau7kkTo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68587923/DSCF7470.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A2L0tq"&gt;The quest to banish the notch from modern smartphone design has resulted in some pretty clever innovations, the latest of which happens to be the under-display selfie cam on the ZTE Axon 20 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgczhJ"&gt;The 32-megapixel camera hiding underneath the screen didn’t quite impress us in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;our review of the device earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a worthy sidestep to the hole punch or the pop-up selfie cam we’ve seen in past devices. Now, a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2J_5JnqQ8Y"&gt;new teardown video from YouTuber JerryRigEverything&lt;/a&gt; gives us a closer look at how exactly the Axon 20’s under-display camera works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8OXmQ"&gt;Beyond being just a generally insightful breakdown of the various components of a modern smartphone, the Axon 20 teardown shows us how ZTE is actually using two screens stacked on top of one another (a small, square, and low-resolution one on top of the selfie cam and the OLED top panel) to let the under-display camera peer out toward the user from beneath the top layer display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yW1AU"&gt;It’s a first-gen device, but it’s undoubtedly a signal of where phone design will go in the future, as companies aim to preserve the edge-to-edge display without compromising on notches and cutouts for things like selfie cams and fingerprint scanners. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now reserve a preorder for Samsung’s Galaxy S21</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVNpLnt6J04v6TrOVg7IxmoO4A4=/52x0:616x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68587701/samsung_galaxy_s21_668_leak.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UTr0uz"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 lineup of phones will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;reportedly debut on January 14th&lt;/a&gt;. If there’s even a slight chance you might pick one up, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can now place a reservation&lt;/a&gt; to guarantee a preorder slot when those become available, which they usually do right after an Unpacked event ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MauAqD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s page&lt;/a&gt; will take down some basic information like your name, email address, and zip code in exchange for dibs on buying one of these new phones. You won’t pay anything to reserve your preorder — Samsung will collect that once you actually order the phone yourself. But what you can also do now is get a quote for a phone you might like to trade in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VzbT3"&gt;You can get up to $700 of instant trade-in credit toward the purchase of a Galaxy S21 if you trade an iPhone 12 series phone, or one of Samsung’s own Note 20 and S20 phones. It’s even offering up to $550 of trade-in credit for certain phones with cracked screens. Samsung just &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wants you to preorder one of these new phones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung reservation page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uU72Ifc_EzhWQygEdN3FUOzIXqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22200108/galaxys21reservation.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung isn’t showing off the Galaxy S21 yet, but it will soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CWqc09"&gt;Reserving one of Samsung’s upcoming phones before the preorders begin will net you $50 to use on accessories like smartwatches and earbuds, and by using the Shop Samsung app for Android, you’ll get an extra $10 on top of that. There’s usually another nice preorder perk announced when the phones launch. For previous launches, Samsung has offered at least $100 in gift cards in addition to other goodies, so it should be a great value if you’re in the market for a new device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeAHy2"&gt;You’ll likely want to catch up on the rumors and leaks if you haven’t already, as there are plenty of them. For starters, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;Samsung itself confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the Galaxy S21 will support the S Pen stylus. We’ve also seen what appears to be a leak of the official teasers for the S21 series, showing off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;some phone colors and the revamped rear camera array&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>So you got a 5G phone, but is your plan ready? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w_lwL3NUDvxHGb7l3SNRe6r20AM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68580559/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;5G in the US isn’t mind-bogglingly fast, but it is going to get better | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Your guide to the current state of 5G carrier plans in the US, what they cost, and whether it’s worth upgrading your plan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0STAxL"&gt;You’re the proud owner of a new 5G phone — congratulations! We’ve got some bad news, though: if you live in the US, 5G &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/study-finds-that-us-5g-speeds-are-slower-than-14-other-countries"&gt;probably isn’t going to be the mind-bogglingly fast experience&lt;/a&gt; that you’ve been promised. For most regions, it’s just a little faster than the 4G speeds we’re used to using. But here’s the good news: 5G is going to get better, so if you have a 5G phone you may want to make sure your plan delivers it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUbp57"&gt;If you got a phone recently, there’s a good chance it supports 5G. Pretty much every new phone in 2021 — with the exception of some budget models — will offer some form of 5G support. Whatever your preferred brand or operating system, 5G is coming your way soon if you don’t have it already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1ylmN"&gt;Your phone is ready for the next big thing, but what about your data plan? Across the board, the major US carriers’ unlimited plans already include access to 5G. However, carriers offer a mix of 5G bands that vary in speed and coverage. It’s complicated, as all things 5G have been since it first appeared in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ov9vPM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s complicated, as all things 5G have been since it first appeared in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AeQgSC"&gt;Consider this your guide to the current state of 5G and data plans in the US — which ones include 5G, which don’t, what variety of 5G they include, and whether you should consider upgrading depending on your carrier’s implementation of 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7M860"&gt;One important note for those with a 5G phone: even if you discover that your current plan does include 5G and it’s available in your area, you may still need to upgrade to a new SIM card if you moved it over from an older device. A SIM card that was activated in a 4G device will still work with a 5G device, but you may have trouble connecting to the 5G network. Check with your carrier if you’re not seeing the little 5G logo pop up on your screen and you think you should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6877V"&gt;For comparison purposes, the prices listed in this article are for one line of service per month before taxes and fees. Additional lines bring down the monthly cost per line, but your total bill increases, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5eQLb4"&gt;Verizon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E2ySFp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Unless you live in one of the few areas with Verizon’s truly fast UW 5G, we don’t think there’s a reason to change your plan just yet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yeRjtT"&gt;Verizon offers two varieties of 5G, the faster of which it calls “Ultra Wideband” (also referred to as millimeter wave or mmWave) and is available only in certain parts of certain cities. It’s scarce, but it is mind-bogglingly fast, and you’ll see a 5G UW logo on your phone screen if your phone is using that network. Oh, and 5G UW signals don’t reach indoors for the most part, so if you’re spending most of your time inside your house or apartment right now, you probably wouldn’t pick it up even if you live in a place where it’s available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="vsmFJ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ultra Wideband is scarce but mind-bogglingly fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="AxSy3H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wnDLVU"&gt;“Nationwide” is the company’s other 5G, a low-band variety that’s slower than mmWave but offers much broader coverage. In fact, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/heres-why-verizon-iphone-users-must-turn-off-5g-right-now"&gt;sometimes a bit slower than 4G&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re not happy with the 5G speeds you’re getting, you may want to try limiting your phone to LTE and see if things improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wc9Ye8"&gt;Check &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fcoverage-map%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s coverage map&lt;/a&gt; to see what’s available in your area. If you do live in a city with UW 5G, be sure to zoom &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way in to see the exact areas and streets with coverage — they’re marked in a darker shade of red that will appear once you zoom in close enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt3rAT"&gt;Verizon’s Shared Data (data capped) plans and its $80-per-month basic unlimited plan include the lower-tier Nationwide 5G only. For access to UW in addition to Nationwide 5G, you’ll need at least the $90 “Play More” unlimited plan. Verizon offers $10 off those monthly prices if you enroll in auto pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkrFa3"&gt;Verizon also includes 5G on its prepaid data plans, which start at $65 per month for unlimited data or $40 per month for a 5GB data-capped plan. There’s a $5 monthly discount for auto pay as well. For now, UW 5G isn’t available for prepaid customers, but Verizon says that’s changing in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H6XaJU"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dGY28e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Don’t worry about switching up your AT&amp;amp;T plan for 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Rje9sa"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s history with 5G is… fraught. Early on, the company marketed what was essentially LTE technology as “5G E” and (rightfully) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;caught a lot of flak for it&lt;/a&gt;. You won’t see that term in any of the company’s marketing these days, but AT&amp;amp;T customers still might see a 5G E logo on their phone screen when connected to this service. If you do see it, know that what you’re getting is not really 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;
&lt;aside id="P0HVlL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G really isn’t worth upgrading for yet, but if you’re on any of the company’s unlimited plans, you wouldn’t need to anyway&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="gXk39F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248430"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C6XNQm"&gt;Outside of that debacle, AT&amp;amp;T has invested in its true 5G offerings, which are structured similarly to Verizon’s: a fast mmWave version called 5G Plus in limited places and slower but more widespread standard 5G coverage. However, 5G Plus may be even more scarce than Verizon’s UW 5G. The company doesn’t provide any coverage maps for it, and it says only that it is deployed in “select innovation zones” in parts of certain cities. Testers for &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks/2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;’s annual mobile network test&lt;/a&gt; didn’t encounter 5G Plus in cities where AT&amp;amp;T offers it. The carrier’s standard 5G is of the low-band variety similar to Verizon’s Nationwide, and &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; testers also found that it sometimes lagged behind 4G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCcuum"&gt;All of this is to say that AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G really isn’t worth upgrading your plan for yet, but if you’re on any of the company’s unlimited plans, you wouldn’t need to anyway. Both 5G and 5G Plus are included in all postpaid unlimited plans, which start at $75 per month ($65 with auto pay). The Unlimited Plus prepaid plan also includes it at $75 per month ($60 with auto pay). AT&amp;amp;T’s only postpaid 4GB data-capped plan doesn’t include 5G and neither do its other prepaid plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNimDg"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T may have had a somewhat rocky start with 5G, but the technology will improve. And for now at least, the company isn’t charging a premium for its fastest 5G variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5N4Cb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fmaps%2Fwireless-coverage.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T 5G coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZW3lLd"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="z7bVnx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: All of T-Mobile’s postpaid plans include 5G. If you’re on the base unlimited plan and live in a congested area you might find you have more reliable access to 5G by upgrading. But no need if you don’t notice slowdowns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PxCgUp"&gt;Of the three big carriers, T-Mobile might be in the best position to bring truly faster-than-LTE 5G to the most people — but it doesn’t seem to be there quite yet. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s efforts have been concentrated around high and low-band offerings. T-Mobile offers both, too, but it’s also working on converting Sprint’s former midband frequencies to 5G. This might be a sweet spot: not as fast as the mmWave stuff, but genuinely faster than 4G. &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/race-to-5g-5g-limps-to-nationwide-status"&gt;Recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; shows the network isn’t delivering on that promise just yet, but T-Mobile promised to extend midband 5G to 100 million people by the end of this year and doesn’t look to be slowing down any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpSW0x"&gt;All of the company’s postpaid plans include 5G, starting with the $65 per month ($60 with autopay) Essentials plan. One caveat: customers on that base-level plan are the first ones subject to slowdowns when the network is congested. T-Mobile does not offer 5G on its prepaid plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="wjFqsx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248478"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TFa17r"&gt;For now, we think T-Mobile customers can stay put on their current plan. Essentials plan customers who are happy with their network speeds and don’t notice slowdowns probably wouldn’t gain much from upgrading just yet. But it will be interesting to see if T-Mobile can make good on its ambitious promises to bring meaningfully fast 5G to more of its customers in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="m4L2q7"&gt;US Cellular&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tQnXJX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: All plans (pre- and postpaid) include access to 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJEhwO"&gt;US Cellular 5G is of the low-band variety, so it’s still only a little faster than 4G. But the good news is if you’re on US Cellular, you have access to the company’s 5G: all plans (pre- and postpaid) include it. And if you’re in a rural area, US Cellular is more likely to offer 5G to you now, while major carriers’ coverage is still mostly concentrated around bigger cities. So there’s not much to deliberate here, if you have a 5G phone and your area is covered, you should be able to connect. We just wouldn’t advise anyone to switch to US Cellular only because it offers 5G where they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xH1tu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uscellular.com%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US Cellular coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x37LzS"&gt;MVNOs: Cricket, Metro by T-Mobile, etc.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jpsQGR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: If you’re happy with your MVNO plan, don’t switch things up just for 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAFgq4"&gt;Most mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs, do include 5G on their plans. Cricket’s unlimited plan offers 5G access using AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network ($60 per month for one line). All Mint Mobile plans include access to 5G on T-Mobile’s network, and Metro by T-Mobile prepaid plans come with 5G access, starting with a 10GB plan for $40 / month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rpGfnM"&gt;A significant caveat though: since MVNOs don’t own the networks they use, carrier subscribers are likely to get preferential treatment when there’s congestion. If you’re looking for the best of the best speeds, one of the big three might be the way to go. But again, that reality is still a ways off. Chances are, you wouldn’t be upgrading to a night-and-day experience if you did switch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s nationwide 5G can be slower than its LTE network, tests show</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoFTeg"&gt;Verizon’s new nationwide 5G network is reportedly slower than its LTE network, to the point that users are apparently better off just disabling 5G entirely unless they’re near a mmWave network. The results come from &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/heres-why-verizon-iphone-users-must-turn-off-5g-right-now"&gt;testing done by &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;’s Sascha Sagan&lt;/a&gt;, who points to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509364/verizon-5g-network-ultra-wideband-nationwide-apple-event"&gt;Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, or DSS&lt;/a&gt;, as the culprit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8EPRy"&gt;The tech lets carriers run LTE and 5G networks side by side, which is useful if, like Verizon, you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418981/verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-auction-winner-fcc-dish"&gt;don’t yet have enough dedicated 5G spectrum&lt;/a&gt;. While the carrier has largely focused on its mmWave network until recently, it also has begun rolling out a mid-band nationwide 5G network, which promises to avoid mmWave’s range issues by using DSS. The only catch is that, with Verizon, it seems like this tech leads to worse performance in most cases for phones running in 5G mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ggJFH4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It may be worth checking to see if you’re actually getting faster speeds with 5G on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8WWL2r"&gt;The solution, at least for now, is to just turn 5G off if you’re a Verizon customer. If that has your concerned about speeds compared to your T-Mobile customer friends, don’t worry too much: in it’s &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks/2020"&gt;nationwide speed test&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; found that T-Mobile’s 5G can often still be slower than Verizon’s LTE, even though it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418289/t-mobile-mid-band-5g-81-new-cities-towns-coverage-gigabit-speeds"&gt;uses dedicated 5G bands&lt;/a&gt;. That same nationwide test also revealed that AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G can be slower than its LTE as well — which makes sense, given that it also uses the DSS technology for it’s 5G network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAZuIE"&gt;The results from &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; were only done in New York City, so if you have a 5G phone on Verizon, it may be worth checking to see if you’re actually getting faster speeds with 5G on. If you’re not, it may be worth turning it off entirely for now. This is also likely just a temporary issue — as Verizon continues to add dedicated 5G spectrum, their speeds are going to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKURvA"&gt;It’s important to note that this doesn’t apply to Verizon’s mmWave technology, which is much faster than anything any other carrier has to offer. However, while mmWave &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8G_4FocrA&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;has the speed, it doesn’t have the range&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be blocked by trees, buildings, and sometimes even windows. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516518/apple-iphone-12-5g-uw-verizon-mmwave-logo-reveal-ad-chris-rock"&gt;if you often find that 5G UB logo&lt;/a&gt; popping up on your phone, and you need that speed, it may be worth keeping 5G on, even if it could lead to slow downs when you get outside its range.&lt;/p&gt;
