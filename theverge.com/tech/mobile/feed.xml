    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4YCz23"&gt;The Arizona House of Representatives just passed landmark app store legislation in a 31-29 vote on Wednesday that could have far-reaching consequences for Apple and Google and their respective mobile operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwGZtT"&gt;The legislation, a &lt;a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/proposed/H.2005COBB.pdf"&gt;sweeping amendment to Arizona’s existing HB2005&lt;/a&gt;, prevents app store operators from forcing a developer based in the state to use a preferred payment system, putting up a significant roadblock to Apple and Google’s ability to collect commissions on in-app purchases and app sales. It will now head to the state senate, where it must pass before its sent to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDD94Y"&gt;The amendment specifically prohibits stores exceeding 1 million downloads from requiring “a developer that is domiciled in this state to use a particular in-application payments system as the exclusive mode of accretive payments from a user.” It also covers users living in Arizona from having to pay for apps using exclusive payment systems, though it’s not immediately clear if that means developers outside Arizona can avoid paying commission to Apple and Google when they sell something to a state resident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPkq8S"&gt;The bill specifically exempts game consoles “and other special-purpose devices that are connected to the internet,” and it also bars companies like Apple and Google from retaliating against developers who choose to use third-party payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yZst2P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bill opens the door to alternative payment systems on iOS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bo2fXl"&gt;The amendment narrowly passed the Arizona House Appropriations Committee last week in a 7-6 vote, which sent it to the floor of the state’s House of Representatives for a full vote on Wednesday. Notable opponents of the bill have been Arizona Democrats, who’ve argued that state legislatures shouldn’t get involved in ongoing legal matters between companies, in reference to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; between Apple and Google and companies like &lt;em&gt;Forntite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games. There was also concern the bill would interfere with interstate commerce and raise unconstitutionality claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQuEBI"&gt;The bill opens the door to developers using third-party payment systems, thereby allowing them to bypass the industry standard 30 percent cut Apple and Google have collected for years. It’s not clear how the tech companies will respond, as the bill could have significant effects on their businesses in the state of Arizona while also putting pressure on them to change the rules for all developers everywhere. Both Apple and Google declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6jqkl"&gt;“Today, Arizona put a marker down and became the first state in the nation to advance a digital market that is free and fair,” said the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), the industry group composed of Epic, Tinder parent company company Match Group, and Spotify that is responsible for helping draft the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySd8Ae"&gt;“The Coalition for App Fairness is pleased to see the House passage of HB 2005, which will encourage business innovation in Arizona and protect consumer choice. While this is cause for celebration, it is only a first step toward achieving a truly level playing field for all,” the statement goes on to say. “We look forward to working with the Arizona State Senate to move a solution forward that builds on this momentum to provide consumer freedom, lower costs, and increase developers’ ability to thrive and innovate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oco2KR"&gt;The bill has attracted intense lobbying from Apple and Google. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/Policy/apple-google-lobbyists-arizona-bill"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;published earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, Apple tapped lobbyist Rod Diridon and also hired Kirk Adams, the former chief of staff to Arizona’s governor, to help make its case to the House of Representatives. Apple also joined the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and pushed the body to begin combating the bill, &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;reported. “We went through a very difficult weekend where Apple and Google hired probably almost every lobbyist in town,” Arizona State Rep. Regina Cobb, a Republican and the primary sponsor of the bill, told&lt;em&gt; Protocol&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULD3Hv"&gt;In testimony in front of the House, Apple’s chief compliance officer, Kyle Andeer, made the case that the App Store provides value to developers that warrant its commission. “The commission has been described by some special interests as a ‘payment processing fee’—as if Apple is just swiping a credit card. That’s terribly misleading. Apple provides developers an enormous amount of value — both the store to distribute their apps around the world and the studio to create them. That is what the commission reflects,” Andeer said in written testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sd59ZZ"&gt;“Yet this bill tells Apple that it cannot use its own check-out lane (and collect a commission) in the store we built,” he goes on. “This would allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free — even if they’re selling digital goods, even if they’re making millions or even billions of dollars doing it. The bill is a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcWRtn"&gt;“Apple and Google have a monopoly on how you download apps to your phone. Because of that, for any app that offers digital services like games or music, you have to pay through Apple or Google’s monopolistic payment processing system,” Cobb wrote in an &lt;a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2021/02/19/its-time-to-free-ourselves-from-big-tech-monopoly/"&gt;op-ed for the &lt;em&gt;Arizona Capitol Times&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “You have to use their system and their payment processor, and then they tax you for it. Small app developers have to absorb the cost and struggle to survive or pass the tax onto their consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4X4AfZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple and Google have a monopoly on how you download apps to your phone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kxcyR5"&gt;The sentiment is one shared by vocal critics of Apple and Google, like Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson. He has submitted testimony for two bills — this one in Arizona and another in North Dakota — in support of legislation to break up what he sees as monopolies on software distribution, and he’s waged an impassioned campaign against Apple in particular since last summer, when the iPhone maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;engaged in a dispute with Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; over its new Hey email application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XrU4T"&gt;“Apple operates a tollbooth on the only road to distribution of mobile software for the dominant iPhone platform. And this doesn’t just hurt app developers, but consumers as well. When Apple tried to shake down our company for the 30% cut of revenues, they explicitly encouraged us simply to pass on the cost to consumers. And that’s exactly what other developers have done,” Hansson wrote in testimony to the Arizona House Appropriations Committee last week. He added that the bill “would not only provide immediate relief to Arizona developers and consumers, it would instantly make the state the most desirable place on earth to start a new software company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvANiS"&gt;The bill is one of many — including ones in Georgia, Hawaii, and Minnesota, as well as one that already failed in the North Dakota state senate — making their way through local legislatures. The multistate push can be drawn back to a national lobbying effort from the CAF. The industry group consists of not only Epic, Match, and Spotify, but also dozens of other companies dissatisfied with the rules imposed by Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store. Epic is also engaged in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against both Apple and Google over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;last summer, a dispute that sits at the heart of the ongoing app store debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3CIISd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bills are part of a multistate lobbying effort from the Coalition for App Fairness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OBPaKu"&gt;The CAF, which worked alongside Match to approach Cobb for HB2005, has been hiring lobbyists around the country to approach representatives with draft bills that would make it easier for developers to bypass rules thought to be ironclad within the mobile app world. Specifically for Apple, these bills are targeting rules dictating that iOS users and the platform’s developers only buy, sell, and distribute software through the App Store. (Google allows alternative app stores on Android, though it does present security warnings and other obstacles to users who download and use them.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNk0wf"&gt;Additionally, these bills are taking aim at rules saying app makers must use the preferred payment systems of Apple and Google, as kind of backup defense in the event alternative app stores remain off the table. It’s those terms, written into developer agreements the companies make app makers sign to distribute software through the stores, that allow both companies to take anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of all revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ir14ht"&gt;The Arizona bill follows a similar, though broader and potentially more disruptive bill in North Dakota that last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;failed to pass the state’s senate&lt;/a&gt;. The North Dakota bill would have forced Apple and Google to allow alternative app stores onto iOS and Android, in addition to allowing developers to use alternative payment systems. The North Dakota bill, which failed in an 11-36 vote, would have also barred companies from retaliating against developers that opted to use alternative app stores or payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj1Erq"&gt;Apple similarly lobbied hard against the North Dakota bill, with Apple’s chief privacy engineer, Erik Neuenschwander, testifying that the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it.” He further argued that it would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into iPhone by design,” &lt;a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/north-dakota-senate-bill-targets-monopolistic-app-stores/article_dc491c88-97e0-54cd-beb2-5a26044cb97c.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdVDxR"&gt;Central to all of these bills and the fierce lobbying efforts surrounding them from both sides is a debate threatening one of the most lucrative pillars of Apple’s (and to a lesser extent Google’s) business: Should app store owners be able to set the rules for what kind of software is allowed onto mobile phones, and should those rules also force developers into paying commissions for accessing the platform? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBdiGX"&gt;Just a few years ago, that Apple and other companies would take 30 percent of all revenue was considered a settled matter. While some companies, like Netflix and Spotify, complained vigorously about unfair treatment, Apple’s iron grip on the App Store, and by extension the iPhone, felt inexorable. It was simply how mobile app distribution worked — unless you were a large company like Amazon, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;cut special deals with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="w8Xx9F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple already has an incredible advantage over any company that dares compete with them.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WCuqfA"&gt;But growing resentment from developers large and small, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301453/antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-reform-cicilline-buck"&gt;an upswell in regulatory fervor in Washington&lt;/a&gt;, and growing consumer hostility toward Big Tech have created an unprecedented movement hoping to rein in Silicon Valley’s most powerful corporations. Square in the sights of all these parties is the App Store — specifically the 30 percent cut, or “Apple tax” as it has come to be known, and the payment system requirements that help enforce it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUSoVB"&gt;Apple has already made some concessions in its relationship to developers in response to rising antitrust pressure. Most prominently, the company announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;new small business program late last year&lt;/a&gt; allowing developers making less than $1 million in annual revenue to lower the App Store cut they pay to Apple from 30 percent to 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLbUvg"&gt;But those concessions are far from stopping Apple’s critics, nor the lobbying efforts of its most committed opponents, from pushing for more. “Apple already has an incredible advantage over any company that dares compete with them, and soon that might well be most of the economy,” Hansson wrote in the conclusion of his HB2005 testimony. “Giving us at least a fighting chance by enforcing a choice in payment processing is the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6B1z3"&gt;Following the bill’s passing, Hansson said his company Basecamp was fully prepared to relocate to Arizona to take advantage of the perks. “This means everything,” he wrote on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wljdkv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are going to prepare app updates for both Android and iOS that give Arizonans the right to signup for service using our normal payment processing setup. Then start the conversation with lawyers on what it’ll take to relocate Basecamp to Arizona. This means everything.&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1367197326041903106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wKT1ur"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 2nd, 2:44PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added additional comment from David Heinemeier Hansson regarding his company’s response to the successful HB2005 vote. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G will get monthly security updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ZV7tgWoE7QEsRsnDV09hg0DKmo=/319x0:3765x2297/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68898786/a52_5g_blass.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The upcoming Galaxy A52 5G is shaping up to be a competitive midranger indeed. | Photo by Evan Blass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lZC4ko"&gt;Samsung’s upcoming midrange device, the Galaxy A52 5G, appears to be in line to receive monthly security updates. First &lt;a href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/nieuws/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-krijgt-maandelijks-beveiligingsupdates/"&gt;spotted by Galaxy Club&lt;/a&gt;, the yet-to-be formally announced A52 5G &lt;a href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb"&gt;appears on Samsung’s security update page&lt;/a&gt; for its monthly update cycle. Along with earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;rumors of high refresh rate screens&lt;/a&gt; — and &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-camera-specs-update-schedule-leaks_id130451"&gt;a new leak that suggests&lt;/a&gt; the main camera will offer optical image stabilization — this looks like Samsung is taking the A51’s successor very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrnslb"&gt;Samsung generally reserves spots on the monthly update schedule for flagship and higher-end devices. While this isn’t the first time a midrange A-series device has been scheduled for monthly updates, last year’s Galaxy A51 and A51 5G are on the quarterly update schedule. Putting the A52 5G on the monthly schedule makes it more competitive with the likes of the Pixel 4A 5G, which receives frequent updates directly from Google. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iH7h35S0hyqg02Ev01y8ovYBIWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22340151/a52_updates.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung has listed the unreleased Galaxy A52 5G on a support page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nXJ5sP"&gt;As far as leaks and rumors go, update schedules aren’t as exciting as hardware specs like screen refresh rates and megapixel counts. But they’re just as important; regular updates ensure that bugs and issues can be fixed in a timely manner. Samsung has committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;offering a minimum of four years&lt;/a&gt; of regular security updates for many of its Galaxy devices, including the A-series. The A52 5G will probably drop down to quarterly and then occasional frequency toward the end of those four years, but this still goes a long way to making the device usable for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="r3GGJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s Galaxy A51 has two good things going for it: the screen and the price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZH1fE0"&gt;There’s still no word on an official release date for the Galaxy A52 5G and A52, but it seems likely that a launch is imminent. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is boosting AR performance on Android phones with dual cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rVDrG2Da_KkqCtDvBT67AevvE2Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68895806/vpavic_191016_3730_0029.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aq3EMv"&gt;Google is updating its augmented reality SDK so that phones with dual cameras can capture better depth information. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/01/googles-about-to-enhance-ar-performance-by-taking-advantage-of-your-phones-dual-cameras/"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent update to the Google Play Services for AR app, which is how Google distributes ARCore features, now notes “Dual camera stereo depth on supported devices” in its changelog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDIf0S"&gt;For now, it appears that the support will be limited to Google’s own Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, which were both released in 2019. The &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of compatible ARCore devices on Google’s developer site says that dual camera support will roll out in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NN0JB1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google keeps adding Pixel features it claims it didn’t need: 2020 edition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496779/google-pixel-5-ultrawide-telephoto-camera-headphone-jack-direction-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ERD4y1"&gt;Notably, this means that the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G, both of which are 2020 Pixel phones with dual cameras, won’t see the benefits for now. That may be because their secondary cameras are ultrawides rather than the Pixel 4 and 4 XL’s telephotos, which would have implications for how they could produce more detailed depth maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWhWoV"&gt;In any case, it’s another consequence of Google’s indecision on Pixel camera lenses. The company long insisted that it only needed a single camera due to computational features like &lt;a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/10/see-better-and-further-with-super-res.html"&gt;Super Res Zoom on the Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20916938/pixel-4-camera-vs-iphone-11-pro"&gt;confusingly added a telephoto lens&lt;/a&gt; on the Pixel 4 anyway, then backtracked and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496686/pixel-5-camera-comparison-sensor-specs-features"&gt;swapped it out for an ultrawide&lt;/a&gt; on the Pixel 5.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4AxgVb"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau is teasing a “moonshot” announcement on March 8th, when the company expected to reveal details about its next flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 9. “Something new is on the horizon” a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fuk%2Fmoonshot&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F1%2F22306934%2Foneplus-9-launch-event-date-moonshot-pete-lau" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;teaser site reads&lt;/a&gt;, alongside a photograph that looks an awful lot like the famous “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise"&gt;Earthrise&lt;/a&gt;” photograph from the Apollo 8 mission. That photo was taken with a Hasselblad camera, the 180-year-old Swedish company rumored to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272052/oneplus-9-pro-hasselbland-quad-rear-cameras-ultrawide-telephoto-zoom-specs"&gt;partnering with OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; on its upcoming phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rdIV9"&gt;In the past, manufacturers have also used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/20/18232998/huawei-p30-pro-quad-camera-leica-specs-features"&gt;photographs of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; to advertise the capabilities of their phones’ zoom cameras for astrophotography, indicating that this could be a key feature of the OnePlus 9 lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DR7Onq"&gt;The tease comes days after tipster Ishan Agarwal &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-9-pro-9r-watch-march-launch-exclusive/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company would be announcing three new smartphones — the OnePlus 9, 9 Pro, and 9R — and a smartwatch in mid-March. According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxJmb/status/1366308703562059785"&gt;tipster Max Jambor&lt;/a&gt;, the company will announce the launch date of the OnePlus 9 series on March 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OuSSii"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Stay tuned for March 8.&lt;a href="https://t.co/mprr4v8UbS"&gt;https://t.co/mprr4v8UbS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/CQSop6Fg85"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CQSop6Fg85&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Lau (@PeteLau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1366357664213528576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fTtPun"&gt;Other rumors about the upcoming OnePlus 9 Pro include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;wireless fast charging at 45W&lt;/a&gt;. The step-down OnePlus 9 is expected to have a flat 6.55-inch 120Hz 1080p display, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-9-specs-1195130/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while the 9 Pro will reportedly have a 6.78-inch 120Hz 1440p display. Both phones are expected to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor. A third phone, rumored to be called either the OnePlus 9R or OnePlus 9 Lite, could also be announced with an older Snapdragon 865 processor, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-lite-snapdragon-865-will-launch-alongside-oneplus-9-9-pro"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon support says you should turn off 5G to save your phone’s battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Verizon Communications logo seen displayed on a smartphone with the 5G inscription background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYLHsvbhArPFRlGPayxGnme_6xc=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68887873/1227822210.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwJAmv"&gt;Despite its relentless promotion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22194419/5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide"&gt;5G phones&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that it spent more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;$45 billion bidding&lt;/a&gt; on a new faster spectrum, Verizon support now is advising people on Twitter to turn off their phones’ 5G access to preserve battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1vDDR"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1366055566347546635?s=20"&gt;Sunday morning tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon support helpfully suggested that “one way to help conserve battery life is to turn on LTE” if users found their batteries were “draining faster than normal.” That step would, of course, turn off 5G in a phone that has it available. It’s also worth pointing out that you don’t actually “turn on LTE” when doing this step — LTE is always enabled as a fallback for the 5G network. But Verizon is obviously being cautious so as not to actually tell its customers to “turn off 5G”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fAfQh69dqwsWSeWwmy_E0WegA_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22334862/verizon_says_turn_off_5g.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GIze4C"&gt;Twitter users naturally pointed out that switching to LTE-only would mean turning off 5G (which is available in some newer phones), but the helpful support person said it was important to troubleshoot “steps to find the root cause of any issues with speed,” adding that Verizon is “quickly launching more 5G areas, and making updates constantly to improve speeds.” Verizon’s nationwide 5G network uses a technology called DSS, which in many instances is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;actually slower than the LTE network&lt;/a&gt; it’s trying to replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXMAO1"&gt;Verizon announced its big 5G plans for 2021 last month, after formally launching its next-gen network in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509364/verizon-5g-network-ultra-wideband-nationwide-apple-event"&gt;October 2020&lt;/a&gt;.  One of its top priorities is expanding coverage of its ultra-fast mmWave coverage, which is currently restricted to parts of some cities in the US. It’s also heavily dependent on how close you are to a Verizon 5G site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jauZ6Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oxXD2Q"&gt;Both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T spent big bucks in the FCC’s Auction 107, bidding on the C-band spectrum. Verizon spent $45.4 billion— twice as much as AT&amp;amp;T’s $23.4 billion. AT&amp;amp;T’s current nationwide 5G network also relies on DSS with speeds close to or lower than 4G LTE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ottI2"&gt;The new frequencies won’t become available until the end of the 2021 at the earliest, and will be available in limited locations first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMmHq3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram update adds auto-delete option to all messages, expiring invites, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4wPLt53eGo3fE1HuGhq53pQ4DZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68877478/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8fbrHy"&gt;Telegram is updating its messaging app with options for auto-deleting messages, expiring invite links, and new unlimited groups, the company &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/autodelete-inv2"&gt;shared in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Much like Signal, Telegram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;received a burst of new users&lt;/a&gt; in the confusion over WhatsApp’s privacy policy and now the company is adopting features that were already part of its competitors’ apps, features which offer more security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7yZYj"&gt;Auto-deleting messages were already possible in Telegram’s encrypted Secret Chats, but this new update for iOS and Android adds the option to make messages disappear in any kind of chat. Auto-delete can be enabled inside of chats, and set to delete either 24 hours or seven days after messages are sent. Auto-delete won’t remove every message though; if a message was sent before the feature was turned on, it’ll stick around. Telegram’s competitors have had similar features: WhatsApp introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550634/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-feature"&gt;a feature in 2020&lt;/a&gt; and Signal has had disappearing messages &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/disappearing-messages/"&gt;since at least 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mAUhhCNzCkl3DyjKNSkMkB69h4g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328934/telegram_auto_delete_1.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Messages can auto-delete after 24 hours or seven days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bYzqM1"&gt;Telegram’s also making changes to groups that might allow for the kind of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261435/elon-musk-clubhouse-podcasts-robinhood"&gt;immediate, informative audio experiences&lt;/a&gt; that have become popular on Clubhouse. New “Broadcast Groups” allow for an unlimited number of members, but limit creating posts to group admins so they can, well, broadcast. Voice chats on the other hand are open to everyone in a broadcast group, and Telegram thinks the feature should be “ideal for large communities, where people can follow along and catch exclusive interviews, news, or just casual talks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIbBnv"&gt;To help keep these groups exclusive (or grow them fast) Telegram is adding in expiring invite links that can be set to expire after a certain number of uses, a certain amount of time, or both. With the new invites, group admins should be able to better moderate who joins and keep private subject matter a little more private.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eyzJbIQJuQi50OtVWI-JZhwtGjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328939/telegram_invite_links_1.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invite links can be set to expire after a certain number of uses or a set duration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4uHoi2"&gt;Many users left WhatsApp for Telegram out of concern that Facebook would read their messages. Expanding privacy features like auto-delete seems like a good way for Telegram to address those concerns. But even with new privacy options, Telegram still doesn’t universally offer a feature many users expect — end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpLWdT"&gt;All messages on Telegram are technically encrypted, but Secret Chats are the only ones that are exclusively viewable on the devices of the people participating. It’s a difference that Telegram says &lt;a href="https://telegra.ph/Why-Isnt-Telegram-End-to-End-Encrypted-by-Default-08-14"&gt;enables features like the new broadcast groups&lt;/a&gt;, but even with auto-delete it might be a dealbreaker for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWLDw2"&gt;You can see &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/autodelete-inv2"&gt;the full list of new features&lt;/a&gt; on Telegram’s blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TNbOj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68OjOc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis compiles the entire FFVII timeline into one mobile game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4czh9798E_aU-w_L-bb-XPRWbg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876956/FFVIIEC05_en.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="obmwZW"&gt;Square Enix announced two mobile games set in the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII &lt;/em&gt;universe today. One is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301945/final-fantasy-7-soldier-prequel-battle-royale-android-iphone"&gt;battle royale game aiming for a 2021 release&lt;/a&gt;, and the other is &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis&lt;/em&gt;, a compilation of all the games and stories set in the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII &lt;/em&gt;universe (&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Advent Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Before Crisis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crisis Core&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dirge of Cerberus&lt;/em&gt;). The latter is slated to launch sometime in 2022 on Android and iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZEohX"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-ANNOUNCED-FOR-PLAYSTATION5-CONSOLE"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis&lt;/em&gt; is a chapter-structured single-player experience that covers the entire timeline in one of the most popular installments in Square Enix’s RPG franchise. The compilation will feature all the events from each game, in addition to new story elements focusing on the “origins of SOLDIER.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDRBeR"&gt;In an interview &lt;a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202102/26215104.html"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;Weekly Famitsu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; director Tetsuya Nomura strongly hints you’ll meet a younger Sephiroth: “it goes without saying that you will get to see the early days of a certain legendary hero when he was younger.” He also says the game will be released in monthly installments, and will have a materia combat system more like the original game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXr1Kq"&gt;Watching the announcement trailer, &lt;em&gt;Ever Crisis&lt;/em&gt; reminds me of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/18/16979602/final-fantasy-xv-pocket-edition-ios-android"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a 2018 title that served as an abridged version of the fifteenth main installment in the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXtJxJ"&gt;The description for the trailer on YouTube notes it is “another possibility for a remake,” and the visuals look greatly improved from the original version of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; on the PlayStation, as pointed out by Twitter user Nibellion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T spins out DirecTV as a $16B company, a quarter of what it paid in 2015</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qcUNkMMrtzKhjg0-UgELFsKl6xo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876637/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="keg3YK"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T today announced plans to spin out its various video businesses — DirecTV, AT&amp;amp;T TV, and U-Verse — into a new company that it will jointly control with TPG Capital. The deal sees AT&amp;amp;T holding on to a 70 percent stake in the company, with TPG getting the other 30. “The transaction to separate AT&amp;amp;T’s US video business into New DirecTV implies an enterprise value for the new company of $16.25 billion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1gjto"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T paid a total of $67 billion to buy DirecTV: it landed the satellite provider &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/18/5727276/att-acquires-directv"&gt;for $48.5 billion in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest was debt that AT&amp;amp;T took on. With this “premium new video entity” valued at less than a quarter of that, you can see how just how badly the original mega-acquisition has fared. “We certainly didn’t expect this outcome when we closed the DirecTV acquisition in 2015,” AT&amp;amp;T John Stankey said on a call with analysts and investors after the news was made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPdvuQ"&gt;The deal for this new company, which will be led by AT&amp;amp;T US video boss Bill Morrow, is expected to close in the second half of 2021. AT&amp;amp;T will net $7.8 billion as part of the pact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AHRlOq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AT&amp;amp;amp;T tried to buy out the streaming wars — and customers are paying for it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21115181/att-direct-tv-time-warner-acquisition-debt-streaming-wars"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GbwZay"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says that all content deals — including NFL Sunday Ticket — will move along to the “new” DirecTV. The company is also insisting that its WarnerMedia channels like CNN, TBS, and TNT will remain a core part of the video properties. “Customers aren’t going to see a change” in bundles or programming in the near term, Stankey said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24mN8c"&gt;Activist investors have long urged AT&amp;amp;T to deal with its DirecTV problem; Elliott Management has said the transaction produced “damaging results.” DirecTV’s business has continued to suffer declining subscribers as consumers have shifted en masse to streaming entertainment. But AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20747190/directv-now-rebrand-att-tv-streaming-app"&gt;deeply confusing branding choices&lt;/a&gt; for its video services haven’t helped matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3RBdH"&gt;“Today’s announcement lines up with the evolution of our business,” Stankey said on the call. “We’re coming off a year where we saw strong wireless subscriber growth,” Stankey said, and he also called HBO Max “an important part of our future.” AT&amp;amp;T has said it’s focused on the mobile business — it just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;spent $23.4 billion in the FCC’s C-band spectrum auction&lt;/a&gt; — and content efforts like HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mHsFe"&gt;Stankey added that AT&amp;amp;T examined “every possibility under the sun” for what to do with its video assets before deciding on the deal with TPG.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter planning a feature to let you auto-block and mute abusive accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yMhBh6q_mT1LeR1BX2CSpVlLSMc=/0x83:1898x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875042/twitter_auto_block.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dgZp9v"&gt;Twitter plans to introduce a way for you to automatically block and mute abusive accounts, the company announced at its Analyst Day presentation on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6TFyA"&gt;It appears the feature will be a toggle you can turn on in a new “safety mode,” according to a slide in the &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_presentations/Analyst_Day_2021/3_AnalystDay2021_Kayvon-Dantley.pdf"&gt;Analyst Day slide deck&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s Twitter’s description of how the toggle will work if you flip it on: “Automatically block accounts that appear to break the Twitter Rules, and mute accounts that might be using insults, name-calling, strong language, or hateful remarks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bi2JPu"&gt;With the new safety mode, Twitter will automatically detect accounts that “might be acting abusive or spammy” and limit how those accounts can engage with your content for seven days, according to the slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsNNmW"&gt;We’ve asked Twitter for more information about the new features and will update this article with anything we hear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3xAsg"&gt;Twitter has historically struggled with abuse on its platform and has released a number of features over the years to help reduce offensive content, such as letting people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20874847/twitter-feature-launch-us-japan-rollout-hide-replies"&gt;hide replies&lt;/a&gt; and letting users control &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362514/twitter-reply-limiting-features-all-users-harassment-rollout-available-now"&gt;who can reply to an individual tweet&lt;/a&gt;. The company also has some automated tools in place to remove abusive tweets, and it said in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20929290/twitter-abusive-tweets-automated-removal-earnings-q3-2019"&gt;that it removes&lt;/a&gt; more than 50 percent of abusive tweets before users report them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG: New State is a futuristic new battle royale game for Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FG35rvlSegFMS6_TcQniVYhW-0w=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68871803/PUBG_NEW_STATE_Key_Art_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t2yXxQ"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; universe is expanding with a new mobile title for iOS and Android called &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State, &lt;/em&gt;which catapults the battle royale ahead in time for a more futuristic take on the massive multiplayer genre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRcioC"&gt;Set in 2051, &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt; takes place years after the current &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; games (which are set in approximately modern times) on a new map called Troi and promises to bring with it a slew of near-future weapons and vehicles, like drones and deployable combat shields. Based on the early images, it’s a similar vibe to fellow shooter &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s semi-futuristic military tech from games like &lt;em&gt;Black Ops 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJD19c"&gt;The new game is also set to dive deeper into the &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/"&gt;lore of the overall &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; universe&lt;/a&gt;, which is apparently a thing that surprisingly exists for a game whose most notable cultural signifier is the use of a cast-iron skillet as a weapon. What the time jump will mean for beloved &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; characters like &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/en/character/lunchmeat"&gt;Lunchmeat&lt;/a&gt;, though, will have to wait for the game’s release. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVi79IthSp1c0u7cD0MoZHZZuoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326840/PUBG_NEW_STATE_Screenshot_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kSJ0pM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; also promises to shake up the formula for &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; games, with in-game weapon customization options that will allow players to modify their weapons within a match in a way that sounds similar to &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;’ weapon attachments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCeBU6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; marks the third battle royale game under the &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; umbrella — although, unlike its mobile cousin &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt; will be developed by PUBG Studio, the company behind &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, the PC and console version of the original game. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21399585/pubg-mobile-update-esports-tournament-2-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; is actually a separate title&lt;/a&gt; developed by Chinese tech giant Tencent.) And despite the mobile nature of the title, PUBG Studio is making big promises of “ultra-realistic graphics that push the limits of mobile gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccKBKW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State &lt;/em&gt;will be available on Android and iOS later in 2021, with alpha tests also set for later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6FdkD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
