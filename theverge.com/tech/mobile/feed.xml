    <title>Android 12 is now available for Pixel phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Pixel running Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rAlVt-rNjyvS47ulzWJjSnahSbQ=/0x0:1875x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016203/android12hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CEtPXJ"&gt;The final version of Android 12 has been available to developers and eager fans for a few weeks on AOSP, but today, it officially launched for people who want to easily pick up the update over the air. It’s available to install right now on Pixel 3 and up, including the Pixel 3A, Pixel 4, Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, the Pixel 5, and the Pixel 5A. It’ll launch on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22495075"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, as well. Android 12 will be coming later this year to Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Tecno, Vivo, and Xiaomi devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKAdZA"&gt;The most noticeable feature in Android 12 is the new Material You design, which lets you go a little deeper to tweak the look of the homescreen to your liking. It’s more expressive than previous versions of Android, with tools to let you coordinate colors that can extend across app icons, pull-down menus, widgets, and more. Speaking of widgets, many of those have been updated to match the new look, and Google shared today that by the end of October, it plans to have over a dozen new or refreshed widgets available for its first-party apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 running on Pixel 6" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJxL1Hdpwnwi6X74iXuiib8rr_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938464/pixelandroid12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at some of the new widgets made for Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uk9I0L"&gt;There are plenty of other features in Android 12, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;you can read more about them in my review of the software&lt;/a&gt;. Google also &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/android/android-12/"&gt;published a blog&lt;/a&gt; that goes deep on the features you’ll be able to experience. But if you’re mainly interested in Material You, you should know that Google says it’s a “Pixel-first” feature, though it will be coming to “more device makers and phones soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EghAY"&gt;It’s likely that Pixel phones will receive several more “Pixel-first” features in the future with Android 12. For the past couple of years, Google has released feature drops that make it a little sweeter to be a Pixel user. Some of the features only work on newer Pixel phones, though, so that’s all the more reason to consider picking up the new Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro. Google shared during its hardware event that these phones will get a minimum of five years of support, which is impressive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRFxm0"&gt;To get the update, head to your Pixel phone’s settings app, click “System,” then find “System update” and click into it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have big screens, big ambitions, and small prices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5De6cYg1oD4_rn2GWs6Lgp7kRxk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016178/bfarsace_211014_4802_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Google claims to finally be ready to take on Apple and Samsung&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TCOahY"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22729135/google-pixel-6-pro-leaked-photos-images-renders-evan-blass"&gt;many leaks&lt;/a&gt;, official teases, and months of waiting, Google has finally given its latest Pixel phones a formal launch. The new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are the latest high-end phones from the company that hasn’t traditionally been able to make much of a dent in the high-end phone market. Both are available for preorder starting today, October 19th, and will begin shipping on October 28th. Google says all the major US carriers, plus retailers such as the Google Store, Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and others, will be selling the phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIFGEC"&gt;There are a lot of things to cover with the new Pixels, but the most important place to start is this: $599 and $899. Those are the starting prices for the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, respectively. That pricing is aggressive compared to similar iPhones, Samsungs, or even OnePlus phones, especially when you consider that Google is providing 128GB of storage in both base models. (The 6 can be equipped with up to 256GB, the 6 Pro has options up to 512GB.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpTmvm"&gt;Aggressive pricing has long been a Pixel &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;, and though the new Pixel 6 and 6 Pro represent a new push from Google to make phones that are competitive with the best from Apple and Samsung, these prices are just lower than the competition. A big draw for a lot of people might be that, at the end of the day, the Pixels just cost less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUbJxf38TEYXXa1KB0-HKkD7i6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934843/cwelch_211015_4802_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the Pixel 6 Pro (left) and the Pixel 6 are large phones — Google isn’t offering small and large options this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UfOfNy"&gt;The other big thing to note with the Pixels is their new processor, a custom-designed ARM SoC (System on a Chip) that Google is calling Tensor. Google says it’s competitive with the Snapdragon 888 from Qualcomm, which is what you find in basically every other high-end Android phone available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHplBf"&gt;There’s a lot going on with this processor. The most important piece is that there’s a custom TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) for AI built right into the chip and many main processing pipelines. In addition, there are two high-power application cores, two mid-range cores, four low-power cores, a dedicated coprocessor for security, a private compute core, and an image processing core. The Pixel 6 pairs the new chip with 8GB of RAM, while the 6 Pro has 12GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vjG5Ci"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a lot going on with Google’s new Tensor processor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cXG8bQ"&gt;Visually, the new phones are a departure from prior Pixel phones. Though they share a common design language, that language doesn’t really connect back to the Pixel 5 or the Pixel 4 that came before. Instead, these are flashier, shinier phones, with polished metal frames (on the 6 Pro) and glossy glass backs (on both). Google is offering each phone in three different colors, but the 6 Pro’s are decidedly more “professional” (read: boring), while the regular Pixel 6 colors are clearly more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5bLu7"&gt;I haven’t really been able to put a finger on how I feel about the new designs, but there’s something undeniably generic about them. Take the G logo off the back, and these could be phones from Samsung, TCL, OnePlus, Oppo, or any one of a number of other Chinese OEMs. Prior Pixel phones often were criticized for having a plain look that bordered on reference designs, but they all had a Google-y aesthetic to them. I’m not sure these new models have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmRQgK"&gt;By the way, Google’s rules for reviewers and influencers dictate that today, we can write about hardware impressions and specs but not provide any details on software, performance, or image quality. It’s meant to provide a sort of hands-on experience — rest assured, we will have much more to say in the full review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z46T4ahUo1sPcJNtmim9zl7Noig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934864/bfarsace_211014_4802_0117.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera module is the most prominent part of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwpk-zXoSnjbk7Cl9atGkDmIE68=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934831/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a new standard wide camera and new ultra wide camera in both phones; the Pixel 6 Pro adds a 4x telephoto camera to the mix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KbtPK1"&gt;The most prominent feature on the 6 and 6 Pro is the back camera housing. I call it a ledge; you might call it a shelf; Google seems to refer to it as a “bar,” but it’s an enormous protuberance that spans the entire width of the phone and houses two (Pixel 6) or three (6 Pro) cameras and related sensors in it. The bar is large, but unlike camera housings located in the upper corner, like you get on an iPhone or Samsung, it doesn’t cause the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro to rock when placed down. A case will likely help mitigate the size, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OPMn1T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A camera upgrade years in the making&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KIDafJ"&gt;That back camera housing is so prominent because, as usual with Pixel phones, the camera is one of the most important parts of these new models. Google has finally switched to a new camera sensor after using the prior one for four straight generations. Both phones have a 50-megapixel main sensor that is hard coded to output 12.5-megapixel images. It’s a much larger sensor than Google’s used before — physically larger than even the iPhone 13 Pro’s new camera sensor — comes with 1.2μm pixels, and is behind an f/1.85 aperture optically stabilized lens. Google says it captures 150 percent more light than the Pixel 5’s camera. Next to it is a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera with a 114-degree field of view, f/2.2 lens and similarly large 1.25μm pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsVTtt"&gt;If you spring for the Pixel 6 Pro, you also get a 4x telephoto camera that’s not available on the standard Pixel 6. This uses folded optics, has 48-megapixels (also binned down to 12-megapixel output), and has an f/3.5 aperture lens. 4x is slightly longer reach than you get with the iPhone 13 Pro’s 3x tele but not nearly as far as the 10x lens that Samsung has been putting on its high-end phones (not to mention the even longer lenses companies like Xiaomi and Huawei have deployed recently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNnlCY"&gt;The front cameras differ between the models, too, with the Pixel 6 getting an 8-megapixel, 84-degree field of view and the 6 Pro using an 11.1-megapixel, 94-degree camera. That translates into you’ll be able to fit more people in a selfie with the 6 Pro than you can with the 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awL99E"&gt;The new processor enables some new image editing features, like a “magic eraser” tool that gets rid of distracting elements in your images automatically and new long-exposure and motion blur capture modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TX8iLW"&gt;For video, both phones can shoot up to 4K 60fps, now complete with Google’s auto HDR image processing, or capture up to 240fps slow-mo video at 1080p. While Google has generally excelled at still image capture, it has long been behind Apple in video capture — we’ll be seeing just how far it’s come and if it’s more competitive now when we review the phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHl6jRq1h1U8Rsi2ktVZD-U71Kc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934844/cwelch_211015_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 has a 90Hz, 1080p, 6.4-inch OLED screen (left); the 6 Pro steps up to a 6.7-inch, 120Hz, 1440p OLED with LTPO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqvN2U"&gt;Turning to the front of the devices, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro both have large, OLED displays. The 6’s screen measures 6.4 inches diagonally, has 1080p wide resolution, and can refresh at 90Hz for a smoother scrolling experience. It’s a flat panel and has slightly larger bezels all around than the 6 Pro, which utilizes curved sides on its 6.7-inch, 1440p screen to minimize the bezels. The 6 Pro also uses LTPO technology to vary its refresh rate from as low a 10Hz all the way up to 120Hz, depending on what you’re doing on the phone. Both phones’ displays are covered in the latest Gorilla Glass Victus glass and support HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPEjNj"&gt;The screens are bright and look good, though if you turn them off-axis, you can see noticeable color shift, and there’s a visible shadow in the 6 Pro’s curves. Those are things we don’t see in the best screens from Apple and Samsung at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1YAfnl3T0GOFnK8ksZlW-HFD40=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936585/cwelch_211015_4802_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The curve on the Pixel 6 Pro produces a noticeable shadow on light backgrounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JDXcqe"&gt;As you can probably guess from those screen sizes, both of these phones are big. Unlike prior years where Google provided a small and a big option, there’s no real small phone in this lineup. In fact, the Pixel 6 is effectively as big as an iPhone 13 Pro Max; the 6 Pro is even larger, though its curves help mask its large footprint somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCEWce"&gt;Between the two, the 6 Pro certainly feels more “premium.” Its aluminum sides are thinner and polished to a shine; the regular 6 has thicker, matte sides. And there are more rough edges to find: there’s a different radius curve for the camera bar than the rest of the phone and inconsistencies with the clickiness of the buttons in the units we’ve been able to handle so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="jsbNa6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There aren’t any major feature omissions this time around — a rarity for Pixel phones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o6Wk2c"&gt;Rounding out the hardware features are the things you’d expect to find on a premium phone in late 2021. Both have wireless charging (and reverse wireless charging for accessories), IP68 weather resistance ratings, in-screen optical fingerprint sensors, stereo speakers, and fast charging support. But you won’t get a charger in the box — you’ll have to either buy a 30W brick separately or use something you already have to take advantage of that last feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZfnWZ"&gt;Both phones also support 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, though only the 6 Pro and a special version of the 6 for Verizon (which costs $100 more) have millimeter wave support. Batteries are large in both models, as well: 4614mAh in the 6 and 5004mAh in the 6 Pro. We won’t know for sure until we’re able to fully review them, but the concerns of Pixel phones coming with underequipped batteries seem to be fully in the past at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m07WNB"&gt;Lastly, the Pixel 6 Pro also has an ultrawideband chip, similar to recent iPhone and Galaxy models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5KpjHUk9lOwzlkjZSqgBhzmar1Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934858/bfarsace_211014_4802_0095.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro color options are a bit boring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MBIkzqa8G4XMu3yO_gP0NDAn7qY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934836/bfarsace_211014_4802_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s more fun in the regular Pixel 6 color options (a basic black and grey one is also available).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0L0coA"&gt;As you’d expect from a Pixel, the new models ship with the latest version of Android — in this case, Android 12. We’ve already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;gone in depth on Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, but the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro add a few new features that leverage their custom processors, such as faster on-device translation and those new AI-powered image editing features mentioned above. Importantly, Google says the new phones will get a minimum of five years of software support, longer than any other Pixel before and longer than virtually any other Android phone you can buy now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GCCDXt"&gt;Google really wants us to know that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are a turning point for the company. In an interview ahead of the announcement, Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said “this is truly the starting line for Pixel, in that, we’ve brought together all the elements that we think we need to be a real player in this space.” We can’t tell yet whether Google will finally be a “real player” in the smartphone world with its Pixel phones, but the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro do look like its best effort yet. Stay tuned for our full review in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4zkPdrMXZlJK3FLyY6Tkk8xSVWg=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016186/Pixel_6_Group_Image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can preorder Google’s just-announced Pixels.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p512wU"&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are freshly announced, and they’re already up for preorder. The new Pixels promise to offer the latest from Google, including new designs, new cameras, a new and uniquely designed Google Tensor CPU, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57DFat"&gt;This year’s Pixel phones come in two flavors: the standard Pixel 6 and the larger, triple-camera equipped Pixel 6 Pro. The base Pixel 6 with 128GB of storage starts at a price of $599, while the Pixel 6 Pro runs $899 and up if you prefer to go above the base 128GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3iYB8E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US"&gt;Google has already kicked off its preorders on its own store&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers and carriers are coming online shortly. We will update this post as more options become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pixel 6 and 6 Pro launch event live blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3YgsF1z4R1qUrFipuIgnquXaxGU=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016057/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The biggest Pixel in years — literally&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="8lbYBY"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;pre-annoucements&lt;/a&gt;, ads and yet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732322/pixel-6-pro-price-leak-us-eu"&gt;more leaks&lt;/a&gt;, the time has come for Google to officially launch the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. We already know many details: the custom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt; that powers it, the colors and many of the specs, and even some of the software features have all been officially announced. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;rumors have filled in more details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7Wplu"&gt;But there will be more to hear from Google. This is easily the most important Pixel the company has launched in years, it’s a launch where the company says it is taking on flagships from Apple and Samsung at the high end. Google hasn’t really talked big game about its phones before, so even if we’ve seen a lot of rumors, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; Google goes about making this launch happen will be interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKj7Ak"&gt;We’ll likely get a deeper dive into the specs on these phones, including whether the new camera system really is good enough to justify the massive camera ledge on the backs of these phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdCxGr"&gt;We’ll be live blogging the event alongside our other extensive coverage of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, so watch along as we watch Google finally try to step up to the big leagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F8gUx1"&gt;Google Pixel 6 live blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="BDLczB"&gt;&lt;div class="live-center-embed" data-src="https://livecenter.norkon.net/frame/voxmedia/17674/vox"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function(n){function c(t,i){n[e](h,function(n){var r,u;if(n&amp;&amp;(r=n[n.message?"message":"data"]+"",r&amp;&amp;r.substr&amp;&amp;r.substr(0,3)==="nc:")&amp;&amp;(u=r.split(":"),u[1]===i))switch(u[2]){case"h":t.style.height=u[3]+"px";return;case"scrolltotop":t.scrollIntoView();return}},!1)}for(var t,u,f,i,s,e=n.addEventListener?"addEventListener":"attachEvent",h=e==="attachEvent"?"onmessage":"message",o=n.document.querySelectorAll(".live-center-embed"),r=0;r&lt;o.length;r++)(t=o[r],t.getAttribute("data-rendered"))||(u=t.getAttribute("data-src"),u&amp;&amp;(t.setAttribute("data-rendered","true"),f=n.ncVizCounter||1e3,n.ncVizCounter=f+1,i=f+"",s="nc-frame-c-"+i,t.innerHTML='&lt;div style="position: relative; height: 300px; border: none;" id="'+s+'"&gt;&lt;iframe src="'+u+"?"+i+'" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',c(t.firstChild,i)))})(window);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 event: rumors, news, and announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KN1fJmB9HZEtdE8Y2Ca4VAaoABE=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015026/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google will likely reveal more about the Pixel 6 lineup at its October 19th event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s virtual event is set for 1PM ET / 10AM PT on October 19th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="sN2xqV"&gt;Google may have already announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6 and 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but it looks like the company may still have a few more surprises in store for us — or at least a few more details. Despite announcing the new phones earlier this year, the tech giant will hold a virtual Pixel event on October 19th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GSBWt"&gt;During the “Pixel Fall Launch” event, we anticipate we’ll learn more about the new phones and their respective specs. The company may also announce a new subscription bundle called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720374/google-pixel-pass-subscription-premium-services-bundle-extended-warranty"&gt;Pixel Pass&lt;/a&gt;,” which would add an extended warranty and premium subscriptions to Google services like YouTube to the new Pixel phones. We expect Google will explore the Pixel 6’s new Tensor SoC chipset in more detail, too, much of which still remains a mystery. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;Reports indicate&lt;/a&gt; that Google’s first in-house chip consists of a combination of new cores and weaker old ones — an unusual design choice we may finally understand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ05tm"&gt;Other event highlights are less certain. Could we get a glimpse of Google’s first folding Pixel phone, the Pixel Fold? Possibly. After a mid-2020 leak &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; the company may release it in late 2021, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;more recent report&lt;/a&gt; indicates Samsung will start producing folding OLED panels this month for the new device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkTX5h"&gt;Earlier this month, Google also said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; will roll out to Pixel devices in the “next few weeks,” so there’s a possibility the company will provide details as to when we can expect the design-focused update to roll out to Pixel devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmfYEs"&gt;Regardless of what’s announced, however, we’ll be watching the virtual event live, so check this page for the latest announcements as they’re revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Google’s Pixel 6 Fall Launch event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c93P4AT40TVWAvvqseYVcnkFFDQ=/436x0:3661x2150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015018/FA8qbJ0VQAsbGif.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and Android 12 will bring a fresh look to Google’s latest hardware.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JHyOof"&gt;With the number of leaks and pre-announcements for the Google Pixel 6, it may seem like the phones should already be here by now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Thanks to Google&lt;/a&gt;, we already know the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro exist, what they will look like, and that they will use a Google-designed CPU. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;We also have an idea what the camera specs will be&lt;/a&gt;, what the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714141/google-pixel-6-pro-marketing-images-leak-evleaks-wireless-charger-face-unlock"&gt;new wireless charging stand probably looks like&lt;/a&gt;, and even what’s inside, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716681/google-pixel-6-pro-leaked-video-assemble-disassemble"&gt;courtesy of a teardown video&lt;/a&gt; that has since been removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUkzG9"&gt;The only thing left is for Google to fill out the remaining details we don’t know and launch the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro. Google has one of the worst track records for keeping things secret, so perhaps hoping for a surprise or two might be a stretch, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356760/foldable-google-pixel-q4-2021-leaked-internal-document-5-5a-4a-5g"&gt;long-rumored, folding Pixel&lt;/a&gt; could still materialize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22486864"&gt;alongside other surprises&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to know for sure is to tune in to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;company’s Pixel Fall Launch event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xk2u34"&gt;What time does the Pixel 6 event start? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hqdhnu"&gt;The Pixel 6 event will be a pre-recorded stream airing online at 1PM ET / 10AM PT today, Tuesday, October 19th. You can mark it on your Google Calendar using a &lt;a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&amp;amp;text=Pixel%20Fall%20Launch&amp;amp;dates=20211019T170000Z/20211019T180000Z&amp;amp;sprop=website:http://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/&amp;amp;details=On+October+19%2C+we%E2%80%99re+officially+introducing+you+to+Pixel+6+and+Pixel+6+Pro%E2%80%94the+completely+reimagined+Google+phones.+Powered+by+Google+Tensor%2C+Google%E2%80%99s+first+custom+mobile+chip%2C+they%E2%80%99re+fast%2C+smart+and+secure.+And+they+adapt+to+you.+%23Pixel6Launch%0A%0AWatch+this+keynote%2C+click+here+on+October+19th+at+10am+PT%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fpixelevent.withgoogle.com%0A%0AShop+the+Google+Store%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gle%2FGoogleStore"&gt;handy shortcut&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/"&gt;Pixel Event page&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re an iOS user, Google conveniently (and hilariously) includes a &lt;a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/downloads/Pixel-Fall-Launch.ics"&gt;.ics file&lt;/a&gt; on that same page for your convenience — and because it knows a lot of people use the calendar app built into their iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sjJcsH"&gt;Where can I watch the Pixel 6 event?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IINoCH"&gt;Google is hosting the event stream, for the general public and press alike, directly on the &lt;a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/"&gt;Pixel Event page&lt;/a&gt;. It will most certainly be a YouTube live video, so you can also set a reminder on the embedded video once it’s up. If available, we’ll also add the live video to the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpJsSY"&gt;You can rest assured that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be watching and reporting, and you can follow along on our live blog while you watch or if you’re unable to stream the video at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47Wvup"&gt;Other ways to keep up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="o0aRXA"&gt;Follow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge"&gt;@verge on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Edtfbj"&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/verge/"&gt;@verge on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Someone unboxed the Pixel 6 early and didn’t bother to turn it on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 color choices" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-XfVzGdHxQQaqtli3WLbugSjLuk=/0x22:3170x2135/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011701/pixel_6_phones.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Pixel 6 color choices | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auC0LN"&gt;Google’s upcoming phones have made early appearances in leaks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/14/20865699/pixel-4-xl-leaked-photos-camera-specs"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/3/17814936/google-pixel-3-xl-leak-found-in-lyft"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/3/18527905/pixel-3a-xl-best-buy-leak-6-inch-display-64gb-ram-specs-features"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/3/4691652/did-google-just-leak-the-nexus-5-kitkat-video"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/12/3493954/lg-nexus-4-full-review-leaked-ahead-of-announcement"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; again, so it’s really no surprise that someone seems to have obtained a retail-boxed Pixel 6 unit ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;the fall launch event tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iG6u53"&gt;In a video posted initially to TikTok, then deleted but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CristianDimboiu/status/1450058587091390469"&gt;still available on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for a few hours, @CristianDimboiu took a literal approach to unboxing by removing the “Sorta Seafoam” green device from its carrier without going any further. We didn’t see the screen turn on or see the screen at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dxeipT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google Pixel 6 - World First Unboxing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GooglePixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GooglePixel6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6Launch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6Launch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/0z6wttnVp7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0z6wttnVp7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris DB (@CristianDimboiu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CristianDimboiu/status/1450058587091390469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fd2ZyY"&gt;Fortunately, Google apparently ships its new phone upside down so that we could see the camera bar at the back with multiple lenses. It also appears that this phone ships with a cable and USB-C adapter but no charger, so hopefully, new owners will have one handy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1JoRQ"&gt;Now the video has been removed from Twitter as well. However, it was so short that it’s hard to say you missed anything of note unless you really wanted to hear K Camp’s TikTok hit, Lottery, playing at maximum volume. Check back here on Tuesday at 1PM ET / 10AM PT for Google’s launch event to get a much more thorough look at both Pixel 6 devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNmEWL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Google’s own preview&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the Pixel 6 Pro adds a telephoto lens to the mix, but more about the hardware performance, display characteristics, and software tweaks will have to wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cmdcuV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Pixel 6: what to expect from Google’s thoroughly pre-announced phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PFB3Oe"&gt;What we know so far about the Pixel 6 family, thanks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732322/pixel-6-pro-price-leak-us-eu"&gt;to retailer leaks over the weekend&lt;/a&gt;, is that pricing may have dropped compared to the Pixel 5. If information from Target is correct, then the 128GB Pixel 6 will go on sale for $599, while the 128GB Pixel 6 Pro costs $898.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66ECom"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 18th, 8:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted that the video has been removed from Twitter and TikTok.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="oOXIzj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;We’ve seen the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s decision to announce and thoroughly tease its new high-end flagship was revealing and confusing but, given all the leaks that followed, ultimately not that consequential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZL0jRM"&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro feature an all-new, in some cases, quite colorful design, with an in-display fingerprint sensor, Google’s new Tensor SoC, and the Titan M2 security chip. The standard Pixel 6 has a 90Hz 6.4-inch screen, while the Pro gets a 120Hz 6.7-inch, but the big difference might end up being the cameras. Both devices have new wide and ultrawide cameras, but the Pro comes with an additional 4x optical zoom periscope lens. You can see what they look like in the hands of real people in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129719782326274"&gt;this Twitter thread of leaked images&lt;/a&gt; from Evan Blass:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOH9Ng"&gt;But now that company is planning on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;launching its new phones on October 19th&lt;/a&gt;, you might be wondering: what could Google have left to share? If leaks are any indication, quite a few interesting things. We’ll be covering Google’s event live on Tuesday, but keep reading below for what to expect ahead of the Pixel 6 launch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ckQnWc66L7bV9d2osK3PMYdxPE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755089/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2tBUMk"&gt;Powerful new hardware, including upgraded cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rAJIdy"&gt;Google long held the crown for best smartphone camera on its Pixel line but slipped in the last few years in favor of what both Samsung and Apple brought to the table. A clear break from mid-range phones and mid-range specs to something decidedly on the high-end could be just the thing Google needs to retake its crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GffJx5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;Rumors and leaked store pages from Carphone Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; (viewable on the Wayback Machine &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211009124417/https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-river-content.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211009124928/https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-pro-river-content.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) suggest Google is sparing no expense in updating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;the cameras of the Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt;. Both versions of the Pixel 6 feature a 50MP main sensor — a big step up from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22674143/apple-iphone-13-pro-12-samsung-galaxy-pixel-android-comparison-specs"&gt;the iPhone 13 Pro’s 12MP camera&lt;/a&gt; — and a 12MP ultrawide. The Pixel 6 Pro also has an extra camera with 4x zoom with 48MP telephoto that can reach an even higher 20x zoom thanks to Google’s Super Res Zoom feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;it first added with the Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydITbR"&gt;On the front of the Pixel 6 Pro, the selfie camera can also be expected to feature a wide 94-degree field of view, not dissimilar from the wide-angle selfie camera on the Pixel 3. People love selfies, and the front camera is another clear place Google could shine since Apple decided to keep selfies the same on the iPhone 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5A6jmW"&gt;Surprisingly affordable pricing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="tq0Apa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732322/pixel-6-pro-price-leak-us-eu"&gt;Pricing leaks snagged from Target shelf tags and its internal system have arrived&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1449909532939804678"&gt;M. Brandon Lee&lt;/a&gt; and Evan Lei. They put the US starting price of 128GB Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro phones at $599 and $898, respectively. That’s cheaper than where the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; started last year ($699) and could help shake up the market for Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Pixel Stand, 30W charging brick, and clear Pixel 6 Case&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gvVvjU"&gt;Other tweaks are less visible. The battery in the Pixel 6 is expected to be improved and, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158452/google-pixel-december-feature-drop-features"&gt;with Extreme Battery Saver&lt;/a&gt; turned on, lasts for 48 hours on a single charge. The Pixel 6 Pro could also feature even faster charging, with the ability to hit 50 percent charge in 30 minutes, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/massive-leak-just-confirmed-ton-new-pixel-6-features"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. Helping make all of that happen is a new 30W charging brick (which won’t be included in the box) and&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714141/google-pixel-6-pro-marketing-images-leak-evleaks-wireless-charger-face-unlock"&gt; a new 23W Pixel Stand with active cooling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUOPIU"&gt;The same leaked Pixel 6 store pages also point to the use of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335252/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-drop-scratch-resistant-apple-samsung"&gt;Corning’s Gorilla Glass Victus&lt;/a&gt; for the glass on the new phones and a new clear case that could be perfect for showing off the multicolored varieties of Pixel 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tdnanj"&gt;Long-awaited software tricks like the Magic Eraser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Wjhqyq"&gt;Google can pack as much high-tech hardware into its phones as it wants, but the real trick is all the extra performance its software squeezes out of it. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro appear to have several software features that might do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cnm2I"&gt;First is Magic Eraser, which promises to “remove strangers and unwanted objects” with just a few taps in Google Photos. This actually appears to be a photo feature Google’s been working on for at least four years. The company introduced a similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15654476/google-photos-object-removal-feature-demo"&gt;obstruction-erasing feature in 2017&lt;/a&gt; by removing a fence from a photo of a baseball game. The fine print on the leaked store page is clear that Magic Eraser won’t work for every photo, but it certainly seems like it could be very impressive when it does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kB-ygslMZlThvd8jZgUONPvXhC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925206/Screenshot_2021_10_13_4.16.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211009124417/https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-river-content.html" target="_blank"&gt;Carphone Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446843190892453889?s=21" target="_blank"&gt;@evleaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motion Mode on the new Pixel 6 and 6 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="epasHb"&gt;Google’s two other software features mentioned in the same leaked store pages are opposites. Face Unblur attempts to deblur faces captured in motion-heavy photos (Google’s example is children playing). While Motion Mode “adds more action to action shots.” It’s not super clear what that entails, but Google’s photo example shows a blurry, clearly in-motion Ferris wheel with two subjects in focus standing in front of it — almost like long exposure background with a traditional photo foreground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQbbmU"&gt;Other software advancements include several varieties of on-device translation, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;Google’s mysteriously structured Tensor chip&lt;/a&gt;. The text from the Carphone Warehouse leak specifically calls out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ap6A2s"&gt;Get your chats translated in real time, listen to podcasts with translated captions and even use your camera to read signs in up to 55 languages. No Internet needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5vIJHc"&gt;Rumors point to fairly extensive software support for both versions of the Pixel 6, which means they could stay ahead of the pack as Google rolls out new features over time. So far, that looks like four major Android updates, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/13/pixel-6-android-updates/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and five years of security updates based on what &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; saw in those leaked store pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sVn4l7"&gt;The Google-y versions of an Apple One subscription&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wMCKbJ"&gt;What better to go with a bunch of new phone hardware and software than a nice all-in-one subscription package? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21433205/apple-one-subscription-bundle-price-music-tv-plus-arcade-icloud"&gt;Apple One was Apple’s version of the subscription bundle&lt;/a&gt; tying in services like Apple TV Plus, Apple Music, and extra iCloud storage. Now, it seems like Google might have something similar in mind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720374/google-pixel-pass-subscription-premium-services-bundle-extended-warranty"&gt;with a bundle called “Pixel Pass.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g49gvU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pixel Pass: This appears to be a blend of the iPhone upgrade plan where you can get a new phone every year and the Apple One Subscription.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains YouTube Premium, Google One, Play Pass, extended warranty, and is associated with Google Fi.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#pixel6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/teampixel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#teampixel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/iU7VTc16vS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iU7VTc16vS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— M. Brandon Lee | THIS IS TECH TODAY (@thisistechtoday) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1447248490321514500?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qlkSZt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1447248490321514500?s=20"&gt;A leaked document from Brandon Lee&lt;/a&gt; suggests Pixel Pass could combine up to four subscriptions: YouTube Premium or YouTube Music, Google One for extra storage and discounts, Play Pass for apps and games, and Google Fi. The bundle could also incorporate some kind of upgrade plan akin to Apple’s iPhone Upgrade program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6Mp7tu"&gt;A foldable Pixel &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jwYDcp"&gt;Last but not least, there’s a whole other Pixel device that Google could show off or at least tease at the launch of the Pixel 6 — a foldable codenamed “Passport.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90DkF5"&gt;In 2019, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535863/google-pixel-foldable-phone-prototype-samsung-galaxy-fold-io-2019"&gt;revealed it has prototyped foldable devices&lt;/a&gt; for years. The company has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18071720/google-android-foldables-fragmentation-displays"&gt;made modifications to Android&lt;/a&gt; over the years to better support devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697950/android-12-1-foldable-features-report-split-screen-multi-tasking-taskbar"&gt;and it has even more planned&lt;/a&gt;. It follows that Google might at least try its hand at making some kind of device to straddle the phone and tablet markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZR16F5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356760/foldable-google-pixel-q4-2021-leaked-internal-document-5-5a-4a-5g"&gt;An internal Google document leaked in 2020&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the company was targeting a 2021 release for the “Passport.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;Further reporting from &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this June claimed that Samsung had begun production on folding OLED displays for use in new devices from Google, Vivo, and Xiaomi. That could line up with a late 2021 release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbHhyI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 18th, 11:36AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added tweet thread from Evan Blass with pictures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s1StdY"&gt;The Pixel 6’s price could start at $599 with 128GB of storage, while the 128GB Pixel 6 Pro could start at $898, according to early US pricing at Target stores spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1449909532939804678"&gt;M. Brandon Lee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EvanLei1/status/1449875442953949184"&gt;Evan Lei&lt;/a&gt;. Lei posted a photo of pricing already displayed on Target’s shelves, while Lee has images of the retailer’s inventory system showing the same prices. A “street date” for both phones (aka their release dates) is listed as October 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfvImM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayOD9qDsSq0"&gt;Lee has previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the European starting prices of the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro will be €649 and €899 respectively, while &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1449810859807608836?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1449810859807608836%7Ctwgr%5Ehb_2_7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2021%2F10%2F17%2Fpixel-6-us-price%2F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s Roland Quandt&lt;/a&gt; has discovered Amazon UK listings that show the 128GB Pixel 6 Pro priced at £849, with a shipping date of November 1st. The Pixel 6 Pro with 256GB of storage could cost £100 more at £949.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6h2Dhq"&gt;If accurate, these prices are much more affordable than what we expected after Google said it was making an “ultra high end” smartphone in August. Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh even said that the new phone would “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;certainly be a premium-priced product&lt;/a&gt;,” which suggested pricing of over $1,000. Instead, these starting prices are cheaper than the midrange &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; that debuted for $699 last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqI3wS"&gt;Google is poised to announce its latest smartphones at an event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;taking place on Tuesday at 1PM ET / 10AM PT&lt;/a&gt;. The two phones will be Google’s first to run its own Tensor processor, and could support face-unlock, up to 23W wireless fast charging via a new Pixel Stand, and come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;five years of Android security updates&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>ZmBIZI’s $550 Z2 phone pays you for your data usage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HzIRy1GZvCR0i5xnYHyUYlIdLa0=/0x0:2522x1681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999652/image__1___1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZmBIZI Z2 is a the $550 4G phone that pays you for the personal data you share on your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HflYoT"&gt;We live so much of our lives on our smartphones these days that our mobile devices are just full of valuable data that we often unknowingly and freely give to all the major tech companies: our spending habits, our personal preferences, our locations, and much more. Since we can’t really live without our phones, and tech companies aren’t going to stop monetizing our data without a fight, we might as well get our cut of the data pie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ooKny"&gt;That’s the premise of ZmBIZI phones, the LA-based and minority-owned startup backed by the &lt;a href="https://streetcredcapital.com/portfolio-item/zmbizi/"&gt;fintech lender Street Cred Capital&lt;/a&gt; that is trying to make our phones work for us. Both its new phone, the Z2, and its proprietary software are designed to share the profit that your mobile data generate, back with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUyqmx"&gt;I spoke with ZmBIZI co-founder &lt;a href="https://www.gq.co.za/culture/entertainment/alpesh-patel-the-african-connection-16554524"&gt;Alpesh Patel&lt;/a&gt;, the former director of sales at Motorola in Africa and founder of Mi-Fone in Africa, who explained ZmBIZI’s ambitions on both the hardware and software fronts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoyxnN"&gt;ZmBIZI is putting its bets on its new $550 unlocked 4G phone, the Z2. It has a high-resolution, 6.67-inch Full HD+ LCD display (1080 x 2400 pixels; 20:9 aspect ratio), a MediaTek Helio P60 processor, 8GB RAM, and 128GB of storage. The version I saw through a Zoom video call has a glossy fuchsia back cover with transparent cut-outs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdwasm"&gt;Like many phones these days, the Z2 has multiple cameras on the back. It has a 64-megapixel rear camera, a 16-megapixel wide-angle, 5-megapixel macro, and a 0.3-megapixel photosensitive one. The Z2 is powered by a 4,400mAh battery, has a dual-SIM slot, but has no 3.5mm audio jack. According to &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/this-startups-flagship-smartphone-pays-you"&gt;PCMag’s research, this phone is likely a rebrand of Cubot X50&lt;/a&gt; with some tweaks. PCMag also notes that it will work best on AT&amp;amp;T’s network, will have limited coverage on T-Mobile, and is unlikely to work at all on Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mk4JnC"&gt;Most importantly, the Z2 can accept contactless payments through NFC, which means it can be used as a point-of-sale terminal for someone running a food truck without additional hardware, for example. This is actually the first phone &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210616005325/en/Visa-Launches-its-First-U.S.-Tap-to-Phone-Pilot-in-Washington-D.C.-to-Support-Region%E2%80%99s-Black-Owned-Small-Businesses"&gt;Visa has partnered with to pilot its Tap to Phone&lt;/a&gt; program in America. This means customers can just tap their existing forms of payment (card or Apple or Google Pay) rather than download a third-party app like Venmo to pay or use a card swiping dongle from Square. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OnR7PacRrSulpTnWKQ_A0q-pKEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22928858/ZmBIZI_Z2_back.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;ZmBIZI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZmBIZI Z2 has quad cameras on the back, with a 64-megapixel main camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S8fgQ4"&gt;The main selling point of this phone is that you can earn ZmBIZI Coins by using partnered apps or doing organic smartphone tasks on the Z2. It’s similar to using cash-back websites like Rakuten to shop, where you get money back by buying at their partnered retailers. Each ZmBIZI coin is equivalent to $0.01 USD, and when you’ve accumulated at least $20 USD, then you can move your coins onto a digital Visa debit card preloaded on the phone, which enables you to use that money in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Us7qjW"&gt;The website and press materials claim you can make an average of $10 per month from the Z2, but that number feels very optimistic. Patel explained the payment scheme this way: when you buy something with your credit card on your phone, the retailer will share a fraction of the 3.5-percentage processing fee with ZmBIZI, and ZmBIZI will share 1/5 of that amount, evenly divided by the number of its users. This is the amount you can expect. Perhaps other things you do on the phone, such as viewing ads, will offer bigger payouts, but it’s hard to tell over a short Zoom call with limited app demonstrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dww2f"&gt;Based on what I could see over Zoom and the company’s website, the Z2 homescreen has a circular launcher that ZmBIZI plans to serve custom ads to its users, so they can watch and get paid. This feature is more of a concept rather than a reality at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfnTlI"&gt;The Z2’s list of curated apps with rewards is long and often strange; you can see the complete list by hovering your mouse over different app icons on its &lt;a href="https://zmbizi.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. For example, you can get paid by doing something very simple, like using Yahoo Search rather than Google to search the web, because they have a paid partnership. There’s also an aptly named app called Earn Money, which gives you tasks like snap photos around your neighborhood and surveys to complete to earn your rewards. Perhaps you’d prefer the Smilecheck app, where “the more you smile, the more you get paid” — my guess is that you’d be feeding the AI valuable facial recognition information. It’s not clear whether each app will disclose how and where it will be using the information it collects about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbqIaS"&gt;Some of these coin-earning tasks are essentially asking you, the user, to allow yourself to become a data guinea pig, but I’m not sure the minimal reward will be worthwhile. I used to do &lt;a href="https://surveys.google.com/google-opinion-rewards/"&gt;Google’s Opinion Rewards surveys&lt;/a&gt; for fun until I got bored answering the same few questions, never redeemed my Google Play points, and have since lost track of my account. With the Z2, I guess even if you stop participating in the data collection, you’ll still be able to use the $550 Z2 as a fully functioning phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21FqN5"&gt;Who knows if the company will be able to realize its vision of paying its users for their data usage or if the startup will just fold. Back in 2017, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/7/14841604/freedompop-free-mobile-plan-android-smartphone-v7"&gt;FreedomPop V7 phone in Europe&lt;/a&gt; had promised a “free mobile plan for life,” but it offered such low data limits (200 megabytes) that made the company pivot its strategy again. Or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/21/22635779/ceo-saygus-smartphone-company-fraud"&gt;Saygus company&lt;/a&gt; that raised money in 2006 for a new phone that was never made and ended up defrauding investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0sYht"&gt;If you don’t mind taking a bet on ZmBIZI, you can pre-order the unlocked ZmBIZI Z2 directly from its &lt;a href="https://zmbizi.com/"&gt;website &lt;/a&gt;now (the phone should be available for sale by November 2021).&lt;/p&gt;
