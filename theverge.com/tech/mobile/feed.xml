    <title>The Balmuda Phone is a compact Android phone from a high-end toaster company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MKeX3hdAWiaNxxPC4GogvZITY8w=/0x0:3339x2226/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148021/7ABABA5A_D83B_498D_9F33_08E0C80D8CE5.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone has a 4.9-inch 16:9 1080p display.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6pt1nF"&gt;Japanese design company Balmuda today announced its first smartphone at a press event in Tokyo. The straightforwardly titled Balmuda Phone is the debut product from Balmuda Technologies, a new division of the company previously known for stylish, premium home appliances like air purifiers and rice cookers. Balmuda’s toaster in particular has a cult following in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqEM2i"&gt;As you’d expect, the Balmuda Phone is quite a bit different to other phones on the market. CEO Gen Terao said on stage that he felt that smartphones have gotten too big and unwieldy in recent years, so the Balmuda Phone was designed with compactness and elegance as the primary goals. It has a very sharp 4.9-inch 16:9 1080p display and is roughly comparable to a 4.7-inch iPhone SE; the display is slightly bigger and the phone is 2mm wider, but the smaller bezels mean it’s 15mm shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fN__psLPI6HAZ0JLLqx4FcYmkaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018299/913677DF_0F3E_4043_89E8_3AEDC7B09DF4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone is much thicker in the middle than on the edges.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P0QexY"&gt;The Balmuda Phone is a full 13mm thick at its thickest point, but the back panel tapers down heavily toward the edges. There’s a single large camera with a 48-megapixel sensor in the top right corner, and it’s mirrored by a fingerprint sensor in the top left. The 8-megapixel selfie camera is housed in a hole-punch cutout at the top right of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XHTgf"&gt;The phone’s specs are generally mid-range. The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 and there’s 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The battery is just 2,500mAh, which will hopefully be offset somewhat by the lower-power processor, though we’ll have to test for ourselves to see. The phone does thankfully have wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arA421"&gt;Where Balmuda is really differentiating itself is with design. It’s a well-worn tech writing cliche to say that something “feels good in the hand,” but that was clearly Balmuda’s intent here with the compact size and curved back that nestles into your palm like a pebble. I have big hands, granted, but I think just about anyone would find this more comfortable to use than the hefty 6-inch slabs most of us carry around these days. While the case is plastic, build quality feels solid and there’s a nice contrast between the textured back panel and the glossy edges. All in all it’s a cute, attractive object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2rl_ANrYzkkReSjuhmQ1rPu8ur0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018298/1C8A4701_958F_4569_B34D_2A9B396E407A.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone has a textured plastic back and comes in black or white.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9QdLYwVGs4Ir1fsShFoeNDs55Ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018304/IMG_0777.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Balmuda’s built-in calendar app, which syncs with Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fNb9Ee"&gt;The software, based on Android 11, is also very different to what you’d find on most Android phones today. There’s an interactive home screen with various elements of the wallpaper customizable for different shortcuts; for example, you could swipe on one of the lines to launch Google Maps. Horizontal swipes move you between some of the built-in software, like a calendar, a notes app, and a calculator. All of these had neat design touches, like the notes app’s visual timeline of photos and memos, or the calculator app’s built-in currency conversion and ability to handle large Japanese numbers that are counted in the 10,000s rather than the thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEkgcb"&gt;The Balmuda Phone will be available in Japan on contract with SoftBank later this month, and Balmuda is selling an unlocked model itself for 104,800 yen (about $920). That might sound like a lot for a compact Android 11 phone with these specs, but then $250 probably sounds like a lot for a toaster, too. In both cases, you’re paying for the design and the user experience rather than the bill of materials, and this clearly isn’t aimed at anyone who wants a conventional Android flagship. As someone who does own Balmuda’s toaster, I’m looking forward to finding out how well the phone holds up under general use — because much as I like the toaster, a smartphone is a lot more important to my life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile hits its goal of 200 million covered by ‘ultra capacity’ 5G a few weeks early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4CjWuAi_BscdAQlGVVu0NurvA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70145975/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtc5b9"&gt;T-Mobile has announced that its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Ft-mobiles-game-changing-ultra-capacity-5g-now-reaches-200-million-people-nationwide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F15%2F22783712%2Ft-mobile-5g-ultra-capacity-mmwave-200-million-coverage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Ultra Capacity” 5G network&lt;/a&gt; now covers over 200 million people in the US, a goal the company had previously set to reach before the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ihkFg"&gt;T-Mobile uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675255/tmobile-5g-uc-icon-iphone"&gt;its “Ultra Capacity” 5G label&lt;/a&gt; for its mid-band and mmWave networks, both of which offer much faster speeds than its low-band “5G Extended Range” network. The low-band network — which is closer to 4G LTE in actual speed — has an even wider reach, with T-Mobile boasting that it “covers 308 million people across 1.7 million square miles.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7bC9S5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MpcsZm"&gt;The rollout here is particularly notable given T-Mobile’s success with its mid-band network — &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fastest-mobile-networks-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; crowned the carrier&lt;/a&gt; as the fastest in 2021, largely due to the strength and coverage of its mid-band spectrum rollout. Meanwhile, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have seen their mid-spectrum efforts largely been put on pause: the two companies were planning on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;relying on C-band spectrum&lt;/a&gt; to shore up their mid-band coverage, but that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;rollout has been put on hold&lt;/a&gt; after FAA warnings that the networks could mess with radio-based safety systems on some planes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCxgKC"&gt;Of course, there’s a big difference between “covering” that many people and actually having them use T-Mobile, and despite the celebrations here, T-Mobile only actually gives service to just a fraction of those customers. At the end of 2020, the &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2021/T-Mobile-Adds-5.5-Million-Postpaid-Customers-in-2020--the-Most-in-Company-History--and-Further-Expands-5G-Network-Leadership-by-Exceeding-Ambitious-2020-5G-Goals/default.aspx"&gt;company had just over 100 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, which is still a far cry from the 200 million people that can now theoretically access its faster 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOmQmK"&gt;And just because T-Mobile’s 5G UC network has hit the milestone doesn’t mean that there’s still not a lot of work to do in building out its network further: thanks to concentrated population clusters in the US in major cities and dense urban areas, it’s comparatively easy to reach “big” coverage numbers. T-Mobile’s future rollout plans are expected to go much slower as a result, with the company hoping to reach 5G UC coverage for 300 million people over the next two years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Under-display cameras are slowly getting better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0KzxHaot5gReB6iNuMOFEtYRBUI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144165/UDC_v02.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VoB38H"&gt;As is often the case with new technology, under-display cameras didn’t make a great first impression. It’s a nice idea in theory, of course — you don’t need a notch or a hole-punch if you can put a selfie camera under the display — but the earliest efforts had some issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGn1Zb"&gt;ZTE’s Axon 20 last year was the first phone to ship with one, and it was bad. The camera quality was incredibly poor, and the area of the screen looked more distracting than a notch. Samsung followed up this year with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, which had similar issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Zlghiy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The world’s first under-display selfie camera isn’t very good","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="n8DWBZ"&gt;But things are actually getting better. Two newer phones on the market, Xiaomi’s Mix 4 and ZTE’s Axon 30, use a different approach to the technology, and it’s an improvement on the previous generation. Instead of having a lower resolution area of the screen that allows light through to the camera, they shrink the size of the pixels without reducing the number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUPvyE"&gt;This means that the part of the screen that covers the camera is really difficult to see in normal use. Look at how the Axon 30 compares to the Axon 20 on a white background, which was the most challenging situation for the older phone to disguise the camera in. It’s also much harder to make out than the camera on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PtU8R9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10865855"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hDMSTZ"&gt;Image quality from the camera is improved, too. Look at these selfies:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0SGA5EZ5oacEfndGn3D1Kscres=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015429/ztecomp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A selfie from ZTE’s Axon 20 on the left, and from the Axon 30 on the right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YH093A"&gt;Now, the camera is clearly still compromised compared to one that doesn’t have to gather light from behind a screen. ZTE and Xiaomi lean hard on algorithms for post-processing — you can tell because the live image preview looks much worse than the final picture. The results still look over-processed and unnatural, even if they’re more usable than their predecessors’. Video quality is also bad, because it’s probably too much to ask for these phones to do the processing in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ10Pg"&gt;Still, the pictures you get are definitely usable most of the time. If you’re not a big selfie person, or if you don’t use your phone for Zoom calls, I think you could get away with it. If those use cases are important to you, though, you should probably stick with a hole punch or a notch. Especially if you just don’t care about hole punches or notches, as I believe is the case for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBjkrc"&gt;There’s more to the idea than just reducing the size of your phone bezels, though. We spoke to Steven Bathiche from Microsoft’s Applied Sciences group on how the company is working on under-display cameras for an entirely different reason — so you can maintain eye contact while looking at your screen on video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEdVii"&gt;For that conversation, as well as more on how ZTE and Xiaomi’s phones work in practice, check out the video up top.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says a fix is coming for update that erased major Pixel 6 feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAZ-1KCcusee49erWj4-_sIKw1Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70135494/akrales_211022_4802_0839.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SX3YdU"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/135090859/magic-eraser-was-there-to-use-until-this-morning-now-gone-%F0%9F%A4%B7%E2%80%8D%E2%99%80%EF%B8%8F?hl=en"&gt;reports from some users&lt;/a&gt;, an update to Google Photos removed one of the Pixel 6’s big features: the Magic Eraser tool that lets you remove unwanted objects or people from your photos. If your Pixel downloaded the affected version (5.67, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-magically-erases-magic-eraser-latest-google-photos-update"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), fear not: Google says it’s working on a fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rj0Dcp"&gt;While the version of Photos with the Magic Eraser erased doesn’t appear to be available in the Play Store anymore, its &lt;a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/photos/"&gt;presence on APK Mirror&lt;/a&gt; confirms that it was at one point (though we wouldn’t recommend downloading it). According to one user, the broken version displayed a tip about the object removal feature, despite it no longer being accessible in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iaijh6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says a fix is coming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fSbyUs"&gt;Google spokesperson Alex Moriconi told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company “identified an issue early in the rollout of [its] latest Photos update and are providing a fix shortly.” Google also says that the issue didn’t affect everyone, which reflects our experience — two &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff with Pixel 6s said that they didn’t have any Google Photos updates available and that they were still able to use Magic Eraser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3viRbA"&gt;While it seems like the update is no longer spreading, it’s still understandable why the users that got it would be shocked to find Magic Eraser missing — it was one of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8YiEmekf_34?t=114"&gt;Google’s main selling points&lt;/a&gt; when it launched the phone around a month ago. Plus, the missing feature being designed to delete things adds dramatic irony, as &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;’s “Google magically erases Magic Eraser” headline pokes fun at. Given the relatively small number of posts about the issue, though, it hopefully won’t affect you too much. If it does, keep your eyes peeled for an update to Google Photos; help is apparently on the way. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rittenhouse trial judge still baffled by pinch-to-zoom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kyle Rittenhouse Trial Continues In Kenosha, WI" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ZRp1eJWDGDRsvDOEwxypppFmuQ=/472x487:4865x3416/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70135398/1236522232.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;nbsp;Judge Bruce Schroeder takes a moment to take a personal call as the court waits for and evidence video to be played as Kyle Rittenhouse, left, and his attorney Mark Richards look on at the Kenosha County Courthouse on November 12, 2021 in Kenosha, Wisconsin | Photo by Sean Krajacic-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="83Tq5c"&gt;The prosecution and defense continue to argue over evidence in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse for killing two people during a protest in Wisconsin, with a surprising amount of confusion from both the defense and Judge Bruce Schroeder about what happens when you pinch-to-zoom on a touchscreen device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLND8s"&gt;On Wednesday, Schroeder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775580/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-judge-apple-ai-pinch-to-zoom-footage-manipulation-claim"&gt;stated it was up to the prosecution to prove that zooming on a video in with an iPad&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t alter or manipulate the footage. “iPads, which are made by Apple, have artificial intelligence in them that allow things to be viewed through three-dimensions and logarithms,” the defense said as part of its objection, adding that the iPad “uses artificial intelligence, or their logarithms, to create what they believe is happening. So this isn’t actually enhanced video; this is Apple’s iPad programming creating what it thinks is there, not what necessarily is there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ru18F3"&gt;Judge Schroeder let the objection stand after giving prosecutors only 20 minutes to find an expert witness to explain how pinch-to-zoom on an iPad worked. (It should be noted, of course, that iPads do not have any “logarithms” that allow video to be viewed in three dimensions or “recreate” parts of an image that are not there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ODrit"&gt;During arguments over jury instructions &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-live-kyle-rittenhouse-lawyers-and-judge-discuss-jury-instructions-as-trial-for-kenosha-shooting-continues-day-9"&gt;broadcast live today&lt;/a&gt;, the judge went further, pulling out his own smartphone to demonstrate his continuing bafflement at pinch-to-zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyLxan"&gt;Specifically, the judge saves texts from his friends by taking screenshots and emailing them to himself. He showed one such screenshot to the courtroom today, noting that “some of them are pretty long” and “show up in my email like this, like a little ribbon,” so he zooms on them and “it’s just a blur.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="maNtzk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s just a blur”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r27KD2"&gt;According to the judge (talking to the prosecution), “You were talking the other day... about it’s just like a cellphone where you can expand a picture and make it bigger. But it’s not making it any bigger; it’s just a blur. Well, it’s not making it any bigger...it’s making it bigger, but it’s nothing but a blur.” He then questioned, “how that can be reliable... because it isn’t reliable for me and getting my messages on my phone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBcwBz"&gt;The prosecutor responded, “I think you’re taking the picture wrong on your phone. I’m not tech support, but...” The judge replied, “I’m not surprised,” prompting laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vaz2Yr"&gt;Let’s explain what’s going on here. Judge Schroeder appears to be using a Samsung Galaxy 20. That means he’s likely activating “scroll capture,” a Samsung screenshot feature that produces long images of an entire window — in this case, the entire text conversation. So those screenshots show up as long skinny images on his screen in order to fit. When he emails (or texts) that image to himself, the image is then &lt;em&gt;compressed&lt;/em&gt; to a smaller resolution and file size, so when he tries to zoom in on it, it’s blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aG4dmh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Judge Schroeder appears to be activating scroll capture on his Galaxy S20&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vNWu6O"&gt;None of this is useful evidence in support of the defense’s objection about iPad pinch-to-zoom. First of all, a Galaxy S20 runs Google’s Android operating system with various Samsung customizations, while the defense’s specific objections were about Apple’s “logarithms” on an iPad. So from the start, whatever a Samsung phone is doing is not relevant to an objection about how an Apple device works. Secondly, the defense’s objection is about those Apple logarithms &lt;em&gt;adding&lt;/em&gt; data to an image such that it can be viewed in three dimensions or recreate what is not there. Here, Judge Shroeder’s phone is plainly not adding any data to the image: it remains &lt;em&gt;blurry&lt;/em&gt;. If anything, his experience supports the &lt;em&gt;prosecution’s &lt;/em&gt;ability to zoom a video. But again: different software from different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U39FA9"&gt;The judge closed the conversation by failing to silence his phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces its next-gen RAM for phones and ‘the metaverse’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/is3lyUe0H97S94WbD186Da_Go2E=/0x42:2000x1375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118221/Samsung_LPDDR5X_DRAM_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FbCO0W"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-develops-industrys-first-lpddr5x-dram"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; its next-generation RAM tech made for mobile devices, which it says can be used in future smartphones but also in servers, cars, and “the metaverse.” While Samsung’s press release doesn’t mention how its new LPDDR5X RAM chips could help people enter the “digital reality,” the tech should help make devices run faster and last longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsHQxN"&gt;Putting the buzzwords like metaverse, AI, and 5G aside, Samsung is promising some real improvements to speed and power usage: it says its next-gen RAM will have 1.3-times faster processing speeds versus the previous-gen LPDDR5, will be capable of higher densities (up to 64GB per chip), and will use 20 percent less power than the last generation. Some of these improvements, according to Samsung, can be chalked up to the new 14nm process it’s using to create the chips. Also, for all the ribbing about the metaverse, lower-power draw and better performance could actually help with AR and VR headsets with onboard processors or phones that are driving those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="pBAd70"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10833239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ecLAES"&gt;Samsung didn’t immediately respond to a request for clarification about the improvements of the 14nm process versus its previous-gen RAM chips, which &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-begins-mass-production-of-16gb-lpddr5-dram-at-worlds-largest-semiconductor-line"&gt;it marketed as “10nm-class,”&lt;/a&gt; meaning &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-industrys-first-8gb-lpddr5-dram-for-5g-and-ai-powered-mobile-applications"&gt;that the process was between 10nm and 20nm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="temZrD"&gt;Samsung doesn’t say when its LPDDR5X RAM chips will be available to manufacturers (including Samsung’s phone division), but &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17058/samsung-announces-lpddr5x-at-85gbps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; has speculated&lt;/a&gt; that they’ll start showing up in devices around 2023. &lt;a href="https://overclock3d.net/reviews/cpu_mainboard/intel_12th_gen_ddr4_vs_ddr5_with_asus_z690_plus_tuf_gaming_d4/1"&gt;As with regular-power DDR5&lt;/a&gt;, which is making its way to desktop computers, it’s not likely that you’ll be able to immediately notice a massive generational leap between devices using LPDDR5 and LPDDR5X memory. However, it’s these kinds of improvements that help our devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749341/smartphones-future-predictions"&gt;get better and better with each generation&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s nice to see Samsung pushing one of the less exciting aspects of a phone’s performance forward — even if it’s using vague promises about the metaverse to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Netflix is getting into video games&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="5hhtFz"&gt;Netflix is making a big push into video games. The company first dabbled in games with interactive titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152973/netflix-carmen-sandiego-interactive-special-black-mirror-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carmen Sandiego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; game, but in 2021, it made gaming a much bigger priority. Netflix hired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;a former EA exec&lt;/a&gt; in July to lead its gaming efforts and, in November, let people play a selection of mobile games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772480/netflix-games-apple-iphone-ipad-ios-subscription-app-store"&gt;free&lt;/a&gt; as part of their subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Spaces try to make it easier to get apps ready for augmented reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CghtZ3dT3JKa7tCMdJUSd8FH9HI=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116410/Snapdragon_Spaces_Lifestyle_Asset.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JsfwNW"&gt;While a lot of talk about the metaverse has focused on virtual reality experiences that use a VR headset to put people in digital environments, other approaches use augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (XR) to blend digital and physical elements. Today at the Augmented World Expo, Qualcomm &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/11/09/snapdragon-spaces-xr-developer-platform-launches-create-headworn-ar"&gt;is revealing its Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform&lt;/a&gt;, a kit that will help devs expand existing apps and create new ones to take advantage of AR devices you wear on your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpSJR1"&gt;Today’s announcement doesn’t include mention of new hardware, however, Qualcomm is lining up some important partners for the mixed reality future that it’s been planning for the last decade. They include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22768925/niantic-lightship-developer-platform-john-hanke-pokemon-go"&gt;Niantic and its recently revealed Lightship platform&lt;/a&gt; for “real-world metaverse apps,” as well as hardware OEMs including Lenovo, Motorola, Oppo, and Xiaomi. Lenovo’s ThinkReality A3 glasses, based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296100/qualcomm-xr1-smart-viewer-ar-glasses-announce-lenovo-thinkreality-a3"&gt;Qualcomm’s XR1 Smart Viewer reference design&lt;/a&gt;, will be the first to “commercialize” Snapdragon Spaces next year. T-Mobile is the “lead 5G launch partner” and will work with startups and developers via its existing &lt;a href="http://t-mobileaccelerator.com/"&gt;T-Mobile Accelerator program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHzAdeIyVMqJ76T2uTLBw-dJuhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998297/qualcomm_snapdragon_spaces.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="krxMUo"&gt;Snapdragon Spaces is intended to underpin an “open” and “cross device” ecosystem, with APIs that are hardware agnostic so the software developers create can run on many different types of platforms, including AR glasses or full AR headsets that look more like Microsoft’s HoloLens. According to Qualcomm, this is “the first headworn AR platform optimized for AR Glasses tethered to smartphones with an OpenXR conformant runtime.” It also has support for the familiar developer tools Unreal Engine 4 and Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0C6LG"&gt;It’s available now to “select” developers like Holo One and NZXT. Access for everyone is coming early next year, complete with tools for hand tracking, image recognition and tracking, positional tracking, and the like. Qualcomm also announced it has acquired assets from HINS SAS and its subsidiary, Clay AIR, for hand tracking and gesture recognition, while a partnership with Wikitude will open up access for that AR development platform’s 150,000 registered developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5IXa5"&gt;As 5G becomes widely available on more mobile devices (many of which are powered by Qualcomm hardware), the idea is that AR as a second screen feature for apps will also be ubiquitous. That includes AR tracks overlaying your living room for an Anki Drive-like experience or a floating smartwatch UI that only you can see. There are already augmented reality experiences available for mobile devices that can help you shop for furniture and visualize it inside your living space, but this platform is supposed to make those easier to build from scratch, port them from one platform to another, and get them ready for use in upcoming headsets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This $252 Nokia X100 is a budget 5G phone with a 1080p display and 6GB RAM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iuo3ZS4_YPvZib4d0za9eKlQdNE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116059/nokia_x100_product_photo__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia X100 is a T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile exclusive budge 5G phone.&lt;/em&gt; | HMD Global&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6K8CXr"&gt;Starting November 19th, 2021, T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile will be adding another budget 5G phone to the lineup — the $252 Nokia X100 that is exclusive to T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLQUYX"&gt;This addition is coming just as the holiday shopping season is ready for kickoff, and T-Mobile’s sales of other budget 5G phones from REVVL and certain OnePlus models have been limited by handset shortages, according to Wave7 Research’s September 2021 Smartphone Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIZwuq"&gt;Nokia is doing its part to jump-start sales by packing the X100 with lots of surprising features, despite its small sub-$300 price tag. While it shares similar looks and the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22760873/nokia-g50-review-mobile-5g-sub6hz-android-smartphone"&gt;$300 Nokia G50&lt;/a&gt;, that’s where their similarities end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDd0HT"&gt;Unlike the G50, the X100 is geared for entertainment. It has a 6.67-inch 1080p full HD display (1080 x 2400p resolution), with a 20:9 aspect ratio that is a little wider to better fit full-screen videos. It has 6GB of RAM to support its processor, 128GB of internal storage, as well as a microSD card slot that can accept up to a 1TB card for backup and extra storage. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a4069TCDv9dDJEAbUwGVTcz_6Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22996850/Nokia_X100_Lifestyle_Photo__6_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia X100 has quad rear cameras, including a 2-megapixel Macro camera for closeups and extreme details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S8PTBp"&gt;The cheaper Nokia X100 also has four cameras on the back: a 48-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide camera, a 2-megapixel depth camera, as well as a 2-megapixel Macro camera for extreme closeups and details. It also has a 16-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kda8v6"&gt;Out of the box, the X100 uses Android 11, but it’s unclear if and when this model will get future OS or security updates from the carrier or manufacturer. It’s worth noting this Nokia doesn’t have the biggest battery at 4,470mAh, especially in combination with its high-resolution screen and 5G connectivity. However, it still has a 3.5mm audio jack for wired headphone fans, as well as NFC to handle contactless payments. As a 5G phone, the X100 is compatible with T-Mobile’s slower but more widely available sub-6Hz 5G network, in case you need 5G speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhd4QQ"&gt;You can find the Nokia X100 at T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile stores starting on November 19th for $252. Keep your eyes peeled for extra carrier holiday deals to sweeten the Nokia X100 even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpHTAE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwywxv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y477jU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yes, your Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro can be MagSafe-friendly with this Moment case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vhnDp0sypwlk5vjmT5IbaSogRzA=/403x490:5654x3991/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102491/Moment_Pixel6_mforce_magsafe_1126.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moment has a whole ecosystem of accessories that will now work with the Pixel 6, thanks to its new M(force) case.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Moment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EJACZV"&gt;Your dangerously slippery Pixel 6 or 6 Pro just arrived, and you’re scrambling to find an available case that will protect your new baby. Whether you are a MagSafe-curious Pixel owner or recently ditched your iPhone for the Pixel but have some MagSafe accessories you don’t want to waste, Moment’s (M)Force case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro could be the bridge to more platform agnostic mobile accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ei1Rb"&gt;As a mobile accessory maker, Moment embraces the idea that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22417836/moment-magsafe-iphone-camera-accessories-review-price-features-specs"&gt;ecosystem of lenses and mounts for content creators&lt;/a&gt; should be compatible with different phone brands and models. After all, each case is compatible with Moment’s catalog of accessories that shares the same mount design — just like the way camera lenses work with various camera bodies. This is not the first time that Moment has made a cross-platform case: earlier this year, the company released some &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fgalaxy-thin-case-m-force%2FS21-ultra-5g-black&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22753313%2Fpixel-6-magsafe-pro-moment-mforce-case-mobile-accessories-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe-compatible cases for the Samsung Galaxy S21s&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbZ6dn"&gt;According to Alec Ploof who is in charge of partnerships at Moment, the thought process to make its cases compatible with MagSafe was simple: “We included our proprietary M(Force) magnets into all of the Moment cases we made for iPhone 11, 12, &amp;amp; 13, so we figured to also include them in our new Pixel 6 or Samsung S21 cases to also make these devices compatible with our MagSafe mounting products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vhyFs7Qe1cZa8SVGtGPrPpxDu1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989736/P6_Pro_3_Front.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moment’s case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro with (M)Force has an array of 36 magnets that help MagSafe accessories attach to the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhwhAroeCg3z1lFRPrR2c79fBtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989743/P6_Pro_1_Back.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike Moment’s other cases which feature wood or canvas panels, the (M)Force case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro is made of textured polycarbonate and TPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JqOnHi"&gt;Unlike Moment’s previous cases that feature wood and canvas panels, there is just one case design for both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s case with (M)Force. It’s all black and made of a textured and a “grippy material” called high-strength polycarbonate and TPU. Its three-layer exterior should protect your Pixel 6 from up to six-foot drops and even has a provision for a wrist strap (sold separately). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mB1209"&gt;On the inside is a layer of premium microfiber liner that wraps around your Pixel 6 or 6 Pro, as well as an array of 36 of Moment’s proprietary (M)Force magnets. Those magnets are equivalent to about 15lbs of force, so your MagSafe accessory should be able to attach easily yet securely to your Pixel. &lt;/p&gt;

Just don’t expect to get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;15W fast charging from Apple’s official MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
