    <title>Smaller Pixel 6 leaks with flat screen and fewer cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dWmKknsp9GG8QoIu3cza5DLzSH8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69321632/PIXEL_6_5K3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jw8QBm"&gt;Yesterday &lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt; released CAD renders of what is supposedly Google’s next flagship phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446078/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-specs-camera-screen"&gt;the Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and now the noted leaker has followed up with details and images of the smaller model, &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-6-renders-design-exclusive/"&gt;posted at &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The so-called Pixel 6 looks like it’ll adopt the same distinctive design as the Pro, with one colorway featuring orange and white sections broken up by a glossy black bar that houses the camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27MzEy"&gt;You’ll find one fewer camera in that bump, according to the leak — it’s said to be a dual-camera setup, presumably a regular wide and an ultrawide. The 6 Pro, on the other hand, appears to include a periscope telephoto lens. Both phones are depicted with a single centrally aligned hole-punch selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wKCqlx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 6.4-inch display without curved edges&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="On1SQc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt; says that the Pixel 6 has a 6.4-inch display with flat edges, unlike the curved 6.67-inch panel used in the 6 Pro. The 6 reportedly also has wireless charging, an in-display fingerprint sensor, and bottom-firing stereo speakers, with dimensions of 158.6mm x 74.8mm x 8.9mm. The &lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt; renders match up with designs shown off by &lt;em&gt;Front Page Tech&lt;/em&gt;’s Jon Prosser &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzupAfbY8a4"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2e31s"&gt;There’s no word on exactly when the Pixel 6 will launch, but Pixel phones do have a habit of leaking (or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18663172/google-pixel-4-camera-sensor-design-official-photo"&gt;being announced by Google&lt;/a&gt;) well before their eventual release date, so we could well be waiting until fall. At this point, it’s almost a surprise that leakers managed to beat Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352032/google-pixel-5-4a-5g-price-release-date-specs"&gt;to the punch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWRPbb"&gt;Google has also said it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;planning to release a Pixel 5A phone&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6 Pro could have a curved screen and a triple rear camera, new leak suggests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9E-SsriP6IB3EtdUWxmBEjxESQ8=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319100/PIXEL_6_PRO_5K3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newly leaked renders suggest that Google isn’t playing it safe anymore with its next generation of Pixel devices.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnLeaks and digit.in&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aYaYqP"&gt;New images from reputable leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/onleaks"&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.digit.in/news/mobile-phones/exclusive-google-pixel-6-pro-rednders-leak-display-design-camera-59483.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;digit.in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) show what may be a bold step forward for Google’s Pixel series. The Pixel 6 Pro, as pictured in the alleged renders, could offer a 6.67-inch curved display and a rear triple-camera array — a Pixel first — including a periscope-style telephoto lens. OnLeaks later followed up via &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt; with supposed renders of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447011/google-pixel-6-leaks-renders-pics-specs"&gt;smaller Pixel 6 phone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0Zh5G"&gt;This report also says that the 6 Pro will use an OLED screen, though there’s no confirmation of refresh rate, and will measure around 163.9 x 75.8 x 8.9mm. It’s expected to offer dual speakers and support wireless charging — features that are both available on the Pixel 5. There are some obvious differences in design, too, with the camera array moved to a raised, horizontal stripe across the back of the device and a bright accent color on the panel above it. There’s no confirmation with this leak whether the 6 Pro will include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364543/google-pixel-6-custom-in-house-processor-gs101-whitechapel-arm-report"&gt;rumored, Google-designed “Whitechapel” SoC&lt;/a&gt; (system on a chip).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UC-GcKR-HRuFxfKOQmvNX-DYtno=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528954/PIXEL_6_PRO_5K1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnLeaks and digit.in&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Renders show a rear triple-camera array including a periscope telephoto lens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MhZnlx"&gt;The naming shift from “XL” to “Pro” could also indicate a new relationship between the standard and big-screen models. In previous generations (the Pixel 5 never got an XL counterpart), the XL model was a “same phone, bigger screen” affair. Ditching that moniker for “Pro” could indicate that it’s both a bigger and higher-end device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTkQGB"&gt;Google has taken a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;conservative approach recently&lt;/a&gt; to its Pixel hardware and design. This hasn’t been an entirely bad thing, and it’s earned Google’s handsets a reputation for simple, affordable design with great cameras and software. But if these renders are the real deal, then the company appears to be making a move to challenge other flagships with higher-end hardware. For now, there’s no confirmed release date for the Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro, but we’d expect Google to stick with its typical fall timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoiiaR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, May 21st, 4.30AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a link to the later story on the smaller Pixel 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lofelt’s new haptics framework is ready to bring good vibrations to Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Qualcomm Lofelt" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owHO1DVBrVcpvFHKo7sgIRSPo2o=/69x0:807x492/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310907/0_66eU5_KB84vIXV7A.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lofelt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="htfuLm"&gt;Haptic feedback on Android phones is usually terrible, at least compared to devices that have Apple’s Taptic Engine. You know it, I know it, and a haptics company called Lofelt apparently knows it, too. Today, though, Lofelt, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297285/qualcomm-lofelt-haptics-vibration-snapdragon-888-api-software"&gt;partnership with Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, announced that it’s making its VTX haptic framework available to OEMs, with the hope that these manufacturers will start putting better haptics into more Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeMuxB"&gt;The framework will allow OEMs to utilize high-definition haptic vibration on phones running the latest Snapdragon 8-series and 7-series without any hardware tweaks. The system is “tightly integrated with Snapdragon and fully validated by Qualcomm,” according to Lofelt. While the framework is technically compatible with older phones that have a Snapdragon 7-series and 8-series chipset, it’s at the discretion of each OEM whether to add support. It seems more likely that companies will make the big effort to implement improved haptics in upcoming phones than adding it to older models. As for which newer models will feature the framework, none have been announced yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eNU9eK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VTX comes with “no performance trade-offs,” says Lofelt&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xsR6Fl"&gt;Ahead of this announcement, I got to actually feel the difference myself that Lofelt’s improved haptics can make on a phone through software tweaks only. The company sent over a custom Google Pixel 4 packed with demos that show off how its vibrations feel compared to the stock Android implementation (the same setup can’t be duplicated on other devices). Compared to phones designed to take full advantage of Lofelt VTX’s integration with the chipset, this Pixel 4 was running the haptics tricks through the application layer as a proof of concept. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m54Hgt2LU3SXibxUiEMAat33Vzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522947/lofelttoggle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lofelt’s app let me feel the difference between stock Android vibrations and the company’s own — and the difference was noticeable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2vih4G"&gt;Each of the demos featured a toggle that lets you switch between the stock Android vibration and Lofelt’s refined haptics, as shown in the bottom right of the picture above. One instance ran through a few scenarios in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;. The vibrations varied in strength and duration depending on the kind of gun being shot, and I was able to feel distinct pulsations of a helicopter soaring through the sky. A demo for &lt;em&gt;Asphalt 9: Legends&lt;/em&gt; let me feel the roar of an engine through haptics, as well as the fast, crunchy pulsing of the vibration motor when the car ran over a dirt median. Even though the Pixel 4 and earlier models don’t natively support VTX, these demos were far more expressive than standard Android phone vibrations. If you’re someone who takes mobile gaming seriously, to the point of owning something like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Razer Kishi controller&lt;/a&gt;, haptics could make your favorite games feel more immersive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPUkDo"&gt;The big challenge for Lofelt isn’t in proving that these sorts of immersive haptic experiences are worth building (give the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lofelt-studio/id1482238306"&gt;Lofelt Studio app for iOS&lt;/a&gt; a try if you need convincing yourself). The real work is ensuring that as many phones as possible can eventually get them, and that it won’t take too much effort for developers. That’s where Lofelt’s AX (adaptive experience) signal processing tech built into VTX comes into play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0AHjL"&gt;According to Lofelt, AX converts a universal haptic signal into vibrations that play to the strengths of each individual phone, taking into consideration its haptics driver, actuator hardware, and control algorithms from the manufacturer. The goal is for Android devices to catch up to Apple’s excellent Taptic Engine that’s in modern iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d67vsXP1TXxgnEht8c6zjiSlNZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21955672/akrales_201012_4137_0103.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Older phones with the Snapdragon 7-series and 8-series can be updated as OEMs see fit, but you’ll likely find better haptics in new phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LNUdA2"&gt;App and game developers can design advanced haptics using Lofelt Studio, which integrates with Unity, Unreal, and Xcode, and create a universal .haptic file that works across multiple devices. According to Lofelt, these files contain “universal parameters, such as whether the haptics should include smooth, continuous signals or more punchy, dynamic events.” In other words, you’ll only need to build it once, then the framework can deliver a consistent experience across different phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bERQJA"&gt;Existing games and apps running on supported Snapdragon hardware won’t be left in the dust. Lofelt claims that framework will also be able to convert the audio stream coming from an app into vibrations in real time without any hardware or coding modifications. So, you won’t necessarily need to wait for every developer to create bespoke haptics in order to start feeling some tactile enhancements with apps you already know and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3gtcJ"&gt;Lofelt says that its VTX framework comes with no performance trade-offs, and that it aims to deliver better haptics “while minimizing the impact on battery and actuator.” That sounds great, and the demo I tried feels ready for deployment. But now, the wait begins for some phone manufacturers to kickstart what could be a big, positive change for Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G chipset will put premium features in midrange phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpeqS7-xZs5K93r7a7GER8zE018=/0x0:895x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310906/Under_Embargo___Snapdragon_778G_Press_Note_Final_11__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qualcomm’s 700-series Snapdragon chipsets are popular among midrange and premium midrange phone manufacturers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dHT4li"&gt;Qualcomm has announced a new 700-series chipset for mobile devices: the Snapdragon 778G 5G. It will start appearing in premium midrange phones from manufacturers including Motorola, Xiaomi, Realme, Honor, Oppo, and iQOO in the next few months, bringing with it some video capture and AI capabilities borrowed from the Snapdragon 888, the current chipset of choice for flagship Android phones. The company has also made a couple of other announcements today designed to get 5G connectivity into more tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mhwNy"&gt;The Snapdragon 778G offers three image-signal processors, or ISPs — a feature Qualcomm touted in its flagship 888 chipset, and also appears in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350079/qualcomm-snapdragon-780g-888-5g-mobile-chipset-phone-android"&gt;higher-end 780G&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it possible to capture photos and video from three different cameras at once. You can easily switch between different cameras’ video feeds during recording ala &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/sg/support/mobile-devices/control-your-shots-with-directors-view-on-galaxy-s21-series/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s director view&lt;/a&gt; on the Snapdragon 888-powered S21 series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgzGLZ"&gt;The processor also supports cameras with staggered HDR sensors like the 50-megapixel chip in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; for better HDR video recording. The 778G also includes some improvements for more GPU-efficient mobile gaming, and things like better noise suppression and camera experiences on video calls. Both mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G are supported, as well as Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PGoBr"&gt;In “more 5G in more places” news, Qualcomm is also making M.2 reference designs available for current OEM customers of its X65 and X62 5G modems. This makes it easier for laptop, desktop, gaming, and IoT manufacturers to incorporate 5G connectivity into their products. The company is also debuting a new X65 5G modem, which Qualcomm says is more energy efficient and offers wider support of mmWave frequencies. It will start appearing in commercial mobile devices later this year, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 public beta is now available: here’s how to install it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rhzGfRd8tVHG9KHkxSRLx4kT19U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69307041/vpavic_210517_4586_0027.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo composite by Amelia Holowaty Krales and Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SGc5DS"&gt;Google unveiled Android 12 at its opening &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432922/google-io-2021-rumors-news-announcements"&gt;I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt;  keynote, and now you can try the new update yourself as part of the first public beta. The Android 12 public beta is currently available for Google’s Pixel phones (Pixel 3 and up) and will also come to devices from OnePlus, Lenovo, Asus, Oppo, Realme, Sharp, Tecno, TCL, Vivo, Xiaomi, and ZTE. You can enroll your Pixel phone on &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;Google’s Android beta site&lt;/a&gt; or find specific instructions for other supported phones on &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;the Android Developers page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blkQBw"&gt;Android 12 brings a cornucopia of new features, but the most exciting are the new visuals. Along with new animations, widgets, and a modified lock screen, Android 12 also offers theming, with the ability to change the colors used across the OS just by changing your wallpaper. Not all of the dramatic visual changes will be available in this first beta, but they should roll out over time as we get closer to release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3nlq1"&gt;Google is tweaking other aspects of the Android experience as well, like notifications and quick settings. It’s also making some improvements to privacy and security, with indicators for when your phone’s camera or microphones are in use, and easier access to all of your apps’ various permissions in one dashboard. For a more in-depth look at Android 12, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22203818"&gt;check out our full preview&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pqo2S3"&gt;How to install the Android 12 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DcweJw"&gt;The process of how you get Android 12 beta on your phone ranges from requiring just a few clicks to something more involved. For this beta download, it’s considerably easier to get the it on one of the supported Google Pixel phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nukaT"&gt;For a Pixel, begin by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;visiting the Android 12 beta site to enroll your phone in the beta&lt;/a&gt;. You should be able to find your phone listed when you click “View your eligible devices.” After you enroll your device, you might be nudged via a notification on your phone that the software is ready to install. If you want to check manually, open the settings menu on your phone, then head to System &amp;gt; System Update. Tap “Check for update” to see if you can download the new software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5turHD"&gt;If nothing happens right away, your only option is to keep waiting. In the past, I’ve gotten the beta update on my phone within minutes of enrolling, though sometimes it takes hours. It may take over 24 hours for the software to be ready to install on your phone, so hang tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feWDkB"&gt;As for supported phones from other brands like OnePlus, Realme, Sharp, and others, &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;follow the instructions on each page&lt;/a&gt; from Google’s list of eligible phones, as the process for installation seems to differ depending on the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The BlackBerry keyboard lives on in this new Android phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVzzJYtocOfElCkblMsP62xwykE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304306/IMG_20210518_162259.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EuW3H4"&gt;Even though the iPhone arrived as a harbinger of doom for phones with physical keyboards well over a decade ago, the fanatical enthusiasm for BlackBerry isn’t something that just goes away completely. People loved their BlackBerry keyboards, and their relative efficiency when compared to touchscreens wasn’t really the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nApvQN"&gt;Still, the niche gets tinier by the year, and it falls on similarly tiny companies to serve it. Now we have the Titan Pocket, a new Android phone launching today &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/titan-pocket-the-smallest-qwerty-android-11-smartphone"&gt;on Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; from Unihertz, which previously released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332385/jelly-2-phone-size-screen-kickstarter-price-specs-features"&gt;miniature Jelly phones&lt;/a&gt; and, more pertinently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20826305/unihertz-titan-phone-keyboard-hands-on-kickstarter-specs-price-features"&gt;another BlackBerry-esque device called the Titan&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDQl9C"&gt;The Titan was like a rugged take on the BlackBerry Passport, which was a weird phone even for BlackBerry fans. Its sibling, the Pocket, keeps the rugged style but comes in much more manageable dimensions — Unihertz says the size has been reduced by 31 percent. The 3.1-inch LCD screen is actually a little smaller than a BlackBerry Classic’s, though it has a similar resolution at 716 x 720, which makes for a fairly sharp pixel density of 328 ppi.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XBpKRDDFEQI2oCJ2f11S3ryzRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522380/IMG_20210518_162324.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Titan Pocket is a lot more rugged than the average BlackBerry.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BgELwz"&gt;Obviously, you can’t fit all that much content on a screen like this. The Gmail app only shows three emails at once, for example. But if you’re longing for the days of firing out email blasts on your Blackberry, well, the Titan Pocket shows about as much of your message as any other smartphone would when bringing up a touchscreen keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0u9iY"&gt;I was never a BlackBerry addict myself, so those who were may feel differently, but I think the Titan Pocket’s keyboard is pretty good. I’m way faster on a touchscreen, of course, but the keys are responsive and easy to distinguish, and the backlighting looks much better than it did on the bigger Titan. The Pocket delivers on its promise of a satisfyingly tactile typing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Z7Cd2n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tUh5H6"&gt;Beyond the keyboard, the Pocket runs a basically stock version of Android 11 that hasn’t been customized much for its form factor. You can set some basic functions, but it’s not as deeply integrated as what BlackBerry users were used to. By default, pressing or holding down a letter key on the home screen just starts typing in a Google search. (This would be a useful feature if not for the fact that the cursor appears in the search bar behind the first letter you typed, making it essentially useless since you’ll have to fix a typo on every single search.) There’s also an option to use the keyboard’s touch-sensitive surface for scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCAPwV"&gt;As with the larger Titan, you’ll find many examples of how Android apps don’t really know how to deal with square screens. Games are mostly out, and fullscreen video usually only plays on its side. (Then again, I suppose the BlackBerry Bold wasn’t exactly an incredible entertainment device itself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fY84pp"&gt;Accordingly, the Titan Pocket is not a powerful phone. It has a MediaTek P70 processor, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage; you’ll sometimes see some lag when scrolling through Twitter and so on, but generally performance seems adequate for the kind of thing you’ll be doing on a phone like this. Other features include a microSD card slot, an IR blaster, and a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJSbGO"&gt;The standout spec is the 4,000mAh battery, which is no doubt helped by the sturdy, 16.8mm-thick design and should give the phone some pretty serious endurance considering the small screen and low-power processor. This phone’s vibe is decidedly less C-suite than an actual BlackBerry, but if you need to send emails while hiking, it could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEF6k_lvl3malWN2WedCaY8DLfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522379/ptp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Titan Pocket doesn’t do a great job with moving subjects or low-light conditions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7UlRgl"&gt;As long as you don’t also need to take stunning photos on the hike, that is, because the Titan Pocket’s single 16-megapixel camera predictably isn’t very good. It should do a reasonable job in bright conditions, like just about anything else, but the square-by-default results aren’t great for low light or moving subjects. Like my dog most of the time, as you can see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DcPZb"&gt;But hey, this is a niche device at a pretty low price. Its camera might be worse than most other phones out there, but its physical keyboard is better than all other phones out there by virtue of existing at all. Its &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/titan-pocket-the-smallest-qwerty-android-11-smartphone"&gt;Kickstarter early-bird pricing&lt;/a&gt; started at $159 but is now set at $219, which still makes it a potentially viable option as a second device despite its obvious limitations. (The official MSRP is $299.) Unihertz has a good record shipping crowdfunded phones, and while this one doesn’t do much for me personally, I can imagine it might for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzb36b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11.10AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The article has been updated based on further information from the Kickstarter campaign.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Display is showing off new foldable tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTk_hAE5ag1ZXNCS4g7AKUWtiz0=/0x15:820x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300675/foldable_concept.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s display division is working on a bi-folding OLED panel suitable for folding phones.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8J1SSe"&gt;This year has seen no shortage of rollable display demos from manufacturers, and now Samsung Display is the latest company to show off new concepts for folding and sliding screens. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsungs-new-foldable-and-udc-panels-reveal-an-exciting-future/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt; the concepts being showcased as part of a virtual Display Week exhibition (if you forgot to mail out your Happy Display Week cards, there’s still time since it &lt;a href="http://www.displayweek.org/"&gt;runs through Friday&lt;/a&gt;) including a “multi-foldable” mobile display and a large 17-inch folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRlPZr"&gt;The company calls its first concept S-foldable, with a bi-fold design that opens up to a maximum screen size of 7.2 inches. It’s similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; except, well, plus one fold. There’s also a sliding mobile display similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;ill-fated rollable concept&lt;/a&gt; LG showed off earlier this year before leaving the smartphone space altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BQ1emc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10505033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8S0EHO"&gt;Samsung Display is also showing two concepts for bigger panels, including a 17-inch foldable OLED that’s tablet-sized when folded and can function as a monitor when unfolded. Finally, there’s a more traditional-looking laptop display; it doesn’t fold or flex, but it does include an under-display camera — hopefully it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;better than the last one&lt;/a&gt; we used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prKcyC"&gt;Samsung Display is a division of Samsung Electronics, and it produces OLED panels for use by Samsung and other consumer tech manufacturers. So while these concepts may end up in future Samsung products, it’s certainly not guaranteed. The company as a whole hasn’t been shy about embracing foldable technology, getting into the foldable device market early. It may have more company soon; display OEM TCL has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;shown off its own concepts&lt;/a&gt; and says it will bring one to market this year. Until then, we’ll be watching and filling out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"&gt;foldable concept&lt;/a&gt; bingo cards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sharp’s new flagship phone has a giant 1-inch camera sensor and Leica branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tr6IWS0pnW4PQD5469hI0pVApoo=/0x0:2090x1393/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297483/sharp.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dP3AC6"&gt;It appears that Leica has found a new mobile camera partner, following Huawei’s sanctions-induced retreat from the international smartphone market. Sharp just announced the &lt;a href="https://jp.sharp/k-tai/aquos-r6/"&gt;Aquos R6&lt;/a&gt; in Japan, and its Leica-branded lens sits in front of what is now the largest camera sensor on any phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxTt8t"&gt;The 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor is similar in specs to what you’d find in Sony’s high-end RX100 compact cameras. It’s only the second 1-inch sensor ever to make its way into a smartphone, and the first to make its way into a phone from an traditional phone manufacturer — Panasonic released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6151671/panasonic-leica-cm1-android-cameraphone"&gt;Android-powered CM1 back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t exactly a mainstream device. The closest any current phone gets to a 1-inch sensor is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Xiaomi’s new Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, which has a 1/1.12-inch component behind the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="waAUWN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Only one rear camera, but it’s a big one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nQ5jK0"&gt;The f/1.9 “Summicron” lens is also much wider than on other phones’ primary cameras, with an equivalent focal length of 19mm — that’s in ultrawide territory. Oddly, it’s the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; outward-facing camera on the R6, so you’ll need to use digital zoom for more conventional focal lengths. The camera bump also houses an LED flash and a time-of-flight sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OGUE0"&gt;The Aquos R6’s other big feature is its display, which Sharp calls a Pro IGZO OLED. It’s a 6.6-inch 2,730 x 1,260 panel with a peak brightness of 2,000 nits and a variable refresh rate of 1 to 240Hz. Most Android phones to date haven’t been able to offer OLED displays with truly variable refresh rates that adapt to content in real time — this panel sounds like the most advanced available on any phone right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L183Uj"&gt;Elsewhere the R6’s specs are standard for a 2021 flagship: a Snapdragon 888, 12GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 5,000mAh battery. It’ll go on sale in June in Japan through carriers NTT Docomo and SoftBank. Pricing isn’t yet available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is reportedly in talks to merge its media business with Discovery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lEIbzCpdGrzvXV40hGeiICItzxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69295421/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vlDm8s"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery are in talks that would combine AT&amp;amp;T’s media business with Discovery’s reality-TV dynasty to create a massive new entertainment entity, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/at-t-is-said-in-talks-to-combine-content-assets-with-discovery-kor6r2uj?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources. &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-05-16/why-att-is-spinning-off-hbo-cnn-warner-media-discovery"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; corroborated the story&lt;/a&gt;, noting that “many Warner Media executives were stunned by the news.” Neither company confirmed the deal, but if it came to pass, the combined company would be a potentially significant competitor for streaming brands like Netflix and Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gm5ih"&gt;But as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, AT&amp;amp;T only recently added some major entertainment brands to its portfolio when it &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-m-a-at-t/att-closes-85-billion-deal-for-time-warner-idUSKBN1JA36U"&gt;acquired Time Warner for $85 billion&lt;/a&gt;, a deal that was finalized in 2018. And while AT&amp;amp;T’s streaming channel HBO Max has performed relatively well since its somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21268490/hbo-max-launch-price-warnermedia-att-dc-harry-potter-friends-disney-netflix-peacock"&gt;messy launch last May&lt;/a&gt;, it’s still not quite as robust as older streamers like Netflix. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212963/new-discovery-plus-streaming-channel-roku-hbo-peacock"&gt;Discovery launched its own streaming platform&lt;/a&gt; Discovery Plus, which launched with shows spun off from its Discovery Channel catalog, including a new &lt;em&gt;House Hunters&lt;/em&gt; series and new series from the creators of &lt;em&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUuVmy"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s WarnerMedia unit owns cable channels CNN, HBO, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and the Warner Bros. movie studio. Discovery’s offerings include cable networks HGTV, Food Network, and TLC. But as more people migrate away from traditional cable TV and to streaming options, most media companies are trying to find new ways to reach audiences.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODc2pC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s sources indicated a deal could be announced as early as this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ib44Au"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Sunday May 16th, 9:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added mention of the LA Times’ corroborating report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="shKhfk"&gt;As part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; forces developers to ask permission for something they used to be able to do for free: track iOS users. Today, Twitter is joining the ranks of other developers and adding a prompt that asks users to enable tracking on iOS (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/14/twitter-app-tracking-transparency-support/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJ2nR0"&gt;Twitter’s main justification for listening to its request is straightforward — having the feature enabled allows it to serve “better” ads. The company includes a link to settings so you can make those changes, but read Twitter’s explanation before you decide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZXbtIX"&gt;Keep ads relevant to you by allowing Twitter to track data from other companies on this device, like apps you use and websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gEzkzL"&gt;The company also includes a link to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/about-ios-tracking"&gt;a support post&lt;/a&gt; in the Twitter help center which explains why it has to ask for permission, includes a link to its current App Privacy Policy, and goes over what enabling or disabling tracking does in iOS. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bHoO3K"&gt;It’s a surprisingly low-key attempt to get users to allow Twitter to track them, considering the company highlighted Apple’s addition of App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14.5 as a potential risk in its recent &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1'21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;earnings statement (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KRFfUZ"&gt;We continue to expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021, assuming the global pandemic continues to improve and that we see modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14.5. How much faster will depend on various factors, including our execution on our direct response roadmap and macroeconomic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2fOfnN"&gt;Facebook and Instagram took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking"&gt;a far more aggressive approach&lt;/a&gt; to convince users its use of ad tracking is on the up-and-up — even going as far as including a vague threat that enabling tracking will “help keep Facebook/Instagram free of charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syShzs"&gt;Companies like Twitter and Facebook rely on tracking users to support their separate, often very lucrative ad businesses. After all, it’s usually ad sales that pay for free social networks,  and customer data helps to target those ads. As a company that’s more interested in selling hardware and subscription services, Apple doesn’t really have to worry about things like that, but brash changes like the new tracking permissions can leave developers scrambling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8Qksg"&gt;App Tracking Transparency has proven popular, though — around &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/"&gt;96 percent of US users&lt;/a&gt; are opting out of tracking according to some recent surveys. And with Google considering developing its own methods for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266823/google-anti-tracking-feature-android-privacy-apple-ios-app-tracking-transparency"&gt;blocking tracking on Android&lt;/a&gt;, we might just have to get used to apps coming to us and begging for free data.&lt;/p&gt;
