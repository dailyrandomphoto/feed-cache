    <title>Samsung will now let you design your own Galaxy Z Flip 3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WL7XQtHCaY8XIag1QldWSLZCWlg=/105x0:1151x697/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020323/60aaea24_159d_4298_8796_f8918ffa9918.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="leuHcQ"&gt;Samsung released the Galaxy Z Flip 3 in August, but if none of the colorways were exactly what you wanted, the company will let you make your own design with the new Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition. The new phone was announced at the company’s Unpacked Part 2 event on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mkvx8"&gt;You won’t be able to customize the Bespoke Edition with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; color you want, but Samsung is offering a lot of options. You’ll be able to choose a black or silver phone frame and front and back colors (aka the top and bottom, if the phone is open) of blue, yellow, pink, white, or black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wNONt"&gt;If you get tired of your color combination, you’ll be able to make a slight change down the line by swapping out the colors on the back glass panel of the phone for a fee with the Bespoke Upgrade Care service. Samsung says the panel costs vary but start at $79, and that the service will be available starting in November. And no matter what, you’ll have to have some black on the phone because of the cover screen, so you might want to keep that in mind as you’re designing your color combo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5ZiDL"&gt;We asked if Samsung might bring this level of customizability to future phones, and it sounds like that might be on the table, based on a statement from the company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9hTW4t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the past year, Samsung has committed to openness – a dedication to create technologies that help our users eliminate boundaries in their lives. We believe technology should reflect each customers’ individuality and Mobile devices are everyday technologies that users spend the most time with. We wanted customers to use them as self-expression tools in and out too. Starting with the Galaxy Z Flip3 Bespoke Edition, Samsung is expanding this initiative to other devices moving forward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3mZwVt"&gt;If you’re interested in a Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition, you’ll be able to make one on Samsung’s website starting Wednesday. You’ll have to pay a premium for the customizability, though, because the Bespoke Edition costs $1,099, which is $100 more than the base model phone. And you won’t just be able to personalize the Z Flip 3; Samsung is also launching the Galaxy Watch 4 Bespoke Studio so you can tailor a Galaxy Watch 4 to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo reportedly developing own chips for flagship phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FRZORTnZ9nDo2ASDfyNolvOwtAg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018964/DSCF7705.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XUEALA"&gt;Oppo is developing its own high-end chips for flagship mobile phones, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/China-s-Oppo-joins-race-to-develop-own-smartphone-chips"&gt;according to a report in &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Two people who spoke to the newspaper said that the plan was to release custom SoCs in 2023 or 2024 “depending on the speed of development.” Oppo reportedly wants to use TSMC’s advanced 3nm process technology for the chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBVSiO"&gt;If plans come to pass, Oppo would be the latest major smartphone manufacturer to take control of its own SoC design. Yesterday Google launched the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, its first phones with a custom SoC called Tensor. Apple and Samsung also design their own smartphone chips, as did Huawei before US sanctions decimated its mobile business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Z7C5N1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vXhS7y"&gt;Oppo currently uses chips from Qualcomm and MediaTek, like all other Chinese smartphone vendors since the crackdown on Huawei. Xiaomi designed and released a low-end SoC called the Surge S1 for its budget Mi 5C phone in 2017, but since then its chip design efforts have been limited to secondary components like image signal processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYRst8"&gt;As Qualcomm laid bare in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728062/qualcomm-pixel-6-google-tensor-snapdragon-meme"&gt;salty Google subtweet&lt;/a&gt; last week, it would stand to lose out if major companies like Oppo were to take on SoC design themselves. Oppo is the fourth largest smartphone maker in the world by shipments, according to IDC, and given it shares a supply chain and ownership with Vivo, Realme and OnePlus, Oppo-developed chips could quickly find their way into phones from multiple brands.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Google Store is open again, and Pixel 6 delivery dates are all over the place</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TZ71o4Xo9Rmu-WcQclHf8CadVHE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016823/bfarsace_211014_4802_0044.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DqywpW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734748/google-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;Pre-orders for Google’s new line of phones&lt;/a&gt; started at the same time as their launch event, but for most of us, trying to buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; has meant seeing nothing but error screens. Some unsteadiness is to be expected given the sudden demand, but at 1PM ET, the doors opened, and Google’s store seemed to fall flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGyn0z"&gt;As of 5:40PM ET, Google says the store is operational again, and many of us have been able to put orders through. According to a spokesperson, “The Google Store was temporarily down but is now back up. We apologize for the inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zzX7D"&gt;However, as &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/19/pixel-6-shipping-date-flux/#more-461552"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out, being able to submit an order is only part of it. Availability of different devices and projected delivery dates have continued to move around, with little consistency about what’s available and when it might show up at your front door. Some people are reporting delivery dates stretching into 2022 for the Pixel 6 Pro, while others have been able to secure orders scheduled to arrive in early November.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-VTM8N_HuEMKwCMJ5jQfb8z0u5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939534/google_store.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="feOHQ5"&gt;Since then, things have improved, but more than an hour later, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisPirillo/status/1450522739442262018"&gt;most of us&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1450527567593758721"&gt;only seeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1450507803504881666"&gt;one error code after another&lt;/a&gt;. If you can get through, you can select to use the new Pixel Pass or add on a 30W phone charger. The fast wireless charging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22732918/google-pixel-stand-23w-wireless-charging"&gt;Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt;, however, says it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmY7tH"&gt;A quick scan of social media revealed that some people were able to complete purchases for the new Pixel 6 in the first hour or two they were available. For the rest of us, at least we’ve had time to learn patience while searching for a PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch OLED, RTX 3090, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727969/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-price-release-date"&gt;Xbox Series X refrigerator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jyKvTA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 19th, 5:55PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the store is functional again, and added a statement from a Google spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spec showdown: Google’s new Pixel 6 vs. Samsung, Apple, and more</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gqqDWH"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;its fall event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, Google announced the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, which feature its custom Tensor processor and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;the first big camera upgrade for Google’s phones&lt;/a&gt; since the Pixel 3. Since the Pixel 6s are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734748/google-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;available to preorder now&lt;/a&gt;, let’s take a look at how Google’s new phones compare on paper to their Android and iPhone competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8OO9p"&gt;At this point, how Google’s Tensor custom chip will perform is the biggest question mark — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; it’s comparable to the Snapdragon 888, but that’s not even Qualcomm’s most powerful chip today, and Qualcomm is &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-tech-summit"&gt;holding an event in November&lt;/a&gt;, potentially to show off &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-tech-summit"&gt;even newer chips&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, though, as we’re working on putting the Tensor through its paces to see how it performs in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhC82S"&gt;With that in mind, let’s see how the mid-range Pixel 6 compares to some of its competitors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TW6y6Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10816344"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DtgE2c"&gt;Observant readers may have noticed that Samsung’s due to refresh its mainstream Galaxy S lineup in a few months. While that’s perhaps not a concern for someone looking to buy a phone &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, it’s something worth keeping in mind if you’re willing to wait a bit for an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HXPiol"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung could bring the heat in a few months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S6XKUN"&gt;Today, though, the Pixel 6 is less expensive than its competitors and would physically tower over most of them. It’s actually bumping up against the &lt;em&gt;iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/em&gt; in terms of dimensions, which is great news if you like big phones — and not so great if you prefer more compact ones, like the original Pixel or iPhone Mini. While the Pixel 6’s battery is no slouch capacity-wise, it is a bit curious that Google didn’t choose to make it bigger. Though again — the phone starts at $599, so there’s only so much complaining you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFvWPR"&gt;Let’s move on from the mid-range phones and take a look at the higher-end offerings from Google, Apple, and Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3uzdo8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10816311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aMP0f9"&gt;As with the regular Pixel 6, the Pro’s price does it a lot of favors, especially when many of its competitors are playing in the $1,000-and-up range. We’re also seeing Google join the megapixel race that’s been kicked off among Android phone manufacturers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;finally ditching the 12MP sensor that’s been featured on Pixels for so long&lt;/a&gt; (though we’ll have to test them out to see how the images actually look). The Pixel 6 Pro also has a top-tier amount of RAM for multi-taskers, and its battery is nothing to sneeze at either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Of3Wgw"&gt;Overall, it’s a phone that checks a lot of the boxes for a flagship Android phone — it has mmWave 5G, a 120Hz 1440p display, and promising camera specs. As always, though, stay tuned for the full review to find out if the Pixel 6 Pro is equal to (or, dare I hope, better than) the sum of its parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnAUXB"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Pixel 6 and the Pro or are currently rocking a lower-end Pixel and are wondering if it’s time for an upgrade, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22724481/google-pixel-6-pro-specs-comparison-price"&gt;check out our Pixel comparison article here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat says the Pixel 6 is ‘the fastest phone to make a Snap’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Quick Tap to Snap feature" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pG5ug9t9h16_IfC8jQ_0YMV0Cq4=/0x47:1112x788/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016898/snapchat_quick_tap_snap.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EwgD1Q"&gt;At today’s Pixel event, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;Google &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;dove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt; into the details about the Pixel 6 series devices&lt;/a&gt; and outlined a brand new feature that will make sending Snaps even faster. The new feature, called Quick Tap to Snap, adds a camera-only version of Snapchat directly to the lock screen of the Pixel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vo7NeY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Us   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snapchat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6&lt;/a&gt; is the fastest phone to make a Snap thanks to Quick Tap to Snap!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And check out Pixel lenses and other exclusive features too!&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6Launch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6Launch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/94trIxzHzk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/94trIxzHzk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Made By Google (@madebygoogle) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1450516328763232261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EWTrw3"&gt;To access it, all you have to do is tap the back of your phone twice, and the Snapchat camera will open. From there, you can snap a picture all without unlocking your device — you’ll only have to authenticate your identity when you go to send the Snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Obcgex"&gt;In addition to Quick Tap to Snap, Google is also working on exclusive augmented reality Lenses, as well as incorporating live translation into Snapchat. This means that users will be able to have their conversations translated in real-time while using the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1Y6qN"&gt;Google’s partnership with Snapchat doesn’t come as much of a surprise, considering that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/15/5106950/google-snapchat-4-billion-buyout-rumor"&gt;Google actually attempted to buy Snapchat in the past&lt;/a&gt;. Now that Snapchat is sort of built into the Pixel, Google might see that as a small victory. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The biggest announcements from Google’s Pixel 6 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gdcUY04juykf3dUZuLQ_fPyEcas=/152x0:1768x1077/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016892/lcimg_e5568f90_70f5_4d74_938b_5d1c34060e11.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B3AjPT"&gt;Google just wrapped up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733532/google-pixel-6-pro-event-live-blog"&gt;its Pixel 6 Fall Launch event&lt;/a&gt;, where it announced two new phones as well as a wealth of features that are supported by its new Tensor processor. Here are the biggest things Google announced during its live stream.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qYkC6nm2kiiK0khVjc2DFmxtpp8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755114/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AEQ0zz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google finally shows off the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i7vkhn"&gt;After months of leaks, we got the full details on Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro phones — the Pixel 6 will sell for $599 and the Pixel 6 Pro for $899. Both will feature Google’s Tensor processor and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;a 50-megapixel camera&lt;/a&gt; (which bins images down to 12.5-megapixels during processing). The phones also feature an ultra-wide camera, and the Pro adds a telephoto camera and gives the selfie camera an upgrade with a wider lens and higher-resolution sensor. The Pro model is also physically larger, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;it’s not a massive difference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IaquUxERUcc8HTWAYqEYbuZ_yU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939252/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_1.08.09_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H0EQpd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;Google’s new phones are powered by its Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NrRCfR"&gt;Much of Google’s event focused on the Google-designed Tensor processor that powers the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Google showed off how the machine learning prowess of its chip would be able to help with tasks like voice recognition, making photos less blurry (and even automatically erasing unwanted people from the background), and real-time captions and translation. Outside of ML, Google says that it should be competitive with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon processors when it comes to overall CPU and GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WedQNW"&gt;Google also emphasized how the Tensor could help its phones be more personalized to you but didn’t go into much detail on how exactly that would work. Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;we have our hands on the new phones&lt;/a&gt;, so we’ll be able to poke around at them. Speaking of those phones...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IjF24v"&gt;Google showed off the results of its camera inclusivity work with Real Tone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6F6T72"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442515/google-camera-app-inclusive-image-equity-skintones"&gt;At Google I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Google announced it was working on making its cameras and photo processing better for people with darker skin, and today, we got to see some of those results. Google’s Real Tone tech, which will work both in its camera app and third-party ones, will try to accurately depict people’s skin tones instead of doing weird things with exposure and contrast like old phones used to do. Google’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WNarpiGz3Kk?t=2775"&gt;before-and-after presentation&lt;/a&gt; was impressive, but we’ll have to see how it actually performs in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Pixel tap to Snap" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FcX26u6qXSONrM0yotcIULtTH9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939407/google_pixel_tap_snap.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The fastest phone to make a Snap”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QwUH07"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22499034"&gt;Snapchat gets a special place on the Pixel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qtFb6N"&gt;You’ll be able to quickly access Snapchat’s camera by tapping the back of the Pixel, even from the lock screen. Of course, you’ll have to log into the phone to actually send the Snap to your friends, but it’s quite possibly the quickest way to send a Snap that we’ve seen yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rzqJfm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22498413"&gt;Google’s trying to make phone trees suck less&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="na3Wsr"&gt;Google announced a new Pixel phone feature, which aims to make calls to customer service lines less awful by trying to estimate how long you’ll have to wait on hold and giving you a written list of the phone tree options, so you don’t have to go “wait, what number do I press for this again?” Google’s also expanding its feature that lets you have your phone wait on hold for you to more countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="qxpSs0"&gt;Google didn’t announce it during the event itself, but it’s also launched Pixel Pass alongside the new phones. Pixel Pass lets you bundle a phone (and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/7528518?hl=en"&gt;Google’s Preferred Care repair plan&lt;/a&gt;), cloud storage, YouTube Premium, and Google Play Pass, all in one monthly payment. Google’s charging $45 per month for the plan with a Pixel 6 and $55 a month for the Pixel 6 Pro plan. According to the company, you’ll end up paying off your phone over the course of two years, and if you cancel Pixel Pass, you’ll have to pay off the remaining balance on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIfpRT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-pixel-pass/?_ga=2.47950050.454935072.1634662818-63996501.1634662818"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; that subscribers to Google Fi, its cellular plan, will get $5 off their monthly bill for subscribing to Pixel Pass. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the Pixel 6 compares to the Pixel 6 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h-JP5RqG0K2_Zvw2q3b_1-Pbu8Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016830/bfarsace_211014_4802_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sote5c"&gt;There’s a lot that we already knew about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; ahead of their debut at Google’s October 2021 event. Some of the key specs, including the Tensor processor and the camera details, were made publicly available by Google itself. But of course, we know a lot more now than we did before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dv7Xm"&gt;Check out my colleague Dan Seifert’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;big hands-on with both phones right here&lt;/a&gt;. It dives into the design, features, and he talks about how this is a big moment both for Google to prove that its Tensor processor is as good as it claims to be and that it knows how to make flagship phones that people want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j9ykUg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oOL3J0"&gt;If all that you’re curious about is raw specs, we’ve got that below. Given that the design differences between the Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6 are minor, we’re focused instead on what’s inside of them. There are just a couple of differences internally, but you deserve to know what they are. To be exhaustive, we’ve also compared them to other Pixel phones that you can easily buy these days, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xmqcf3"&gt;We’ll add more specs to this table should they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro can make calling customer service less nightmarish </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gs1QKAOmO5TSMA0PEHlfoM2cQWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016597/bfarsace_211014_4802_0052.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CYT4Y2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; is Google’s first phone with a custom-designed SoC, and the appeal of the Tensor chip isn’t in raw power, it’s what the combination of hardware and software can do. Speech and image processing that happens on device are great for Google Assistant or improving photographs, but a feature many owners will appreciate at launch is &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/phone-app-updates/"&gt;an improved Phone app that’s built to manage annoying calls to customer service lines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6gNLDId5wrMsjhGLKvfOZCCUXlk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939435/Dialer_P6_Marketing_Wait_Times.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jdw4RD"&gt;According to Google, the app can tell you the current hold time for a business’s 1-800 number before you even dial, as well as the projected wait times for later in the day or week. These projections are “inferred from call length data that is not linked to user identifier.” Google didn’t get more specific, but it sounds similar to Google Maps monitoring traffic flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuOtOq"&gt;Direct My Call is a feature built for anyone who has ever forgotten the list of choices by the time an automated message is reading off the third one. It presents the options and their associated numbers right on the screen, so that you don’t have to listen to the entire spiel again just because you were distracted for a moment. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0h0y8RKFdaqkQosjY8SA78MsAHQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939410/pixel_call.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yovcCJ"&gt;Meanwhile, the Google Duplex-powered Hold for Me feature is expanding to Pixel owners in Australia, Canada, and Japan soon. Google will also prompt users to share information about businesses that call using numbers not already in its directory, with the intent to eventually share that information to other people who receive calls from those businesses. That could add some information to businesses that simply use multiple numbers... or give you a heads-up that a bill collector is on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeLJO9"&gt;It’s not clear whether these features will always be Pixel-exclusive, or if they’ll be available on older Pixel models.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Pixel Stand supports up to 23W wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jO_jzzIrG-FNLvO9ldwBzDr5CW0=/181x0:1260x719/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016546/screenshot.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Pixel Stand wireless charger.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BzztjI"&gt;Google revealed a new second-generation Pixel Stand wireless charger on Tuesday. The new charger offers charging speeds of up to 23W with “compatible Pixel phones” and up to 15W with other Qi-certified devices. To keep the stand cool while it’s charging at those higher speeds, the new Pixel Stand has a “nearly silent built-in fan,” which could be similar to the fans inside recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22335032/oneplus-9-pro-fast-wireless-charging"&gt;chargers&lt;/a&gt;. We haven’t used the stand ourselves, though, so we’ll have to wait and see if the fan is as quiet as Google claims it will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03ia0t"&gt;Like Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17941176/google-pixel-stand-wireless-charger-announcement-price-release-date"&gt;first Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt;, the second-generation version is designed to let your phone sit in portrait mode. That could make it easier to keep up with texts and notifications as they come in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPPvhL"&gt;The new Pixel Stand will cost $79, though the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen?hl=en-US"&gt;charger’s Google Store page&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t give a specific release date. You can’t order it yet, though Google says it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szJ03U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22497573"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel 6 event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6’s Tensor processor promises to put Google’s machine learning smarts in your pocket</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRnhH4F6TRpJmtwSmpP9JVm15HM=/0x4:1304x873/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016540/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_1.08.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lkwHn1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are officially here&lt;/a&gt;, and with them, the debut of Google’s new Tensor chip. Google has finally revealed more information on what the new SoC can actually do, for the fastest Pixel phones ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tFw24"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;initial reveal&lt;/a&gt; of the Pixel 6 and the Tensor chip was largely centered on its AI-focused TPU (Tensor processing unit) and how the custom hardware would help Google differentiate itself from competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjpSJ9"&gt;That’s still the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-google-tensor/"&gt;big focus of Google’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; today: the company calls Tensor a “milestone for machine learning” that was co-designed alongside Google Research to allow it to easily translate AI and machine learning advances into actual consumer products. For example, Google says that the Tensor chip will have “the most accurate Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)” that it’s offered, for both quick Google Assistant queries and longer audio tasks like live captions or the Recorder app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ry5Dmf"&gt;Tensor also enables new Pixel 6 features like Motion Mode, more accurate face detection, and live translations that can convert text to a different language as quickly as you can type it. Google also says that the Tensor chip will handle dedicated machine learning tasks with far more power efficiency than previous Pixel phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gpvg7L"&gt;But there’s a lot more to a smartphone chip than its AI chops, and with the reveal of the Pixel 6, we finally have more details on the &lt;em&gt;rest &lt;/em&gt;of the chip, including the CPU, GPU, modem, and the major components that make Tensor tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lTFKze"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s Tensor chip is only the first step toward truly great Pixel phones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609924/pixel-6-google-tensor-soc-chip-cpu-gpu-samsung-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPA2FORP_FDIJPtCcyA4M3rZw44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939258/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_1.10.47_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Joi0va"&gt;As rumored, the Tensor chip uses a unique combination of CPU cores. There’s the custom TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) for AI, two high-power Cortex-X1 cores, two midrange (rumored to be older Cortex-A76 cores), and then four low power efficiency cores (likely Arm’s usual Cortex-55 designs). Graphics are offered by a 20-core GPU, in addition to a context hub that powers ambient experiences like the always-on display, a private computer core, and a new Titan M2 chip for security. There’s also a dedicated image processing core to help with the Pixel’s hallmark photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rIv2O"&gt;It’s not entirely clear why Google would choose to use the Cortex-A76 cores instead of the more modern Cortex-A78 (which are both more powerful and more power efficient). But it is worth noting that the &lt;a href="https://nanoreview.net/en/soc/qualcomm-snapdragon-765g"&gt;Pixel 5’s Snapdragon 765G&lt;/a&gt; also used two Cortex-A76 cores for its main CPU cores, so it’s possible Google is sticking with what it knows. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6VEpDSX5ZyjsCkTpKEst72BmF8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939331/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_1.25.43_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S6Ce3G"&gt;The new phones should still be the fastest Pixel phones yet, with Google promising 80 percent faster CPU performance compared to the Pixel 5, and 370 percent faster GPU performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2I9uV"&gt;The real question, though, is how the Pixel 6 and its Tensor chip hold up compared to other traditional Android flagships. Google’s CPU configuration is a unique one, compared to the more traditional four high-performance and four efficiency cores used by major Qualcomm and Samsung chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nHipu"&gt;In theory, Google is offering double the number of X1 performance cores — the most powerful Arm design — than the Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100, which both use a single &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;Cortex-X1, three Cortex-A78, and four Cortex-A55&lt;/a&gt; cores. But Google is also swapping out the two high-end cores with midrange ones, which may help battery life and performance... or may just result in a weaker overall device. We’ll find out soon once we’ve had the chance to put the Pixel 6 and Tensor through their paces. &lt;/p&gt;
