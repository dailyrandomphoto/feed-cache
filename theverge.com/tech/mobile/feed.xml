    <title>Verizon is pausing its 3G shutdown indefinitely</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yc-MECnplWZx7mqEH4gntj_KZC8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623912/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQDhUA"&gt;Verizon is indefinitely delaying the shutdown of its 3G network, pushing back the original plan for the network to shutter at the end of 2020 to an as-yet-undetermined point in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VjPhE"&gt;The news comes from Verizon spokesperson Kevin King, who &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ossbss/verizon-indefinitely-delays-3g-network-shutdown/d/d-id/766399?_mc=RSS_LR_EDT"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Our 3G network is operational and we don’t have a plan to shut it down at this time. We’ll work with customers to move them to newer technology.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qLqyX"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;, Verizon previously announced that it planned to shutter the 3G network at the end of 2020, which was already a delay. (The company originally intended to close the network at the end of 2019.) Now, it seems that Verizon is once again punting that decision down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKZsQA"&gt;The interesting part of this decision is that Verizon is making it solely for customers who are still using their existing 3G devices. The company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsupport%2Fknowledge-base-218813%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F5%2F22215453%2Fverizon-3g-shutdown-paused-delay-network-old-phones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;no longer allows&lt;/a&gt; customers to activate new 3G phones on its network (as of 2018), nor does it offer prepaid 3G service (as of 2019). Obviously, Verizon would prefer that its customers upgrade to new 4G LTE — or, at this point, 5G — plans (presumably with new phones that they’ll buy through the carrier). But the repeated delays in shutting down the 3G network seem to suggest that the transition isn’t going as fast as the company would like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OhRse"&gt;Verizon isn’t the only network working to move customers off of its legacy 3G network. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;recently advised&lt;/a&gt; its customers using 3G phones that it plans to shut down its 3G network sometime in early 2022, while T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21336397/t-mobile-require-support-volte-2021-5g-lte"&gt;reportedly looking&lt;/a&gt; to make voice over LTE (VoLTE) a requirement early this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple patents point to using your MacBook to wirelessly charge your iPhone and Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/euw_dZeUrJ1Mf86nWNmC3Rx8HtQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623907/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8wxBfg"&gt;Apple has been granted two patents that describe adding two-way wireless charging to its devices (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/05/macbook-wirelessly-charging/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The patents, first &lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2021/01/apple-has-been-granted-a-pair-of-2-way-charging-patents-for-a-future-macbook-pro-that-could-recharge-idevices-and-more.html"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Patently Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, include drawings that show a MacBook charging various devices, including an iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, as well as drawings of iPads and iPhones doing the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzIN8M"&gt;If this sounds familiar, it’s because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21353196/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-price-release-date-camera-stylus-specs"&gt;many other phone makers&lt;/a&gt; have released devices with similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/3/21548318/google-pixel-5-wireless-charging-pad-qi-automatic-battery-share"&gt;reverse wireless charging technology&lt;/a&gt;. Although Apple’s take is a little different. According to the patent images, a MacBook’s lid, palm rest, or trackpad could be used to charge a wireless charging-compatible iOS device. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e3fZqL9Bx3Qcb2pcKVmaX8Zpjw8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215615/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_10.24.55_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The patent shows a future MacBook device charging an iPhone and Apple Watch, though this configuration would make it tricky to use the computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mHiKgL"&gt;The problem the patents claim to solve is the one where you may find yourself without enough outlets, power bricks, or any electricity at all. The patents state that “despite having standardized connectors and cable[s], each device may require a separate or dedicated power supply to charge. In some cases, having separate power supplies for each device may be burdensome to use, store, and/or transport.” (Of course, having separate power bricks for your devices is also made more difficult &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455726/apple-removes-charging-brick-watch-edition-hermes-model-environment"&gt;when they aren’t included in the box&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3oI461NOFoIxv3TBWA_gwrOc9E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215618/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_10.25.15_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This figure showing devices being charged on a MacBook’s lid suggests that you could use your laptop as a wireless charging pad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fkWgSd"&gt;There are other times when this kind of tech could be useful. For example, if you’re away from a charger and your Apple Watch or AirPods die, it’d be useful to be able to top them up with your phone. Likewise, being able to charge your phone from your laptop would be useful, and if Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515789/apple-portless-iphone-magsafe-wireless-charging"&gt;truly heading toward a portless iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, this type of tech could be a way to retain that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrY6TH"&gt;Right now, MacBooks and iPads are made out of aluminum, which isn’t compatible with wireless charging. If Apple wants to include this reverse wireless charging tech in its devices, it’ll have to design around that limitation. (Maybe it could bring back a plastic MacBook?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmqvby"&gt;It’s also hard to avoid thinking about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;Apple’s ill-fated AirPower project&lt;/a&gt; when considering the idea of a MacBook or iPad filled with wireless charging coils that are able to charge multiple devices at once. To be fair, Apple’s tech has progressed since then, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;now has control of the processors in all of its devices&lt;/a&gt;. It may come up with some solution to help the devices communicate and power levels and thermal constraints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZ1rVy"&gt;Whether you’ll actually be able to use your MacBook as a wireless charging pad for all of your devices remains to be seen, but I’d at least like to see this tech come to the iPhone. Many of its competitors already have some sort of reverse wireless charging capability, and while it’d be great to see it cranked up to 11 like in the below patent drawing, I’d be happy with Apple just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/3/21548318/google-pixel-5-wireless-charging-pad-qi-automatic-battery-share"&gt;catching up with the competition at this point&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537855/iphone-12-mini-pro-max-reverse-wireless-charging-fcc-filings-hidden"&gt;it seems like the iPhone 12 has the hardware to do this&lt;/a&gt;, it’s currently not enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67J1i_C_OYBK5-TLfwvSxgrh8VY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215621/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_10.25.23_AM.png"&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon is taking over as CEO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L3G3AB5uV5DDj1Ecvtrtb5RGeMk=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68621762/cristiano_amon_headshot_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRBrDk"&gt;Qualcomm is getting a new CEO: Cristiano Amon, who already serves as president for the company, will replace Steve Mollenkopf, who took over as CEO in 2014. Amon has already served as the public face of the company for some time, presiding over introductions of new products like the Snapdragon 888, making him an obvious choice to succeed Mollenkopf at the helm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23LY1E"&gt;Mollenkopf’s tenure as CEO saw Qualcomm face numerous challenges: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363629/qualcomm-win-appeal-antitrust-ftc-lawsuit-frand-patents-chips"&gt;antitrust accusations&lt;/a&gt;, allegations of anticompetitive behavior, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18410985/apple-qualcomm-settle-royalty-dispute-patent-licensing-terms-high-fees"&gt;massive fight with Apple&lt;/a&gt; that saw the two companies sever their relationship (before patching things up in a settlement). But he also oversaw Qualcomm’s growth into the juggernaut it is today, one that nearly completely dominates the industry for mobile processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0dwKl6"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/3guY6dNe1shpzEl8rEEIKi" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 232px;" allowfullscreen="" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TvlvaN"&gt;“I am honored to be named the next CEO of Qualcomm and appreciate the confidence that Steve and the Board have in me,” said Amon in a statement. “Qualcomm is an incredible Company. We have been at the forefront of innovation for decades and I look forward to maintaining this position going forward. In addition to driving the expansion of 5G into mainstream devices and beyond mobile, Qualcomm is set to play a key role in the digital transformation of numerous industries as our technologies become essential to connecting everything to the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord N10 5G and N100 are coming to the US on January 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v457j4-eMg1RmWKd_qMOe1tvsBs=/0x24:1080x744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68621543/Still_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord N10 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KyUvC3"&gt;The original&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt; OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt; skipped North America, but OnePlus is finally bringing two cheaper, mid-range options from its Nord line to the US and Canada on January 15th. The OnePlus Nord N10 5G offers flagship standards like a high-refresh rate 90Hz display and fast charging for $299.99 ($389 CAD), while the OnePlus Nord N100 features an even larger display and battery for $179.99 ($239 CAD). After&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534004/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-n100-price-news-features-specs-battery-quad-triple-cameras"&gt; launching in Europe last year&lt;/a&gt;, both phones are now carrier-exclusives for T-Mobile and available unlocked from OnePlus and other online retailers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JtX1J"&gt;The N10 5G’s 6.49-inch high-refresh rate display, 128GB of expandable storage, and 30W fast charging make it similar to the original Nord. Where it differs is with its lower-tier Snapdragon 690 processor, an LCD screen instead of OLED, and 6GB instead of 8GB of RAM. The N10 5G does still feature four rear cameras, though: a 64-megapixel main camera, and wide-angle, macro and monochrome cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BdhqGjPdbn2E3yyUW-Kz9C3KX44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989022/N10_Still.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord N10 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="naJ6lk"&gt;As its name suggests, the N10 5G supports 5G networks. The handset is limited to potentially slower low and mid-band 5G in the US, but should have better range and coverage than phones that only support millimeter wave 5G. Notably, the N10 5G doesn’t support mmWave 5G at all, OnePlus confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;the difficulty we’ve had with mmWave 5G on other phones&lt;/a&gt;, that might still be for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IHhySBrjtz9s46rdUd3u-3h4VNk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989021/N100_Still.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord N100.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tM9DEq"&gt;The cheaper N100 is a slight step down in features from the N10 5G, firstly because it only works with 4G. Its larger (but lower-resolution) 6.52-inch display and 5,000 mAh battery (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"&gt;larger than the OnePlus 8T&lt;/a&gt;) also make it less comparable to the Nord, and really brings it into the realm of an inexpensive battery-focused phone like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt;. The Snapdragon 460 and 64GB starting expandable storage mark this as a decidedly budget phone, which makes sense given the price. The N100 also only features 18W fast charging, around half what the N10 5G and Nord can handle. For cameras, The N100 has three on the back instead of four, with a 13-megapixel main camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtxLIv"&gt;Both phones run Android 10 skinned with OxygenOS, and OnePlus says that they’ll be updated to Android 11 at some point in the future. OnePlus is also guaranteeing two years of security updates for each handset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wS46l"&gt;In terms of price, the phones cost less than we expected and come in under the original Nord’s price of £379 (around $484). They might not be using the same “recipe” as the original, but a lower price is always worth considering. You’ll be able to purchase the N10 5G and the N100 from OnePlus’ carrier partners T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile, or unlocked from OnePlus, Amazon, Best Buy, and B&amp;amp;H. The phones will be available at OnePlus’ website on January 15th at 10:00AM ET, with pre-sale beginning on January 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi announces made-in-India Mi 10i</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8OYlyo7lyHNPIIbrQ3INjBkMUm0=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68620790/Eqt5qQdU0AgyxZY.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VgXIzO"&gt;Xiaomi has announced the Mi 10i, a new phone in its 10 series intended for the Indian market and manufactured in the country — that’s what the “i” stands for, apparently. That said, it’s essentially a rebranded, region-specific version of the Mi 10T Lite 5G, which is itself basically the same thing as the Redmi Note 9 Pro 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A19cai"&gt;The phone has a 6.67-inch 120Hz 20:9 1080p LCD, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor with an onboard X52 5G modem, and up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The battery is 4,820mAh, and Xiaomi says it should charge from empty to full in 58 minutes at 33W. There’s also a headphone jack, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and an IR blaster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8vH9ucU3zrcqzwD0KlHXgoC2jHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214665/Eq8lDsjUcAE7u7o.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kxhjXa"&gt;The main camera uses Samsung’s 108-megapixel ISOCELL HM2 sensor, supported by an 8-megapixel ultrawide camera and 2-megapixel macro and depth sensors. The selfie camera is 16 megapixels and located in what Xiaomi says is the smallest hole-punch cutout in its class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RER9aW"&gt;The Mi 10i will go on sale on January 7th in India priced at Rs. 20,999 (~$290) for a model with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The Rs. 21,999 ($300) model doubles the storage to 128GB, and there’s another 8GB/128GB variant at Rs. 23,999 ($330). At that pricing, it could be a strong competitor to the likes of the OnePlus Nord.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your Pixel 5’s system sounds are annoyingly loud, a new update may fix that problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The bottom speaker sounds much better than the panel audio speaker" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aMHktbyx08GVw7s00Hkj9T3fFL4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68619813/akrales_201012_4137_0151.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qGuqaN"&gt;As part of its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/91975505"&gt;January Pixel updates&lt;/a&gt;, Google might have fixed an issue that meant Pixel 5 system sounds could be a lot louder than you might have wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hm2Gb1"&gt;Since the Pixel 5’s launch in October, numerous users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jm8yzm/lowest_volume_on_pixel_5_notifications_is_very/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jnpwhd/pixel_5_users_volume_issue_on_some_systemapp/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and on Google’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/77479730?hl=en"&gt;own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/80874883?hl=en"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/79219514?hl=en#"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; have reported that Pixel 5 system sounds (like the camera shutter or the sound you hear when you take a screenshot) could be quite loud, even when the phone’s volume was set to a lower level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzejQO"&gt;In the release notes for the January Pixel updates, however, Google says that the Pixel 5-specific update includes “further tuning &amp;amp; improvements for volume level of system sounds.” A few users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/kqg3q3/january_update_finally_fixes_the_most_annoying/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; have reported that the system sounds are much quieter after installing the update, though some say that the sounds are &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; quiet now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zG8nI"&gt;The release notes also list other changes, including improvements to auto-brightness on the Pixel 4A, 4A 5G, and 5. Here’s Google’s full list of “notable fixes” in the January updates:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFpdfR_tgQW-vidQsK3Q_G5EsZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214032/thread_91975505_11215868825490307245.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zj4vUP"&gt;Google says the updates are rolling out now to all supported Pixel devices running Android 11. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 Pro rumored to offer faster 45W wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9AVy6hpGVXZpDnqLOrcm_Qjv40M=/0x1:1874x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68617635/oneplus_9_leaked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The leaked prototype of the OnePlus 9.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/oneplus-9-pro-45w-wireless-charging-specs-features-rumors_id129312" target="_blank"&gt;PhoneArena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="chat-messages-795702904228413470"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is rumored to feature faster 45W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging for filling up accessories like wireless headphones, according to a post from &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@maxjmb/oneplus-9-pro-45w-wireless-charging-1609755049-1189681637"&gt;Max Jambor at &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OxV9Y"&gt;The OnePlus 8 Pro was the first OnePlus device to feature wireless charging, but it was capped at 30W. A bump up to 45W would be a notable increase and could allow for even faster charging speeds than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;8 Pro’s 50 percent charge in 30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;. Faster wireless charging might also indicate that the OnePlus 9 Pro could feature the 65W wired charging of the OnePlus 8T, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/04/oneplus-9-pro-wireless-charging-45w/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;However OnePlus decides to improve charging, it could potentially be useful if other flagship features like an improved display and 5G support drain the battery faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snBpCt"&gt;Reverse wireless charging was also available previously on the OnePlus 8 Pro, but the 9 Pro could offer faster charging speeds. Over the last few years, several flagship Android phones have adopted the feature, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/3/21548318/google-pixel-5-wireless-charging-pad-qi-automatic-battery-share"&gt;Pixel 5’s Battery Share&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/what-is/wireless-powershare/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wireless PowerShare&lt;/a&gt; on the Galaxy S20 line. Like these phones, reverse wireless charging will likely be slower than what you could get from a wired connection, but it’s still a handy feature for OnePlus to include.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjmWzo"&gt;The rest of the OnePlus Pro 9 remains a mystery, but images and specs for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174437/oneplus-9-photos-leak-2021-flagship"&gt;a prototype of the OnePlus 9 have leaked&lt;/a&gt;, giving us a pretty good indication of the main features of the new line. A few notable ones include a 120Hz display, a Snapdragon 888 processor, and a 4,500mAh battery. Look out for more leaks and rumors as we get closer to the expected spring launch of OnePlus’ newest phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjhOGy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article said that OnePlus hasn’t included reverse wireless charging in a phone  before. That’s incorrect, the OnePlus 8 Pro had the feature. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmVTIW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 480 heralds a new wave of budget 5G phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uh5htUR1gWkX6EVd7L8XZl-6h3s=/0x0:2064x1376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615978/Snapdragon_480_5G_Mobile_Platform___Logo___Outdoors.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="46aLPh"&gt;Qualcomm has officially announced the Snapdragon 480 5G, the company’s latest 5G-capable processor and the first in its Snapdragon 4-series of chips which power budget Android devices that tend to be far cheaper than most of Qualcomm’s 5G efforts to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aP6m1c"&gt;The news of a 4-series chip with 5G was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409504/qualcomm-snapdragon-4-series-budget-4-phones-ifa-2020"&gt;originally teased&lt;/a&gt; at IFA 2020, but today’s announcement marks the first real details for the new processor. The Snapdragon 480 features an integrated Snapdragon X51 modem with support for both mmWave and sub-6GHz networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2kCqz5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Qualcomm’s next budget Snapdragon 4-series chips could take 5G mainstream in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409504/qualcomm-snapdragon-4-series-budget-4-phones-ifa-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8dpblm"&gt;The addition of 5G to the 4-series could be one of the biggest factors yet in making the next-generation networking standard more accessible to users around the world. Right now, most 5G phones tend to cost upward of $500 — the technology is generally limited to mid-tier and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;flagship phones&lt;/a&gt;. But by adding it to the Snapdragon 4-series lineup, Qualcomm is making it possible for manufacturers to easily add 5G to their cheapest phones in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cristianoamon/status/1301584443090464768"&gt;$125 to $250 range&lt;/a&gt;. That means that 2021 may be the year that truly budget 5G phones arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SIzQQvZyb9mawQ-0RuOa6fEbSEY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22211637/Snapdragon_480_5G_Mobile_Platform___Logo___Vertical___English.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fw1JRY"&gt;But the Snapdragon 480 isn’t just interesting because of its 5G support — it also promises to offer a massive leap in performance compared to its predecessor, the Snapdragon 460. Specifically, Qualcomm says that the Snapdragon 480 should offer twice the performance of the old model for both the CPU and GPU, with a 70 percent improvement for AI tasks. (Specifically, through new Adreno 619 GPU, Kryo 460 CPU, and Qualcomm Hexagon 686 chipsets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMBm4H"&gt;There are also several features that have trickled down from past premium Snapdragon products, making their debut on the budget line for the first time. The Snapdragon 480 is the first 4-series chip to use an 8nm process, the first to support &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2018/02/23/how-can-quick-charge-4-turbocharge-your-mobile-device"&gt;Quick Charge 4 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, the first to support 120fps FHD+ panels, the first to offer 64-megapixel still images, and the first to offer a triple ISP for triple camera integration that can shoot up to three photos at once. Again, none of these are new features, but they should vastly expand what budget-priced phones will be able to do — especially when combined with the performance improvements coming to the CPU and GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3yvgSK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor will power the Android flagships of 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="V05kq9"&gt;The first phones featuring the Snapdragon 480 are expected to arrive in Q1 2021. Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, Motorola, and HMD’s Nokia are among the major companies that are expected to release phones powered by the new chip in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Images of Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra’s optional stylus and compatible case leak early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sdequBrQeAgmHk1V9hBD7cXTy7w=/0x0:2250x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615395/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_S_Pen_Cover_1609725103_0_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A case for the S21 Ultra with space for an optional  S Pen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="le0KRq"&gt;Images of what appears to be an S Pen stylus and carrying case for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S21 Ultra have leaked online, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. They show a stylus that looks similar in appearance to Samsung’s previous S Pens, as well as a phone case that’s a little wider than the handset itself to allow space for the optional accessory. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports that the stylus will be sold separately from the phone for just under €40 (around $49). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBEhCB"&gt;This phone case is necessary because the S21 Ultra is rumored to support the S Pen but &lt;a href="https://winfuture.mobi/news/119995"&gt;reportedly won’t have a dedicated slot&lt;/a&gt; to store it unlike Samsung’s Note devices. The stylus is reportedly an optional accessory for the S21 Ultra, rather than something that comes in the box like with the Note phones. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhnR3BnQbLiQ8g-kvF9TL0B_UBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22212392/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_S_Pen_Cover_1609725152_0_0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stylus accessory looks a lot like Samsung’s previous S Pens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ1Syy"&gt;Rumors that the Galaxy S21 Ultra will work with the S Pen have been around for at least a month, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;Samsung itself&lt;/a&gt; even hinted that support was on the way when its president of mobile TM Roh said the company would add some of the Galaxy Note’s “most well-loved features” to other devices in its lineup. At the end of last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;an FCC filing&lt;/a&gt; all-but-confirmed that stylus support was on the way for the upcoming phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aTQQ2"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;, the S21 Ultra will support many of the same S Pen features as previous Note devices. It will reportedly have a pressure-sensitive tip, gesture controls via an accelerometer, and controls for playing and pausing videos or remotely taking photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6tt9p"&gt;Reports of stylus support coming to the S21 Ultra have coincided with rumors that Samsung was preparing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;discontinue its Note lineup&lt;/a&gt;, which counts stylus support among its defining features. However, this has reportedly been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22177972/galaxy-note-21-still-happening-yonhap"&gt;disputed by one Samsung official&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BqgnK"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is expected to be one of three devices that’ll make up the S21 lineup, alongside the Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus. Beyond its stylus support, other reports have claimed the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s rear camera array will include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189305/samsung-s21-ultra-spec-leak-cameras"&gt;two telephoto cameras&lt;/a&gt; as well as a main 108-megapixel camera. Leaked video teasers suggest it’ll have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;curved screen&lt;/a&gt; (compared to flat screens for the other two S21 handsets) and redesigned camera bump compared to the previous generation S20 Ultra, and &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; it’ll have a 6.8-inch 120Hz display, and a 5,000 mAh battery with support for 45W fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gt7Jux"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;Samsung has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that its next Unpacked launch event will take place on January 14th, during which it’s expected to announce the new Galaxy S21 range and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/1/22209216/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-tile-item-tracker-leak"&gt;a new Tile competitor&lt;/a&gt; alongside the heavily leaked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung officially confirms Galaxy S21 event for January 14th</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="at34Jk"&gt;Samsung will officially be announcing its latest lineup of Galaxy flagship phones — rumored to be the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra — on January 14th, the company confirmed through invitations to a new Galaxy Unpacked event. The tagline: “Welcome to the Everyday Epic.” The event will kick off at 7AM PT / 10AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPqWI5"&gt;The company is widely expected to announce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202864/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-specs-leak"&gt;three new smartphones at the event&lt;/a&gt;, successors to last year’s Galaxy S20 lineup: a pair of matching S21 and S21 Plus phones (that are expected to be largely similar, except for size), and a more premium S21 Ultra model that will offer even better specs and cameras, similar to its 2020 counterpart, in addition to a curved display and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;support for Samsung’s S-Pen stylus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApD5hc"&gt;There’s not a lot to glean from the event teaser video you can watch at the top of this post, which appears to simply be the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;Galaxy S21’s camera module&lt;/a&gt; floating inside a translucent cube. But practically every detail of these new phones already seems to have leaked, including sharper animated GIFs of what those modules should look like:&lt;/p&gt;
