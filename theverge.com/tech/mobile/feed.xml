    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e3KHRc"&gt;Sony’s Xperia 5 III, the compact counterpart to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22580552/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-price-specs-screen-camera"&gt;Xperia 1 III&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href="https://pressroom.pixelshift.studio/sony-electronics-highly-anticipated-xperiar-5-iii-smartphone-now-shipping-in-the-united-states"&gt;now on sale in the US&lt;/a&gt;, almost nine months after the company initially announced the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382887/sony-announces-xperia-1-iii-xperia-5-iii"&gt;in April 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The phone retails for $999.99 and will be available in black or green, with the latter exclusive to Sony’s own online store. The phone went on sale in the second half of last year in the UK and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktKLs8"&gt;The phone has seen some internal upgrades compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514064/sony-xperia-5-ii-review"&gt;Xperia 1 II&lt;/a&gt;, which bring it more into line with mainstream handsets from 2021. It’s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, runs Android 11 out of the box, and should also be able to benefit from at least some 5G connectivity in the US. Elsewhere, battery capacity has been upped to 4,500mAh, and Sony advertises that this larger battery can be charged to 50 percent in half an hour, like its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8e7JgyoV9gkitL48wARyEBuXEVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160681/auto.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tall display paired with three rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gjED2g"&gt;Externally the Xperia 5 III has a similar design to the Xperia 5 II. Its 120Hz 6.1-inch display maintains Sony’s trademark 21:9 aspect ratio, and there are still three rear 12-megapixel cameras, which handle main, ultrawide, and telephoto duties, respectively. There’s support for taking photos at up to 20fps, with focus / exposure readings happening at 60fps, as well as support for recording 120fps 4K footage in HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvspRt"&gt;It’s a decent set of specs, and if the Xperia 1 III is anything to go by, the phone should have decent camera performance and a stunning screen. But $999 seems like a high price when, very soon, we’re going to start seeing phones releasing with Qualcomm’s newer Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xr8tB8"&gt;The Xperia 5 III is shipping now, and Sony says that orders placed before February 27th will come with a pair of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt; earbuds and 43,200 &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; CP points for free. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything you need to know about 2022’s biggest chips from CES (and elsewhere)  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BA-qOvlIZpUM9jZivpdTDrd-cLY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374177/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yd7xYj"&gt;It’s a new year, and like clockwork, 2022 has brought with it a plethora of new chips for laptops, desktops, phones, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEs5sx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855915/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-ces-2022-h-series-laptops-gaming-performance"&gt;Intel announced new CPUs&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866533/intel-12th-gen-cpu-alder-lake-mainstream-consumer-desktops-ces-2022"&gt;virtually every product it makes&lt;/a&gt;, AMD refreshed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;laptop processors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt; for its whole lineup &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; started teasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856151/amd-ryzen-7000-desktop-cpu-5nm-next-gen-zen-4-release-date-ces-2022"&gt;its next major desktop overhaul&lt;/a&gt;, and Nvidia came out swinging with the announcement of its most &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866454/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2022"&gt;powerful GPU yet&lt;/a&gt;. If you weren’t keeping up (or even if you were) it was a &lt;em&gt;lot.&lt;/em&gt; And that was just CES: Qualcomm already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809687/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-chip-smartphone-processor-specs-details"&gt;announced &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; next-gen chips&lt;/a&gt; for smartphones and laptops in December, and Samsung is teeing up a new Exynos processor, too. And that’s not even considering Apple, which tends to play its cards closer to its chest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWkn4I"&gt;But as the dust settles and products with that plethora of processors start to loom on the horizon, here’s a breakdown of 2022’s most important chips, and what they’ll mean when you’re looking for a new laptop, computer, or phone this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WBK3tc"&gt;Laptops&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MZOC9y"&gt;2022 is shaping up to be a very interesting year for new laptops, thanks to AMD and Intel — both of which announced full slates of new laptop chips at CES 2022, which will likely power almost any major computer released this year that doesn’t have an Apple logo on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="392Zcv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lots of new laptop hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wWZNLm"&gt;Intel’s updates appear to be the more notable of the two companies, with the announcement of its Alder Lake family of chips for its entire laptop range (although only the most powerful H-series chips made their formal debut; the U-series and P-series lineups for lighter-weight laptops are set to arrive later in 2022). Like last year’s Alder Lake desktop chips, the new laptop chips are the first to feature Intel’s new (some might say Arm-esque) architecture with a mix of performance and efficiency cores.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZoUXLvvbEWktQCn47-4fD92mQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142901/12th_gen_mobile_chip_pose_06_4000px.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eSEIB2"&gt;The first wave of Alder Lake desktop processors were &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; impressive, a breakthrough product for an Intel that had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22597713/intel-7nm-delay-summer-2020-apple-arm-switch-roadmap-gelsinger-ceo"&gt;been caught in a yearslong slump of delays&lt;/a&gt; for its 10nm process (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;since renamed Intel 7&lt;/a&gt;). If Intel can realize similar success on its laptop lineup, Alder Lake could be the edge the company needs to fend off an ascendant AMD and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8CJwX"&gt;Processors are only a piece of the puzzle, though, and Intel’s biggest product of 2022 was still largely missing from CES 2022: its upcoming lineup of discrete Arc GPUs, which will be rolling out later this year for desktop &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;laptop devices. The company has already started teasing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865560/intel-arc-gpu-teaser-alchemist-ces-2022-oem"&gt;major partners like Dell, HP, and Samsung&lt;/a&gt; will be using its chips (in addition to adding the requirement that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856046/intel-evo-laptop-standard-foldable-laptops-h-series-project-athena-ces-2022"&gt;Intel Evo-branded laptops&lt;/a&gt; with discrete GPUs will need to be using Arc chips to get Intel’s seal of approval). And Intel is making big promises about the potential of combining its integrated graphics in conjunction with discrete Arc GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/adaptix/deep-link.html"&gt;through its Deep Link technology&lt;/a&gt; for bigger gains. But for now, Arc is still one of the biggest question marks for 2022’s computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaRkIf"&gt;On the other side of the aisle are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;AMD’s new Ryzen 6000 chips&lt;/a&gt; for its laptops. This year’s chips still are using a slightly upgraded architecture from last year’s Ryzen 5000 (AMD calls its Zen 3 Plus and called out a few improvements like bumps to performance and battery life). That’s fine, given that last year’s Ryzen chips were already great —&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt; AMD’s 2021 laptops were its first truly premium designs in ages&lt;/a&gt;, with great battery life, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;excellent performance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;powerful discrete GPUs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RG-699T4XpCmshx07FoajVAvCDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160565/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_9.03.17_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LIzmAa"&gt;The integrated GPU side of things, though, is where this year’s biggest changes are for AMD, which is finally upgrading to its new RDNA 2 architecture here instead of continuing to use its old Vega GPU designs. RDNA 2 is the same architecture that the PS5 and Xbox Series X have, and while the integrated GPUs on 2022 AMD laptops won’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; approach the power of those consoles, they’re even closer (with the top Radeon RX 6850M XT GPU actually offering more compute units than the PS5 does). All told, AMD is promising some big boosts for gaming on laptops, which is an exciting prospect… if the chips actually hold up to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DDKUDN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AMD has some big gaming updates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9jtJYV"&gt;And for those who need more power, AMD also has a slate of new notebook GPUs, expanding its lower-end range for its 6000M series chips. It’s also introducing a new, more power-efficient line of Radeon 6000S chips for thinner and lighter laptops that — in theory — won’t have to compromise on gaming performance. Both of those lineups will be based on RDNA 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Nr1FZ"&gt;Lastly, there’s Nvidia, which announced a refreshed wave of powerful laptop GPUs that are coming soon: mobile versions of the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti, which promise 1440p gaming at 100 and 120 frames per second and can integrate with a laptop’s CPU to balance power and temperature for maximum performance. Nvidia tells us they’re roughly 10-20 percent more powerful than their non-Ti laptop predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qmhmdp6umSn-6Sp_vSd5gNaW7vc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144576/chrome_MtQmNzsoUF.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vpKkNV"&gt;All said, it’s an exciting time to be looking to buy a new laptop in the coming weeks or months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLbYKa"&gt;Of course, all that goes without acknowledging the elephant in the room: Apple, which has not so quietly been establishing itself as a silicon force to be reckoned with thanks to its excellent M1 series of processors. (They recently received high-powered upgrades in the company’s late 2021 MacBook Pros — resulting in some of the best performance and battery life on any computer &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has ever tested.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mmTDnB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Qualcomm will probably have to wait until next year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uTNRI3"&gt;Qualcomm is also trying again to make inroads with laptops, a market that the company (which thoroughly dominates mobile SoCs) has yet to really break into in any meaningful way. This year, the company has its new Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 chipset, which the company says offers an 85 percent jump in CPU performance and a 60 percent faster GPU compared to Qualcomm’s previous laptop chip. That said, the new platform is off to a slow start: CES 2022 came and went without a single device announced using the 8cx Gen 3, and Qualcomm itself seems to be pinning its future not on its current flagship laptop chip, but a 2023 chip designed by the Nuvia team that will “set the performance benchmark for Windows PCs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovBXVa"&gt;While Apple didn’t make an appearance at CES 2022, the shadow of its chips were definitely felt: Intel defiantly rolled out slides of benchmarks claiming its new Alder Lake H-series chips were even more powerful than Cupertino’s best — something that we’ll have to test for ourselves when 2022’s new crop of laptops roll around. Battery life on Intel’s chips is also a big question mark, one that the company didn’t really address in its announcements. Nvidia also took a shot at Apple, arguing that its new RTX Studio-branded computers with its new GPUs can offer seven times the GPU performance as Apple’s M1 Max. But Apple itself is rumored to have its second-generation processors out later this year, which could throw 2022’s chip crown into contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bB4Rcr"&gt;Desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UHmEEY"&gt;The desktop side of things was a little calmer at CES 2022. Intel caught up the rest of its desktop lineup to Alder Lake, as well (last year’s launch was just a trio of high-powered gaming chips). The new lineup should bring Intel’s new architecture strategy (which has two types of processor cores) to the rest of its desktops, including more consumer-friendly desktop towers and all-in-one PCs. The company also rolled out new, cheaper motherboard designs to go with the broader release of chips (which were badly needed, given that until now there was just a single high-end chipset available). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wE3ADt"&gt;AMD (which hasn’t updated its desktop lineup since late 2020) only announced a single new chip coming in the first half of the year: Ryzen 7 5800X3D, which uses AMD’s 3D V-Cache stacking technology to squeak out an extra 15 percent of power compared to the Ryzen 5900X. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hqEZvMf4RISZQ6DQob6ZI5lwBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144140/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_8.02.34_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bvFlJm"&gt;More exciting things are on the horizon for later in 2022, though, even if there’s going to be a bit of a wait to get them. AMD has started its next big processor refresh with the Ryzen 7000 line of chips, which will be powered by the company’s new Zen 4 architecture, jump to a 5nm process node, and add a new socket. The chips will switch to AMD’s new AM5 design, which puts pins on the motherboard instead of the CPUs. That means that for the first time in over five years, you’ll have to get a new motherboard to take advantage of AMD’s new CPUs. Those chips won’t arrive until the second half of the year, but they should make a pretty big splash when they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJoeCr"&gt;Nvidia also showed off its upcoming RTX 3090 Ti, which will take the crown as the company’s most powerful consumer graphics card when it arrives later this year (with a presumably sky-high price tag to match its performance).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d1NA3pSU803m-Z4iGtlydXb4VJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144510/rtx3090Ti.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fMlJhI"&gt;Similar to the laptop side of things, 2022’s most mysterious chip product is Intel’s upcoming Arc discrete GPUs. Codenamed “Alchemist,” Intel will finally look to take on AMD and Nvidia directly for the minds, hearts, and GPU slots of gamers and creatives alike when it launches its extremely hyped consumer graphics cards later in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zkYSih"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Arc is inbound&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="okM4gJ"&gt;Intel has already showed off some interesting demos, like its XeSS super-sampling for 4K scaling (similar to Nvidia’s DLSS or AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution). But the real test will come when the first GPUs actually ship. The current crop of rumors expect that Intel will be targeting the middle of the road for its first generation of GPUs (one leak from last fall &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/intel-arc-alchemist-gpu-could-be-a-game-changer-heres-everything-we-know"&gt;expects Intel’s best first-gen card&lt;/a&gt; to be competitive with about an RTX 3070), but we’ll have to wait for later this year when customers can see for themselves just how well Intel’s first major discrete GPUs in history really hold up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnEdiD"&gt;Lastly, there’s Apple, which is rumored to be expanding its Arm-based chips to the rest of its desktop lineup in 2022, where some of its most intriguing products have yet to be updated, like its high-powered Mac Pro desktop. It’ll be interesting to see how Apple manages to scale up its chip designs to that level of power and performance — especially with the fierce competition from AMD and Intel’s refreshed lineups mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JyMcHD"&gt;Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jZrpY7"&gt;Things are a little simpler when it comes to mobile chips. If you’re buying an Android phone in the US, odds are it’ll have a Qualcomm chip powering it. If it’s a flagship device, it’ll be the recently announced Qualcomm 8 Gen 1, the company’s latest and greatest SoC that’s expected to start showing up in products like Samsung’s Galaxy S22 lineup in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cx9ECELaIfVlFXwfXgJGcLFNL0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053632/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Mobile_Platform__Key_Visual__Angle_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="26x4vd"&gt;Apple will use whatever it names the next iteration of its A-series chips for the iPhone (the same money is on the A16), but it’ll be exclusively in Apple products. Samsung has its new Exynos 2200 processor, which will mix things up a bit with an AMD RDNA 2-powered GPU, but odds are it won’t ever make it to the US for a variety of licensing and modem issues (along with the simple fact that Qualcomm’s chips historically perform better than Samsung’s).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpXs3W"&gt;Google is a company to watch, with its new Tensor SoC platform that it debuted on the Pixel 6 lineup last year; presumably, Google will be looking to follow that up with a second-generation version to power its 2022 smartphones. The company is rumored to be working on more powerful in-house chips for future Chromebooks, too — which could be extremely interesting in a world where Apple’s similarly custom-designed Arm-based laptops are some of the best computers around. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile appears to be blocking some iPhone users from turning on Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lX89e"&gt;T-Mobile appears to be blocking some iPhone users from enabling iCloud Private Relay, a feature that lets you hide the websites you visit from third parties, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/t-mobile-block-icloud-private-relay/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The block doesn’t appear to be malicious, however — without it, some T-Mobile services couldn’t operate, &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

It’s currently available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;via a subscription to iCloud Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwCA9M"&gt;Private Relay is still in beta in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, and it isn’t turned on by default. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;You have to go into your iPhone’s settings to switch it on&lt;/a&gt;, which is where some T-Mobile customers have noticed a strange message popping up. As shown in the above tweet, the user is presented with the message, “Your cellular plan doesn’t support iCloud Private Relay. With Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z095du"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480631410239094797?s=20"&gt;a reply to that tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the user shows what happens when you click the “Learn More” button below the initial message — there, Apple explains why T-Mobile might be blocking the feature. “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay,” it reads. “Your cellular provider may be providing network-based services, such as Parental Controls, requiring them to view the traffic on your network.” An &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;internal note shared with &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;suggests that’s exactly what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oYDJF"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report, &lt;/em&gt;iCloud Private Relay conflicts with a number of T-Mobile services. Notably, Private Relay conflicts with T-Mobile customers using Web Guard, and Sprint and Home Office Internet customers who enable content filtering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4ZROa"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/european-carriers-seek-to-block-iphone-private-relay-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iPhone users in Europe were the first to notice that access to the Private Relay feature had been blocked. T-Mobile, Vodafone, and Telefonica added their names to an open letter published in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Fapple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F10%2F22877211%2Ft-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that criticizes the feature. Carriers argue that Private Relay “will impair others to innovate and compete in downstream digital markets and may negatively impact operators’ ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7LADr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to T-Mobile and Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWnp0v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 11th, 4:48AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with additional &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;reporting by The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor announces the Magic V, its first foldable smartphone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/skD0J9sSG0ptJskU5JJts_kogs0=/0x0:1358x905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70369188/d81jWLiA_cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor’s new foldable, the Magic V.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRv9FC"&gt;Former Huawei sub-brand Honor has just announced its first foldable smartphone, the Honor Magic V. It uses a similar folding form factor to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold devices, combining a large internal folding display with a smaller external display that can be used while the device is folded. Today is the foldable’s Chinese launch, where its price starts at ¥9,999 (around $1,569) for its 256GB storage model. It will go on open sale on January 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puGB6W"&gt;The Magic V’s flagship feature, its internal folding screen, measures 7.9 inches from corner to corner, has a resolution of 2272 x 1984 with a refresh rate of 90Hz, and an aspect ratio of 10:9. That’s slightly bigger than Samsung’s Z Fold 3, whose internal screen is 7.6 inches with a resolution of 2208 x 1768. Honor says the Magic V’s internal screen is like using two 21:9 screens side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWMekK"&gt;The Magic V’s external screen is also slightly larger than the Z Fold 3 at 6.45 inches (compared to 6.2 for Samsung), with a resolution of 2560 x 1080, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 21:9 aspect ratio. Honor says this will help make the device more usable when you don’t want to unfold it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pqAqKnxfPipygOI4i1AW1A6XFeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158005/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_12.32.15_PM.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic V in orange.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M4iOVM251Pj5YM_WPRwb-g8SZHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158009/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_12.29.52_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Honor&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor’s foldable, folded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jym1Eh"&gt;When folded, the Magic V measures 72.7mm wide, 14.3mm thick, and has a height of 160.4mm, and when unfolded it expands to 141.1mm wide and is 6.7mm thick. That’s slightly wider than Samsung’s latest Z Fold, while being slightly thinner overall when folded. Honor’s foldable is slightly heavier, however. It’s available in three colors: orange, silver, and black, and Honor CEO George Zhao says it should survive being folded and unfolded 200,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hr0esu"&gt;Internally, the Magic V is running Qualcomm’s latest chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, which is paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage. It’s got a 4,750mAh battery that can be charged at up to 66W, which gives you a 50 percent charge in 15 minutes. It’s 5G compatible and is running Honor’s Magic UI 6.0 software on top of Android 12, which supports the display of multiple app windows at the same time, Honor says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNoWvQ"&gt;In terms of cameras, Honor has included a trio of 50-megapixel sensors on the rear of the foldable, which include a main sensor, an ultrawide camera, and something Honor is calling a “spectrum enhanced camera.” We’ve followed up with the company for details on what exactly this third camera does. The Magic V has a pair of 42-megapixel selfie cameras, one embedded in the outer display, and one embedded in the inner folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NjOIA"&gt;Honor joins an increasingly long list of companies that have either announced or have started to sell foldable smartphones. Most recently, we saw Oppo announce its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price"&gt;Find N&lt;/a&gt; late last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Honor’s former parent company Huawei&lt;/a&gt; also have foldable devices of their own. We’ve followed up with Honor to find out if, or when, the Magic V might see a global release. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA lists 50 airports that will have 5G buffer zones ahead of C-band expansion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cell Tower" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0DUnadgi6Re0qcDz56wmLp5nbTk=/104x0:3967x2575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70364482/1234861974.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8YJChP"&gt;With AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon set to bring their 5G expansion live on January 19th, &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-5g"&gt;the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has chosen&lt;/a&gt; 50 airports (&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2022-01/50%20Airports%20with%205G%20Buffer.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) that will have buffer zones to help prevent flight disruptions (via &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-faa-details-50-airports-that-will-have-5g-buffer-zones-2022-01-08/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/faa-selects-airports-for-5g-buffer-zones-11641609361"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Safety regulators picked airports based on location, traffic volume, and the likelihood of low visibility — all factors that may increase cancelations, delays, and diversions as both carriers roll out 5G C-band service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOd3oM"&gt;As pointed out by the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, notably busy airports like Chicago O’Hare, Orlando International, Los Angeles International, and Dallas / Fort Worth International are included on the list, along with airports in locations that are often impacted by foggy conditions, such as Seattle / Tacoma International and San Francisco International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e2kesa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will turn off 5G transmitters at buffer zones for six months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4QT6vg"&gt;The FAA notes that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have agreed to turn off their 5G transmitters at these specific buffer zones for six months, which should “minimize potential 5G interference with sensitive aircraft instruments used in low-visibility landings.” Some airports — including major hubs like Hartsfield / Jackson International and Denver International — didn’t make the list, either because they aren’t in locations where 5G C-Band deployment will take place, or they can’t permit low-visibility landings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cX0Ttp"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have been itching to deploy their improved 5G service ever since they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;spent a combined $70 billion last year&lt;/a&gt; on securing chunks of the C-band spectrum, which should provide a middle ground in terms of 5G speed and coverage — something that both carriers’ 5G service is currently lacking. The two currently offer 5G service using super fast high-band millimeter wave technology that only covers small areas, as well as the low-band spectrum, which provides a lot of coverage with slow service akin to 4G LTE. T-Mobile already offers mid-band 5G service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;but it isn’t in the C-band range&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BZJsj"&gt;Both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T were originally set to switch on their 5G expansions on December 5th, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;air safety fears delayed the launch&lt;/a&gt; twice. The carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863964/faa-fcc-verizon-att-c-band-5g-airports-proposal-rejected"&gt;ended up rejecting the FAA’s request&lt;/a&gt; to delay the rollout until January 5th but later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;came to an agreement&lt;/a&gt; to turn on service on January 19th, giving the FAA additional time to account for potential flight disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QcGBwX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Samsung is showing off the foldables of the future at CES</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GABMbrADflCB0KQDm994LxD_LtI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360697/Screen_Shot_2022_01_07_at_9.27.00_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vZmPbp"&gt;Samsung is arguably leading the charge on folding phones, and even though the first Galaxy Fold got off to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938653/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-updated-android-price-specs-features-hinge"&gt;a rocky start&lt;/a&gt;, last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; were impressive devices that delivered on the promise of how handy a device with a folding screen can be. But the company isn’t stopping with those form factors; at CES 2022, it showed off a bunch of prototype folding devices that could hint at foldables to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCzqCZ"&gt;Take the Flex S, a multi-foldable device that can stretch all the way out to a triple-wide screen. Or the Flex G, a pocket-sized device that folds &lt;em&gt;inward&lt;/em&gt; to protect the screen. There’s a device with a right rail that slides out to add some screen real estate. And Samsung even showed off a 17-inch folding laptop that’s not unlike the one Asus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867624/asus-zenbook-17-fold-oled-foldable-laptop-tablet-specs-price-release-date"&gt;announced at CES&lt;/a&gt; (though Asus is promising that its device will come out this year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ90MF"&gt;There’s a lot to get excited about, and you can see Samsung’s latest foldable tech in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzdwfCZ9XKY"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApO4Tc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 10 Pro gets a better RAW mode and a wider ultrawide camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GsB40f87Eyxw1A4ckKegdYWtmGQ=/0x49:1173x831/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70357604/OnePlus_10_Pro_Black_Headshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus continues to lean into partner Hasselblad’s image tuning expertise and branding.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sraOKr"&gt;OnePlus is sharing a few more details about the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22849868/oneplus-pro-china-launch-january-11th-design"&gt;OnePlus 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a focus on camera specifications. If you were hoping for lots of hardware upgrades from this second-gen partnership with Hasselblad, it looks like you’ll have to keep waiting — with the exception of a new ultrawide, these updates are primarily software-based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKzEpi"&gt;To recap some basic camera specs that we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs"&gt;learned earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, the OnePlus 10 will offer a triple rear camera — likely the same 48-megapixel main, 50-megapixel ultrawide, and 8-megapixel telephoto configuration as last year. There’s a 32-megapixel front-facing camera, which is a significant resolution bump from the 9 and 9 Pro’s 16-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzC3Sw"&gt;A notable update is the addition of a shooting mode called RAW Plus which, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174433/apple-ios-14-3-pro-raw-iphone-12-pro-max-update-features"&gt;Apple’s ProRAW format&lt;/a&gt;, combines the benefits of computational photography and RAW image capture. The OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro offered a traditional RAW mode, so this is a nice improvement for those who want to tinker with data-rich RAW files while retaining the advanced image processing that smartphone cameras are so good at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UNir2z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vlrPdg"&gt;All three rear cameras can be used in the updated Hasselblad Pro Mode to control exposure settings and shoot 12-bit RAW files. We really liked the intuitive Pro Mode on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro, so we’re eager to check out the latest version. There’s a new manual video recording mode, too, called Movie Mode. It offers control over ISO and shutter speed as well as access to a LOG shooting format that better lends itself to post-capture color grading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1EJNZ"&gt;The 9 and 9 Pro cameras featured color tuning by Hasselblad, and OnePlus continues to lean into that aspect of the partnership. In this iteration, it combines its own (also Oppo’s own) “Billion Color Solution” and Hasselblad’s color science to bring 10-bit color to each of the phone’s three rear cameras. That should make for smoother color gradations in images — provided that you’re looking at them on a screen capable of displaying all of those colors. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNmthcFuANzn8jtQlWZiFsLFHEI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23148621/OnePlus_10_Pro_150__Ultra_wide_Portrait_Watermarked.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The view from OnePlus’ new ultrawide lens is very wide indeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ek8K6j"&gt;On the hardware side, there’s a new ultrawide camera sensor with an extreme 150-degree field of view — somewhere in the ballpark of 5mm in 35mm terms. If you want to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; go for a dramatic shot, this lens can be used in combination with a new fisheye mode. For a slightly narrower view, the ultrawide offers a 110-degree mode, which is closer to the 14mm equivalent offered by the 9 and 9 Pro, and uses AI distortion correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCzpZB"&gt;There’s one more hardware change to note: it looks like OnePlus dropped the monochrome camera. This was a low-resolution chip that was included in previous models to assist when shooting black-and-white images. That was the claim, anyway. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"&gt;struggled to find it making any difference&lt;/a&gt; in monochrome images and my colleague Jon Porter has bemoaned its existence for years, describing it at turns as “baffling” and “pointless.” The renders of the 10 Pro that we’ve seen thus far show three useful-looking cameras along with a flash and nothing that looks like a little monochrome sensor in sight. If that’s the case: farewell, monochrome camera, we hardly knew what ye did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XaGyd"&gt;Outside of camera updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs"&gt;what we’ve learned about the OnePlus 10 Pro so far&lt;/a&gt; is not surprising at all. It will come with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, a 120Hz screen, and 50W wireless charging — in line with previous OnePlus flagships and checking all the “2022 Android flagship” boxes. It’s due to launch on January 11th in China with availability in other regions later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S22 lineup takes shape in unofficial leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/32zktFFnAMLjHdM6OpQD25akSMk=/0x0:1566x1044/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70353729/s22_lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, the Galaxy S22 Ultra, S22 Plus, and S22.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Unbox Therapy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAWmRy"&gt;A video from Unbox Therapy has shown off what appears to be three dummy units of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S22 series of phones, giving an early look at the design of the handsets. Although the video has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qhk3Wfc3Ps"&gt;now been delisted&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHJ34Bbu8OI"&gt;reuploaded on other channels&lt;/a&gt;, and a screenshot was &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/05/galaxy-s22-size-leak-video/"&gt;taken by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The video emerged alongside other details of the upcoming phones, including camera specs, and images of a new fast charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUhauT"&gt;This isn’t the first time footage of Galaxy S22 dummy units has leaked online. Twitter leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1470530973712498692"&gt;OnLeaks posted similar footage&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of last month. Unbox Therapy’s video appears to corroborate these previous designs, and also shows the handsets more clearly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TDpQqH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Well, OK... &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Samsung?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Samsung&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS22?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS22&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS22Plus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS22Plus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS22Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS22Ultra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dummy?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Dummy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/CD8rnHhStx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CD8rnHhStx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1470530973712498692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Do48z1"&gt;The three handsets shown in Unbox Therapy’s video are thought to be the S22 Ultra, the S22 Plus, and the regular S22, though these names may not be final. The S22 and S22 Plus appear to have similar designs to last year’s S21 devices, with camera bumps across the top left side of their backs. Both dummy units appear to have triple camera setups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWMgTH"&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xeetechcare/status/1478674235916980224"&gt;leaked spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; suggests the regular S22 will have a more compact 6.1-inch display (the S21, for reference, had a 6.2-inch display). This compares to a reported &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s22-plus-design-renders-exclusive/"&gt;6.55-inch display for the S22 Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Previous reports suggest &lt;a href="https://zouton.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s22-2021-exclusive-launch-edition-price-renders-design"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; will have a 50-megapixel main camera paired with extra ultra wide and telephoto cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cgt6ft"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;First Look at Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra / S22 Specs Sheet!   Introducing  SuperClear Lens!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/nyEFGrPtAH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nyEFGrPtAH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zaryab Khan (@xeetechcare) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xeetechcare/status/1478674235916980224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NfK032"&gt;In line with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;previous leak from last month&lt;/a&gt;, the S22 Ultra appears to have a very Galaxy Note-style design, with a squared off top and bottom and a built-in holder for an S Pen stylus. There’s also no camera bump around the phone’s reported four cameras. A leaked spec sheet suggests these will consist of a primary 108-megapixel sensor, a 12-megapixel ultrawide, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto, and a 10-megapixel 10x periscope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DsWeo"&gt;Interestingly, the spec sheet mentions that this main 108-megapixel sensor could have a lens made of “Super Clear Glass,” which appears to be branding for some kind of Gorilla Glass. In an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orxS9qJsRkY&amp;amp;t=4s"&gt;accompanying video&lt;/a&gt; to the spec sheet leak, Zaryab Khan speculates that this new lens could be designed to reduce the appearance of small bright dots that can appear in camera footage taken at night (a problem we’ve had &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/71m3SDGa220?t=760"&gt;with the iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, for example)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdi283"&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1478702640355844096"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s Roland Quandt&lt;/a&gt; has shared images of what appears to be a fast-charger for the S22 Ultra. It’s 45W and has just a single USB-C charging port, which suggests we might be looking at an increase in charging speeds compared to the 25W S21 Ultra (Samsung previously offered 45W charging on the Note 10 Plus). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U3thqf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's that 45W PD Charger for your new S22 Ultra (EP-T4510)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the pic I posted a while back for this was obviously the wrong one. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jZw8Gu4Giq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jZw8Gu4Giq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roland Quandt (@rquandt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1478702640355844096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="meDhOD"&gt;It’s currently unclear exactly when these phones might all be announced. Samsung launched the S21 series in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227561/samsung-galaxy-s21-event-news-announcements-biggest-products-unpacked"&gt;mid-January last year&lt;/a&gt;, but has typically opted for February launches for previous lineups. Given ongoing supply chain issues and a global chip shortage, it’s anyone’s guess as to when the S22 handsets may eventually make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is doing great, according to HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/StipGqIgGVVr1QwQ-4LfUd8v_Ww=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352645/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PMtWzM"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s latest subscriber figures make it seem like HBO and its sister service HBO Max are doing pretty well — great, even! In a &lt;a href="https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/atnt2/sec/sec-show.aspx?Type=html&amp;amp;FilingId=15462042&amp;amp;CIK=0000732717&amp;amp;Index=10000"&gt;regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt; this week, AT&amp;amp;T revealed that it beat its projected year-end goal with 73.8 million total subscribers between HBO and HBO Max (even after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738967/hbo-max-subscriptions-q3-2021-amazon-exit"&gt;breakup with Amazon&lt;/a&gt;). Not too bad, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83dm4C"&gt;But that win comes after a year of highly anticipated movie debuts meant to balloon subscriber numbers, and it’s still tens of millions of subscribers behind rivals like Disney Plus and Netflix. The numbers also come with some pretty big caveats. In other words, hold the applause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yogjgp"&gt;For one, AT&amp;amp;T’s figures (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/global/hbo-max-2021-subscriber-att-warnermedia-1235147025/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;) conflate two separate services — HBO, its cable business, and HBO Max, its streaming service — and they don’t distinguish how many subscribers each service has individually. WarnerMedia spokesperson Jaclyn Mandelbaum told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that more information “will be broken out in AT&amp;amp;T’s earnings in a couple weeks” but declined to specify figures for each service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CEJD0H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2021 should’ve been HBO Max’s year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AH0iOr"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s growth also looks less impressive given the high-profile content slate it served over the last year, including titles like &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;, and the third season of &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;. On top of that, HBO Max added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444063/hbo-max-ad-supported-tier-announced-pricing-release-date"&gt;lower-priced tier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278287/hbo-max-international-launch-june-2021-latin-america-europe-warnermedia-streaming"&gt;launched internationally&lt;/a&gt; partway through the year — both of which should have helped boost its subscribers substantially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VaM2I"&gt;Disney Plus added more than twice as many subscribers over a similar time period. Disney’s streaming service, which launched roughly six months before HBO Max, reported &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-earnings-for-fiscal-2021/"&gt;118.1 million paid subscribers&lt;/a&gt; as of October 2021, up from &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/disney-plus-hits-86-8-million-subscribers-1234850846/"&gt;73.7 million&lt;/a&gt; about a year earlier. HBO’s 73.8 million record, on the other hand, is only up from &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/q4_earnings_2020.html"&gt;61 million subscribers globally&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDW2u6"&gt;Streaming data is virtually impossible to tackle on a one-for-one comparison level for myriad reasons, not the least of which being that everyone is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;playing by different rules&lt;/a&gt;. That’s to say nothing of how piracy, account-sharing, and features like auto-play can significantly skew a truly accurate picture of subscriber and title success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXRAWN"&gt;Last year should’ve been HBO Max’s year to win. It’s going to have to find new ways to grow without the help of a highly anticipated day-and-date slate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HMD has five new sub-$250 Nokia phones coming to the US soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dXioUsd6x8fR5-uUDFXezX04piM=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70349795/HMD_New2022_Packshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, the Nokia 2760 Flip, C100, G400, C200, G100.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bvnagr"&gt;HMD, the company behind modern Nokia-branded phones, has announced five new “US exclusive” phones coming in the first half of this year. None of these are flagships: there’s only one 5G device, and all five are set to retail for under $250. HMD has also revived a classic Nokia design as a modern feature phone — the Nokia 2760 — a flip phone that inherits its name from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_2760"&gt;original 2007 handset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytpmPp"&gt;The company isn’t fully detailing the specs of the five phones today and says it plans to release this information closer to each handset’s launch. Instead, it’s emphasizing that the phones will be available across a wider range of US wireless providers, which now include Dish Wireless and Consumer Cellular in addition to T-Mobile and TracFone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hY2SVP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The original Nokia 2760 was released in 2007&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="czU073"&gt;In descending order of price, there’s the $239 G400, which is due for release in Q2. It’s a 5G phone with a triple rear camera array consisting of a 48-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro. Interestingly, its 6.6-inch display has a 120Hz refresh rate, which is relatively uncommon at this price point. It has a 5,000mAh battery and comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsgOp5"&gt;Then there’s the $149 G100, a 4G phone with a 6.5-inch display, 5,000mAh battery, and a fingerprint sensor built into the power button that’s also due for release in Q2. Both the G100 and G400 are part of HMD’s midrange G-series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAnGIm"&gt;HMD’s also bringing two phones to the accessible, value-focused Nokia C-series range. There’s the $99 C100 (due in Q1) and $119 C200 (releasing in Q2). The C100 has a relatively compact 5.45-inch display, a relatively low-resolution 8-megapixel rear camera, and a 3,000mAh battery. The C200 is slightly larger with a 6.1-inch display and has a bigger 4,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbvOIW"&gt;Finally, there’s the $79 Nokia 2760 Flip, a clamshell feature phone releasing in Q1. It’s running KaiOS, which offers a limited amount of smartphone-style services like Google Maps, and its focus is on durability and reliability with a target customer age of mainly 55 and above. There’s also an emergency button on its side that can be configured to call a contact and share your location, and a small external screen for notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
