    <title>OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro announced with Hasselblad-branded cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OeYXZgPJbIWfPECBK0-ELn27kws=/88x0:1048x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69011581/diEE3C19Xw.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xqNyHx"&gt;OnePlus has announced the first two phones in its OnePlus 9-series, the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro. As expected, the OnePlus 9 Pro is the flagship, designed to face off against the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra and the iPhone 12 Pro Max, while the OnePlus 9 is its lower-specced and slightly more affordable counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3vSdN"&gt;OnePlus spent much of its announcement talking about the cameras on the new phones, which have been developed in partnership with Hasselblad. OnePlus says the colors have been tuned to look more natural and that the ultrawide sensor on the 9 Pro is one of the biggest to ever ship on a smartphone. The ultrawide uses a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor that’s 1/1.56” in size with an aperture of f/2.2. Meanwhile, its main Sony IMX 789 sensor has a resolution of 48 megapixels and is 1/1.43” in size. There’s also a monochrome sensor and a 16-megapixel front-facing camera. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9CmT23"&gt;On the software side, OnePlus has added a Hasselblad Pro Mode that gives additional control over photography settings and includes a focus peaking feature. In terms of video, the 9 Pro can shoot at up to 8K at 30fps, or 4K at 120fps, and includes an enhanced Nightscape Video mode for filming in low light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUjVNj"&gt;As previously announced, the 9 Pro has a 120Hz display that makes use of LPTO technology to adjust its refresh rate between 1 and 120Hz based on the content being displayed on-screen, reducing power consumption by “up to 50 percent.” OnePlus also claims it should feel more responsive to use in games that support its Hyper Touch technology. The screen has a maximum brightness of 1300 nits, and supports HDR10+. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7Mplv"&gt;Internally, the 9 Pro are powered by a Snapdragon 888 processor, and has a new internal cooling system that OnePlus claims should keep it running cooler over longer periods. It supports Warp Charge 65T, which OnePlus claims should be able to charge the phone to 100 percent in under half an hour. It can also charge wirelessly at up to 50W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ljV9rx"&gt;In terms of colors, the OnePlus 9 Pro is available in black, silver, and green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RikYNP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re updating this post in real time with more information from the OnePlus event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pikmin is the next AR game from the makers of Pokémon Go</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qq-W4prKzzLKpAHXV4Nd-NaaLpU=/128x0:896x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69009287/Niantic_Nintendo_Pikmin_app.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AjIMq3"&gt;Niantic, developer of the smash hit &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, has announced a new partnership with Nintendo. The first new game from the collaboration will be a mobile augmented reality game based on Nintendo’s popular &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; franchise, and it will launch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyLthC"&gt;Details are thin right now, &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/nintendo-apps-partnership/?hl=en"&gt;but Niantic says that&lt;/a&gt; “the app will include gameplay activities to encourage walking and make walking more delightful.” If you want to receive more information about the new game as it’s available, &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/newappsignup/"&gt;you can sign up here&lt;/a&gt; to get updates. The new &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; AR game will be the first developed by Niantic’s Tokyo Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0mavJQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're overjoyed to make new memories with our partners at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; and YOU!    Imagine exploring the world through the wonder of AR and alongside all of your pals - including your new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pikmin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pikmin&lt;/a&gt; friends! Learn more about our partnership here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/TiQ10S8kMR"&gt;https://t.co/TiQ10S8kMR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/YUpp4P33NA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YUpp4P33NA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Niantic, Inc. (@NianticLabs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NianticLabs/status/1374148894028873729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="psSbcs"&gt;“Niantic’s AR technology has made it possible for us to experience the world as if &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; are secretly living all around us”, Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210323.html"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Based on the theme of making walking fun, our mission is to provide people a new experience that’s different from traditional games. We hope that the &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; and this app will become a partner in your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfadaI"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; franchise is all about exploring a very Earth-like planet with packs of the adorable Pikmin creatures, so a Niantic-made &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; game about walking and exploring the world around you makes a lot of sense. The latest game in the &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; series is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355506/pikmin-3-deluxe-nintendo-switch-release-date"&gt;Nintendo Switch’s &lt;em&gt;Pikmin 3 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an upgraded version of the 2013 game first released for the Wii U.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilQOxk"&gt;Niantic didn’t say what other games it will be making with Nintendo, but it sounds like the two companies have secured some kind of long-term partnership. “We’re honored that Nintendo has chosen Niantic to be its publisher of real-world AR applications,” Niantic said. More details about upcoming apps will be revealed “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5nAEJ"&gt;Niantic is best-known for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, the hugely popular mobile AR game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/6/12113802/pokemon-go-release-date-us-ios-android-app-available"&gt;released in July 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The game is still quite popular despite being nearly five years old, although Niantic has had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178230/pokemon-go-coronavirus-niantic-updates-temporary-discounts-inside"&gt;make some changes&lt;/a&gt; to the game while many have been staying inside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22189424/pokemon-go-covid-2020-safety"&gt;due to the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Those changes didn’t stop &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; from generating money hand over fist, however — 2020 was the game’s biggest year yet, surpassing $1 billion in revenue as of November, according to &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-one-billion-revenue-2020"&gt;app analytics firm Sensor Tower&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung is reportedly working on a double-folding phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2-rHBwDs0WYxMxmC5nGGhJcxcM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008123/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gBFX4j"&gt;Samsung is reportedly working on a double-folding phone to add to its lineup, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Samsung-bets-big-on-foldable-smartphones-amid-chip-crunch"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/22/samsung-double-folding-smartphone-report/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to the article, the phone would fold into three segments using two hinges and could be announced “as early as the end of this year.” The phone would be a third option in Samsung’s foldable lineup, joining the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260357/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-price-drop-1200"&gt;Z Flip&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are also expected to appear in new versions this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6Tzqm"&gt;According to the report, the design is still being finalized, but &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s sources say its screen could have a more standard 16:9 or 18:9 aspect ratio, making it easier for app makers to design for than the 25:9 screen found on the Z Fold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBZaI5"&gt;We’ve seen phones with multiple folds before: Xiaomi’s folding phone prototype &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194065/xiaomi-foldable-phone-tablet-device-teaser"&gt;folded at two points&lt;/a&gt;, but the company has &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/03/19/xiaomi-foldable-mi-mix-smartphone-leaks-real-skin/"&gt;reportedly adopted a more Galaxy Fold-like design&lt;/a&gt; for its upcoming foldable. Huawei’s Mate X2 foldable also uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;a similar design to Samsung’s&lt;/a&gt;. It would be a bit ironic, then, if Samsung’s working on a double-folding design after others adopted its single-fold style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bh1ED8"&gt;It’s possible that Samsung is introducing the new type of foldable to ease its power users into a transition to the form factor. Samsung says it might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;skipping a new Galaxy Note this year&lt;/a&gt; but wasn’t exactly clear on why. There was talk of streamlining its phone offerings and of the global chip shortage, but this could be a test to see if Note users are ready for the fold. By giving customers three foldable options to choose from, Samsung could be trying to make it as likely as possible that people will find one that works for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jl3OaD"&gt;It’s likely the multifold phone’s release will depend on whether Samsung can figure out how to navigate the chip shortages &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;that have been affecting the entire industry&lt;/a&gt;. Folding phones are already more difficult to make than standard smartphones, and if Samsung’s not able to get the chips it needs, it could push the company’s plans back. Still, it’s exciting to hear that Samsung is working on a third type of foldable, as it indicates that Samsung still sees the form factor as the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Poco’s new phones have new-ish Snapdragon processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mzt4Y7lQSTgD5NhCWmDF6E_REj0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005989/DSCF7676.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FXJ9tW"&gt;Xiaomi-owned Poco has returned with two new phones that have some notable processor choices at low prices. Both the X3 Pro and the F3 use new Qualcomm chips that are essentially updated and repurposed flagship-class processors from the past couple of years, which make them an interesting price-performance proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7002et"&gt;First up is the Poco X3 Pro (pictured above and below), which is essentially identical to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21426866/xiaomi-poco-x3-nfc-hands-on-price-specs-release"&gt;last year’s Poco X3 NFC&lt;/a&gt; but with a new processor. That means there’s still a 6.67-inch 120Hz 1080p LCD, a 5,160mAh battery with 33W fast charging, and a quad-camera setup headlined by a 48-megapixel primary sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO4fOD"&gt;What’s new is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 860 SoC, which hasn’t previously been announced. The processor appears to be a new version of the Snapdragon 855, Qualcomm’s flagship part from two years ago found in phones like the Galaxy S10 and the Pixel 4. It uses the same Kryo 485 core based on ARM’s Cortex-A76 CPU, but the clock speed has been slightly bumped to up to 2.96GHz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNOKrC"&gt;Poco describes the 860 as “the leading 4G flagship processor in 2021,” which doesn’t strike me as a field with a whole lot of competition. Still, it will likely outperform newer mid-range 5G chips like the 765.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/seAR_5vKNHpwmjslPQBEQtNKlH8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388255/DSCF7678.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OMJJS7"&gt;The Poco F3, meanwhile, is a higher-end device that’s one of the first phones to use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 870, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22233584/qualcomm-snapdragon-870-865-plus-refresh-processor-smartphones-2021"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a couple of months ago. The 870 is a similar idea to the 860 but based on the one-year-newer 865, which was Qualcomm’s highest-end chip in 2020. The CPU clock speed has again received a slight bump to a max of 3.2GHz. The 870 won’t be as fast as the 888, but another way to think of it is that it would’ve been the fastest Android phone chip in the world a couple of months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybBjzu"&gt;The F3 itself is a rebranded version of Xiaomi’s Redmi K40, which was recently released in China. It has a 6.67-inch 120Hz 1080p OLED display, a 4,520mAh battery with 33W fast charging, and a triple-camera setup including a 48-megapixel main sensor, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and what seems to be the same 5-megapixel “telemacro” found on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;the Xiaomi Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gh2NyF"&gt;Poco hasn’t announced full global release details yet, but the X3 Pro costs €199 for a model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (or €249 for 8GB/256GB), while the F3 is €299 for 6GB/128GB and €349 for 8GB/256GB. Those are early-bird prices — all models will be bumped up by €50 after April 1st for the X3 Pro and April 6th for the F3. Even after that, though, they look like very good value for their segment. Both phones will go on sale later this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash will let you order at-home COVID-19 testing kits delivered to your door</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iq-ByWCgYFEMr89hi7KUNXdg1PU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005664/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rwwgy8"&gt;DoorDash has partnered with two US-based digital health companies, Vault Health and Everlywell, to help distribute at-home COVID-19 test kits across the country, the company announced on Monday. The partnerships will allow DoorDash customers to order the testing kits directly from the company’s app in 12 markets or, conversely, to order the kits from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vaulthealth.com%2Fcovid&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22340706%2Fdoordash-covid-home-testing-kits-delivery-vault-health-everlywell" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vault Health’s website&lt;/a&gt; in 20 markets with same-day delivery from DoorDash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ8N9x"&gt;Both kits contain polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which is a molecular test and considered the most accurate of the testing varieties on the market. Both kits have also received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for at-home testing. The Everlywell testing kit ($109) is a self-administered nasal swab that can be done unsupervised, while the Vault Health kit ($119) is a saliva test that involves supervision from a staffer over Zoom. Both companies promise to return results within 24 to 48 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P4I_CNNHLXjnkCyXjuu2DR-ZMY4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388449/PRImage_COVIDTests.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DoorDash&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HC5VXK"&gt;The markets supported by the DoorDash app include Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Minneapolis, and Phoenix, with more cities to be added soon, the company says. Vault Health’s direct online order option will be supported in Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and San Diego, among other markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dUolQ"&gt;The initiative is part of DoorDash’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355625/doordash-dashmart-convenience-store-launch-snacks-groceries"&gt;DashMart convenience store platform&lt;/a&gt;, a new type of virtual marketplace the company launched last summer as the pandemic was in full swing. DashMarts act similar to a CVS or 7-Eleven but they’re available at all hours of the day from the DoorDash app for ordering convenience store items, light food and groceries, and other products you’d typically find at a corner store or pharmacy. The stores also source from a variety of different vendors, so there’s just not one list of limited inventory to choose  from. In some cases, DoorDash even sources local restaurants’ products to give DashMart the feel of a boutique store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixwCgZ"&gt;Now, in addition to buying supplies, food, and other items, you’ll also be able to start buying COVID-19 testing kits in what DoorDash is positioning as a push into health products. “Amidst the pandemic, one of our priorities has been to make health and wellness essentials more accessible for customers, with the goal of helping businesses leverage our last-mile logistics infrastructure to provide more convenient and timely access to their health supplies,” Anna Katherine Barnett-Hart, director of new verticals at DoorDash, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 9 will use Oppo’s ColorOS in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7XwIBdlAPYJmOqoLYs1M49tUHLQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69004315/DSCF7578.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1SW7p5"&gt;OnePlus is switching to ColorOS, the variant of Android used by Oppo smartphones, for its new OnePlus 9 series in China. The move was &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/update-about-operating-system-in-mainland-china.1404113/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on OnePlus’ forums by Gary C, the product lead on OxygenOS, which is what OnePlus phones use in the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8Q2ai"&gt;“As a global technology company, we always look for ways to address the different usage habits and preferences among our users worldwide,” Gary C says. “We truly believe this customized new operating system will bring our Chinese users a software experience that is better suited to their liking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEE3J4"&gt;This doesn’t change anything for the global OnePlus 9 series that’s set to be unveiled in full tomorrow — it’ll still run OxygenOS. But it does appear to spell the end for HydrogenOS, which is the China-specific version of Android that OnePlus had previously been using for all of its phones that shipped in the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5wY7Q4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus is spoiling its 9 and 9 Pro keynote with early reveals, and here’s the TL;DR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334396/oneplus-9-march-23rd-event-rumor-announcement-roundup-smartwatch-cameras"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5NZ1B6"&gt;ColorOS is already used by a lot more people in China than HydrogenOS; Oppo recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318941/china-smartphone-market-share-oppo-huawei-vivo-apple-xiaomi-january-2021"&gt;became the biggest smartphone brand&lt;/a&gt; in its home country for the first time. I’m using it full-time right now as I review Oppo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22324860/oppo-find-x3-pro-flagship-announced-10-bit-microlens-specs"&gt;new Find X3 Pro flagship&lt;/a&gt; (pictured above), and I generally find it to be sleek and performant. There’s no denying that HydrogenOS (and OxygenOS) provide a more minimalist experience, though — if that’s your thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsC11r"&gt;Oppo and OnePlus are both owned by Chinese conglomerate BBK Electronics, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/15/17467348/oneplus-6-vs-oppo-r15-pro-vivo-bbk"&gt;sharing a supply chain and often critical technology&lt;/a&gt;. Realme, another BBK brand, also used ColorOS at first before developing its own software called Realme UI. The companies tend to publicly downplay the connection between themselves, but OnePlus deciding to use Oppo’s software outright is one of the more conspicuous examples of collaboration to date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google made an ASMR video about switching to a Pixel, and it’s stressing me out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDKhAfQ3Ycg56xdYMgMG8uA0lgA=/0x0:1969x1313/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68995581/googlecommercial.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Bd3L0"&gt;You can switch from your old phone to a new Google Pixel, or you can close your eyes, breathe, and then &lt;em&gt;mindfully switch to a new Google Pixel&lt;/em&gt;. Sorry, I’m trying to force myself into the higher plane of existence that the narrator of this new ad-meets-ASMR meditation session from Google is on, and the edibles haven’t kicked in yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjb4ia"&gt;The video above guides you through the process of getting all of your data onto a new Pixel, with meditative advice laid atop a slideshow of gorgeous vistas. It’s relaxing at first, but don’t take it too seriously. The chill vibes eventually give way to a cutting line of existential dread that then pivots the video completely into cringey meme territory. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LrkFbgy0h8qW7M4sBWIazuDFQjo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383430/googlecommercial.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just a snippet of one-liners from the video to quickly get you in the zone in case you don’t have time to watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KRZfCk"&gt;What follows is a lightly edited transcript of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Slack after editor Chris Welch pasted in the link with the ever-appropriate reaction “...what.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4sm2U"&gt;Me: this is actually very stressful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ozk2mF"&gt;Chaim Gartenberg: friiiiiiiiiiday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECllL5"&gt;Chaim: powerful friday brand energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ri7T4a"&gt;Chaim: also we should 1000 percent tldr this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZBa8T"&gt;Sean O’Kane: cameron you’re right there is something really stressful about this lol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Pm7AS"&gt;Mitchell Clark: What is this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yfIah"&gt;Sean: I’ll have what google’s having&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1G89zT"&gt;Chris Welch: is that.... God.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unconfirmed: God may have appeared in this Google Pixel ad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TooxEi"&gt;Me: bruh...maybe...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lensr5"&gt;Dan Seifert: big palm pre commercial vibes&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus is spoiling its 9 and 9 Pro keynote with early reveals, and here’s the TL;DR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OV53Mvzvvg87ojtCoEn9BsAjJIU=/112x0:1843x1154/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986485/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_10.38.59_AM.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3I8qce"&gt;OnePlus will be formally announcing the 9 and 9 Pro phones, a smartwatch, and a blazing-fast wireless charger on March 23rd — but why wait? OnePlus definitely isn’t: it’s been spoiling its own announcements nonstop on Twitter, YouTube, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22335032/oneplus-9-pro-fast-wireless-charging"&gt;right here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. One day, the CEO will tweet out which processor the phone will use; the next, the company will upload &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1371427524027113473?s=20"&gt;pictures of the phone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1371430983409541120?s=20"&gt;multiple angles&lt;/a&gt;! If you haven’t been keeping up, we’ve compiled all the... leaks? Mini-announcements? in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VbxpkT"&gt;Confirmed by OnePlus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WmyBTC"&gt;OnePlus has been in the habit lately of trying to build up suspense for its events, which is why you see it and its executives just tweeting out information about the phones. Here’s what we’ve learned from them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UOKA5i"&gt;There will be at least two phones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DDC87U"&gt;The OnePlus 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JiJSsB"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro, which will have a bigger camera and probably a bigger, better display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lhQqWR"&gt;There’s also a third, less expensive phone coming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4FWbbQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-lite-snapdragon-865-will-launch-alongside-oneplus-9-9-pro"&gt;There were rumors&lt;/a&gt; of a cheaper third phone, which OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338504/oneplus-9r-less-expensive-phone-confirmed-india-5g"&gt;has now confirmed will be called the 9R&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment, the company has only confirmed that the phone will be sold in India and that it will feature 5G. It’s also unclear if it will be announced at the March 23rd event or if it will be coming later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8N3qvy"&gt;Chargers? In the box&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kgVwo9"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau confirmed on a forum post that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319657/oneplus-9-charger-in-box-pete-lau-announcement"&gt;will be including a charger in the box&lt;/a&gt; with the 9-series phones, instead of going the route that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225930/samsung-galaxy-s21-no-charger-brick-headphones-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; have taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BKDz3r"&gt;The Pro will have 50W wireless charging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6LSMRg"&gt;OnePlus has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22099073"&gt;let &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;try the 9 Pro’s 50W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;, and it is indeed fast, charging the phone from 1 to 100 percent in 43 minutes. If you prefer charging with a cable, both the Pro and regular 9 will support 65W wired charging as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3IqcIH"&gt;OnePlus has already shown off the design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3qPDX1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/oneplus-says-screw-it-heres-the-oneplus-9-pro-photos-from-every-angle"&gt;Input has a collection&lt;/a&gt; of all the images that OnePlus has posted of the 9 Pro on Twitter, and there’s not a ton left to the imagination. It does, in fact, look like a smartphone, with USB-C port on the bottom, and a camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_J0Z-X41ti1g5WJVCjBt0YCtB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22377986/1_M00_22_12_rB8bwmBQEOWACzO_AAZ7LBXLBP0204.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hasselblad branding and a variety of lenses. The 9 is on the left, the 9 Pro on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Zo1q43"&gt;OnePlus is focusing on cameras&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9nfFNG"&gt;We know that the legendary camera company Hasselblad will be working on &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-9-exclusive-ceo-pete-lau-on-its-new-camera-and-whats-next"&gt;providing “color expertise” for the phones’ cameras&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus has been dropping subtle hints about the collaboration, like centering its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306934/oneplus-9-launch-event-date-moonshot-pete-lau"&gt;marketing material around the moon&lt;/a&gt; (when Apollo astronauts went to the moon, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise"&gt;they took Hasselblad cameras&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/oneplus-says-screw-it-heres-the-oneplus-9-pro-photos-from-every-angle"&gt;releasing pictures of the phones&lt;/a&gt;, which have the word “Hasselblad” written on the camera modules. And having a Hasselblad section on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Flaunch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F18%2F22334396%2Foneplus-9-march-23rd-event-rumor-announcement-roundup-smartwatch-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the phone’s launch page&lt;/a&gt;. Okay, maybe it’s not so subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2t2j5X"&gt;When it comes to the capabilities of those cameras, we can look at an &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-9-exclusive-ceo-pete-lau-on-its-new-camera-and-whats-next"&gt;interview Lau did with &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He talks about the phones working with Sony to make a custom IMX789 sensor (something he’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369304680241762311"&gt;also tweeted about&lt;/a&gt;) and mentions that they will be capable of shooting 4K at 120fps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsIHrY"&gt;What the camera capabilities of the 9 Pro versus the regular 9 are will probably have to wait for the official announcement — but the pictures released by OnePlus show that the Pro seems to have four cameras, where the regular only has three. As with past OnePlus phones, at least one of the cameras &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369304680241762311"&gt;will be an ultrawide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="T3LZsr"&gt;Of course, the phones will be 5G-capable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YLd2pZ"&gt;The OnePlus 8 series had 5G, and the 9 series will, too, as indicated by the “5G” superscript on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1371400783950970881"&gt;OnePlus’ announcement images&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K0JSrg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's an EXCLUSIVE look at the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnePlusWatch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OnePlusWatch&lt;/a&gt;... &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnePlus9Series?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OnePlus9Series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@oneplus&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;a href="https://t.co/tKBUcXkuth"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tKBUcXkuth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Unbox Therapy (@UnboxTherapy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UnboxTherapy/status/1372881459892084736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2vdq5B"&gt;There will be a smartwatch launched as well&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xYowLD"&gt;OnePlus has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339768/oneplus-watch-image-reveal-design-leak-smartwatch-wearable"&gt;revealed an image of the device&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/17/oneplus-watch-wear-os-confirmed/"&gt;confirmed that it won’t be running Google’s Wear OS&lt;/a&gt;. It also seems that all of the specs for the watch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1372072726500843522?s=20"&gt;have been leaked&lt;/a&gt;, though those aren’t officially confirmed by OnePlus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vXVuXF"&gt;The phones will use the Snapdragon 888&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VUJYho"&gt;OnePlus is continuing its tradition of including Qualcomm’s flagship-class processor, according to tweets &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1372193579674841090?s=20"&gt;from Lau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1372140664868208643?s=20"&gt;the OnePlus account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hXzd1h"&gt;What we know about the displays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FqInCT"&gt;Lau also tweeted out most of the details about the 9 Pro’s display:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jQovJ1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just the rundown: &lt;br&gt;LTPO&lt;br&gt;QHD+ &lt;br&gt;Smart 120Hz &lt;br&gt;Native 10-bit color depth (1.07 billion colors)&lt;br&gt;1300 nits&lt;br&gt;MEMC&lt;br&gt;HDR10+&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Lau (@PeteLau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1371817947694514176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aam7r6"&gt;LTPO displays &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;can run at different refresh rates&lt;/a&gt; depending on the content being displayed, meaning that the OnePlus 9 screens should be able to sip power when displaying static images, but still provide smooth animations &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1371830276926668801?s=20"&gt;at 120Hz when you’re actually using the phone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; has already seen &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/exclusive-first-test-results-of-the-radical-oneplus-9-pro-display"&gt;in-depth testing results&lt;/a&gt; from the Pro’s screen, showing its power usage, and 360Hz touch-polling rate, which should lead to improved responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71ix5v"&gt;Also new to the Pro is a 10-bit display which should, in theory, show colors more accurately. Otherwise, it’s packing many of the same features as the screen on the OnePlus 8 Pro, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"&gt;is not a complaint&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, unless you don’t like big screens — &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/exclusive-first-test-results-of-the-radical-oneplus-9-pro-display"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Pro’s display is 6.7 inches, the same size as an iPhone Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nWX31N"&gt;Colors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="almzN5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1371400783950970881"&gt;We’ve officially seen&lt;/a&gt; the Pro’s “morning mist” (silver) and regular OnePlus 9’s “winter mist” (purple) colors, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="456Leu"&gt;Left to the Imagination (and leaks)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="u71pvB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323979/oneplus-9-pro-leak-images-hasselblad-camera"&gt;There have also been leaks showing off other colors&lt;/a&gt;, like a forest green on the Pro, and a blue for the regular OnePlus 9. And of course, there are black versions of each phone as well. (I anxiously await to see if OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230934/samsung-galaxy-s21-phantom-black-phone-color"&gt;makes a big deal about it in the presentation&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IB9KKz"&gt;The Regular 9 will have a (slightly) smaller screen than the Pro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QE1Lvf"&gt;While OnePlus officially shared the Pro’s screen size with &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, the details of the regular 9 weren’t mentioned. &lt;a href="http://www.slashleaks.com/l/oneplus-9-key-specs-leaked-through-aida64"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slashleaks &lt;/em&gt;rumors&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be 6.55 inches, and have a slightly lower resolution of 1080 x 2400, as opposed to the 1440 x 3216 reported for the Pro by &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bD7qLf"&gt;
&lt;p id="IkhucV"&gt;It seems that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau"&gt;its CEO&lt;/a&gt; are going to be posting more details on Twitter during the lead-up to the event, but at this point, it seems like we’ve got a good outline of what the phones will be like. Now, it’s just waiting until March 23rd at 10AM ET to have the details filled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WucYt2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 19th, 3:03PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moved the budget OnePlus 9R from the rumored section to the known section, as it has been confirmed by OnePlus. Also added the smartwatch reveal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus CEO announces there will be a third, less-expensive phone called the OnePlus 9R</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVfLkW2GbidnSi3b0DwDHMPALOA=/0x0:534x356/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68990435/1616062102_oneplus_9r.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UbXIal"&gt;A third phone in the upcoming OnePlus 9 series has been confirmed by the company’s CEO, in &lt;a href="https://www.news18.com/news/tech/exclusive-oneplus-9r-signals-return-of-the-flagship-killer-gaming-credentials-and-made-for-india-3547673.html"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;News18&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/18/oneplus-ceo-confirms-affordably-priced-oneplus-9r-coming-to-india/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The announcement, which is coming just five days before the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334396/oneplus-9-march-23rd-event-rumor-announcement-roundup-smartwatch-cameras"&gt;OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro are set to be fully revealed&lt;/a&gt;, confirms rumors that OnePlus would also be announcing a less expensive phone in addition to its new flagships. So far, though, the phone is only confirmed to be coming to India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJZe5R"&gt;In the interview, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau says that the company wants “to go even further” than it did with the OnePlus Nord, in regards to the included tech and design. Depending on how closely you follow OnePlus, you may remember the Nord as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;mid-range phone that was available in Europe and India&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;as a budget phone released in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Which part of the price-to-performance spectrum OnePlus is targeting isn’t clear yet, though some of Lau’s comments indicate that it may be closer to the mid-range end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MPEI7P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We expect gaming phones to be specced out with the latest and greatest&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YngCTR"&gt;He says the phone will feature 5G, and talks &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; about gaming in relation to the 9R, saying that the company wants the phone to provide “fast and smooth experiences” for “heavy gameplay.” The “smooth experiences” and “smooth scrolling” references suggest that, like with its recent budget phones, OnePlus will probably include a 90Hz or faster display. As for the gaming focus, that may be more of a marketing focus than a hardware one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPfgl2"&gt;The 9R &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-lite-snapdragon-865-will-launch-alongside-oneplus-9-9-pro"&gt;is rumored to have a Snapdragon 865&lt;/a&gt;, a processor from last year — where usually we expect gaming phones to be specced out with the latest and greatest chips. For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;ROG Phone 5&lt;/a&gt; has the Snapdragon 888, up to 18GB of RAM, and a 144Hz screen. None of that is exactly cost-friendly, so perhaps OnePlus’s claims that it’ll be for heavy gamers should be taken with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84HkgV"&gt;The rest of the interview is light on concrete details, with Lau not talking about pricing or availability outside of India, but it does give an idea of what OnePlus is thinking about for the 9R. With the event just around the corner, it may not long before we find out for sure. If you’re curious about the higher-end 9 and 9 Pro, you can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334396/oneplus-9-march-23rd-event-rumor-announcement-roundup-smartwatch-cameras"&gt;our pre-announcement information roundup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS developer who drew attention to App Store scams is now suing Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8VOytbQjhwM4pNFyhhTl9_Tr0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986294/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Be9Nie"&gt;Mobile app developer Kosta Eleftheriou, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;publicly called out Apple earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for negligence with regard to policing iOS scams and copycat apps on the App Store, has filed a lawsuit against the iPhone maker in California. He’s accusing the company of exploiting its monopoly power over iOS apps “to make billions of dollars in profits at the expense of small application developers and consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6IHJA"&gt;Eleftheriou’s company KPAW LLC, which he co-owns with his partner Ashley Eleftheriou, filed its complaint in Santa Clara County on Wednesday. It details the development and release timeline of Eleftheriou’s Apple Watch keyboard app FlickType. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jIZ8V"&gt;At the time he began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;accusing Apple of abetting App Store scams&lt;/a&gt; early last month, Eleftheriou revealed that his FlickType app had been targeted by competing software he says either didn’t work well or didn’t work at all, and yet nonetheless chipped away at this sales and App Store rankings through false advertising and the purchase of fake reviews. After he complained, he said Apple did not do enough to combat the scams, though Apple did later remove some of the apps he called attention to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bTOuKZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The App Store has a big problem &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You: an honest developer, working hard to improve your IAP conversions.&lt;br&gt;Your competitor: a $2M/year scam running rampant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/ &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iCwzu7"&gt;Eleftheriou’s claims join a chorus of growing complaints against Apple and the App Store. Some developers, competing tech companies, regulators, and now state lawmakers have accused the mobile marketplace of being a monopoly in software distribution that harms competition and keeps consumers paying higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SngFHz"&gt;Epic Games, the maker of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;targeting both Apple and Google with antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; over the removal of the battle royale game last summer for use of an alternative in-app payment system. Meanwhile, a group of app makers, ranging from Epic to Spotify to Tinder parent company Match Group, have begun lobbying state lawmakers to take up the fight against the App Store and Google Play Store, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;surprising success so far in Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and numerous other bills around the country in the works, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mff1OQ"&gt;In the complaint, Eleftheriou goes further into detail about what he claims is wrongful behavior from Apple, including alleged false advertising, breach of its developer agreement, and fraud. One notable claim involves Apple trying to acquire FlickType, after which Eleftheriou says he faced “roadblock after roadblock” to selling his software on the App Store. The complaint suggests Apple chose not to take action on scam and copycat apps in an effort to force Eleftheriou to sell his app to Apple. “Evidently, Apple thought Plaintiff would simply give up and sell its application to Apple at a discount,” the complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cakQJk"&gt;At the heart of the dispute appears to be conversations Eleftheriou had with an Apple executive Randy Marsden, who led mobile keyboard technology at the company and later held the position of Text Input Special Projects Manager. Marsden is well known in the tech industry for co-founding the keyboard technology startup Swype, and for later co-founding the app Dryft, which was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/apple-quietly-bought-dryft-a-keyboard-app/"&gt;acquired by Apple in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The acquisition resulted in Marsden being put in charge of the iOS keyboard at Apple from 2014 to 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MGygaY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple systematically flexes its monopoly muscle against potential competition through the App Store”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G8H2CO"&gt;Eleftheriou says he was approached by Marsden, who expressed interest in having Apple acquire his software to improve typing on the Apple Watch. Yet, the negotiations went quiet, and afterward, Eleftheriou claims Apple removed his FlickType keyboard app and refused to approve future versions as well as a note-taking variant, on what he thinks are suspicious grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mu2UYd"&gt;Only later did Apple permit both apps after months of appeals and after Eleftheriou let countless other app makers integrate his technology. Those apps using the FlickType tech were approved without issue, the complaint says. Meanwhile, many other wearable and mobile keyboard apps Eleftheriou characterizes as scams were also approved and allowed on the App Store. “By this time, Apple’s wrongful rejections had already cost Plaintiff over a year of revenue,” the complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="462hBJ"&gt;Eleftheriou’s complaint says this is evidence of Apple “flexing its monopoly muscle against potential competition”: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="z21d1N"&gt;Apple entices software application developers like Plaintiff to develop innovative applications with the promise of a fair and secure App Store in which to sell them. In truth, Apple systematically flexes its monopoly muscle against potential competition through the App Store and profits from rampant fraudulent practices. If Apple cannot buy a desired application from a developer on the cheap, Apple attempts to crush that developer through exploitive fees and selective application of opaque and unreasonable constraints against the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXDx4A"&gt; At the same time, Apple permits other developers that Apple does not view as real competition, including scam competitors, to peddle similar, inferior products because Apple profits from their sales. Scammers oftentimes use screenshots and videos taken from legitimate developer’s applications and manipulate their ratings. Apple does little to police these practices because it profits from them. Apple then lies to its regulators by asserting that it must maintain its monopoly power over the sale of Apple-related applications to protect consumers, when, in fact, Apple lets them get ripped off and exploits the developers trying to deliver innovation to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="A9h9uq"&gt;Eleftheriou says even after his app became the No. 1 paid app on the App Store after it was approved, earning him $130,000 in its first month of release, he had to face down a wave of scam apps and copycat software that targeted FlickType after its visible success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oiHVGV"&gt;“Despite possessing massive resources and technological savvy, Apple intentionally fails to police these fraudsters, costing honest developers millions, and perhaps billions, while Apple continues to amass huge profits for itself,” the complaint reads. “Apple holds both its device users and developers hostage. Yet each time it faces antitrust claims, Apple justifies its monopoly by claiming it is necessary to protect its users and developers from unscrupulous conduct and ensure a fair competitive marketplace for the benefit of both. In truth, Apple turns a blind eye to rampant fraud and exploitation to make an easy profit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZuPiN"&gt;Eleftheriou is accusing Apple of false advertising, unfair competition in violation of California’s business and professions code, breach of good faith and fair dealing with regard to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, fraud, and negligence and negligent misrepresentation. &lt;/p&gt;
