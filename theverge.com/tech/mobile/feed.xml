    <title>OnePlus updates its midrange Nord with new processor and a headphone jack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFsKI0A7E2BNkz8JgQoLdp3_6po=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433448/OnePlus_Nord_CE_5G.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord CE 5G will be available in black, blue, and silver.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OPgJcu"&gt;OnePlus has announced a new addition to its lineup of midrange phones, the Nord CE. According to the company, the “CE” stands for “Core Edition,” an indication that the company is focusing on the fundamentals, rather than inflating the device’s spec sheet with unnecessary extras. The phone is launching in Europe and India, and there are no plans for a US release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egSlyU"&gt;What this focus on the fundamentals means in practice is that the Nord CE is slightly stripped down compared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;last year’s Nord&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s slightly higher-specced than its predecessor, too. So you’re getting a higher-resolution 64-megapixel main camera (up from 48 megapixels), but there are only three rear sensors in total. (There’s also an 8-megapixel ultrawide with a 119-degree field of view and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor.) The Nord CE also only has a single 16-megapixel selfie camera, with no secondary ultrawide like the original Nord. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QOENK9aP_B8wGZ-Jdf9g3RrqxqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650055/Nord_CE_all_three_colours.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone features a very similar design to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mMJRZa"&gt;Internally, there’s a Snapdragon 750G powering this year’s model, compared to the 765G in last year’s phone. OnePlus claims its CPU is 20 percent faster, while its GPU is 10 percent faster. That’s paired with a choice of 6, 8, or 12GB of RAM, although these options vary slightly based on region. There’s a 4,500mAh battery inside the Nord CE, up from 4,115mAh last year, and the phone supports Warp Charge 30T Plus fast charging, which OnePlus says should charge you from 0 to 70 percent in half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naiktt"&gt;Externally, the Nord CE looks very similar to its predecessor. It’s got a very similarly styled camera bump on the back left (though with three rather than four cameras) and a hole-punch for its selfie camera on the front of the phone (again, with one rather than two cameras). However, on the bottom of the phone, you’ll find a headphone jack, which was missing from last year’s device. In terms of display, the Nord CE comes with a 6.43-inch 90Hz 1080p OLED panel. The phone is available in blue, black, or silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7n6EZm"&gt;The Nord CE will be available to preorder in limited quantities from OnePlus itself starting today in the UK, and these devices will ship on June 14th. The device goes on general sale on June 21st. In the UK, it starts at £299 (€329) for the model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and £369 (€399) for the model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. In Europe, there’s a version with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which will retail for €299. Those prices are slightly cheaper than the original Nord, which started at £379 (€399) for its 8GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzkoZL"&gt;Like the original Nord, OnePlus says it doesn’t have plans to release the Nord CE in the US. Instead, the US has the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522711/oneplus-n200-5g-specs-screen-price"&gt;OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; to look forward to. It’s a successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;N100&lt;/a&gt; that OnePlus CEO Pete Lau recently confirmed will retail for under $250.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung pushes pixel size even further with new camera sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vySmsQbNA_U2A2teUKK3ia92SYs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69432122/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gnuK0M"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005959/en/Samsung-Breaks-New-Ground-with-Mass-Production-of-Industry%E2%80%99s-Smallest-0.64%CE%BCm-pixel-Mobile-Image-Sensor/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new image sensor for smartphone cameras that it says has the smallest pixels in the industry. The ISOCELL JN1 is a 50-megapixel sensor with a relatively tiny 1/2.76-inch format, meaning its pixels are just 0.64μm in size. For comparison, Samsung already broke records in 2019 with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/23/20881141/samsung-isocell-slim-gh1-sensor-smallest-pixels"&gt;slightly larger ISOCELL Slim GH1&lt;/a&gt;, another 50-megapixel sensor with 0.7μm pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfAXUh"&gt;Conventional camera wisdom says that smaller pixels usually result in worse image quality with higher noise, so why is Samsung doing this? According to the company, it’s about form factor versatility. The sensor’s smaller size means it can be used in ultrawide or telephoto camera modules — which are challenging to design when size is at a premium — or as a way to reduce the height of the primary camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJukvb"&gt;As with other high-resolution camera sensors, the JN1 will make use of pixel-binning technology that combines multiple pixels into one for higher light sensitivity. In this case, Samsung says the sensor will capture 12.5-megapixel photos with the equivalent of 1.28μm pixels, and the company is also claiming a 16 percent boost to light sensitivity with its ISOCELL 2.0 tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCaixq"&gt;Unusually, Samsung even held a full-on live-streamed launch event for this sensor, which you can watch here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gisJ1C"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aai2Ux2Wsnk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SI2Dcz"&gt;Samsung says the JN1 is currently in mass production, so it’s likely to show up in smartphones before too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNgiei"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Moto G Stylus 5G is a step-up version of our favorite budget stylus phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y6xaGFnsQTnJYX_FLp51TJpPa0Y=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69427223/moto_g_stylus_5G_Cosmic_Emerald_Hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Stylus 5G features a 6.8-inch screen and a large 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9MXtRt"&gt;Motorola has announced the Moto G Stylus 5G, a new version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;very good, non-5G budget-friendly stylus phone&lt;/a&gt;. It offers broadly similar hardware to the 4G version, with notable exceptions in the new Snapdragon 480 5G chipset with sub-6GHz 5G connectivity and a bigger 5,000mAh battery. Priced at $399, it’s at the higher end of the budget range and will go on sale June 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rH8DV4"&gt;Like its 4G peer, the G Stylus 5G features a large 6.8-inch 1080p screen, ready for your notes and doodles courtesy of a built-in stylus. It includes 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and ships with Android 11. There’s a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a charging brick is included in the box. The Stylus 5G is a little bigger and heavier than the 4G version, but not by much — it’s about four grams heavier and 0.3mm thicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iVBHoG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10597540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSK7b6"&gt;The G Stylus 5G offers a rear triple-camera array that’s very similar to the 4G G Stylus’, with a 48-megapixel f/1.7 standard wide, 8-megapixel ultrawide, and 5-megapixel macro, plus a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Around front, there’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IitoSD"&gt;The G Stylus 5G isn’t the most aggressively priced 5G phone in the budget market. OnePlus says its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522711/oneplus-n200-5g-specs-screen-price"&gt;upcoming N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; will cost less than $250, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling for $279. It’s also surprising to see the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Snapdragon 480 5G chipset&lt;/a&gt; used here, since it’s intended for more affordable 5G devices well under the Stylus 5G’s $400 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaIEjl"&gt;On the other hand, the G Stylus 5G is quite a bit cheaper than the other prominent 5G phone with a built-in stylus, the $999 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506471/samsung-galaxy-note-20-review-price-stylus"&gt;Galaxy Note 20&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to look at things that way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus to launch stripped-down Nord CE 5G this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NWp7rWH46bNOfBLD1RWCi9PNoko=/0x0:864x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426437/nce5g.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OnePlus Nord CE 5G. | OnePlus via TechRadar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tUkr43"&gt;OnePlus is planning to announce a new budget smartphone called the Nord CE 5G this week. &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; has a render of the device &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/exclusive-oneplus-nord-ce-design-first-look-and-how-oneplus-designed-it"&gt;straight from OnePlus itself&lt;/a&gt;, showing that, well, it looks quite a lot like the original OnePlus Nord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkjv80"&gt;The CE 5G, however, will be a little cut back in terms of specs. OnePlus’ product head Oliver Zhang tells &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; that CE stands for “Core Edition” and refers to a design philosophy where the company had a goal of “distilling the product down to the most important things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUiITm"&gt;“You see mid-range phones on the market with very exaggerated specifications,” Zhang says. “We actively avoided some of those features and kept the things we felt would really make a difference to the daily smartphone experience, like fast charging (Warp Charge 30T Plus), a 90Hz AMOLED display, or 5G.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q16nzR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Nord review: the right compromises","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UMUIiF"&gt;OnePlus itself has been guilty of these “exaggerated specifications” in the past — the original Nord, for example, had a “quad-camera” setup that included a 2-megapixel macro camera and depth sensor of dubious utility. The Nord CE 5G, on the other hand, makes do with three cameras on the back. That camera proposition, as well as the CE 5G’s processor and price, will be key to the product’s appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ch34QH"&gt;Evleaks has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1402400286937960448"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; several leaked images and a video of the Nord CE 5G, revealing some more features like a 64-megapixel main camera, 7.9mm thickness, and — unlike the original Nord — a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yluuKP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;OnePlus Nord Core Edition 5G &lt;a href="https://t.co/9ovnqoXxKL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9ovnqoXxKL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1402400286937960448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FgGeMi"&gt;The full reveal is happening tomorrow, June 10th, at 10PM ET. The Nord CE 5G is being targeted at the European and Indian markets, according to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s first folding Pixel is apparently still on track for a 2021 reveal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6nxU1r"&gt;Google may have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22448165/google-samsung-wearable-partnership-wear-os-tizen-merge-smartwatch"&gt;shied away from a Pixel Watch&lt;/a&gt;, but a Pixel Fold still very much seems to be on the way — following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356760/foldable-google-pixel-q4-2021-leaked-internal-document-5-5a-4a-5g"&gt;a leak last August&lt;/a&gt; that revealed the company was planning to release its first folding Pixel phone in late 2021, Korean industry site &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; is now reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung will begin production of folding OLED panels this October for Google, Vivo and Xiaomi’s upcoming folding phones, all of which will reportedly be revealed late this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAfTpk"&gt;Google hasn’t exactly kept its folding phone ambitions a secret; in 2019, it published patent applications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266257/google-folding-bending-screen-display-patent"&gt;for its own folding screens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535863/google-pixel-foldable-phone-prototype-samsung-galaxy-fold-io-2019"&gt;admitted it had been prototyping them for quite some time&lt;/a&gt;, telling &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; that it didn’t have “a clear use case yet.” But now, it appears Google has a foldable, codename “Passport,” that could be nearly ready to announce. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/18/android-12-beta-model-numbers-pixel-6-family-passport-foldable/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; even spotted a new reference&lt;/a&gt; to it last month in Android 12’s code, alongside other codenames believed to be the upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 5a 5G. &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; says it’ll have a single 7.6-inch panel that folds inward, while Vivo’s upcoming phone will have a 8-inch main screen and a 6.5-inch outer display. It didn’t mention the size of the new Xiaomi phone’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uSRFA"&gt;It’s not clear whether a Pixel Fold would actually come with a display designed by Google itself, though it’s possible; Samsung acts as a contract manufacturer for many other companies, producing some of Apple’s homegrown processors as one example. Either way, one portion of the screen’s sandwich may still largely belong to Samsung itself: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ETNews &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung will supply its proprietary ultra-thin cover glass (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;which is technically made by German manufacturer Schott&lt;/a&gt;) to other smartphone manufacturers, and Google is expected to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DNbiiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Folding glass: how, why, and the truth of Samsung’s Z Flip","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2vekEL"&gt;Xiaomi already announced a folding phone earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;the Mi Mix Fold&lt;/a&gt;, but it sounds like it’ll have a second one. &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; also reports Oppo will be delaying a new foldable phone to 2022, with a 7.1-inch main screen and a smaller outer one between 1.5 and 2 inches diagonally.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJXKRU687lH-RGE7OuYMUCbW5qA=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418050/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1XcSmT"&gt;As expected, Apple offered a preview of iOS 15 at today’s WWDC 2021 keynote, highlighting some changes coming to FaceTime and notifications, as well as more privacy controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a31hjb"&gt;FaceTime gets some major updates, with spatial audio that reflects the speaker’s location on-screen, and voice isolation to help reduce distracting background noise. Portrait mode’s blurred backgrounds can also be used in FaceTime, and users can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;share music and videos during calls&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also possible now to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;include Android users on FaceTime&lt;/a&gt; with a shareable link that opens the call in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jmbj3hvnqDaBOFCsr2YZVLTMT-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643191/662_2021_06_07_662_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shareable links make it easier to schedule FaceTime calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="miGlYM"&gt;Notifications get a new look, with contact photos on text notifications and bigger app icons, and they will get new filter modes in iOS 15, called Focus. This allows you to customize which notifications appear during different activities, like while you’re working, and sync across all devices. You can set a custom home screen page with widgets and apps appropriate for your chosen Focus mode. There’s also an option to batch certain notifications and receive them as a digest at certain times of day as a summary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYkEgh_ery2zYr_RWSMglWUmKIA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643232/697_2021_06_07_697_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 15 offers more custom controls over notifications, like batch summaries and Focus modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vE5xTo"&gt;Messages gets a few updates, too. iOS 15 makes it possible for others to see when you’ve enabled Do Not Disturb mode by way of an automatic status update in Messages. It’s also possible to override Do Not Disturb for urgent messages. Photos shared in messages are automatically grouped into collages or stacks and will appear in other places like your photo gallery and memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgK87d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22502877/apple-app-privacy-report-ip-hiding-safari-mail-wwdc"&gt;Updated privacy controls&lt;/a&gt; in iOS 15 include a move to bring all Siri request processing on-device by default. Users will also get an App Privacy Report with a seven-day summary of how often apps accessed location information and your phone’s microphone or camera. Mail will also block tracking pixels commonly used in marketing emails to determine whether an email was opened and read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rrCgq"&gt;Other updates include the ability to search text in photos courtesy of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;new feature called LiveText&lt;/a&gt;, including the ability to search photos in Spotlight, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522951/apple-airpods-find-my-hearing-accesibility-notification-wwdc"&gt;AirPods audio updates&lt;/a&gt;, and the ability to locate AirPods Pro and AirPods Max using Find My. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/75mXKebWo8740_AmXOEjvnnFztk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643263/image__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Wallet can store ID info for TSA in iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Asxadc"&gt;Apple Wallet will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;support a wider range of items&lt;/a&gt;, like hotel room keys and relevant identification information for TSA. Memories get more customization options with different music track and transition options to change the feel of your video clips, and the weather app will display more information with new full-screen maps and a wider range of animated backgrounds. Maps gets some attention too, with “significantly enhanced details in cities” and a three-dimensional city driving view when using navigation on the phone or on CarPlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTYltu"&gt;Changes are coming to Safari are coming across the Apple ecosystem, including on iOS. It will offer a simpler tab bar design as well as support for grouped tabs that sync across all devices. Safari on iOS will also support browser extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qV47mQ"&gt;Apple says iOS 15 will arrive to the public this fall for iPhone 6s and newer, with a developer beta arriving today and a public beta next month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus confirms N200 5G details including 90Hz screen and sub-$250 price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/78z7U629aqkVsQHKY52wqcj411I=/0x46:1085x769/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417779/nord.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus has confirmed the N200 5G for North America, and has revealed a few key specs like a 90Hz screen to PCMag.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JIRX4k"&gt;OnePlus &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/more-accessible-5g-with-new-nord-devices.1444639/"&gt;recently confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that it would launch an affordable 5G device, the N200 5G, in North America, and has revealed a few more &lt;a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/mobile-phones/133795/exclusive-oneplus-ceo-reveals-n200-phone-details-official-photo"&gt;details — and a photo of the phone — to &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Most notably, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau says that the N200 5G will cost less than $250 and will include a 90Hz screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6BtwU"&gt;Lau says the N200 is “fully upgraded from OnePlus Nord N100,” a big-battery, budget 4G phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;launched in the US earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. He says that the N200 will get a 6.49-inch 1080p display, which will be a resolution boost from the N100’s 6.52-inch 720p screen. Its 90Hz refresh rate will make motion and animations on-screen appear a bit smoother than the standard 60Hz rate. It’s a feature not often seen in the budget class, outside of OnePlus’ own Nord N10 5G, also launched earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuwWt5"&gt;The N200 also appears to offer a camera array similar to the N100’s, with three rear cameras accompanied by a flash. OnePlus hasn’t confirmed an official launch date for the device yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6fkU25"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"OnePlus Nord N10 5G review: tall phone, small price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dYrpiN"&gt;For now, OnePlus appears to be focusing on bringing its high-end flagships like the OnePlus 9 Pro and low-end budget offerings like the N100 and N200 5G to North America, while reserving midrange phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; and upcoming Nord CE 5G for European and Indian markets. That’s a sensible approach, especially considering the gap in the affordable and prepaid device market that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375938/lg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola"&gt;LG is leaving in the wake of its departure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WWDC 2021: the latest news from Apple’s annual developer conference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TCrUKoPtLEfxKk5f50QlBAqtVzg=/184x0:807x415/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417646/hero_large.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What’s new in the Apple ecosystem?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="K28Qfi"&gt;Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, or WWDC, will run from June 7th through the 11th this year, with the main keynote set for June 7th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. Like last year, &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22085002"&gt;the event will be virtual&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s probably safe to expect another immaculately produced keynote video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFthrB"&gt;Apple is likely to announce updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It’ll be interesting to see what Apple does with the iPad and Mac especially; the iPad Pro is now powered by the same M1 chips as Apple’s best laptops, but its OS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396449/apple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021"&gt;arguably holds it back&lt;/a&gt;.  We’re also still waiting on the pro-focused MacBooks and iMacs. While the current versions are fast, they lack the ports and RAM capacity that professionals are looking for, so we’ll be on the lookout for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;rumored MacBook Pro refresh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QO3Ahi"&gt;We’ll be covering everything that happens on the day, and any news that comes out after, which you can catch up on here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First official images of Honor 50 look weirdly like Huawei’s P50</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/plOQ3XD0AxSEPiHDZ5RvXNmfK1A=/1x0:1231x820/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415268/E3RP8UBVgAAehBM.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1TvJra"&gt;Honor has released a couple of official images for its upcoming 50 series smartphone via its &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3206603957/Kj2gp1BMw?type=comment#_rnd1623057835464"&gt;Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1401833284183621637"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The images focus on the rear of the phone, showing an eye-catching pair of circular camera bumps. The Honor 50 series is currently due to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1399599535077220356"&gt;announced on June 16th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7ODi7"&gt;Amidst a sea of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/12/18663281/google-pixel-4-apple-iphone-11-ugly-square-phone-cameras-modules"&gt;square and rectangular camera bumps&lt;/a&gt;, the dual circle design is an interesting look for Honor’s next flagship. It’s also a style that Honor’s former parent company Huawei is planning to use for &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; next flagship, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464776/huawei-p50-phone-camera-periscope-telephoto-leica-harmonyos"&gt;the similarly-named P50&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible that the two companies finalized their designs before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;Huawei sold off Honor late last year&lt;/a&gt;, but it’ll be strange to see such similar looking devices released from two distinct manufacturers within such close proximity to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4ZZGU2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Honor50series?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Honor50series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;100W Super Fast Charge&lt;br&gt;Hypercurved screen.                                                  Launching in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shanghai?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;, June 16th! &lt;a href="https://t.co/9MAzE0RsDb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9MAzE0RsDb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bhavya (Haya) (@bhavis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1401833284183621637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NTJNMl"&gt;From the images it appears as though Honor’s next handset will have four rear cameras in total. The upper camera circle has one large lens, and it’s joined by three more on the lower bump. In contrast, Huawei’s P50 appears to have three lenses on the upper circle, and a single camera paired with a flash on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFDdLE"&gt;Beyond its design, Honor’s next flagship will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G processor, will feature 100W fast charging, and will also come with a “hypercurved screen.” It may also mark the return of Google’s apps and services to Honor’s devices (including the Google Play Store) if a &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-50-google-apps/"&gt;now-deleted tweet from the company’s German Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. Honor was prevented from including Google’s software because of sanctions placed on its former parent company Huawei, but these are believed to not apply since it became independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y406pk"&gt;A spokesperson from Honor previously declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; as to whether or not Google’s software would be available on the upcoming 50 series. But with an official launch just round the corner, we won’t have long to wait to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rshhL7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile employee files suit after HR asked invasive questions about her OnlyFans account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-saP0D0IsKjlMdLfQxIO6gMz4U8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69407426/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hvfLAr"&gt;A sales rep at a T-Mobile store in Fort Worth, Texas has filed a gender discrimination suit against the company after a member of the HR team inappropriately questioned her about having an OnlyFans account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GycML4"&gt;Caitlyn Stevens had been working at T-Mobile for nearly seven years when a male colleague became angry with her about how she was handling a customer interaction, the complaint says. He approached her “in a physically aggressive manager,” forcing a coworker to step in and stop the man from hitting her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcr5mF"&gt;Stevens reported the incident to the store manager. Rather than disciplining the male colleague who’d allegedly tried to hurt her, the manager relocated Stevens to a different location, according to the complaint. The location got less foot traffic, resulting in fewer sales for employees, Stevens says. “I did not feel like it was fair that I went to a slower location based on what had just happened,” she explains in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kq6rWZ"&gt;When Stevens submitted a complaint to HR, a man on the team called her and began asking questions about her personal life, including “whether she had a ‘sugar daddy’ and whether she had an OnlyFans account.” Stevens was shocked. “I immediately started crying,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I told him I did not feel comfortable and he still continued to ask the questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VLOzl"&gt;According to Stevens, the male HR rep said “we’ve heard that you have an OnlyFans account, is that true?” Then he added, “We’ve heard that people have seen nude pictures of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oRYan"&gt;Stevens says the questions felt violating. “I felt sexually harassed, I felt uncomfortable,” she says. “The nature of the questions, when I’m literally reporting a physical assault, is not okay.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvPhAN"&gt;Stevens’ attorney, Vincent White, a partner at White, Hilferty and Albanese, says the incident shows T-Mobile sided with Stevens’ male colleague over her. “T-Mobile chose to stand with a man who had a history of violence in the workplace over a woman who was a high performer at the company for seven years,” he said in a statement. “Caitlyn Stevens’ personal life had nothing to do with store operations, while threatening coworkers with violence hinders the productivity and well-being of the entire workplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3DF1D"&gt;This isn’t the first time that a woman has been shamed or retaliated against for having an OnlyFans account. In April 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/mechanic-fired-onlyfans-account-indiana"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that a mechanic in Indiana was fired from her job after her bosses found out she was making amateur porn on OnlyFans outside of work. In December 2020, the &lt;em&gt;New York Post &lt;/em&gt;tried to “out” an EMT who was making ends meet through OnlyFans (whatever the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; was trying to do here backfired — the publication was widely criticized for “doxxing someone simply for trying to earn a living” &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/onlyfans-medic-lauren-kwei-new-york-post-interview-1104943/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The incidents point to how far some companies will try to go to control the lives of their workers, while also refusing to pay people enough to allow them to maintain a single stream of income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5IINI"&gt;Stevens turned down a settlement in order to speak out about what happened. “I think she chose a much harder path here, but she realizes that this is indicative of a broader trend that many women are facing and feels strongly about changing the culture by telling her story,” says Ariella Steinhorn, founder of Lioness Strategies, a communications firm assisting in Stevens’ case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fErus"&gt;Stevens has taken a medical leave of absence due to the stress of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvZkmd"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a T-Mobile spokesperson said: “We take matters like this seriously and worked with the employee to investigate her claims. We found they had no merit.”&lt;/p&gt;
