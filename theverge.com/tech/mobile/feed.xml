    <title>AT&amp;T and Verizon may have to delay 5G deployments another two weeks over airline safety fears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQc0cfDVFbOQyriJ8meFsw6J9eQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70336748/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OOFwVV"&gt;US officials have asked AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon to further delay new 5G deployments so that the Federal Aviation Administration can have more time to determine where they might interfere with airlines. US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson sent a letter to the CEOs of the two telecoms on Friday requesting a delay of “no more than two weeks,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-officials-ask-att-verizon-delay-5g-wireless-over-aviation-safety-concerns-2021-12-31/"&gt;according to Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8V1bx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon had already delayed these deployments by a month over regulators’ concerns and planned to start the rollout on January 5th as a result. The two telecoms now &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buttigieg-delay-5g-service-airline-safety-concerns-verizon-wireless-att-2022-1"&gt;tell &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;they are reviewing the latest request for a further delay. Buttigieg and Dickson write that, even with an additional delay, they expect 5G deployment will still begin in January “with certain exceptions around priority airports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RXyjNT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Carriers are miffed about the delays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnAkNi"&gt;The two telecoms are eager to start deploying the new 5G spectrum that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;they bought in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the so-called C-band frequencies. Those frequencies of spectrum allow radio waves to hit a sweet spot between high speeds and long distances, allowing for higher-speed 5G deployments than traditional LTE spectrum can achieve, without the stifling distance limitations that come with millimeter wave 5G. Getting these deployments out is a critical step for AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon to make 5G a worthwhile upgrade and stay competitive with T-Mobile, which has &lt;a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/t-mobiles-mid-band-5g-network-surpasses-200m-people-covered/2021/11/"&gt;already started deploying&lt;/a&gt; its own similar spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNSRyV"&gt;Officials have been concerned that C-band frequencies could interfere with altimeters and prevent the use of guided landing systems meant for times of low-visibility, threatening the safety of aircraft. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;On December 7th&lt;/a&gt;, the FAA went so far as to tell pilots they wouldn’t be able to use those guided and automatic landing systems at airports where there’s deemed to be interference, which could theoretically lead to many flight delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXBwPU"&gt;Buttigieg and Dickson want to identify “priority airports” and mitigation strategies so that most large commercial aircraft can “operate safely in all conditions.” Some proposals revolve around placing 5G “buffer zones” around airports, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/airlines-brace-for-flight-restrictions-in-5g-standoff-11639929603"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOIwwt"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are pretty unhappy about the delays. On Friday, the companies accused the aerospace industry of holding deployment “hostage” unless they covered the cost of altimeter upgrades. Verizon also went in on the airline industry, telling &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, “This industry which got a $54 billion taxpayer-funded, government bail out over the past couple years clearly has much bigger issues to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BlackBerry will die on January 4th — for real this time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uO2QEwgyrYwSJhJP4Sz3r9yp07k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70333149/akrales_180531_2598_0178.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;QWERTY and quirky — Blackberry’s later Android incarnations retained the famous keyboard. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQex1z"&gt;Dear friends, we’re gathered here today to mourn the death of that once-beloved monarch of the mobile world: BlackBerry. And, yes, I realize that this is &lt;em&gt;not the first time&lt;/em&gt; we’ve announced the death of the company or its devices (and, for reasons I’ll explain below, it likely won’t be the last) but this is a very definite ending for legacy BlackBerry hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlXY5O"&gt;As of January 4th, any phones or tablets running BlackBerry’s own software — that’s BlackBerry 7.1 or earlier, BlackBerry 10, or its tablet operating system BlackBerry PlayBook — will “no longer reliably function,” &lt;a href="https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/support/devices/end-of-life"&gt;says the company&lt;/a&gt;. Whether on Wi-Fi or cellular, there’ll be no guarantee you can make phone calls, send text messages, use data, establish an SMS connection, or even call 9-1-1. That sounds pretty darned dead to us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9J1OsT"&gt;If, for whatever inexplicable reason, you or someone you love is still using an original BlackBerry, then we recommend you make it a New Year’s resolution to pry it gently but firmly from their hands. From January 4th onwards, it’ll be little more than a paperweight. (Though BlackBerry devices running Android will continue to work as normal.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="RIM BlackBerry 8310 beat up (1020)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03_rw04RGhfOq5A6Agczeuih_jw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/964696/blackberry-8310-att-busted_1020.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An elegant phone for a more civilized age: the BlackBerry 8310. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pbeXcJ"&gt;As alluded to above, though, this might not be the last BlackBerry death we announce. The company has experienced a slow and torturous decline since its dominant era in the late 2000s, when its QWERTY keyboards and reputation for security gave it a 50 percent market share in the US, but such a storied brand has to be wrung for its last dregs of value. (Its parent company, BlackBerry Limited, has pivoted to &lt;a href="https://marker.medium.com/how-blackberry-yes-that-blackberry-became-a-cybersecurity-company-efae02912751"&gt;selling cybersecurity software&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbDVFa"&gt;BlackBerry &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/30/3929760/blackberry-z10-review"&gt;tried to reboot itself&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 with a new OS, BlackBerry 10 (which failed), and in 2015 switched to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9694374/blackberry-priv-review-android-phone"&gt;making Android devices&lt;/a&gt; (which failed, too). Then, in 2016, it started licensing its brand to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/16/13979914/blackberry-global-branding-phone-rights-tcl"&gt;third-party manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; like TCL. This is still how the BlackBerry name lingers on, and in 2020, a Texas firm named OnwardMobility said it would be making a 5G Android-powered BlackBerry device with a full QWERTY keyboard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375026/5g-blackberry-phone-android-physical-keyboard-2021-release-date"&gt;to release in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1CVTX"&gt;Well, the clock is rather ticking on that one (OnwardMobility hasn’t shared any news or updates on its website since January 2021), but whether that particular effort lives or dies, it will at least give us a chance to gather again for another funeral. We really must get together some time under kinder circumstances. How are your aunt and uncle anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung teases Exynos 2200 with AMD’s RDNA 2 graphics coming January 11th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KEgTJsb_Jz7ZuWI64xcM6kx_z5E=/266x0:1985x1146/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331839/Screen_Shot_2021_12_30_at_5.17.19_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wRBqpn"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/exynos/playtime-is-over/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;started teasing its next flagship smartphone SoC&lt;/a&gt; — expected to be called the Exynos 2200 — ahead of a January 11th announcement with a tantalizing tidbit of information: the new chipset will feature a GPU powered by AMD’s RDNA 2 graphics architecture, better known for powering the next-gen graphics on the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and AMD’s RX 6000-series graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TNfkkr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s leaked Galaxy S22 Ultra is just straight up a Galaxy Note now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lLMoxs"&gt;Of course, given that the Exynos 2200 will be powering a smartphone, the new GPU won’t be magically enabling next-gen graphics on par with the most powerful consoles and gaming PCs. But it likely will enable some improvements in graphics, along with whatever other upgrade Samsung has up its sleeve for its latest flagship chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HjFMkm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlaytimeIsOver?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PlaytimeIsOver&lt;/a&gt;. The gaming marketplace is about to get serious. Stay tuned for the next &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Exynos?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Exynos&lt;/a&gt; with the new GPU born from RDNA 2. January 11, 2022. &lt;a href="https://t.co/0H2MeVUbeS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0H2MeVUbeS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Samsung Exynos (@SamsungExynos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungExynos/status/1476538563235831810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bZz6Yi"&gt;As a successor to 2021’s Exynos 2100, the Exynos 2200 will likely power some of Samsung’s most powerful phones in 2022, including the presumed Galaxy S22 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;S22 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. As is usually the case, though, it’s likely that phones using Samsung’s in-house designs will be limited to international models of its upcoming flagships, with the US variants presumably set to use Qualcomm’s recently announced Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWTdkT"&gt;Fortunately, we won’t have to wait long to get more details on the Exynos 2200 (or whatever Samsung calls it), given that the company is promising a formal debut on January 11th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s leaked Galaxy S22 Ultra is just straight up a Galaxy Note now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbSEqAa5HvBi6XrDoYApqqsUvCE=/15x0:1065x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331734/s22U.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1476660792527306754" target="_blank"&gt;evleaks (Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZL2j1N"&gt;It looks like Samsung’s next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S22 Ultra, will borrow more heavily from the Galaxy Note’s DNA than ever before. In fact, a newly leaked official render &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1476660792527306754"&gt;published by Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; confirms that the phone is pretty much a Note in every way except for its name. Wider screen with more surface to write on? Check. S Pen silo? Check. Flat top and bottom? Yep. Around back is a camera array that sticks closely to the layout from the S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjmHlF"&gt;Personally, I think the S21 Ultra was one of the boldest, best-looking phones Samsung has ever produced — especially that sleek matte black version. It owned the large camera bump in a way that actually looked &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy S21 Ultra, in Phantom Black" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hqNHCbYQFfkdxl7hLhCT0VijTvk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248897/vpavic_210118_4377_0090.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra put a unique spin on the camera bump. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9xbO2A"&gt;While I’m glad to see Samsung has found room for the sensors in a way that keeps the back of the device uniform, there’s definitely something a little more bland about this design. It looks every bit like a Note 10 Plus or Note 20 Ultra with a revamped camera system, but maybe that’s exactly what some Samsung fans want. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s22-ultra-black-images-awesome/"&gt;Real-world shots of the S22 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; have also leaked out recently, and yet again, it’s looking pretty great in black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLi9Xg"&gt;Whatever can help boost sales of the company’s traditional phones is probably the right move. The company is happy to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22859804/samsung-foldable-phone-sales-shipments-2021-forecast"&gt;talk up the momentum of foldables&lt;/a&gt;, but the S21 lineup reportedly disappointed in its retail performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuSiwk"&gt;Based on past history, Samsung should announce the S22 family sometime in February. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google pulls back the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro December update to fix dropped calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xik8yFqTkuaY5qhOedcK19CeChI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331126/akrales_211020_4802_0082.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUeh6c"&gt;The rollout of the first major update for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; has been slow and plagued by reports of problems. Now the company says it paused releasing the December 2021 update to investigate reports of calls dropping and disconnecting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="voe159"&gt;The news arrived &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143183382/december-2021-update-paused?hl=en"&gt;in a post on the Google Support forums&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/12/30/google-confirms-pixel-6-december-update-pause/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Droid-Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that says a new version with all the previously announced features and a fix for the disconnection issue should be ready by late January. If you’re not having any problems, then you can keep using the new software for now, but for those afflicted by the connection issues, Google only suggests reverting and factory resetting your device as an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="poCwHS"&gt;Hey Pixel Community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGpYCX"&gt;The Pixel team paused the December software update to Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro devices after some users reported calls were dropping or disconnecting. We have now identified a fix that will roll out in a software update by late January. This update will also include all the fixes and improvements that were originally planned in December. If you received the December software update on Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro and are still experiencing mobile connectivity issues, you can revert to the previous software version using the Android Flash Tool (&lt;a href="https://flash.android.com/welcome"&gt;flash.android.com&lt;/a&gt;) and performing a factory reset. Please back up your phone before restoring to the previous software version. If you are not experiencing mobile connectivity issues, no action is required. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience as we roll out the fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krEjx5"&gt;Your Pixel Community Manager,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9HGZG"&gt;Camille&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EntWbn"&gt;The December update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832212/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-bug-fixes-fingerprint-sensor"&gt;was packing a long list of eagerly anticipated fixes already&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788072/google-pixel-6-stand-wireless-charging-fast-23w-qi"&gt;fast 23W wireless charging with the Pixel Stand 2&lt;/a&gt;. It also included new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820593/google-pixel-december-feature-drop-quick-tap-to-snap-shortcut-ultra-wideband-nearby-share"&gt;features like&lt;/a&gt; the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734993/pixel-6-snapchat-feature-tap-camera"&gt;Quick Tap to Snap&lt;/a&gt;” Snapchat integration Google touted during the phone’s launch, plus digital car key support and file sharing for the ultra-wideband chip in the Pixel 6 Pro. Now most owners of Google’s latest flagship phones will have to wait a little longer (or risk updating manually with the flawed patch that’s available) before experiencing all the new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="k0pazt"&gt;Samsung wants you to know its foldables haven’t flopped. In a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/a-decade-in-the-making-how-samsung-foldables-are-defining-the-future-of-smartphone-innovation"&gt;recent blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company said it sold four times more foldable devices in 2021 than 2020. It attributes this success to the arrival of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3, which, in our own reviews, we hailed as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;step toward mainstream usability&lt;/a&gt; thanks to their refined designs and lower prices. Samsung says sales for these two devices in their first month alone exceeded “total accumulative sales of Samsung foldable devices in 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79fSs0"&gt;These are promising metrics for the slow ascension of foldable phones, though you should bear in mind that Samsung isn’t sharing hard sales data. Instead, it pointed to the fact that its increases were greater than predictions made by third-party analysts, who suggested  that total shipments from all manufacturers for foldable devices would hit &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/ko/foldable-smartphone-shipments-2023/"&gt;9 million in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbb8o4"&gt;If Samsung thinks this figure is useful enough to cite — and with the company thought to account for around 88 percent of the total foldable markets — we can guess that its sales were in the high single-digit millions or pushing into the low tens of millions. These numbers are expected to increase tenfold by 2023, with Samsung taking a smaller slice of the market as rival manufacturers like Oppo and Huawei join the foldable fun. Also predicted by some for 2023: a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307677/folding-iphone-rumors-screen-size-kuo"&gt;foldable iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, which would really boost the segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avYseV"&gt;Samsung also says that its decision to push forward early with foldable devices has paid off in terms of converting customers. It says that “compared to the Galaxy Note 20, Samsung has seen a 150 percent increase in consumers who switched smartphone brands for the Galaxy Z Flip 3.” If you want to attract new money, it helps to offer something unique.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xiaomi 12 Pro’s main camera is absolutely massive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqET6mS4OiiBEOijUcVP034qUG0=/0x67:686x524/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70328001/23b7af4f9dcbdb453c205e6c51479e5a.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even for Xiaomi, the 12 and 12 Pro offer huge main camera modules.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qN0wZM"&gt;Xiaomi is at it again — putting another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356660/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-camera-bump"&gt;fantastically huge camera&lt;/a&gt; on a flagship phone. This time, it’s the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mi.com%2Fglobal%2Fdiscover%2Farticle%3Fid%3D2603&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F29%2F22858529%2Fxiaomi-12-pro-camera-specifications-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xiaomi 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a 50-megapixel main sensor and f/1.9 standard wide lens. It’s not the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; biggest sensor Xiaomi has used in a phone, but the combination of a wide aperture lens and sizable imaging chip makes it... well, just look at the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dag6Sd"&gt;On the technical side, it’s a Sony IMX707 chip, which Xiaomi says it’s the first to use in a mobile device. &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/12/25/xiaomi-12-pro-confirmed-to-use-sony-imx707-sensor-for-primary-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmochina&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; that the 707 appears to be a very light refresh of the IMX700, which makes that claim a little less exciting. Either way, it’s a large 1/1.28-inch type sensor. Sony combines its 1.22μm pixels, which are already fairly large for a mobile camera sensor, to create even larger 2.44μm “4-in-1” pixels for better low-light photos. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfOub_Vp8H8dJkV5FgIx3hD-JCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132629/xiaomi.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vwrq8U"&gt;The 12 Pro includes two more 50-megapixel rear camera sensors: an ultrawide and a telephoto. The Xiaomi 12 features a slightly smaller 1/1.56-inch type sensor, a 13-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel “telemacro.” In addition to impressive hardware, the 12 and 12 Pro include camera software improvements like reduced shutter lag, burst shooting improvements, and subject tracking for human and animal faces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9W9QxH"&gt;On the non-camera side, the 12 Pro and its 12 sibling have all the trimmings of a modern flagship with Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipsets and 120Hz OLED panels. The Xiaomi 12 offers a 6.28-inch screen and a 4,500mAh battery; the 12 Pro includes a 6.73-inch screen with 1,500 nit peak brightness and a 4,600mAh battery with 120W fast charging. &lt;/p&gt;

The 12 Pro starts at RMB 4,699 (about $737) for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and the Xiaomi 12 starts at RMB 3,699 (about $580) for the same 8GB / 128GB configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>10 Apple Arcade games for your new iPhone or iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jZGq8g2Z3smGeIleo1ZAmJ62yGU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70326376/RoundUpArt_iOSGames.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to play on Apple’s game subscription service&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OPLfSJ"&gt;Apple Arcade is a gaming subscription service that offers a wealth of great titles with no ads &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-arcade/?itscg=10000&amp;amp;itsct=arc-0-apl_hp-lrn_tle-apl-ref-210507"&gt;for $4.99 per month&lt;/a&gt;. Some great new games were released for it this year, but there are also many Apple Arcade-exclusive versions of some of the biggest App Store hits, and they’re just as fun as when they first came out. We’ve compiled a mix of new and classic games you might want to check out if you’re a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6P2Ixz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Arcade finally got the boost it needed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PgPTGw"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Fantasian&lt;em&gt; features handcrafted dioramas that create a distinctive style.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A6pmHU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is a mobile JRPG from Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy. &lt;/em&gt;It takes cues from many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;classic JRPGs&lt;/a&gt;, features a soundtrack from another recognizable name to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; fans, Nobuo Uematsu, and takes place in a game world built from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;handcrafted dioramas&lt;/a&gt;. The game first released in April and got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616888/fantasian-part-2-apple-arcade-release-date"&gt;part two update in August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b2zIHX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clap Hanz Golf&lt;/em&gt; is a spiritual successor to the &lt;em&gt;Hot Shots Golf&lt;/em&gt; games (or &lt;em&gt;Everybody’s Golf&lt;/em&gt; outside of North America), so if you’ve played that series, you should feel right at home with &lt;em&gt;Clap Hanz Golf&lt;/em&gt;’s arcade-y take on the sport. &lt;em&gt;Clap Hanz&lt;/em&gt; is actually the developer for all of the &lt;em&gt;Hot Shots Golf&lt;/em&gt; titles except for the first, and the studio brings all of their expertise on the virtual greens to translate the sport to Apple’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jdFCWZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918007" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiny Wings Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HFw0mZ"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Tiny Wings Plus&lt;/em&gt;, you play as a tiny bird with the goal of building momentum between sloping hills. If you hit the curve of the hills just right, you pick up speed and fly through the air — which is made even more fun by the bird’s charming chirps of joy. The game is accompanied by a wonderfully peaceful song that you’ll be humming happily long after you’ve stopped playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TFbS84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911831" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dCbHOu"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="amswqS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threes Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look how happy the tiles are!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j6utxH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threes Plus&lt;/em&gt; is a puzzle game where you swipe tiles with numbers to match them together. It’s a bit more complex than I’m making it sound, but the game does a great job explaining its rules. You have as much time as you need to make a move, which makes it more relaxing than some other puzzle games, and it’s all elevated by a delightful presentation — the tiles are full of personality, with silly faces and cute voices, and the music is excellent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x5tNV9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911834" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Sayonara Wild Hearts&lt;em&gt; is filled with vibrant worlds.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TbxKKD"&gt;My colleague Andrew Webster described &lt;em&gt;Sayonara Wild Hearts&lt;/em&gt; as “an electrifying ride through a world made of pop culture,” and I think that’s pretty apt. Stages are short, too,  which means that you should be able to make progress whether you only have a few minutes to play or a little bit longer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Jump through beautiful landscapes in &lt;/em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="68tpe0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; is a relaxing sidescroller where you jump off rolling hills. The goal is to go as far as you can without crashing into rocks or falling on your head while trying to do a flip. The excellent mechanics are complemented by a gorgeous art style, and you’ll find ample opportunities to use the built-in photo mode for snapping pictures of flips across beautiful landscapes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x5BulC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Reader&lt;/em&gt; makes puzzles out of pages of classic books. In this relaxing game, you’re tasked with putting mixed-up passages back in order by filling in blanks, swapping words around, and more. The game offers a clever way to work through a puzzle while simultaneously absorbing some classic literature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;You’ll collect a lot of coins in &lt;/em&gt;Jetpack Joyride Plus&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wc7m4L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jetpack Joyride Plus&lt;/em&gt; is an action-oriented infinite runner where you collect coins, dodge missiles and obstacles, and pick up items (including ridiculous vehicles like a giant robot dragon) to make it easier to get as far as you can. There are also fun missions that add some structure to each run, and completing them gives you more coins you can spend on upgrades and items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ok5HMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911839" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSIsno"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Reigns Plus&lt;/em&gt;, a clever card-based monarchy simulator, you swipe right or left on requests brought to you to keep your reign in place for as long as possible. Each decision affects the balance of your kingdom, and some have adverse consequences that may lead to your eventual demise. The simple gameplay and excellent writing make for an engaging game where you’re constantly creating your own story, and it is satisfying to play for just a bit or for a long while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5JtErl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918052" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;em&gt;You’ll dodge many obstacles in &lt;/em&gt;Crossy Road Plus&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eXUF0D"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Crossy Road Plus&lt;/em&gt;, you play a tiny voxel animal trying to navigate through busy streets, logs floating down rivers, and other types of perilous terrain, one tiny hop at a time. It’s kind of like a modern-day version of the classic &lt;em&gt;Frogger&lt;/em&gt;, but with more cute digital animals. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC win clears the way for a massive Wi-Fi 6E upgrade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-JwJhJQ39rrF6yczVUtfK-PduFs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70325565/acastro__171016_1777_0001_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrator by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vFk4dU"&gt;A ruling (&lt;a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/7658F4CE919568A7852587B900589344/%24file/20-1190-1928330.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;) on Tuesday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has backed up an &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-opens-6-ghz-band-wi-fi-and-other-unlicensed-uses"&gt;April 2020 decision&lt;/a&gt; by the FCC to open up 1,200MHz of spectrum in the 6GHz band for unlicensed use. Unlicensed means anyone can use it, as long as they do so responsibly, covering uses like your future Wi-Fi 6E home network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSMctO"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work"&gt;Wi-Fi 6 connections make more reliable and efficient use of the same spectrum&lt;/a&gt; that’s been in use for the last couple of decades, especially when multiple devices are connected, Wi-Fi 6E routers will work at 2.4GHz and 5GHz plus the new 6GHz band. That has enough room for up to seven maximum capacity Wi-Fi streams to broadcast in the same area at once without interfering with each other or using any existing spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;aside id="SU5GQZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wi-Fi is getting its biggest upgrade in 20 years ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="vkbMZI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:3630921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FedYPO"&gt;Beyond that, there’s already work on a future standard, known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11be"&gt;IEEE 802.11be&lt;/a&gt; or Wi-Fi 7. That could further optimize the use of the new band with even larger 320MHz channels, 46 Gbps maximum transfer rates, and more, but it’s not scheduled to be complete until 2024 (&lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/wi-fi-7-and-beyond.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HwbN4"&gt;In the immediate future, while 6GHz Wi-Fi has the same theoretical top speed as 5GHz Wi-Fi, the extra space means that instead of getting so much interference from other devices and nearby networks, you’ll have a faster, more consistent connection. Last year a representative for the Wi-Fi Alliance told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that this should enable 1–2 Gbps connections over Wi-Fi, similar to what you see now with mmWave 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BfK2w"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T argued against the FCC’s plan, saying the commission failed to identify and address possible interference with “tens of thousands of microwave links critical to maintaining network infrastructure,” talking about the &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/atandt-takes-fcc-to-court-over-5g-backhaul/d/d-id/772166"&gt;wireless tech that keeps many cell sites connected to the wider internet&lt;/a&gt;. In one filing spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/atandt-takes-fcc-to-court-over-5g-backhaul/d/d-id/772166"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T said, “The 6GHz FS [fixed service] band is the only band suitable for long distance transmission, routinely supporting paths between 10-50 miles and, in cases, even longer distances.” Mobile carriers preferred a plan where the FCC would auction off a chunk of the 6GHz bandwidth for use solely by their 5G networks. The FCC said that low-power indoor use protects licensed 6GHz tech like AT&amp;amp;T’s microwave links and TV broadcasts from interference, while “standard power” devices used indoors and outdoors could include automated frequency control to prevent interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="C7xt62"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FCC’s 6GHz decision could help your 5G connections too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JUAm3P"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T did not have a comment today on the outcome. However, at the same time this case is being decided, a similar objection by the FAA is being used against the FCC to pause its ability to start using C-Band spectrum for 5G. As an FAA spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “Landings during periods of low visibility could be limited due to concerns that the 5G signal could interfere with the accuracy of an airplane’s radio altimeter, without other mitigations in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="L2E9sG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FCC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FCC&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have to show no potential for harmful interference ever. FCC does not need to protect against wildly unlikely scenarios. Instead, FCC balances all factors to conclude whether harmful interference is unlikely enough to be negligible risk. /3&lt;/p&gt;— (((haroldfeld))) (@haroldfeld) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/haroldfeld/status/1475906524807634955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YsJ4sJ"&gt;Harold Feld, senior vice president of the advocacy group &lt;a href="https://publicknowledge.org/public-knowledge-applauds-d-c-circuit-court-ruling-affirming-fcc-rules-for-gigabit-wi-fi/"&gt;Public Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; says, “the D.C. Circuit reaffirmed that it will not second-guess the technical expertise of the FCC when the agency balances the needs of both legacy licensed users and new innovations in Wi-Fi.” FCC commissioner Brendan Carr agrees, as his statement mentioned, “Today’s opinion also underscores the FCC’s role as the nation’s lead spectrum regulator. It does so by once again affirming the FCC’s assessment of the risks of harmful interference to existing operations. U.S. leadership in wireless depends on stakeholders continuing to abide by Congress’s long-standing decision to place these determinations squarely within the FCC’s expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCmgG9"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;as we noted in our Wi-Fi 6E explainer last year&lt;/a&gt; when the FCC made this decision, opening up the spectrum for unlicensed use doesn’t reserve it exclusively for Wi-Fi. It could be used by other devices and connections, like 5G. Sometimes mobile carriers use unlicensed spectrum to augment their licensed spectrum with technology that helps speed up connections, and it could come into play again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Wqmceh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Big news! Today the DC Circuit unanimously upheld the FCC's decision to free up the 6 GHz band for more unlicensed use. This decision = more Wi-Fi in more places and it matters because it comes at a time when being connected is more important than ever. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jjN4G8ALzA"&gt;https://t.co/jjN4G8ALzA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1475915000862715916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaOi6B"&gt;New FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has continued to back this measure that was decided under her predecessor, Trump appointee Ajit Pai. She &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairwoman-rosenworcel-court-victory-dc-circuit"&gt;says in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that “Today’s decision is an important step in clearing the way for next generation Wi-Fi access at a time when it is needed most. In this pandemic so much of modern life has migrated online. 6GHz Wi-Fi will help us address this challenge by offering more access in more places, faster speeds, and better performance from our Wi-Fi networks. It will also help us in our mission to connect everyone, everywhere...It is encouraging to read the Court’s strong approval of this work and we look forward to addressing on remand the narrow issue that the court identified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgcSrS"&gt;That narrow issue she mentions is a concern raised by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) about interference in the 2.4GHz spectrum that the FCC didn’t directly address, but backers of the plan appear confident it will be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etTQAh"&gt;WifiForward, an industry group representing companies like Amazon, Google, Comcast, and Arris, &lt;a href="http://wififorward.org/news/wififorward-statement-dc-circuit-court-affirms-fccs-6-ghz-order/"&gt;praised today’s decision&lt;/a&gt;, saying, “The Commission’s decision was smart, well-researched, unanimous and bipartisan. We look forward to consumers getting faster, lower latency Wi-Fi operations in the band, which will include Wi-Fi 6E and eventually next-generation Wi-Fi 7.” The Wi-Fi Alliance that helps establish and roll out the new standards had a similar reaction, &lt;a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-statement-on-us-court-of-appeals-for-the-dc-circuit-decision"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;, “Today’s court decision removes the regulatory uncertainty surrounding use of the 6 GHz band, allowing Wi-Fi Alliance and our members to expedite delivery of urgently needed Wi-Fi 6E broadband connectivity solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another T-Mobile cyberattack reportedly exposed customer info and SIMs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QSH0QlUPFQHvbkGa28e81UPZDZ8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70325030/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pj5stH"&gt;T-Mobile has suffered another cyberattack after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646439/t-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg"&gt;being rocked by a massive data breach in August&lt;/a&gt;. This time around, attackers accessed “a small number of” customers’ accounts,  according to &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/12/t-mobile-has-suffered-yet-another-data-breach/"&gt;documents posted by &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggOMKY"&gt;According to the report, customers either fell victim to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702544/fcc-rules-sim-swapping-port-out-fraud-cell-phone-carrier"&gt;SIM swapping attack&lt;/a&gt; (which could allow someone to bypass SMS-powered two-factor authentication), had personal plan information exposed, or both. The document shows that the customer proprietary network information that was viewed could’ve included customers’ billing account name, phone and account number, and info about their plan, including how many lines were attached to their account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fIswvB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The person who took credit for the summer hack called T-Mobile’s security “awful”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ystDXu"&gt;This summer, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii"&gt;carrier confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that a data breach exposed almost 50 million customers’ data, with the attacker accessing social security numbers, names, and dates of birth. (A person who claimed to be the hacker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643277/t-mobile-hacker-data-leak-claims-responsibility-criticizes-security"&gt;went on to call the company’s security practices “awful.”&lt;/a&gt;) The information reportedly exposed in December’s breach is less sensitive (and the documents say the customers who had their SIMs swapped have regained access), and is likely not as large in scope. We weren’t able to find widespread reports from customers that said they’d received notification letters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GxbXdL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;T-Mobile is taking immediate steps to help protect all individuals who may be at risk from this cyberattack.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HwR6Pa"&gt;T-Mobile’s support account has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobileHelp/status/1475857262480539648?s=20"&gt;seemingly confirmed that there was a breach&lt;/a&gt;, responding to people on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobileHelp/status/1475869083111284736"&gt;to say&lt;/a&gt; that it’s taking “immediate action” to help individuals who were put at risk by the attack. The company didn’t immediately reply to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
