    <title>Facebook tweaked the News Feed to highlight more mainstream news sources for the election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3KUdPu3nCCcZUP4dnWaTxkVABxw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67871354/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6x25Yo"&gt;Facebook, in the days after the US election, decided that an uptick in viral misinformation related to election results and President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede needed an extreme measure to be dealt with. So the company made a temporary change to its News Feed algorithm to favor mainstream news outlets, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/technology/facebook-election-misinformation.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;published on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKHjhm"&gt;Facebook specifically tweaked how much weight the News Feed gives to “news ecosystem quality” scores, an internet metric designed to quantify the trustworthiness and quality of a news source. That way, users of Facebook would see more news from publishers like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, CNN, and NPR and less of the hyper-partisan pages that tend to peddle in inflammatory and sometimes downright false or misleading content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LKOBnP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook tweaked the News Feed to favor mainstream news publishers in the days after Election Day&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eIwQFC"&gt;Many of those publishers with poor news ecosystem quality scores happen to be right-wing sites, and many of those right-wing sites have been spreading Trump’s false claims and countless other misleading and dubious election fraud and conspiracy theory stories far and wide on the social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvlJ7k"&gt;“There are many variables at play in every product decision we make, all aimed at creating the best possible experience for people,” Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne said in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The assertions in this report are based on sources who have no product decision-making authority and are advancing their own narrow impression of how our process works.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHZjgS"&gt;The company had been signaling for months that it was preparing for worst-case scenarios like what eventually unfolded when President-elect Joe Biden was declared the winner of the election earlier this month, but Trump to this day continues to try to undermine and overturn the results. Facebook described these scenarios and its tools for combating them as “break glass” plans, according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPN0WS"&gt;One of those plans involved manually tweaking the News Feed. CEO Mark Zuckerberg ultimately authorized the change when presented with findings that right-wing news publishers were seeing huge swells in engagement from unverified stories about election fraud and how Democrats were trying to steal the election from Trump, the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnDiXi"&gt;Facebook employees are now asking company leadership whether the changes could stay in place to help promote a healthier and less divisive news ecosystem on the social media network. But executives like News Feed chief John Hegeman tell &lt;em&gt;The Times &lt;/em&gt;that there are no plans to implement any election-related tweaks as permanent changes to the platform. Rather, Facebook plans to study the experiments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aHmMp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 24th, 1:14PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Facebook. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends deadline for requiring in-app purchases for apps selling online classes and events</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/41Td2Civs3RZATncjC73iWzRr-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67866441/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sls9lL"&gt;Apple on Monday announced &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=kw16tplo"&gt;an extension to its deadline&lt;/a&gt; for requiring in-app purchases for online events and classes offered within iOS apps to June 30th, 2021. Apple previously adjusted what types of events are subject to its in-app purchase policy and standard 30 percent cut back in September, with the original intention of requiring in-app purchases in all appropriate apps by December of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOgA4k"&gt;Apple cited the coronavirus pandemic, writing in a developer update posted to its website, “As the world fights COVID-19, we recognize that adapting experiences from in-person to digital continues to be a top priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y0dPqy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This deadline extension means developers have more time to temporarily reap the full profits of their sales&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XVXsTi"&gt;Requiring in-app purchase options for outside services like video streaming and exercise classes offered through iOS has been part of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business"&gt;the company’s policy&lt;/a&gt; for quite a while, but this specific change is focused on the adjustments made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455598/facebook-paid-events-apple-ios-30-percent-fees-waived"&gt;following Facebook’s September complaint&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook’s issue was framed around event organizers losing out on much-needed money for their digital events offered through the Facebook app during COVID-19, because of Apple’s 30 percent in-app purchase commission. Apple decided to waive the fee till the end of the year, and the company adjusted its policy to focus on group events and classes to keep one-on-one experiences free from Apple fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vcUBs"&gt;This deadline extension means developers have more time to incorporate in-app purchases in their apps where applicable and to temporarily reap the full profits of their sales. Apple’s other recent App Store changes suggest it’s inclined to make some concessions, whether because of pressure from developers or regulatory scrutiny from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;on-going legal battle with Epic&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;anti-trust investigation in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLdR73"&gt;The best example is Apple’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;. Any developer making under $1 million in sales per year will be able to apply next year and if approved receive a reduced 15 percent App Store commission. Other companies like Amazon have negotiated such exemptions, albeit in back room deals rather than public battles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;Amazon Prime Video is able to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; with a reduced 15 percent Apple commission and sell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change"&gt;in-app purchases and rentals&lt;/a&gt; without being forced to use Apple’s in-app purchase option. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s TVision Live service gets more channels as short-term fix for content disputes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rcCNLiZfphUPRq3106PeY9U9Z_w=/180x0:2079x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67828464/Screen_Shot_2020_10_27_at_11.38.32_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QKBZD5"&gt;T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2020/T-Mobiles-Got-Serious-Holideals-for-All/default.aspx"&gt;adding 33 channels&lt;/a&gt; from its $10-per-month TVision Vibe service for free to all of its pricier TVision Live plans as it deals with &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/t-mobile-tvision-channels-programmers-deals-disputes/"&gt;ongoing complaints&lt;/a&gt; from cable companies like Discovery over how it offers channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dl0Smh"&gt;“Current TVision Live customers and anyone who signs up for a TVision Live service package gets an additional 30+ top-rated entertainment channels from TVision Vibe included,” the press release notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SO6Cuh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/t-mobile-tvision-revising-bundles-programmer-complaints-1234830369/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile’s press release frames the newly added channels as a holiday deal, but the reality is likely a little bit more complicated: it’s a temporary solution as T-Mobile works to deal with issues raised by its cheaper $10-per-month Vibe plan, which offers channels from AMC, Discovery, and Viacom at a dramatically lower cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYPTGk"&gt;According to an &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/t-mobile-tvision-channel-additions-programming-dispute-1234836655/"&gt;earlier report from &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the issue is centered on the fact that T-Mobile’s contract with those content providers dictates that channels offered in cheaper tiers (like Vibe) have to be included in more premium tiers, too. Splitting up everything into separate packages, like T-Mobile had originally done — as nice of a benefit as it might be for consumers — appears to be against those contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3T6llC"&gt;For now, T-Mobile is solving that issue by including the AMC, Discovery, and Viacom channels in the pricer Live plans (which cost between $40 to $60 per month, depending on which version a customer chooses). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuZFAz"&gt;But it’s hard to imagine that it’ll be a viable long-term solution, given that T-Mobile will have to pay for providing those channels to all of those new customers. And unless the company is willing to just take the loss on that indefinitely, it’s likely that it’ll either have to rejigger its plans entirely or be forced to raise prices (much as competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; have had to do this year). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Music adds behind-the-scenes trivia for songs with new X-Ray features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-b9YC8SgFxb42_S8bsVt5gMfVs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67827842/image001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="agdnUV"&gt;Amazon is adding new X-Ray features to its music streaming service, which let you see extra pieces of trivia about the music you’re listening to. The feature is available globally across “tens of millions” of songs, and Amazon says there are extra “fun facts” available for popular songs in the US and UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYqFds"&gt;X-Ray isn’t an entirely new feature for Amazon. It’s already available on the company’s Prime Video streaming service where it shows information like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/13/8399933/amazon-launches-x-ray-fire-tv"&gt;which actors are in a current scene&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s previously been able to show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/12/5802810/amazon-prime-music-hands-on"&gt;real-time lyrics for songs in Amazon Music&lt;/a&gt;. What’s new are the additional pieces of trivia the feature now shows about tracks. These range from interesting tidbits about an artist’s backstory to more perfunctory information about when a song was released and the spot it reached on the &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOoSsV"&gt;To access the trivia on compatible songs, you can swipe up on the “X-Ray” icon. From there, you can swipe through each fact or tap on the “Credits” section at the bottom of the screen to see a track’s complete credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxCjCx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction November 20th, 2:39PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This post originally stated, based on information provided by Amazon, that X-Ray is only available in the US and UK. This is incorrect. It is actually available globally, but select songs in the US and UK will have extra trivia attached to them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile becomes first carrier to enable 988 number for mental health services</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8PxhVaGIDrDx0gZ4LjiYRt_3ahw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67827717/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;T-Mobile has added support for the 988 emergency mental health services number more than a year and a half ahead of the Federal Communications Commission’s deadline, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fcommunity%2Ft-mobile-makes-988-emergency-lifeline-available-to-customers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F20%2F21580432%2Ftmobile-988-number-fcc-mental-health-suicide-prevention#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. T-Mobile customers who dial 988 will be connected to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) and its network of crisis centers across the US. T-Mobile says it is the first carrier in the US to make 988 available to its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIenGN"&gt;T-Mobile chief technology officer Abdul Saad said in a statement that making the shorter emergency number available to customers was “a matter of urgency for us, particularly as the COVID-19 pandemic continues and the holiday season approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrMr20"&gt;In 2019, the &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-staff-recommends-3-digit-number-suicide-prevention-hotline"&gt;FCC released a report&lt;/a&gt; suggesting a three-digit hotline number would make it easier for those seeking help. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328600/national-suicide-prevention-lifeline-number-dial-988-fcc"&gt;FCC voted unanimously in July&lt;/a&gt; to make 988 the number to connect to the NSPL hotline, and it gave carriers until July 2022 to put it into effect. However, the 988 number isn’t able to receive text messages, which FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said at the time was problematic. She noted that voice service is “not native for most young people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgPwB6"&gt;People in need of mental health support can still contact the NSPL by calling 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK) or by using &lt;a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/"&gt;online chats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrLYkr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp update brings AR features for newer devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4P5H353dMvISgN7M2669bpkkOlQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67824063/ACPocketCamp_06_AR_Camera.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f1Z9pR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&lt;/em&gt;, the smartphone entry in the long-running Nintendo franchise, has been updated with a pair of new augmented reality features. The first, AR Camera, lets you place characters and furniture from the game in the real world and photograph them. Meanwhile, the AR Cabin feature lets players decorate a virtual cabin, fill it with characters, and then view it in augmented reality from their smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBIhN1"&gt;Along with the new AR modes, Nintendo says the update means more areas of each campsite can have furniture and items placed within them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYgErPz9ViGHqJVuAZNJp5Qq4QU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22055599/ACPocketCamp_01_AR_Cabin.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AR Cabin lets you assemble a virtual room and then explore it in augmented reality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ndfM3j"&gt;Unfortunately, the new features have increased the game’s system requirements, and previous versions of the game are &lt;a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/topics/ANNOUNCEMENT_2010297"&gt;now unusable&lt;/a&gt; after the update. A &lt;a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/topics/ANNOUNCEMENT_2011205"&gt;support post&lt;/a&gt; notes that iPhone users now require iOS version 11 at a minimum (or ideally iOS 13 and above) rather than iOS 9, which was the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201109034304if_/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp/id1179915619"&gt;previous requirement&lt;/a&gt;. Android users, meanwhile, now need to be running Android 5 or above on a 64-bit device with at least 1.5GB of RAM. That’s up from the previous requirement of &lt;a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/topics/ANNOUNCEMENT_1111252"&gt;Android version 4.4 and 1.5GB of RAM&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weG3Xa"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/topics/ANNOUNCEMENT_2011205"&gt;same support document&lt;/a&gt;, “Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp cannot be downloaded or played on devices that are no longer supported.” The change has left some players furious. The replies to the official &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pocket_Camp/status/1329673400189587456"&gt;Pocket Camp Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; are littered with complaints from players who can no longer access the game after the update. A particular problem appears to be the requirement for a 64-bit Android device, with some players reporting that they’re &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/philippawarr/status/1329778787563794433"&gt;unable to run the game on their 64-bit hardware&lt;/a&gt; because of a 32-bit operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2lhyfWZpWJ-fGJ1VKrPbCpQqigc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22055601/ACPocketCamp_05_AR_Camera.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While AR Camera lets you place objects and characters from the game in the real world. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8tccP1"&gt;“In certain cases, some devices may not be supported even when they meet the conditions listed,” a &lt;a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/topics/ANNOUNCEMENT_2010297"&gt;support post&lt;/a&gt; about the update from last month read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KajpNw"&gt;Nintendo says that save data can be transferred to a new device if players have already linked their Nintendo Accounts with their game. When setting up a new device, you’ll need to select the “Link Nintendo Account” option when starting the game for the first time, which will let you import the existing save data. Note that Leaf Tickets, an in-game currency that can be purchased with real money, cannot be transferred between Android and iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBY1Pg"&gt;Coinciding with the update, Nintendo is offering a free month of the “Furniture &amp;amp; Fashion Plan,” which offers benefits like expanded storage for items and the chance to get exclusive furniture and clothing. The subscription normally costs $7.99 (£7.99 / €8.99) a month. On the flip side, if you’re one of those players who no longer has a device that can play the game, Nintendo advises that you’ll need to cancel any in-game subscriptions to prevent future charges. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia is coming to iOS officially as a web app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vuaYe7wZW2ORF0ULGyeFt0RXTbI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67817574/akrales_191113_3779_0319.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZY8pmW"&gt;Google on Thursday announced iOS support for its Stadia cloud gaming service, following in the footsteps of Microsoft in turning to the mobile web to circumvent Apple’s App Store restrictions. Google says it has been building a progressive web app version of Stadia that will run in the mobile version of Apple’s Safari browser, similar to how Microsoft intends to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508706/microsoft-xcloud-ios-web-browser-2021"&gt;deliver its competing xCloud service on iOS&lt;/a&gt; sometime next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHLBll"&gt;But Google intends to beat Microsoft to the punch with public testing of its version in the coming weeks. Nvidia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;also announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it a beta web app version of its GeForce Now cloud gaming service on iOS is available today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qucZ0h"&gt;Apple in late August &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;clarified its rules around cloud gaming&lt;/a&gt;, telling providers like Google and Microsoft that their apps were not allowed on the App Store due to restrictions Apple imposes on software that streams games to the iPhone and iPad. Apple eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;loosened its restrictions&lt;/a&gt; after public criticism from Microsoft and others, but the App Store still requires companies to submit individual games for App Store review. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"&gt;called the compromise a “bad experience for consumers”&lt;/a&gt; before deciding it would develop a web app version of xCloud for iOS instead. Now, Google is doing the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mw2qzi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s web app version of its cloud gaming service will arrive before Microsoft’s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Ep28U"&gt;The iOS testing announcement coincides with Stadia’s one-year anniversary of its public launch last fall. Google also announced today that its first slate of free-to-play games would be coming to Stadia, following the reveal earlier this week that the base version of Bungie’s &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; would no longer require a $10 per month Stadia Pro subscription and can now be played by anyone with a Google account that signs up for Stadia. And State Share, the streamer-friendly Stadia feature that allows players to share their exact point in a game with viewers or followers on social media, will be launching next January with the release of IO Interactive’s &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmiicV"&gt;Google is also using its one-year anniversary as an opportunity to tout fresh Stadia statistics. The company won’t yet reveal how many people have signed up for Stadia or subscribed to its Pro service. But the company says it’s introduced more than 80 games in the last 12 months to the platform, with plans to support more than 135 titles by the end of the year. It’s also added more than 100 new features to the platform in the last 12 months, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21546194/google-stadia-family-sharing-digital-games-purchase-share"&gt;family sharing for the first time earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALpQZV"&gt;That library also includes more than 50 Stadia Pro games that have been made available for free since the service’s launch, with more than 30 active titles available as of this month. (Some games are added to Stadia Pro for a limited time before they are removed, similar to limited giveaways of games as part of Sony’s PlayStation Plus and Microsoft’s Xbox Live Gold subscriptions.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fQFAB"&gt;To celebrate the upcoming launch of CD Projekt Red’s &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, Google is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;running a rather excellent promotion&lt;/a&gt;: preordering the game before December 10th or buying the released version before December 17th will get you a Stadia Premiere Edition bundle, which includes the Stadia controller and a Chromecast Ultra for streaming Stadia to a television. The promotion is just while supplies last, though, and Google isn’t saying how many units it will be giving out. So it’s perhaps a good idea to preorder early if you’re interested in making Stadia the platform you use to play &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntl0yW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s entire Galaxy S20 lineup is cheaper than ever today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7h0TNl8OmUxMMGROsXv5aIvioEo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67816937/bking_200306_3928_0015.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EiRtZx"&gt;Samsung’s entire range of S20 series phones is available at all-time-low prices at a few retailers, including Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and eBay (sold by Microsoft). We covered discounts from eBay a few weeks ago, but today’s prices are significantly better. Each phone below is unlocked, with support for GSM and CDMA carriers, so you can get service from T-Mobile, AT&amp;amp;T, and Verizon as well as MVNOs and global carriers. If you want to add 5G to your monthly bill, the S20 FE and the standard S20 offered below support sub-6GHz but not Verizon’s UWB mmWave 5G. However, the S20 Plus and S20 Ultra support both types of 5G networks out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

Even bigger and more capable is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155012/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review-5g-screen-camera-space-zoom-price"&gt;S20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fitm%252FSamsung-Galaxy-S20-Ultra-5G-128GB-BLACK-Unlocked%252F254535897304%26campid%3D5338421468%26toolid%3D20008&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2020%2F11%2F19%2F21575049%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s20-phones-android-deal-sale-ebay-amazon-bh-photo#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $900 for the first time today&lt;/a&gt; at eBay ($1,150 at Amazon). It has a 6.9-inch display, an even larger battery than the other S20 models (5,000mAh), though its defining feature might be its 100x Space Zoom camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9uTFtk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9560585"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="63llNr"&gt;If you’re having a tough time deciding, let your budget and preference in phone size guide you. Each of these phones has the latest Snapdragon 865 processor and plenty of RAM, so you won’t be left with a slow phone — no matter which one you choose. Each also has IP68 water and dust resistance and a 120Hz refresh rate OLED screen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia is bringing Fortnite back to iOS with new cloud gaming web app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B7r0TdxjANPz0CZn_eTjQGOcZuI=/153x0:1803x1100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67816366/GeForce_NOW_on_iOS_Safari.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6XH90e"&gt;Nvidia is joining its fellow cloud gaming providers in choosing to bypass Apple’s App Store and &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/11/19/geforce-now-on-ios-safari/"&gt;launching a mobile web app version&lt;/a&gt; of its GeForce Now service. Nvidia’s version is available today in beta form, meaning any of the service’s more than 5 million registered users can fire up GeForce Now in mobile Safari on an iPhone or iPad and get playing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxq8OR"&gt;Nvidia says it also plans to broaden support for its desktop Chrome-based version of GeForce Now, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21372531/nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-service-chromebook-chrome-os"&gt;currently only works on Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt;, to more platforms starting in the first quarter of next year, including Android, Linux, and Mac. GeForce Now is currently primarily distributed via Mac and PC apps, as well as through dedicated apps on Android and its Nvidia Shield streaming box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QliyLf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Fortnite’ is coming back to iOS, thanks to Nvidia’s GeForce Now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zozLhD"&gt;One of the more obvious upsides here is that Epic Games’ &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;will once again be playable on Apple devices, albeit through a somewhat cumbersome workaround and only after Epic and Nvidia work out some kinks. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s PC version is available through GeForce Now, thanks to Nvidia and Epic’s partnership around cloud gaming that allows Epic Game Store titles to be streamed through Nvidia’s platform. That said, the game isn’t ready for the iOS version of GeForce Now quite yet, as Epic and Nvidia are working together to bring improved touch controls to the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NO1xOT"&gt;“Alongside the amazing team at Epic Games, we’re working to enable a touch-friendly version of Fortnite, which will delay availability of the game. While the GeForce Now library is best experienced on mobile with a gamepad, touch is how over 100 million Fortnite gamers have built, battled and danced their way to Victory Royale,” Nvidia GeForce Now chief Phil Eisler writes in the company’s blog post. “We’re looking forward to delivering a cloud-streaming Fortnite mobile experience powered by GeForce NOW. Members can look for the game on iOS Safari soon.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjtbEj"&gt;So any mobile &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;players who have been unable to access the game will soon be able to claim it on Epic’s PC storefront, sign in with their account, and find the game on the iOS version of GeForce Now. And any players who already play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;across mobile, console, and PC have likely already linked their account and should have no trouble syncing their data across platforms. News of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s return to iOS via GeForce Now was &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54825891"&gt;first reported earlier this month by the BBC,&lt;/a&gt; ahead of Nvidia’s official announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5W88T"&gt;Still, it’s not an ideal workaround, and the hurdles players have to jump through to play a game that just a few months ago ran natively on iOS devices is indicative of the larger fissures forming between Apple and the video game industry. Apple in August became the center of two separate but related controversies. The first kicked off when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;banned &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; (Google did the same by removing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from its Play Store) over the inclusion of Epic’s own in-app payment methods designed to bypass Apple’s standard 30 percent cut. Epic then sued both Apple and Google for anti-competitive practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Fen57"&gt;Shortly after that, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;clarified its position on cloud gaming services&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that the clients operated by Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others were not allowed on iOS because of App Store policies barring platforms that stream games. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;softened its stance slightly by creating an exemption&lt;/a&gt; that would allow a cloud gaming service so long as the games it streamed were submitted individually for App Store review and subject to the same policies and 30 percent commission that other apps are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eK6ms"&gt;Apple also suggested cloud gaming providers use the mobile web instead if they thought the terms were unfavorable. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"&gt;snubbed the olive branch&lt;/a&gt; as a “bad experience for consumers,” while Facebook began publicly criticizing Apple for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios"&gt;restrictions it imposed on its own cloud gaming service&lt;/a&gt;. Neither Google nor Nvidia publicly spoke out about Apple’s position on cloud gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DWxsf0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft and Nvidia have both decided to release iOS web apps due to App Store restrictions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaeAJK"&gt;Now, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia have since taken Apple’s advice and decided to go the mobile web route instead of attempt to work within the confines of the App Store. Microsoft plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508706/microsoft-xcloud-ios-web-browser-2021"&gt;launch an iOS version of xCloud sometime next year&lt;/a&gt;, while Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it would be testing an iOS version of its Stadia platform in the coming weeks. Yet Nvidia is beating both to the punch by launching a WebRTC-based version of GeForce Now on mobile Safari today in beta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPRuOq"&gt;Nvidia says there will be some notable restrictions involved. You will be able to use controllers such as the Xbox One gamepad and Sony’s DualShock 4 as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;supported mobile-first controllers like the Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Nvidia says a majority of GeForce Now’s more than 750 games that work well with gamepads and will run just as well on mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z37izO"&gt;But Nvidia hasn’t tested the new PlayStation 5 console’s DualSense controller and cannot confidently say it will work. Touch controls will also work, though they will not be natively supported in certain games because the machines on which the platform runs stream the PC version of a game and not a made-for-mobile app. (Hence the delay on making &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;available.) Mice and keyboards will not work at all, Nvidia says, due to issues specifically with mouse support using the mobile web client as it’s currently designed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1Srr6"&gt;Nvidia is also announcing some nice new additions to the platform, including InnerSloth’s huge multiplayer hit &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;and support for GOG.com’s PC storefront in time for parent company CD Projekt’s &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; launch on December 10th. And Nvidia says it’s also increased the number of facilities around the globe it uses to deliver GeForce Now to 22 data centers in 70 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOw1J3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 19th, 12PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Included mention of Google’s plans to test an iOS version of Stadia in the coming weeks. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBTRsl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story said Fortnite would be available on iOS through GeForce Now starting today. That is incorrect; Epic and Nvidia are working to improve touch controls for the game before releasing it officially on the platform. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s TVision Home IPTV service is shutting down at the end of December</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Aclu1Z"&gt;T-Mobile is shutting down TVision Home, its IPTV cable service that utilized technology from its 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/13/16773232/layer3-tv-tmobile-streaming-service-iptv-internet-protocol"&gt;acquisition of Layer3&lt;/a&gt;. The service will officially shut down on December 30th, 2020 at 3AM ET, according to an FAQ on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fhome-retire-faq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F18%2F21574328%2Ft-mobile-tvision-home-shutting-down-layer-3#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the T-Mobile website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrStyk"&gt;TVision Home’s shutdown comes shortly after the November 1st launch of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535264/tmobile-tvision-live-internet-tv-streaming-service-price"&gt;new live TV streaming service&lt;/a&gt; — which, confusingly, also uses the TVision brand. The new TVision works via an app that’s available across many platforms and over a $50 4K Android TV dongle that’s sold by T-Mobile — a far more accessible way to access content than the TVision Home, which required a more traditional set-top box. And while a TVision Home subscription cost $90 per month, the new TVision offers a number of more affordable bundles of channels, including one that’s just $10 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKr42q"&gt;If you’re currently a subscriber to the TVision Home cable service, T-Mobile says your subscription will be cancelled automatically when the service shuts down at the end of December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5gPGU"&gt;If you’ve been a subscriber for a while (November 1st or earlier), T-Mobile will also offer you free access to two TVision tiers through June 30th, 2021: the $60 per month TVision Live Zone bundle, which primarily offers news and sports (including access to NFL RedZone), and the $10 per month TVision Vibe bundle, which has more entertainment-focused channels such as AMC, BET, HDTV, and Discovery. Current TVision Home subscribers can also get &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fhome-retire-faq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F18%2F21574328%2Ft-mobile-tvision-home-shutting-down-layer-3#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 20 percent discount&lt;/a&gt; on certain T-Mobile wireless plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8biQKo"&gt;You should know that TVision is currently only available to T-Mobile and Sprint subscribers (not including pre-paid customers), and it won’t be available more widely until sometime in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
