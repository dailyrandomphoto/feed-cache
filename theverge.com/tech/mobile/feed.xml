    <title>In an about-face, Xfinity Mobile will offer discounts on additional unlimited plan lines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZAn9hFCgK1qnzrWebEU7RaqtGs=/89x0:2519x1620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129670/xfinity_mobile_laydown_6_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xfinity Mobile offers cell service on Verizon’s network in addition to 20 million Wi-Fi hotspots across the country.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xfinity Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aNvg2F"&gt;Comcast’s wireless service, Xfinity Mobile, is changing the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fmobile%2Flearn%2Fplan&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F15%2F22384272%2Fxfinity-mobile-unlimited-plan-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pricing structure on its unlimited plans&lt;/a&gt;. The company will now discount additional lines on its unlimited plan: a single-line plan will still cost $45 per month, but additional lines become cheaper the more you add. With four lines on a plan, you’ll pay $30 per month per line. That’s in contrast to a previous policy of charging the same fee per line, regardless of the number of lines on a plan &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; a practice touted on its website as recently as yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGqz8U"&gt;The company points out that its $45 per month unlimited plan is still cheaper than single-line plans among the major wireless carriers, which is true: postpaid unlimited plans from the big three cost between $60 and $70 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/goejcoTYS5PtgGqTzo0WSflEtQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444379/Screen_Shot_2021_04_14_at_12.43.02_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xfinity Mobile&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until recently, single-line customers on Xfinity Mobile enjoyed the same per-line pricing as subscribers with multiple lines, as touted on the company’s website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lZwEkn"&gt;But it’s also worth noting that Xfinity Mobile reduces speeds on all of its unlimited plans once a user reaches 20GB of data per month, which isn’t something you’ll see on the major carriers’ plans. That’s separate from the temporary slowdowns customers might experience when the network is busy, which is a fairly common policy across network providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLw2mX"&gt;Prices for its “By the Gig” metered plans remain the same: 1GB for $15, 3GB for $30, and 10GB for $60. It’s also still possible to mix data-capped and unlimited lines on the same plan. This isn’t the first time Xfinity Mobile, which operates on Verizon’s network, has changed pricing policies: in 2019, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750181/xfinity-mobile-hd-pass-unlimited-plan-extra-fee"&gt;began charging a fee&lt;/a&gt; to add HD streaming to accounts. Previously, it had capped streaming video resolution at 480p but would waive this limitation at no cost on request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8FKpIm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cellphone plan fine print, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tFQLp3"&gt;To be fair, both this change and the new unlimited plan pricing structure follow standard practices across the industry. Most unlimited plans limit streaming video to 480p, and all major wireless carriers charge more per line on single versus multiple-line plans. For a change, Comcast isn’t inventing creative new ways to make your bill more confusing — it’s just going with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIuJFI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra 5G is coming to the US with a 144Hz display and a whole lot more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EkhPadMVYUi0mDj-aJ7Ot6tlvas=/164x0:1373x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129504/Axon_30_Colors_1536x806.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra 5G offers a whole bunch of rear-facing cameras.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8TTDaP"&gt;ZTE has unveiled the Axon 30 Ultra alongside two other 30-series devices — the Axon 30 and Axon 30 Pro — though the Ultra has at least one unique feature: it will be sold in the US and Canada. Exact availability and pricing are still TBD, but we do know that the 30 Ultra has all of the trappings of a high-end Android device. It will offer a Snapdragon 888 processor with 8GB or 12GB of RAM, a 6.67-inch 1080p OLED with adaptive refresh rates up to 144Hz, four rear cameras including a 5x zoom, and 66W fast charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IB0C0e"&gt;The 30 Ultra features a prominent camera bump that houses plenty of pixels, starting with a 64-megapixel f/1.6 main camera with optical image stabilization. There’s another 64-megapixel camera — unstabilized with a 35mm-equivalent f/1.9 lens — and an ultrawide with (you guessed it) a 64-megapixel sensor. A periscope-style telephoto lens is coupled with an 8-megapixel sensor and includes optical stabilization. Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;Axon 20 5G&lt;/a&gt;, it offers a traditional hole-punch 16-megapixel selfie camera around front; no under-screen camera here, which is a good thing in our book. Video recording from the main camera tops out at 8K/30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lnvIjV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10447167"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SFwKTt"&gt;ZTE calls the phone’s 6.67-inch display a “borderless, curved” OLED panel with a 95% screen-to-body ratio. It’s protected with Gorilla Glass 5 — as is the rear panel — and includes HDR10 support. It offers adaptive refresh rates of 60Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz, and 144Hz, which it uses depending on the application to save battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvmXfH"&gt;Rounding out the feature set, the Axon 30 Ultra 5G includes a large 4,600mAh battery that supports fast 66W wired charging. It ships with Android 11 and offers an in-screen fingerprint reader for biometric unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCRBLq"&gt;The step-down Axon 30 Pro still includes the Snapdragon 888 chipset, but features a different rear camera configuration, a non-variable 120Hz screen, and less-speedy 55W charging. The Axon 30 base model is the only one to get the next iteration of the in-display selfie camera, &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/01/20/zte-teases-axon-30-smartphone-will-have-an-under-display-camera/"&gt;as teased by ZTE&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1mW1C"&gt;For now, the Ultra looks like a whole lot of phone, but it’s hard to judge just how competitive it will be in the US until we have a confirmed price. When it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; available, it’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.ztedevices.com/en/"&gt;sold online&lt;/a&gt; unlocked from ZTE. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL’s Fold ‘n Roll concept transforms a 6.87-inch phone into a 10-inch tablet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tvGy1RXa0aBF2FkOb_d4TjLdFVM=/179x0:1822x1095/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125577/Fold__n_Roll_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s concept uses a folding hinge and extendable mechanism to expand from phone to tablet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="csIn7W"&gt;TCL is once again teasing a foldable phone concept — and it’s a Frankenstein’s monster of some previously showcased flexible concepts. Called Fold ‘n Roll, it combines the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18237259/tcl-foldable-phone-prototype-video-dragonhinge-mwc-2019"&gt;“dragonhinge” technology&lt;/a&gt; with an extendable display panel. The result is a 6.87-inch phone that can expand to an 8.85-inch phablet size or fully extend to a 10-inch tablet. Outside of that, the company isn’t offering any other detailed information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P58r4i"&gt;TCL says it’s “still exploring the technical specifications” of this type of device, which doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence that the Fold n’ Roll will hit the market anytime soon. But TCL did say it plans to launch some kind of foldable phone before the end of 2021. The company has offered no shortage of foldable display concepts; most recently, it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;several to show off&lt;/a&gt; at this year’s virtual CES. But there’s a long distance between creating concepts and turning them into mass-market products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Ha5Xj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10446091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fU3Lng"&gt;Still, TCL might be in a good position to address a gap in the rollable market: affordable devices. Flexing, rolling phones are mostly reserved for the high end of the market right now, and TCL may be well-positioned to offer a less costly option. Samsung has hinted at a lower-cost flexible device coming soon, but until then, its current &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; options are still very pricey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrdhAn"&gt;LG’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;rollable concept&lt;/a&gt; may have been destined for a flagship device, but with the manufacturer’s exit from the smartphone business, we’ll never know if that tech might have trickled down to a midrange device. If it is TCL’s intention to offer something more affordable in the space, then there’s certainly some room to jump in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL aims to build a better budget phone with the 20 Pro 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lCZilEyPsfqjlhmV6PBSvFSapXY=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124944/TCL_20_Pro_5G_design_14.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G offers a 6.67-inch screen and 48-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YetCgh"&gt;TCL has announced the rest of its 20-series lineup, with the 20 Pro 5G leading the way. Along with the 20L and 20L Plus, the phone joins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219101/tcl-20-5g-20-se-android-phone-price-specs"&gt;two devices announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; at CES, the TCL 20 5G and 20 SE, all of which prominently feature the company’s display technology. TCL says the 20 Pro 5G and 20S (a regional variant of the 20L Plus) will come to the US this summer, though the company hasn’t confirmed prices yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lk7kQb"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G offers the most advanced specs of the bunch, with some refinements over last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257398/tcl-10-pro-review-release-date-specs-features-camera-screen"&gt;good-not-great 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It offers a 6.67-inch 1080p OLED with HDR10 support and includes the latest generation of TCL’s NXTVISION technology to identify on-screen content and adjust color, contrast, and sharpness accordingly. The 20 Pro 5G uses a Snapdragon 750G chipset — a step up from the 10 Pro’s 600-series processor — with 6GB RAM, ships with Android 11, and offers a 4,500mAh battery. Sub-6GHz 5G is supported, but TCL says it can adapt to include other 5G bands depending on the carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1HbzjVkiVB0lvVWnta7m8ROdjbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441810/TCL_20_Pro_5G_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 20 Pro 5G will come to the US this summer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PNeHDG"&gt;The phone’s main camera uses a 48-megapixel sensor with a small but important addition: optical image stabilization. It’s a feature that should help reduce blur in lower-light conditions, and it wasn’t offered on any of last year’s 10-series models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBhCb0"&gt;The standard wide camera is accompanied by a 16-megapixel ultrawide, 5-megapixel macro, 2-megapixel depth-sensing chip, and 32-megapixel selfie camera. For biometric unlock, the 20 Pro includes an in-display fingerprint sensor. We’re pleased to report that the 3.5mm headphone jack remains, and a microSD card slot is available for expansion on the 256GB of built-in storage. The 20 Pro 5G goes on sale tomorrow in the UK, Italy, and Portugal for €549 (about $655).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C9Qmm2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10444791"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h8XOQi"&gt;The TCL 20L and 20L Plus are more budget-oriented devices. They both offer a 6.67-inch 1080p LCD, a 5,000mAh battery, and a Snapdragon 662 processor. The 20L offers 4GB of RAM in its base model, while the Plus model starts at 6GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnwNfh"&gt;The 20L Plus also features a 64-megapixel main camera, while the 20L includes a 48-megapixel main sensor; both devices include an 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, 2-megapixel depth sensor, and 16-megapixel selfie camera. Both phones also use circular polarization display technology, so that the screen is visible from any angle when viewing it with polarized sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekN725"&gt;The 20L and 20L Plus go on sale tomorrow in the UK, Italy, and Portugal, starting at €229 and €269, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ0clq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next year’s iPhones will have 48-megapixel cameras and no mini option: Kuo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iWq6kGonFQK3rK2AwFJRrC7OjRo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123372/vpavic_4279_20201107_0094.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1evF1E"&gt;The 2022 iPhone lineup will feature substantial changes to the camera system, according to analyst Ming-chi Kuo in an investor note reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2022-iphones-no-mini-upgraded-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/14/kuo-48mp-camera-with-8k-support-coming-to-iphone-in-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo says the high-end iPhones — presumably the Pro range — will use a larger 48-megapixel sensor for the primary camera. Separately, the analyst suggests that 2023 iPhones may start to use Face ID sensors under the screen as a way to get rid of the notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnH08t"&gt;48-megapixel sensors have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/22/18192579/honor-view-20-48-megapixel-camera-review"&gt;common in Android phones for years&lt;/a&gt;, but this component will reportedly be larger than most. It’ll be a 1/1.3-inch sensor with a pixel size of 1.25µm, according to Kuo. That’s smaller than the 1.7µm pixels in the iPhone 12 Pro Max, but Kuo says that the equivalent pixel size will be more like 2.5µm when the sensor is used for 12-megapixel images. Kuo also expects the higher-resolution sensor to enable 8K video capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FZVE5e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple may ditch the iPhone mini in 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwCn04"&gt;The 2022 iPhone lineup is going to see a reduction in screen size options, Kuo says; there won’t be a 5.4-inch mini any more, and Apple will stick to the 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays on other models. The mini has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;not sold to Apple’s expectations&lt;/a&gt;, with the company said to have overestimated demand and cut production orders. The 2021 lineup, however, is expected to keep the same screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDY4ZP"&gt;Finally, Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2023-iphones-under-display-face-id/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone will begin to use an under-display Face ID system in 2023. Kuo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;previously claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Apple will replace the Face ID notch with a hole-punch camera in some models from next year, and that 2023 will also see under-display fingerprint scanners come to the iPhone. It’s not clear exactly which technologies will make it out when, or in which combination.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ppkPbJ"&gt;According to the telecom industry news site &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ossbsscx/verizon-atandt-t-mobile-blow-rcs-launch/d/d-id/768729"&gt;Light Reading, the big three US carriers are walking away from&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;Cross Carrier Messaging Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. The CCMI was meant to be a joint effort to promote RCS, the next-generation messaging standard designed to replace SMS. But while that might seem like bad news on the face of it, what it actually means is that carriers have given up on a bad plan that would have been bad for consumers. Whether or not they will replace it with a &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;plan remains, as ever with RCS, to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUOqAt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;CCMI was launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and by all indications was a joint effort that was spearheaded by Sprint. It initially seemed like a mixed bag of news. At the time, any effort by carriers to support proper cross-compatibility in RCS was a good sign. But the bad part was the consortium planned on creating an Android app themselves for messaging features. If you’ve ever used an app designed by a major US carrier, you know that’s a recipe for a bad experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaoIQK"&gt;Google was not part of the CCMI announcement, either, which was very strange given that Google is by far the biggest booster for the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTsU3N"&gt;However, after that announcement there was precious little information or movement. All the carriers seemed too busy hyping up 5G to give any real attention to the CCMI. Plus, T-Mobile was barreling down the path towards acquiring Sprint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gq804x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The CCMI promised a custom Android app from the carriers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dPxnpm"&gt;That acquisition happened and the one carrier that seemed enthusiastic for CCMI was subsumed into another. Then, last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;T-Mobile announced a huge deal with Google&lt;/a&gt; that included switching Android phones over to Android Messages as the default RCS/SMS app. The writing was on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plPW8g"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt; reached out to the third-party vendor, Synchronoss&lt;/a&gt;, that was originally going to handle the back-end logistics for the CCMI app (RCS can be run through a carrier’s server, Google’s server, or a third-party server). But while Synchronoss’ comment was noncommittal, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are now just telling it like it is. Here’s what Verizon told &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KQ9F9S"&gt;The owners of the Cross Carrier Messaging Initiative decided to end the joint venture effort. However, the owners remain committed to enhancing the messaging experience for customers including growing the availability of RCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4xjEne"&gt;Reached for comment by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T gave us a nearly identical statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9Kyk1"&gt;The rollout for RCS worldwide — and especially in the US — has been terribly slow and even more terribly confusing. Phones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563641/pixel-3a-t-mobile-rcs-chat-rollout-broken-encryption"&gt;should be compatible weren’t&lt;/a&gt;, carriers that promised their RCS would interoperate with others didn’t build those systems, and Apple continued to stay absolutely silent on whether it would support RCS (and it continues to stay silent to this day). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIanVz"&gt;However, Google has plodded along with its plan, making piece-by-piece efforts to broaden RCS adoption. It made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964477/googles-rcs-chat-android-rollout-us-ccmi-texting-sms"&gt;RCS available to anybody on any carrier if they used Android Messages&lt;/a&gt; as their SMS app. It cut that deal with T-Mobile. It has even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"&gt;begun testing end-to-end-encryption over RCS inside Android messages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBubJg"&gt;I will be the first in line to tell you that the rollout for RCS took what should have been a coordinated six-month effort that was a win for both carriers and Google and turned it into a multi-year slog that didn’t help anybody, least of all consumers. But the end of the CCMI is a sign that carriers might just be implementing more consumer-friendly RCS policies, not that they’re walking away entirely. T-Mobile made that deal with Google instead. Will all AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon continue to drag their feet on RCS? Almost definitely. But at least they won’t be foisting a carrier-made app on every Android user in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five things to consider before you sign up for T-Mobile Home Internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1TZIzJqFNRIgNYCXWaFZO0zeUIU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69119429/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s 5G home internet may sound like a tempting alternative to Big Cable.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0MLEl6"&gt;After a long early life in a pilot program, T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;5G home internet service&lt;/a&gt; has finally arrived. The bar for decent, reasonably priced internet service in the US is embarrassingly low, so T-Mobile’s terms might sound like a dream: $60 per month, no contract, no installation appointment, no equipment rental fees, and no data caps. It’s a service that’s very much in its early days, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/t-mobiles-60-home-internet-service-six-weeks-later/"&gt;reviews so far&lt;/a&gt; note some inconsistencies in performance among other quirks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgbpDM"&gt;Even taking all this into consideration, it may still sound well worth the potential risks if you’re shelling out close to twice that to Big Cable every month. But before you drop-kick your Comcast router into the river, there are a few things to be aware of if you’re thinking about switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zaKGul"&gt;Eligibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MeoYKV"&gt;First, and most obviously, is that you may not be eligible for the service. Home Internet isn’t offered everywhere that has T-Mobile cellular phone service; the company is introducing it as local network capacity allows. And even where it’s offered, you might not necessarily be able to get it. To make sure that it can handle the added demands of home internet users, T-Mobile may limit the number of signups they’ll allow in your neighborhood or condo building, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAxZwQ"&gt;Take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/where-can-you-get-t-mobiles-5g-home-internet-service-lets-go-to-the-map"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;’s map&lt;/a&gt; for an easy visual of the areas where home internet is currently offered, but for the most precise information, you’ll of course want to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Feligibility&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F13%2F22381885%2Ft-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check your home address with T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3AK7cs"&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IRBirI"&gt;Setting up wireless internet isn’t quite the plug-and-play experience you get with traditional wired service. You’ll be looking for the best spot in your home to place the Internet Gateway, as T-Mobile calls it. Signal strength may vary from room to room, and even within the same room you might find better signal near a particular window. An accompanying app takes you through the setup steps and lets you self-evaluate your tech comfort level at the beginning to provide an appropriate amount of guidance through the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="WC8zV0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;unlike traditional broadband, you might find a different spot in your home gives better service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nepUqz"&gt;Reviewers and early testers have noticed that signal strength can also vary throughout the day, so keep an eye on your internet speeds. Be prepared to try moving the Gateway to other locations if you’re not getting performance you’re happy with when you need it — unlike traditional broadband, you might find that a different spot in your home gives you better service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hM81wx"&gt;Slowdowns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XTCRst"&gt;Home internet service is subject to the same “data prioritization” policies as most of the company’s cellular data plans, meaning customers might see their speeds temporarily drop during busy times for the network. On some plans, this is applied only after a certain data threshold is met, but that’s not the case for Home Internet — users are always subject to this kind of slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="4uKY6j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;customers might see their speeds temporarily drop during busy times&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aFUL1R"&gt;That sounds like a dealbreaker, but T-Mobile executives that I spoke to said that customers are “unlikely” to experience this thanks to how the company is expanding the service. They say that Home Internet is only offered in places with adequate network capacity, and that signups in a particular area or building may be capped to avoid congestion. That’s reassuring but still something to take into account as a potential drawback if you need guaranteed speeds at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kDuKlS"&gt;Hulu + Live TV isn’t supported right now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gDoDBy"&gt;Tucked away in Home Internet’s fine print is a statement that it’s “not compatible with some live TV streaming services.” T-Mobile clarified this for us, saying that while YouTube TV and Netflix will work, Hulu’s live TV service doesn’t work right now due to a technical requirement. The company says it’s working with Hulu to resolve the problem. If Hulu is your main source for live TV, then it’s a good idea to wait until that’s squared away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="imZe3x"&gt;You can’t take it with you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yWK4wZ"&gt;It might sound appealing to take your internet with you when you stay somewhere else, like a vacation home, but that’s not allowed according to the service’s terms. T-Mobile says that’s to make sure that the service is being used in areas with adequate network capacity. Similarly, you can’t take the SIM card out of your modem and pop it in your phone when you leave the house. T-Mobile’s not going to let you quit your cellphone plan that easily.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Quantum 2 has quantum cryptography built in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RrYlX1bpoTaEsCDXGHFFrnhDoIA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117262/_Photo__SKT_to_Launch_QRNG_Powered_5G_Smartphone_Galaxy_Quantum2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oD1Wz8"&gt;Samsung and South Korean carrier SK Telecom have announced the Galaxy Quantum 2, Samsung’s second phone that features built-in quantum cryptography technology for increased security. It’s the follow-up to last year’s Galaxy A Quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ka7P1O"&gt;The Quantum 2 includes a chip developed by a company called ID Quantique, which says it’s the world’s smallest quantum random number generator (QRNG) at 2.5mm square. It works by capturing random noise with an LED and a CMOS image sensor. According to SK Telecom, the QRNG chip “allows smartphone holders to use services that require security in a more safe and secure manner by generating unpredictable and patternless true random numbers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4QGTZ"&gt;Quantum cryptography RNG is considered to be extremely challenging to hack without extensive physical access to a given device. The benefits will seem pretty niche to the average customer, but the QRNG chip does automatically work with apps that use the Android Keystore APIs, which should make the technology more accessible for developers. SK Telecom is touting local compatibility with the likes of Shinhan Bank and Standard Chartered Bank Korea, plus its own services like T World. The carrier says it’ll work with more services in the future, including Samsung’s own credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6b3mCn"&gt;The phone itself has reasonably high specs, close to what you’d have found in a high-end flagship phone from a year or two ago. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus processor, a 64-megapixel camera, and a 6.7-inch 120Hz OLED display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arWTr7"&gt;The Galaxy Quantum 2 is only confirmed for a release in South Korea right now. It’ll go on sale on April 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4HM3F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s follow up to the Z Fold 2 could be smaller, but maybe not in the dimension you want</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l5HaK0iuv9C7whGTmTMSI2pFSaY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116445/vpavic_200907_4181_0010_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u8ZMiY"&gt;Samsung’s next Galaxy Z Fold folding phone might have a slightly smaller screen than its previous models, feature a smaller battery, and quite possibly launch in July alongside a new Galaxy Z Flip, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=11865"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-3-will-reportedly-be-smaller-than-the-galaxy-z-fold-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CmxEB"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 will reportedly have a 7.5-inch main tablet screen and a 6.2-inch screen on the front cover of the phone, &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; writes, which would be virtually the same as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;the Fold 2’s&lt;/a&gt; 7.6-inch main display and 6.2-inch cover display. &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; says these screen sizes come with the added benefit of “zero bezels,” so even though the screens may be the same size, the third Fold could feel slightly smaller because the actual body of the phone might shrink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBiiEB"&gt;In comparison to the Fold 2’s 4,500mAh battery, the Fold 3 will reportedly make do with a slightly smaller 4,380mAh battery. Again, not a dramatic change in size and it might not even noticeably impact battery life, but it’s interesting to note if it effects other changes to the Fold’s design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uujIi-TwtsLqEJjklQdTF3pllPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439698/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_4.30.23_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even with a slight taper, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 is still almost as thick as two phones back to back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hwzwyn"&gt;There’s other rumored changes to the Fold line, including the possibility of S Pen support, just like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra got earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. For the Fold, a stylus could also pose additional challenges if Samsung tries to integrate stylus storage directly in the phone rather than using an add-on case like the Ultra. A hole for a stylus could take up space that could be filled with extra battery capacity or removed entirely for an overall thinner phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MF37JS"&gt;And — though &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t mention it at all, so don’t expect a change — thinness is the dimension that might actually matter when it comes to a new Galaxy Fold. Including the extra gap created by its hinge, the Fold 2 is about two S21 Ultra thick when folded. If Samsung isn’t thinning out the rumored Fold 3 to make it easier to hold and fit in a pocket, I hope they’ll consider that the next time around: it could also help Samsung compete with newcomers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Huawei’s Mate X2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi’s Mi Mix Fold&lt;/a&gt; which both use similar folding designs and are already thinner than the Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6H3DQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG Korea says that the Wing, Velvet 5G, and Velvet LTE phones will get Android 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1wDBuWsGUlparL02Rj8-GBW33go=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115027/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wing will be one of a few devices to receive OS upgrades for several years after LG exits the smartphone business.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vhTjQN"&gt;LG’s Korean website now lists which phones the company plans to update to Android 12, along with a few devices which will even get Android 13. These upgrades will most likely come long after the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;mobile industry exit&lt;/a&gt;, announced last week. &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/LG-Korea-reveals-which-phones-will-receive-Android-12-and-Android-13-update_id131368"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spotted the &lt;a href="https://www.lge.co.kr/lgekor/contents/mobile/swUpgradeDetail.do?swSeq=1441"&gt;updated FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, which previously stated that some models would get the OS upgrade to 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoiLYB"&gt;According to the FAQ, the LG Wing and both variants of the Velvet (LTE and 5G) will get Android 13. LG also says that those models, along with the V50, V50S, G8, Q31, Q52, and Q92, will receive an Android 12 upgrade. The company also notes that these two updates aren’t strictly guaranteed and will depend on product performance, product stabilization level, and Google policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBwiwF"&gt;LG Korea says that an Android 11 update, already in progress, is planned for the models mentioned above, along with the Q61, Q70, and Q9 One. As an aside, the Q-series models sold throughout Europe and Asia are similar to corresponding models sold as the K-series in the US but aren’t strictly a 1:1 match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4q1Bzo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG leaves behind more than a flip phone-shaped hole in our hearts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375938/lg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="s7vL90"&gt;Availability and timing of updates will, of course, vary by region, but the list is a good indication of which models the company plans to prioritize. Recently, LG’s German website &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327144/lg-android-11-software-update-wing-phones-mobile-q4-2021"&gt;published a timetable&lt;/a&gt; for its Android 11 updates, most of which won’t be released until the end of the 2021. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/1/18164265/lg-android-pie-update-g7-v40-q1-2019"&gt;isn’t known for a great track record&lt;/a&gt; on platform updates, but it’s encouraging to see specific model names mentioned for the future upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;
