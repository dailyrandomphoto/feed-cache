    <title>Google says a fix is coming for update that erased major Pixel 6 feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAZ-1KCcusee49erWj4-_sIKw1Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70135494/akrales_211022_4802_0839.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SX3YdU"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/135090859/magic-eraser-was-there-to-use-until-this-morning-now-gone-%F0%9F%A4%B7%E2%80%8D%E2%99%80%EF%B8%8F?hl=en"&gt;reports from some users&lt;/a&gt;, an update to Google Photos removed one of the Pixel 6’s big features: the Magic Eraser tool that lets you remove unwanted objects or people from your photos. If your Pixel downloaded the affected version (5.67, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-magically-erases-magic-eraser-latest-google-photos-update"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), fear not: Google says it’s working on a fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rj0Dcp"&gt;While the version of Photos with the Magic Eraser erased doesn’t appear to be available in the Play Store anymore, its &lt;a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/photos/"&gt;presence on APK Mirror&lt;/a&gt; confirms that it was at one point (though we wouldn’t recommend downloading it). According to one user, the broken version displayed a tip about the object removal feature, despite it no longer being accessible in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iaijh6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says a fix is coming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fSbyUs"&gt;Google spokesperson Alex Moriconi told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company “identified an issue early in the rollout of [its] latest Photos update and are providing a fix shortly.” Google also says that the issue didn’t affect everyone, which reflects our experience — two &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff with Pixel 6s said that they didn’t have any Google Photos updates available and that they were still able to use Magic Eraser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3viRbA"&gt;While it seems like the update is no longer spreading, it’s still understandable why the users that got it would be shocked to find Magic Eraser missing — it was one of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8YiEmekf_34?t=114"&gt;Google’s main selling points&lt;/a&gt; when it launched the phone around a month ago. Plus, the missing feature being designed to delete things adds dramatic irony, as &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;’s “Google magically erases Magic Eraser” headline pokes fun at. Given the relatively small number of posts about the issue, though, it hopefully won’t affect you too much. If it does, keep your eyes peeled for an update to Google Photos; help is apparently on the way. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rittenhouse trial judge still baffled by pinch-to-zoom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kyle Rittenhouse Trial Continues In Kenosha, WI" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ZRp1eJWDGDRsvDOEwxypppFmuQ=/472x487:4865x3416/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70135398/1236522232.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;nbsp;Judge Bruce Schroeder takes a moment to take a personal call as the court waits for and evidence video to be played as Kyle Rittenhouse, left, and his attorney Mark Richards look on at the Kenosha County Courthouse on November 12, 2021 in Kenosha, Wisconsin | Photo by Sean Krajacic-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="83Tq5c"&gt;The prosecution and defense continue to argue over evidence in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse for killing two people during a protest in Wisconsin, with a surprising amount of confusion from both the defense and Judge Bruce Schroeder about what happens when you pinch-to-zoom on a touchscreen device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLND8s"&gt;On Wednesday, Schroeder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775580/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-judge-apple-ai-pinch-to-zoom-footage-manipulation-claim"&gt;stated it was up to the prosecution to prove that zooming on a video in with an iPad&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t alter or manipulate the footage. “iPads, which are made by Apple, have artificial intelligence in them that allow things to be viewed through three-dimensions and logarithms,” the defense said as part of its objection, adding that the iPad “uses artificial intelligence, or their logarithms, to create what they believe is happening. So this isn’t actually enhanced video; this is Apple’s iPad programming creating what it thinks is there, not what necessarily is there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ru18F3"&gt;Judge Schroeder let the objection stand after giving prosecutors only 20 minutes to find an expert witness to explain how pinch-to-zoom on an iPad worked. (It should be noted, of course, that iPads do not have any “logarithms” that allow video to be viewed in three dimensions or “recreate” parts of an image that are not there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ODrit"&gt;During arguments over jury instructions &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-live-kyle-rittenhouse-lawyers-and-judge-discuss-jury-instructions-as-trial-for-kenosha-shooting-continues-day-9"&gt;broadcast live today&lt;/a&gt;, the judge went further, pulling out his own smartphone to demonstrate his continuing bafflement at pinch-to-zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyLxan"&gt;Specifically, the judge saves texts from his friends by taking screenshots and emailing them to himself. He showed one such screenshot to the courtroom today, noting that “some of them are pretty long” and “show up in my email like this, like a little ribbon,” so he zooms on them and “it’s just a blur.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="maNtzk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s just a blur”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r27KD2"&gt;According to the judge (talking to the prosecution), “You were talking the other day... about it’s just like a cellphone where you can expand a picture and make it bigger. But it’s not making it any bigger; it’s just a blur. Well, it’s not making it any bigger...it’s making it bigger, but it’s nothing but a blur.” He then questioned, “how that can be reliable... because it isn’t reliable for me and getting my messages on my phone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBcwBz"&gt;The prosecutor responded, “I think you’re taking the picture wrong on your phone. I’m not tech support, but...” The judge replied, “I’m not surprised,” prompting laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vaz2Yr"&gt;Let’s explain what’s going on here. Judge Schroeder appears to be using a Samsung Galaxy 20. That means he’s likely activating “scroll capture,” a Samsung screenshot feature that produces long images of an entire window — in this case, the entire text conversation. So those screenshots show up as long skinny images on his screen in order to fit. When he emails (or texts) that image to himself, the image is then &lt;em&gt;compressed&lt;/em&gt; to a smaller resolution and file size, so when he tries to zoom in on it, it’s blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aG4dmh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Judge Schroeder appears to be activating scroll capture on his Galaxy S20&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vNWu6O"&gt;None of this is useful evidence in support of the defense’s objection about iPad pinch-to-zoom. First of all, a Galaxy S20 runs Google’s Android operating system with various Samsung customizations, while the defense’s specific objections were about Apple’s “logarithms” on an iPad. So from the start, whatever a Samsung phone is doing is not relevant to an objection about how an Apple device works. Secondly, the defense’s objection is about those Apple logarithms &lt;em&gt;adding&lt;/em&gt; data to an image such that it can be viewed in three dimensions or recreate what is not there. Here, Judge Shroeder’s phone is plainly not adding any data to the image: it remains &lt;em&gt;blurry&lt;/em&gt;. If anything, his experience supports the &lt;em&gt;prosecution’s &lt;/em&gt;ability to zoom a video. But again: different software from different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U39FA9"&gt;The judge closed the conversation by failing to silence his phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces its next-gen RAM for phones and ‘the metaverse’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/is3lyUe0H97S94WbD186Da_Go2E=/0x42:2000x1375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118221/Samsung_LPDDR5X_DRAM_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FbCO0W"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-develops-industrys-first-lpddr5x-dram"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; its next-generation RAM tech made for mobile devices, which it says can be used in future smartphones but also in servers, cars, and “the metaverse.” While Samsung’s press release doesn’t mention how its new LPDDR5X RAM chips could help people enter the “digital reality,” the tech should help make devices run faster and last longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsHQxN"&gt;Putting the buzzwords like metaverse, AI, and 5G aside, Samsung is promising some real improvements to speed and power usage: it says its next-gen RAM will have 1.3-times faster processing speeds versus the previous-gen LPDDR5, will be capable of higher densities (up to 64GB per chip), and will use 20 percent less power than the last generation. Some of these improvements, according to Samsung, can be chalked up to the new 14nm process it’s using to create the chips. Also, for all the ribbing about the metaverse, lower-power draw and better performance could actually help with AR and VR headsets with onboard processors or phones that are driving those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="pBAd70"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10833239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ecLAES"&gt;Samsung didn’t immediately respond to a request for clarification about the improvements of the 14nm process versus its previous-gen RAM chips, which &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-begins-mass-production-of-16gb-lpddr5-dram-at-worlds-largest-semiconductor-line"&gt;it marketed as “10nm-class,”&lt;/a&gt; meaning &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-industrys-first-8gb-lpddr5-dram-for-5g-and-ai-powered-mobile-applications"&gt;that the process was between 10nm and 20nm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="temZrD"&gt;Samsung doesn’t say when its LPDDR5X RAM chips will be available to manufacturers (including Samsung’s phone division), but &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17058/samsung-announces-lpddr5x-at-85gbps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; has speculated&lt;/a&gt; that they’ll start showing up in devices around 2023. &lt;a href="https://overclock3d.net/reviews/cpu_mainboard/intel_12th_gen_ddr4_vs_ddr5_with_asus_z690_plus_tuf_gaming_d4/1"&gt;As with regular-power DDR5&lt;/a&gt;, which is making its way to desktop computers, it’s not likely that you’ll be able to immediately notice a massive generational leap between devices using LPDDR5 and LPDDR5X memory. However, it’s these kinds of improvements that help our devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749341/smartphones-future-predictions"&gt;get better and better with each generation&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s nice to see Samsung pushing one of the less exciting aspects of a phone’s performance forward — even if it’s using vague promises about the metaverse to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Netflix is getting into video games&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="5hhtFz"&gt;Netflix is making a big push into video games. The company first dabbled in games with interactive titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152973/netflix-carmen-sandiego-interactive-special-black-mirror-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carmen Sandiego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; game, but in 2021, it made gaming a much bigger priority. Netflix hired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;a former EA exec&lt;/a&gt; in July to lead its gaming efforts and, in November, let people play a selection of mobile games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772480/netflix-games-apple-iphone-ipad-ios-subscription-app-store"&gt;free&lt;/a&gt; as part of their subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Spaces try to make it easier to get apps ready for augmented reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CghtZ3dT3JKa7tCMdJUSd8FH9HI=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116410/Snapdragon_Spaces_Lifestyle_Asset.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JsfwNW"&gt;While a lot of talk about the metaverse has focused on virtual reality experiences that use a VR headset to put people in digital environments, other approaches use augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (XR) to blend digital and physical elements. Today at the Augmented World Expo, Qualcomm &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/11/09/snapdragon-spaces-xr-developer-platform-launches-create-headworn-ar"&gt;is revealing its Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform&lt;/a&gt;, a kit that will help devs expand existing apps and create new ones to take advantage of AR devices you wear on your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpSJR1"&gt;Today’s announcement doesn’t include mention of new hardware, however, Qualcomm is lining up some important partners for the mixed reality future that it’s been planning for the last decade. They include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22768925/niantic-lightship-developer-platform-john-hanke-pokemon-go"&gt;Niantic and its recently revealed Lightship platform&lt;/a&gt; for “real-world metaverse apps,” as well as hardware OEMs including Lenovo, Motorola, Oppo, and Xiaomi. Lenovo’s ThinkReality A3 glasses, based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296100/qualcomm-xr1-smart-viewer-ar-glasses-announce-lenovo-thinkreality-a3"&gt;Qualcomm’s XR1 Smart Viewer reference design&lt;/a&gt;, will be the first to “commercialize” Snapdragon Spaces next year. T-Mobile is the “lead 5G launch partner” and will work with startups and developers via its existing &lt;a href="http://t-mobileaccelerator.com/"&gt;T-Mobile Accelerator program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHzAdeIyVMqJ76T2uTLBw-dJuhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998297/qualcomm_snapdragon_spaces.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="krxMUo"&gt;Snapdragon Spaces is intended to underpin an “open” and “cross device” ecosystem, with APIs that are hardware agnostic so the software developers create can run on many different types of platforms, including AR glasses or full AR headsets that look more like Microsoft’s HoloLens. According to Qualcomm, this is “the first headworn AR platform optimized for AR Glasses tethered to smartphones with an OpenXR conformant runtime.” It also has support for the familiar developer tools Unreal Engine 4 and Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0C6LG"&gt;It’s available now to “select” developers like Holo One and NZXT. Access for everyone is coming early next year, complete with tools for hand tracking, image recognition and tracking, positional tracking, and the like. Qualcomm also announced it has acquired assets from HINS SAS and its subsidiary, Clay AIR, for hand tracking and gesture recognition, while a partnership with Wikitude will open up access for that AR development platform’s 150,000 registered developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5IXa5"&gt;As 5G becomes widely available on more mobile devices (many of which are powered by Qualcomm hardware), the idea is that AR as a second screen feature for apps will also be ubiquitous. That includes AR tracks overlaying your living room for an Anki Drive-like experience or a floating smartwatch UI that only you can see. There are already augmented reality experiences available for mobile devices that can help you shop for furniture and visualize it inside your living space, but this platform is supposed to make those easier to build from scratch, port them from one platform to another, and get them ready for use in upcoming headsets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This $252 Nokia X100 is a budget 5G phone with a 1080p display and 6GB RAM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iuo3ZS4_YPvZib4d0za9eKlQdNE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116059/nokia_x100_product_photo__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia X100 is a T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile exclusive budge 5G phone.&lt;/em&gt; | HMD Global&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6K8CXr"&gt;Starting November 19th, 2021, T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile will be adding another budget 5G phone to the lineup — the $252 Nokia X100 that is exclusive to T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLQUYX"&gt;This addition is coming just as the holiday shopping season is ready for kickoff, and T-Mobile’s sales of other budget 5G phones from REVVL and certain OnePlus models have been limited by handset shortages, according to Wave7 Research’s September 2021 Smartphone Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIZwuq"&gt;Nokia is doing its part to jump-start sales by packing the X100 with lots of surprising features, despite its small sub-$300 price tag. While it shares similar looks and the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22760873/nokia-g50-review-mobile-5g-sub6hz-android-smartphone"&gt;$300 Nokia G50&lt;/a&gt;, that’s where their similarities end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDd0HT"&gt;Unlike the G50, the X100 is geared for entertainment. It has a 6.67-inch 1080p full HD display (1080 x 2400p resolution), with a 20:9 aspect ratio that is a little wider to better fit full-screen videos. It has 6GB of RAM to support its processor, 128GB of internal storage, as well as a microSD card slot that can accept up to a 1TB card for backup and extra storage. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia X100 has quad rear cameras, including a 2-megapixel Macro camera for closeups and extreme details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S8PTBp"&gt;The cheaper Nokia X100 also has four cameras on the back: a 48-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide camera, a 2-megapixel depth camera, as well as a 2-megapixel Macro camera for extreme closeups and details. It also has a 16-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kda8v6"&gt;Out of the box, the X100 uses Android 11, but it’s unclear if and when this model will get future OS or security updates from the carrier or manufacturer. It’s worth noting this Nokia doesn’t have the biggest battery at 4,470mAh, especially in combination with its high-resolution screen and 5G connectivity. However, it still has a 3.5mm audio jack for wired headphone fans, as well as NFC to handle contactless payments. As a 5G phone, the X100 is compatible with T-Mobile’s slower but more widely available sub-6Hz 5G network, in case you need 5G speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhd4QQ"&gt;You can find the Nokia X100 at T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile stores starting on November 19th for $252. Keep your eyes peeled for extra carrier holiday deals to sweeten the Nokia X100 even more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yes, your Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro can be MagSafe-friendly with this Moment case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vhnDp0sypwlk5vjmT5IbaSogRzA=/403x490:5654x3991/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102491/Moment_Pixel6_mforce_magsafe_1126.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moment has a whole ecosystem of accessories that will now work with the Pixel 6, thanks to its new M(force) case.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Moment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EJACZV"&gt;Your dangerously slippery Pixel 6 or 6 Pro just arrived, and you’re scrambling to find an available case that will protect your new baby. Whether you are a MagSafe-curious Pixel owner or recently ditched your iPhone for the Pixel but have some MagSafe accessories you don’t want to waste, Moment’s (M)Force case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro could be the bridge to more platform agnostic mobile accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ei1Rb"&gt;As a mobile accessory maker, Moment embraces the idea that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22417836/moment-magsafe-iphone-camera-accessories-review-price-features-specs"&gt;ecosystem of lenses and mounts for content creators&lt;/a&gt; should be compatible with different phone brands and models. After all, each case is compatible with Moment’s catalog of accessories that shares the same mount design — just like the way camera lenses work with various camera bodies. This is not the first time that Moment has made a cross-platform case: earlier this year, the company released some &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fgalaxy-thin-case-m-force%2FS21-ultra-5g-black&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22753313%2Fpixel-6-magsafe-pro-moment-mforce-case-mobile-accessories-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe-compatible cases for the Samsung Galaxy S21s&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbZ6dn"&gt;According to Alec Ploof who is in charge of partnerships at Moment, the thought process to make its cases compatible with MagSafe was simple: “We included our proprietary M(Force) magnets into all of the Moment cases we made for iPhone 11, 12, &amp;amp; 13, so we figured to also include them in our new Pixel 6 or Samsung S21 cases to also make these devices compatible with our MagSafe mounting products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vhyFs7Qe1cZa8SVGtGPrPpxDu1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989736/P6_Pro_3_Front.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moment’s case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro with (M)Force has an array of 36 magnets that help MagSafe accessories attach to the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhwhAroeCg3z1lFRPrR2c79fBtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989743/P6_Pro_1_Back.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike Moment’s other cases which feature wood or canvas panels, the (M)Force case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro is made of textured polycarbonate and TPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JqOnHi"&gt;Unlike Moment’s previous cases that feature wood and canvas panels, there is just one case design for both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s case with (M)Force. It’s all black and made of a textured and a “grippy material” called high-strength polycarbonate and TPU. Its three-layer exterior should protect your Pixel 6 from up to six-foot drops and even has a provision for a wrist strap (sold separately). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mB1209"&gt;On the inside is a layer of premium microfiber liner that wraps around your Pixel 6 or 6 Pro, as well as an array of 36 of Moment’s proprietary (M)Force magnets. Those magnets are equivalent to about 15lbs of force, so your MagSafe accessory should be able to attach easily yet securely to your Pixel. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QxaowMFWrVtDjSkWqkQHutEX60M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989835/Moment_Pixel6_mforce_magsafe_1134.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moment case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro with (M)Force, attached to the Pro Tripod Mount with MagSafe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CeZL9W"&gt;Not only will this Moment case with (M)Force work with its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fmoment-pro-tripod-mount-for-magsafe%2Fpro-portrait-landscape&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22753313%2Fpixel-6-magsafe-pro-moment-mforce-case-mobile-accessories-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Tripod Mount with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, it will be able to charge wirelessly with any battery that is Qi- and MagSafe-compatible. This means your Pixel 6 might just be able to make use of other Qi- and MagSafe-friendly accessories out there, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744362/anker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile"&gt;Anker’s adorable 8-in-1 637 Magnetic Charging Station&lt;/a&gt;. Just don’t expect to get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;15W fast charging from Apple’s official MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jj6ZX1"&gt;Both (M)Force cases for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are available now on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fmoment-case-for-pixel-6%2F6-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22753313%2Fpixel-6-magsafe-pro-moment-mforce-case-mobile-accessories-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Moment’s website for $50&lt;/a&gt;. While the Pixel 6 case is currently in stock, the Pixel 6 Pro case won’t ship until December 4th due to the global supply shortage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Code suggests Google’s folding Pixel will return to 12-megapixel camera next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-UDdpgPW5i6DLdApNvtrnMrWNRs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099537/dbohn_210820_4722_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JhPdxC"&gt;Google’s rumored foldable device could release next year with similar camera hardware to what older Pixel phones used prior to this year’s big Pixel 6 overhaul, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/04/googles-pixel-foldable-coming-in-2022-cameras-will-be-a-step-down-from-pixel-6/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Reports about the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;first emerged this summer&lt;/a&gt;, at which point it was expected to launch before the end of the year. Now the device, whose codename appears to have changed from “Passport” to “Pipit,” seems to be on track for a launch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD9huF"&gt;These latest details have emerged thanks to code discovered in the Google Camera app. In particular, they suggest that the foldable will use a 12.2-megapixel IMX363 sensor for its main camera. That suggests the foldable won’t be equipped with the same 50-megapixel Samsung GN1 camera sensor Google used on this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the IMX363 is the sensor Google used for the Pixel 3 through 5. Its lower resolution suggests the foldable might struggle to match the excellent camera quality of the Pixel 6 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z77dsh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google switched to a 50-megapixel main sensor with the Pixel 6&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nwxnjy"&gt;Aside from the main sensor, the code snippets suggest the Pixel foldable’s other cameras will be more in line with the Pixel 6. There’s a 12-megapixel IMX386 that’s expected to handle ultrawide shots and two 8-megapixel IMX355 sensors for its selfie cameras. Two selfie cameras appear to be necessary to allow selfies to be taken while the foldable is both open and closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sfjZd"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes, it’s not uncommon to see companies equip foldables with less powerful camera hardware than their flagships. The recent Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, for example, had a 12-megapixel sensor rather than the 108-megapixel sensor Samsung used in the Galaxy S21 Ultra. But it might be a disappointment for anyone expecting Google’s rumored foldable to match the camera quality of its latest flagships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="duYy3l"&gt;A release date of next year makes sense for the foldable given what we know about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746599/android-12l-feature-drop-big-screens"&gt;Android 12L&lt;/a&gt;, the upcoming Android update that’s due to launch early next year and is designed to offer a range of improvements for devices with larger screens, including foldables. The update, which has previously been referred to as Android 12.1, also contains code suggesting Google might have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683566/google-jumbojack-foldable-passport-android-12-1-code-discovery"&gt;second foldable device in development&lt;/a&gt; under the codename “Jumbojack.” It’s unclear when, or even if, this second foldable may be released.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’s latest overkill gaming phones arrive in Europe with up to 18GB of RAM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AwUsM0jHvmwjR7mNiHB8BMW66kI=/0x0:1145x763/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099241/msedge_5BtFPuHiJl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROG Phone 5S Pro, which has a small display on its rear.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dPFt5t"&gt;Asus has announced pricing for the ROG Phone 5S series in Europe, following their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630283/asus-rog-phone-5s-pro-gaming-smartphone-android-price-release-date-features"&gt;launch in Taiwan in August&lt;/a&gt;. The ROG Phone 5S costs €999 for 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, while €1,099 gets you a step-up model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The top of the line 5S Pro has an excessive 18GB of RAM and the same 512GB of storage and retails for €1,299. Meanwhile in the UK, &lt;a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/asus/158977-asus-rog-phone-5s-pro-specs-price-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pocket-Lint&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the 16GB model will cost £999, and the 18GB Pro model will set you back £1,099, but there’s no mention of pricing for the 12GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhmTIR"&gt;The ROG Phone 5S and 5S Pro are functionally minor updates to the ROG Phone 5 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; that Asus released earlier this year. They have a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Plus processor and their screens have a more responsive 360Hz touch-sampling rate (their 144Hz refresh rates are unchanged), but the core specs remain the same. They still have 6.78-inch 1080p displays, 6,000mAh batteries, and triple-rear camera array with 64-megapixel main sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GF2DBifVWw0Z2mNXy6H_kAYIcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22987984/h732.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gJJAmG"&gt;Although European pricing for the phones has now been announced, exact release dates seem to vary from country to country. In the UK, for example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fuk%2FMobile%2FPhones%2FAll-series%2Ffilter%3FCategory%3DGaming-Phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765036%2Fasus-rog-phone-5s-pro-europe-launch-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus’ online store&lt;/a&gt; currently doesn’t offer links to preorder the phones. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Ffr%2FMobile%2FPhones%2FAll-series%2Ffilter%3FCategory%3DGaming-Phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765036%2Fasus-rog-phone-5s-pro-europe-launch-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In France&lt;/a&gt; the 16GB model of the ROG Phone 5S is available to buy now, but the 12GB and 18GB RAM variants are due to ship on November 19th. We’re yet to hear about any US release plans for the new phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and AT&amp;T delay crucial 5G expansion over aircraft interference concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SKhuTLlvOCWA4ClbJtBF3P9odDs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094027/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MR2uYu"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are delaying the rollout of their wider 5G networks after the Federal Aviation Administration warned that the new wireless technology could interfere with the safety systems of some aircraft, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-verizon-to-delay-5g-rollout-over-faas-airplane-safety-concerns-11636039555"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBNlyf"&gt;The two companies planned to light up new 5G networks that use so-called “C-band” frequencies on December 5th. That rollout will now be delayed until at least January 5th, the companies said Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQLr73"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T still currently offer ultra-fast 5G connectivity in specific areas using high-band millimeter-wave technology and much slower 5G over low-band frequencies. But the two companies have been banking on using the C-band — which covers midrange frequencies with good-to-great speed — to dramatically expand access to 5G across the country. The two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;collectively spent nearly $70 billion earlier this year to gain access to a bunch of C-band spectrum&lt;/a&gt; that was up for auction. T-Mobile, the other major player in the wireless market, already has a lot of mid-band spectrum that doesn’t operate in the C-band (though it will in a few years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="inoXgW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T need this spectrum to keep pace with T-Mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k7AlJO"&gt;The aviation industry has voiced concerns over C-band interference for a while now. In an &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/faa-has-deep-concern-about-5g-network-plan-aviation-safety-letter-2021-10-29/"&gt;August meeting&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Communications Commission, for instance, industry reps said that “major disruptions to use of the National Airspace System can be expected” with the rollout of C-band 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDKp1g"&gt;Those concerns &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-faa-warns-potential-interference-new-5g-technology-2021-11-02/"&gt;came to a head this week&lt;/a&gt; when the FAA released a “&lt;a href="https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgSAIB.nsf/(LookupSAIBs)/AIR-21-18?OpenDocument"&gt;special information bulletin&lt;/a&gt;” about potential interference issues with safety equipment that relies on radio altimeters. While the agency said that there have been no documented incidents of “harmful interference” in other countries to date, it nonetheless warned aircraft operators that they “should be prepared for the possibility that interference from 5G transmitters and other technology could cause certain safety equipment to malfunction, requiring them to take mitigating action that could affect flight operations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5QOcq"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said Thursday that it is working with the FAA and FCC to better understand the aviation industry’s concerns. “It is critical that these discussions be informed by the science and the data,” the company said in a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That is the only path to enabling experts and engineers to assess whether any legitimate co-existence issues exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfFHfJ"&gt;The major wireless trade group, the CTIA, said last week that companies should be able to use C-band 5G “without causing harmful interference to aviation equipment,” &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/faa-has-deep-concern-about-5g-network-plan-aviation-safety-letter-2021-10-29/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The group pointed to the many successful C-band deployments in other countries as evidence. “Any delay in activating this spectrum risks America’s competitiveness,” the group wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
