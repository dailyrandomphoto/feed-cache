    <title>AT&amp;T’s confusing 5G Plus expansion confirms T-Mobile was right all along </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JFEkF5TRi-tYKnit7lVEJt_rsSo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048196/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VXRhNn"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s new 5G Plus expansion gives T-Mobile the perfect “I told you so” moment. AT&amp;amp;T currently offers two “flavors” of 5G: 5G Plus over the high-band mmWave spectrum and regular 5G, which is comparable to 4G LTE. Now, &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/innovationblog/2021/c-band-5G.html"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; details that AT&amp;amp;T is bolstering 5G Plus with the mid-band C-Band spectrum in 2022 — a concept that T-Mobile has been preaching for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeC7jf"&gt;Former &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8930691/tmobile-ceo-trashes-verizon-att-5g-plans"&gt;T-Mobile CEO John Legere slammed AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; for not having a mid-band spectrum in 2019, stating that 5G needs a low-band, mid-band, and high-band spectrum to work efficiently. This is because that high-band mmWave 5G offers the fastest speeds over shorter distances, making it best for highly concentrated areas. Conversely, low-band 5G provides the bare minimum for speed over wider areas. Offering 5G service with no in-between isn’t ideal — a mid-band range serves as the median between both spectrums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SSTPo9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dear wireless carriers: the 5G hype needs to stop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zNR3bo"&gt;Until this year, T-Mobile was the only major carrier with access to the entire range of spectrums. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T invested nearly $70 billion&lt;/a&gt; combined to gain access to the C-band spectrum in February, making both companies two years behind T-Mobile. AT&amp;amp;T plans on lumping together mmWave and C-band under 5G Plus, and it doesn’t appear that it’s giving you a way to distinguish between the two bands. T-Mobile operates similarly, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675255/tmobile-5g-uc-icon-iphone"&gt;it displays a “5G UC” icon&lt;/a&gt; when you’re connected to either its mid-band or high-band spectrums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6BWd7"&gt;All this relabeling by mobile carriers isn’t making the transition to 5G any less confusing. With each service introducing its own nicknames for their fastest 5G speeds and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265048/att-5g-e-misleading-advertising-recommendation-narb"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T mislabeling its old 4G service as “5Ge,”&lt;/a&gt;  the 5G mess becomes less and less appealing by the day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 695 is a faster mid-tier 5G chip </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1B47So8WeprgfbhVA4f5tvv-msE=/429x0:7179x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047174/QRD_4_pack_version_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0YuLPV"&gt;Qualcomm is announcing a pile of new Snapdragon chips today across its mid- and entry-level product lineups: the Snapdragon 778 Plus, 695, 680, and 480 Plus, offering more options to device manufacturers when it comes to picking the best processor for a phone — and, in theory, more choice for customers when they’re looking to buy one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmwdyA"&gt;The most notable new chip is the Snapdragon 695, which replaces the Snapdragon 690 in Qualcomm’s lineup. Unlike the old model, the Snapdragon 695 will support both mmWave and sub-6GHz versions of 5G, which should help improve data speeds even on cheaper phones (which have thus far tended to skip out on offering mmWave support). There’s also a  considerable boost in performance: Qualcomm promises a 15-percent improvement in CPU performance and up to 30 percent faster graphics rendering compared to the 690. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aHBHoZ-Yq7XABrPd_RkEMPbGILs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956497/QRD_4_pack_version_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kQ7CQr"&gt;There’s also the curious addition of the Snapdragon 680 — a new LTE-only SoC that’s built on the same, more modern 6nm process as the 695. It’s not quite up to par with the new 5G chip that Qualcomm announced, but rather is intended to help fill the gap in Qualcomm’s lineup for companies that still are looking for 4G-only devices (which can help cut costs in regions that don’t have 5G deployments yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JBVQM"&gt;The other two chips are refreshed versions of existing modes. There’s the Snapdragon 778G Plus, an enhanced version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442830/qualcomm-snapdragon-778g-5g-m-2-reference-design"&gt;standard 778G model&lt;/a&gt; that the company announced earlier this year, and the Snapdragon 480 Plus, which upgrades the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;existing Snapdragon 480&lt;/a&gt;. Both models promise boosted performance compared to their non-plus counterparts, although the gains are small. The 778G Plus, for example, sees its CPU go from 2.4GHz to 2.5GHz, while 480 Plus boosts clock speed from 2.0GHz to 2.2GHz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1hK5k"&gt;The four new chip platforms are all expected to launch later in Q4 2021, with partners HMD, Honor, Motorola, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi all expressing interest in using at least some of the new Snapdragon chips. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s broadband satellite venture Kuiper teams up with Verizon to expand 5G coverage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nI9_f7W1gIiuszqwr1G_yVa-y50=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046195/51595784865_fc7b54d339_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Atlas V launching at night. Project Kuiper has bought nine launches of Atlas V rockets to send its satellites into orbit.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: United Launch Alliance&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SdhCxK"&gt;Amazon’s ambitious satellite venture, called Kuiper, is teaming up with Verizon to further expand 4G / LTE and 5G coverage to remote areas of the globe. Through the new partnership, Kuiper’s future satellites could provide connectivity to future Verizon cell towers that don’t require as much costly infrastructure to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFxU7e"&gt;Kuiper is Amazon’s $10 billion initiative to launch a constellation of 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit to provide broadband internet coverage to the Earth below. With satellites flying at altitudes between 366 miles and 391 miles high (or 590 kilometers and 630 kilometers up), the plan is to provide connectivity to remote and rural areas, where it is difficult to provide internet coverage through traditional fiber. During prototype testing, Kuiper claims its system can produce throughput speeds of up to 400Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tVJcKL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“no single company will close the digital divide on its own.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D700Wm"&gt;Amazon is partnering with Verizon to use Kuiper for satellite-based cellular backhaul, allowing (in theory) for Verizon to expand access to its 4G and 5G networks to more rural and remote locations without having to employ more traditional connectivity methods. Instead, Verizon would be able to build 4G and 5G towers in rural and hard-to-reach areas without digging trenches to lay fiber cables — something that is both difficult and sometimes cost-prohibitive. By removing that aspect, the deal could expand Verizon’s reach in areas that suffer from low cellular connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76rA4F"&gt;“There are billions of people without reliable broadband access, and no single company will close the digital divide on its own,” Andy Jassy, Amazon’s CEO, said in a statement. “Verizon is a leader in wireless technology and infrastructure, and we’re proud to be working together to explore bringing fast, reliable broadband to the customers and communities who need it most.” Kuiper declined to say how much Verizon is paying for this service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bvmbv"&gt;Such a reality is still quite a ways off, though. Amazon’s Kuiper has yet to launch any satellites. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;As part of its launch license with the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt;, Kuiper must launch at least half of all of its satellites, or 1,618 spacecraft, by 2026. In April, Kuiper announced that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391508/amazon-ula-rocket-launches-internet-satellites-kuiper"&gt;purchased nine launches of the United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket&lt;/a&gt; to send its first batch of satellites to orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khOguD"&gt;Kuiper’s a proposed competitor to SpaceX’s Starlink project, which aims to provide the same kind of coverage, except with roughly 12,000 satellites instead. So far, SpaceX has launched more than 1,700 Starlink satellites into orbit around Earth and has even allowed users to test out individual connectivity through a beta program. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that Starlink would phase out of beta in October, but there has not been an official update on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4TIEH"&gt;Both Starlink and Kuiper rely on individual customers buying personal dish antennas in order to get connectivity from the satellites orbiting above them. Last year, Kuiper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;revealed the design of its 12-inch-wide dish&lt;/a&gt;, which is roughly half the size of Starlink’s dish (though SpaceX recently &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/new-starlink-user-dish-with-smaller-antenna-pops-up-in-fcc-filing/"&gt;requested a new license&lt;/a&gt; from the FCC for a smaller next-generation antenna).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FAEks"&gt;Starlink and Kuiper aren’t the only companies hoping to provide broadband internet access with low-flying satellites. Another company, &lt;a href="https://oneweb.net/media-center/oneweb-confirms-successful-launch-of-36-satellites-from-vostochny"&gt;OneWeb, has already launched 358 satellites&lt;/a&gt; of a proposed 648-satellite constellation. Meanwhile, another smaller company, Telesat, also plans to launch a constellation of nearly 300 satellites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBrAQU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chaim Gartenberg contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony Xperia Pro-I is a camera first, 5G phone second</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHDzWh8aFvVwlO4-nGrsyIPPyl0=/0x0:750x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70045819/thumbnails_large__default_upload_bucket_01_fe5962e1c05b0527fc2f64dea00191f8_1.png.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFMkgo"&gt;Sony is ready to throw-down with a new camera-first 5G phone — the Xperia Pro-I — in the battle for smartphone camera supremacy. Less than 12-hours after the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s reviews started dropping online, and all the camera enthusiasts trying to determine whether the Pixel 6 Pro or the iPhone 13 Pro Max has the best smartphone camera, Sony wants to be in the mix with the Xperia Pro-I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uk3hDL"&gt;The “I” in the Xperia Pro-I stands for imaging, which pays homage to Sony’s popular line of Alpha mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras and professional video cameras, rather than point-and-shoot camera model names like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995864/sony-rx100-mark-vii-camera-review-price-specs-features-microphone-jack"&gt;Sony RX100 VII (Mark 7)&lt;/a&gt;. At least that’s what the Sony representatives who were briefing journalists ahead of this event told us. The star of the show is obviously this device’s camera technology, so it’s totally fair to think of the Xperia Pro-I as a camera that happens to come with a phone attached. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jdm2oODa5ywRnuN5kYNCOXv_OA4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956098/thumbnails_large__default_upload_bucket_03_bf3834489e39e3e3a97099d54615d806.png.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia Pro-I’s triple rear camera array.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jMGXWd"&gt;After all, it’s notable for using a similar 1.0-type Exmor RS image sensor with phase detection AF (autofocus) that powers the RX100 VII, the preferred point-and-shooter of vloggers and tourists. This large 1-inch camera sensor enables “outstanding low light performance, high dynamic range, and beautiful bokeh,” according to Sony. However, &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/1641689739/sony-just-packed-a-1-stacked-cmos-sensor-into-the-xperia-pro-i-but-there-s-a-catch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DPReview&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that while this 1-inch sensor is 20 megapixels in total, the Xperia Pro-I only makes use of part of the sensor, meaning it outputs a 12-megapixel image on this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nWc1Y"&gt;While rare, Sony isn’t the first to include a 1-inch sensor in a phone. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439883/sharp-aquos-r6-japan-biggest-phone-camera-sensor-1-inch"&gt;Sharp’s Aquos R6&lt;/a&gt; had one when it was announced earlier this year, as did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6151671/panasonic-leica-cm1-android-cameraphone"&gt;Panasonic’s CM1 from 2014&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOSN6M"&gt;Sony’s Xperia Pro-I has a total of three 12-megapixel cameras on the back (a main, ultrawide, and telephoto) and one 8-megapixel camera around its front. While these cameras seem low-resolution, the Sony representative was very eager to explain that they contain fewer but larger (2.4µm) pixels, where each pixel captures more details, more dynamic range and greater depth of field. The company seems confident it doesn’t need to chase higher megapixel counts like its rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTrH0u"&gt;The Xperia Pro-I’s rear cameras use three glass lenses from Zeiss. Its main 24mm lens has dual aperture (f2.0/f4.4) that allows you to change the depth of field more quickly to create “authentic bokeh,” rather than the digital software-created bokeh effect that other phones produce. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VN8CVaZDvtYb372NgLNAF0sld_o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956097/thumbnails_large__default_upload_bucket_01_fe5962e1c05b0527fc2f64dea00191f8_1.png.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone’s display has a 21:9 aspect ratio, making this a narrow, tall device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="coBHFC"&gt;The Xperia Pro-I includes the same BIONZ X imaging processor found in Sony’s A9 professional mirrorless camera for sports, which allows it to take up to 20fps in burst shots similar to Sony’s recent smartphones like the Xperia 1 III. This is the rare smartphone camera that is fast at autofocus, and capable of real-time eye tracking (humans and animals) in both stills and videos. Speaking of videos, Sony claims that the Xperia Pro-I is is the first smartphone in the world that can record 4K videos at 120fps and be able to preserve all 120 frames. While other smartphones can record 4K videos, they often compress the frames into a smaller file, which means you won’t have as much control in post-production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZsaSi"&gt;On the phone side of the Xperia Pro-I, it has a 6.5-inch 21:9 3840x1644 OLED display, with 120Hz refresh rate, at a relatively skinny 21:9 aspect ratio. It’s powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G processor, and unlocked models should work on most 4G networks in the world, as well as sub-6GHz 5G. There’s 12GB RAM, 512GB of internal storage, a microSDXC card slot, and a 4,500mAh battery which can be fast-charged at 30W. Despite its premium and modern specs, the Xperia Pro-I still has a 3.5mm audio jack for creators who need to plug in a mic, and a strap hole to slide in a wrist strap for security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxwYGX"&gt;The Xperia Pro-I will ship in December 2021 for a whopping $1,800 (£1,599). That’s the same price as Samsung’s flagship foldable, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;, and $200 more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673600/iphone-13-1-tera-storage-memory-price-apple"&gt;1TB model of Apple’s iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $1,599. It’s also more than a Sony’s $1,300 RX 100 VII, and the same price as the $1,800 full-frame Sony A7C. But Sony’s aim with the Xperia Pro-I is to provide a device that can do it all, combining the quality of a dedicated point-and-shoot camera with a thin (0.35-inch) 5G phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpuHTb"&gt;Preorders for the Sony Xperia Pro-I will begin October 28, 2021 at 10:00AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q320W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap on Anker MagGo accessories for MagSafe wireless charging in your car and home</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tmaNmAiCZjyJE0xIQ7sURNVG_v4=/288x0:1712x949/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70044128/MagGo_Family.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker is introducing MagGo, its lineup of six MagSafe-compatible products for iPhones.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Anker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tOdnom"&gt;Bored by the few Apple-certified MagSafe accessories like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674261/apple-iphone-leather-wallet-magsafe-find-my-tracking"&gt;MagSafe wallet (2021)&lt;/a&gt;, or the MagSafe Duo Charger, and feel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728967/apple-magsafe-duo-wallet-cases-charging"&gt;stifled by its small ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;? If you want to expand your MagSafe-compatible collection, you’ll need to look to third-party accessory makers like Anker for some fresh ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A07Zx0"&gt;Anker, known for its affordable charging products like portable batteries and universal plugs, is introducing its own suite of MagSafe-compatible gadgets called MagGo that go beyond just wirelessly charging your iPhone 12 or 13. Its opening lineup has six new gadgets that take advantage of the convenience and security of attaching to the phone by magnets — these products are ideal for when you’re on the move and at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMmS55"&gt;Because Apple is so reluctant to certify third-party accessories and share its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;secret sauce on how to enable 15W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;, none of these Anker MagGo products will be capable of fast charging the way Apple’s official MagSafe Battery Pack can. Most are available in iPhone 13 colors (Misty Blue, Interstellar Gray, Dolomite White, and Lilac Purple) and are on sale on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/355BCB41-69A1-4EC7-BF77-DCB62DD95BAE?ingress=2&amp;amp;visitId=42d1b9d2-6b48-4c12-8c52-ab68282c3cf7&amp;amp;ref_=ast_bln"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fpages%2Fmaggo-boa&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt; today (except for the Anker Magnetic Wireless Charger 633). Just beware of the very similar product names — go by the product numbers instead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZyJ6TqB-G3eDxFGnk36nZrVo_8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954932/A25A00V1_RC01_V1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker MagGo Magnetic Phone Grip is a MagSafe version of the Pop Socket, but designed for iPhone 12s and 13s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IlKb8t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnetic Phone Grip (610)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGd1kR"&gt;Like the popular pop sockets that you can attach to the back of your smartphone to get a better grip on the device, the Anker Magnetic Phone Grip (610) attaches to your iPhone using the MagSafe magnet. Anker claims it is “strong enough to hold up to 28oz (800g) or the equivalent weight of four iPhone 12s,” so you should not fear that you’ll drop your phone by holding onto the Phone Grip’s ring. This Phone Grip is available for $15.99 starting today on Anker.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQjCRc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnetic Wireless Charger for your car (613)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNHSCx"&gt;Whether you need your phone for directions or your rideshare side hustle, you want to keep your phone in a safe and convenient place while driving in your car. Anker’s Magnetic Wireless Charger (613) is not only a minimalist car phone holder that attaches to your iPhone with the MagSafe magnet; it also wirelessly charges your phone while you drive (just 7.5W) and is adjustable up to 134 degrees to give you the best viewing angle. Just in case you need some extra USB ports in your car, the base that attaches to your dashboard also includes a dual-port USB charger: one USB-A and one 20W USB-C port. This handy car accessory retails for $69.99 starting today on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fb2930&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KnVc8ag132XFdxtcWJrpAXOUEJY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954957/violet_4_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Anker MagGo Magnetic Battery has a foldable kickstand for convenient video watching.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ndqarr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnetic Battery (622) with built-in stand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGWSkU"&gt;Of course, Anker has to make a MagSafe-friendly Magnetic Battery Pack (622) but with a twist. This one has a foldable kickstand that you can open to prop up your iPhone 12 or 13 while you watch a movie vertically or horizontally. Like Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack, this Anker battery attaches to the back of your iPhone but offers a much bigger 5,000mAh battery charging at a maximum of 7.5W, compared to a 1,460mAh battery charging at 15W on the Apple one. There is no getting around the fact that attaching such a big battery on the back of the phone adds 0.5 inches to its overall thickness, but you do get two extra USB-C ports in case you need to charge other devices when traveling. This 622 Magnetic Battery comes in complimentary iPhone colors (Misty Blue, Interstellar Gray, Dolomite White, Lilac Purple, Buds Green) and retails for $69.99 on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa1611&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVVTis9qkMB67ZAW3ABBxf_8_IY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954810/All_Colors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker’s MagGo Magnetic Wireless Charger (623) is a colorful and adjustable MagSafe-friendly stand and charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6mxxuT"&gt;Anker is also rolling out some handy home products that take advantage of MagSafe-friendly products for your home, like a charger and stand, as well as a power hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbP2eS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnetic Wireless Charger (623)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ev6Dm3"&gt;Now that you are doing more video calls, you’d probably appreciate not having to hold your phone for a 4-hour Zoom meeting. This little (2.49 × 2.49 × 3.14 inches) Anker Magnetic Wireless Charger (623) may look like a little desk garbage can or speaker, but it’s actually a phone charging station for your desk. It can both hold and wirelessly charge your iPhone using the MagSafe magnet and can swivel up to 60 degrees to give you the best viewing angle. According to the press release, apparently, there is a second 5W wireless charging platform underneath the main round charging platform, where you can wirelessly charge your AirPods. It comes in all the iPhone 13-matching colors and is available now for $79.99 on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FAnker.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-Charging/dp/B09B3FR23F?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mp98Ne"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnet Wireless Charger (633)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ok47zz"&gt;Not to be confused with the tiny speaker-like wireless charger (623), this Magnet Wireless Charger (633) is a two-fer that combines a magnetic battery and charging stand, all in one package. Like the Anker Magnetic Battery (622), this bundle comes with a 5,000mAh portable battery capable of charging at 7.5W, along with 2 USB-C ports that you can plug in two other devices that also need more juice. Once at your desk, you can then dock your iPhone without detaching the battery pack, so you can take a video call while wirelessly charging your phone. Its base even has an additional USB-C port and is a secondary 5W charging surface for your AirPods. Unlike the other MagGo products, this particular one won’t be available until December and will retail for $119.99 on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa25a7&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker MagGo Magnet Charging Station looks like a desktop speaker but it’s really a charging hub for all your gadgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C9gQEg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnet Charging Station (637)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65uu3W"&gt;Round and colorful, you’d never guess that this is actually an 8-in-1 power hub for your desk. Not only is the round surface in front a MagSafe charging platform and holder for your iPhone, but the back is also packed full of plugs for all your gadget needs. You can even simultaneously charge eight devices at once if you must. There are 2 USB-C ports, 2 USB-A ports, and three AC outlets that can charge a large laptop at full speed. Available only in America starting today, October 25th, 2021, for $99.99 on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FAnker.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Charging-Wireless-Delivery/dp/B099W4CTJ5?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile delays shutdown of Sprint 3G network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1b-3gOt-1pUqjPvo4j7dC_X3UE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70035219/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile has delayed its plans to shut down Sprint’s CDMA network | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kyB0TN"&gt;T-Mobile said it will delay its planned shutdown of Sprint’s 3G network by three months to ensure its “partners” have time to help customers with the transition. It had originally planned to phase out the network in January; that date has now been pushed to March 31st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Kh5mD"&gt;“Recently it’s become increasingly clear that some of those partners haven’t followed through on their responsibility to help their customers through this shift,” the company said in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Fupdate-on-our-cdma-network-transition-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F23%2F22741762%2Ftmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “So, we’re stepping up on their behalf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRagtl"&gt;T-Mobile’s statement doesn’t mention it by name, but likely is referring to Dish Network. The two sides have tangled over T-Mobile’s announcement it was shutting down Sprint’s legacy network, because of the impact it would have on Dish’s Boost Mobile customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSrfgT"&gt;As one of the conditions of the T-Mobile/Sprint Merger, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;Dish acquired Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in July, 2020 with the goal of Dish taking Sprint’s place as a fourth wireless carrier in the US. After T-Mobile announced it planned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;shut down Sprint’s CDMA network&lt;/a&gt;, Dish chairman Charlie Ergen compared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;T-Mobile to the Grinch&lt;/a&gt;, and later said his company was making every effort to migrate its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsLa4p"&gt;But T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Ffor-t-mobile-5g-connectivity-means-that-no-one-is-left-behind&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F23%2F22741762%2Ftmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that Dish was “dragging their feet in getting their customers upgraded to the superior 4G/5G world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGLj9w"&gt;Dish fired back on Monday; Jeff Blum, the company’s executive VP of external and legislative affairs said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that T-Mobile’s announcement “is a recognition that its premature shutdown of the CDMA network will harm consumers who rely on this network for critical connectivity, including 911.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAEr4d"&gt;Blum said that the additional time was “not nearly sufficient” to ensure that “over one million Boost customers— many of whom are low-income — projected to still need access to this network beyond March 31, 2022.” Supply chain cellphone shortages and COVID-related interruptions have slowed the upgrades, he added&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZrdWJ"&gt;“Given T-Mobile’s new admission that continuing the operation of its CDMA network will have ‘no material financial impact’ to its business and 5G buildout, we urge the company to live up to its promises to regulators,” Blum said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99YHwf"&gt;The Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618472/doj-letter-dish-t-mobile-3g-cdma-network-shutdown"&gt;Justice told Dish Network and T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in a July &lt;a href="https://dish.gcs-web.com/static-files/d0097e8d-56b9-486a-bc0a-1190e7141481"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; that it had “grave concerns” about the shutdown of Sprint’s legacy network, and urged both sides to take “all appropriate steps” to reduce the impact on customers who still rely on the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6gjLQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: October 25th 1:46PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statement from Dish Network EVP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy stores will soon offer Samsung foldable repairs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Best Buy store." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lg-MmU4YHeLxf9SRRQjTk6g-iIA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70041988/1336158138.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WbALcP"&gt;Samsung foldable owners will soon have more options for repairing their devices, with over 100 Best Buy stores gearing up to offer repairs in “early November,” &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/bestbuy/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The retailer is also officially offering repairs of Galaxy S and Galaxy Note devices as of today. Although some Best Buy stores offered similar repairs of these devices in the past, Samsung says this was previously a pilot program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpw77M"&gt;Expanding its repair options to foldables is important given the ongoing concerns people have about durability, especially when it comes to their internal folding displays. And when it comes to foldables, you’ll almost certainly want to turn to a professional for service. The devices are filled with stuff like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;tape, glue, and goo&lt;/a&gt;, which make successful home repairs very difficult to pull off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4pXevt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Foldables are hard to repair yourself&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1qXDZ6"&gt;As well as offering repairs on Samsung devices, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18691649/best-buy-apple-iphone-mac-ipad-repairs-all-stores"&gt;as of early 2019&lt;/a&gt; Best Buy also offers authorized repairs on Apple devices across its stores in the US. Easy access to replacement screens and batteries are important for prolonging the life span of devices, saving customers money, and decreasing the amount of electronic waste that ends up in landfills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJ5EKu"&gt;Samsung says it has a network of over 550 Authorized Care locations across the US, and that it also has over 600 independent service providers. The company also offers a doorstep repair service called “&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/service/we-come-to-you/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;We Come to You&lt;/a&gt;,” as well as a mail-in service. For a full list of Samsung devices that can be repaired at Best Buy, check out &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/http://www.samsung.com/us/support/bestbuy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9a1ibi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 25th, 11:28AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to clarify that Best Buy’s previous Samsung repair options were offered as part of a pilot program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K0LsOJ"&gt;Mobile spam calls have been a nuisance for years. I get between four and six robocalls daily, and a quick survey of friends shows that I’m not alone. Every waking day brings with it a new barrage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDh4m1"&gt;Robocallers have upped their game by masking their spam with local, genuine-looking phone numbers. Sometimes their nonsense is amusing — like when you get a threatening voicemail about your impending arrest over owed back taxes — but the vast majority of the time, it’s an unwelcome distraction. It’s all too easy for these scammers to wield the power of the internet and fire off countless calls with ease. And once even just a few people fall for a scam, they’ve made enough profit to cover their trivial expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRGgSZ"&gt;Estimates put the number of robocalls in 2019 at over 50 billion. Both the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission say they’re doing their best to get a handle on the situation, and yes, there have been significant crackdowns. But real-world feedback indicates that things are getting worse — not better — and it can often feel out of control. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;The FCC has required that US carriers adopt a technology&lt;/a&gt; that will go a long way toward combatting spam calls. But we’re not quite there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rVf4pk"&gt;So if you’re as sick as I am of pulling a vibrating phone out of your pocket only to see a random, suspicious number, let’s go over the options for fighting back and restoring some sense of peace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fW6Fa"&gt;First, I’ll review some definitions since the carriers make important distinctions between these calls — even if they’re all unwelcome and annoying. Here’s how Verizon looks at things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7v0EJZ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Robocallers&lt;/strong&gt;: Automated, prerecorded phone messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gbn800"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Spammers&lt;/strong&gt;: Unwanted callers that may be calling indiscriminately to a large number of recipients; sometimes includes callers to whom you’ve given consent to contact you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p5FXjM"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fraud calls&lt;/strong&gt;: An entity likely pretending to be someone they’re not with malicious intent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3u4VE9"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option A&lt;/strong&gt;: Block individual numbers one by one&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uP22n2"&gt;This is probably a hopeless endeavor if you’re aiming to completely eradicate robocalls, but if there’s a particular number that keeps calling, it’s fairly easy to block it forever from your iPhone or Android phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ocFu4"&gt;On iOS, just go to the Phone app, then your Recents, tap the blue information icon to the right of the number you want to block, and select “Block this Caller.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeQtPq"&gt;For Android, the process isn’t much different: go to the Recents section of the Phone app, long press on the bothersome number, and choose “Block.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkuaeK"&gt;Again, this will take a lot of persistent work on your part to keep the spammers away — and it does no good against blocked or private callers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kt8cHd"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option B&lt;/strong&gt;: Trust (or pay) your carrier to protect you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RT4nE6"&gt;Most of the major mobile providers have taken steps to insert themselves as a barrier between you and these annoying callers. They’ve done this through behind-the-scenes network improvements, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;SHAKEN/STIR technology&lt;/a&gt; that has started making it possible for carriers to verify when a call is legitimate and weed out the many spoofed numbers you’re probably getting from your own local area code. In reality, those calls are probably coming from across the globe, but it’s easy for robocallers to impersonate local numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Oqx9w"&gt;All of the major US carriers offer some level of spam blocking for free as part of your wireless plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luQmc1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/features/security-apps.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call Protect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available for free for all postpaid customers. $3.99 / month for the Plus version&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NIOIuAjtiLTfYFbGY1TYSy_DcB4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21866449/Screen_Shot_2020_09_09_at_11.55.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7ApA4Y"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has a free service, Call Protect, that’s designed to block fraudulent robocalls and likely spam risks before they reach you, and you won’t have to do anything besides install the software on your phone. Call Protect won’t completely stop telemarketer calls, but it will at least display a “nuisance warning” when you receive those. The service also makes it easy to permanently block callers, and you can build a personal block list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOPiBs"&gt;There is also a Call Protect Plus service that offers caller ID, reverse number lookup, and the ability to block or send calls to voicemail by category. These added features cost $3.99 per month, but the main Call Protect service comes free as part of your plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pAJJt"&gt;Call Protect is also available to prepaid customers if they own an AT&amp;amp;T HD Voice-capable phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sJfB6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/at-t-call-protect/id1181632589"&gt;Download for iPhone&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.att.callprotect&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Download for Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgfzS9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fplans-features%2Fblock-unwanted-calls&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scam Shield and Scam Block&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available for free for all postpaid customers. $4 / month for Scam Shield Premium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qrYkOLJIb_Cz70nj7RID312AZY4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21866327/Screen_Shot_2020_09_09_at_11.17.54_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: T-Mobile&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FJ7j6w"&gt;T-Mobile’s effort to combat annoying robocalls is called &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcustomers%2Fscam-shield&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Scam Shield&lt;/a&gt;. The free-to-download Scam Shield app bundles all of T-Mobile’s various tools — Scam ID, Scam Block, and Caller ID — so you can easily configure whatever level of protection is right for you. By default, suspicious calls are always flagged. Enabling Scam Block will prevent many of them from ever ringing your phone. And T-Mobile’s Caller ID service will frequently show the information for whoever’s calling you, even if they’re not in your contacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoOUyp"&gt;You can always turn on Scam Block without the Scam Shield app. To do so, dial #662# from your T-Mobile phone. To disable it, just dial #632#. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2jABw"&gt;Scam Shield goes beyond just blocking bad calls: you can also request a secondary “proxy” number that you can use in instances where you don’t want to share your private phone number. And if you find yourself hopelessly inundated, T-Mobile will let you change your actual number once per year for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8wyqM"&gt;For an added $4 per month per line, you can upgrade to Scam Shield Premium, which lets you “send entire categories of unwanted robocalls directly to voicemail, like telemarketers; create ‘always block’ lists; and get voicemail-to-text for at-a-glance access to your voicemails.” (Customers with Magenta Max plans get Scam Shield Premium for free.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sEtWl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon Wireless: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizonwireless.com%2Fsolutions-and-services%2Fcall-filter%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;l Filter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available free for all postpaid customers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eurjIJRnBSx_H_bute7qt9rVYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10348535/Screen_Shot_2018_03_05_at_2.27.22_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NuHL4X"&gt;Verizon’s Call Filter service, free for postpaid lines, allows customers to “get alerts when a call is likely spam, report unsolicited numbers, and automatically block robocalls based on their preferred level of risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTOAfR"&gt;For no charge, you can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizonwireless.com%2Fsupport%2Fblock-numbers%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;block up to five phone numbers&lt;/a&gt; that you want to prevent from contacting you. However, blocks expire after 90 days and aren’t very helpful against robocallers with numbers that change every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6Vb1n"&gt;You can get more features, such as the ability to create a personal block list, for $2.99 a month per line. The Verizon Smart Family plan offers additional features, including parental controls and the ability to permanently block as many as ten numbers, for $4.99 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HbQb9f"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option C&lt;/strong&gt;: Protect yourself with third-party apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="K5ADcW"&gt;There are a number of services, such as Nomorobo, RoboKiller, and Hiya, that are designed to prevent robocalls from ever ringing your phone. Most of them require a monthly (or annual) subscription. At their core, these services rely on a constantly updating list of robocallers, spammers, and fraudsters and use that database to stop nuisance calls. (When I say “constantly updating,” I mean they’re identifying thousands of bad numbers every day.) A call comes in, and the service runs it against that huge list of scam numbers. If it finds a match, the incoming call gets shut down before it reaches you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbTGHUlqcfFdpZbdA4n1UKLmtVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10357151/Screen_Shot_2018_03_06_at_2.50.48_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QohVLJ"&gt;All of them allow you to maintain your own personal blacklist of numbers that might be bothering you and whitelist those you want to get through. Some work by downloading a dedicated contacts list — separate from your regular contacts — to your phone. But both iOS and Android have recently given these services more leeway in taking control over your phone app and stopping the jerks from ever reaching you. On iPhone, you’ll have to enable them in the Settings app and give them caller ID permissions before they can start working. Apple shows you how to do that &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099"&gt;step-by-step right here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVpXNO"&gt;I’d recommend looking into each of these services to see which one you like best. All of them are largely well-reviewed by customers, and all offer free trials to get started. One of these will ultimately be what you need to really fight back against the robocalls. It’s just a matter of finding your favorite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="8Q4UUQ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option D:&lt;/strong&gt; Depend on your mobile OS to protect you&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ya016nQKUOe0-yNZtWWEUQ-lrGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10357035/apps_smart_call_kv_pc.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A6tyvX"&gt;Many Android phones — including those from Samsung and Google — have built-in options for flagging suspected spam calls. If you’ve got a Google Pixel device, the entire screen will turn red when a spammer rings you, which is an easy way of knowing to ignore the call if you’re across the room from your phone. On Pixel phones, you can also tap the three dots in the upper right corner of the Phone app and then go to Settings &amp;gt; Caller ID &amp;amp; spam; you can then see spam IDs and filter spam calls. Other phones will have similar features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZ8pDN"&gt;iOS 13 introduced its own app called Silence Unknown Callers, which blocks any callers that aren’t in your contact list, haven’t been in contact with, or haven’t texted. Instead, those calls will go straight to voicemail. You can enable it by selecting Settings &amp;gt; Phone &amp;gt; Silence Unknown Callers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Sk8sol"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Nuclear Option:&lt;/strong&gt; Use Do Not Disturb to only allow calls from your contacts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Jy7xYw"&gt;On both Android and iOS, you can set each operating system’s Do Not Disturb mode to allow phone calls from only those people and businesses in your contacts list. This is a pretty drastic, sledgehammer solution to the problem of robocalls, and you’re almost certain to miss calls that you would’ve liked to have answered. But those calls will go through to voicemail, and then you can add that number to your contacts for the future. I’d still only recommend this option if you’re &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; fed up, and only if you’re very good and meticulous about keeping contacts up to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WAranM"&gt;Why do more and more spam calls look like they’re coming from a local number?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3z8si2"&gt;It’s super annoying, isn't it? It’s a trick called neighborhood spoofing, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.robokiller.com%2Fblog%2Flocal-call%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RoboKiller has a good explainer on it here&lt;/a&gt;. In short, scammers think that a number matching your area code (and maybe even the first digits of your own number) will trick your brain and make you more likely to answer. And it makes their deception feel even more nefarious. What if it’s a family emergency? Maybe it’s your doctor’s office or the pharmacy? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EyjcD"&gt;Thankfully, the robocall blocker apps have gotten better at spotting neighborhood spoofing. RoboKiller claims it’s been good at doing so since the beginning, and Nomorobo has also made detecting neighborhood spoofing a major focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cXa47e"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Don’t forget to add yourself to the Do Not Call Registry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="slsnjn"&gt;In theory, telemarketers are supposed to be honoring the &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0108-national-do-not-call-registry"&gt;National Do Not Call Registry&lt;/a&gt;. You can add yourself to the list by visiting &lt;a href="http://www.donotcall.gov"&gt;www.donotcall.gov&lt;/a&gt;. The FTC says to allow 31 days for legitimate telemarketer sales calls to stop. Once you’ve signed up, your presence on the Do Not Call Registry never lapses or expires, contrary to some recent rumors. There’s no reason to renew or re-add your number to the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hHGVI"&gt;The Do Not Call Registry only covers &lt;em&gt;sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;calls. Charities, political groups, debt collectors, and surveys are still allowed to call you once you’ve signed up. The same goes for companies that you might’ve recently done business with. (You might be able to stop this specific type by verbally telling them to stop calling you.) Unfortunately, scammers / robocallers don’t pay the DNC Registry any mind and just ignore the thing entirely. These robots answer to no one, so you’re better off circling back to one of the solutions earlier in this article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BpDOis"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Never let the robots know you’re a real human&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CTiJtD"&gt;Tempting as it might be to swear up and down at a robocaller or scammer, your best course of action is to leave them unsure as to whether they connected with an actual person. Don’t say anything. Don’t push buttons — even if the robotic voice says doing so will prevent further calls. Put no faith or trust in the robot voice. Either just let it go through to voicemail or hang up immediately if you mistakenly picked up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QCE5gr"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Complain to the FTC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wZrSyK"&gt;When all else fails and you’re consumed by despair and anger over the never-ending interruptions, you can always report callers to the FTC. They’re not going to pursue every individual complaint, but it’s certainly important to keep the commission aware of the magnitude of this problem. And as I said earlier, sometimes the FTC &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/01/ftc-announces-crackdown-two-massive-illegal-robocall-operations"&gt;does actually take down&lt;/a&gt; some of these scammers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mC8bMy"&gt;Even with all of these tools in place, it’s unlikely you’ll avoid every robocall or spammer. But it should help ease the avalanche you’re probably experiencing right now. And hopefully, when all carriers get call verification up and running, you’ll be able to start trusting your caller ID again and actually answer calls more often than not.

    <title>PUBG: New State arrives on iOS and Android on November 11th</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SOEq8q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt;, the upcoming free-to-play mobile game, will release on iOS and Android on November 11th, its &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/krafton-to-globally-launch-pubg-new-state-on-nov-11-857106352.html"&gt;publisher Krafton announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The game is set in the year 2051, and will offer a futuristic take on the multiplayer-focused PUBG formula with new features like weapon customization and in-game drones. &lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; will be available in over 200 countries and 17 languages at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0nwwi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; is a significant launch for the PUBG series, which popularized the battle royale genre after the launch of its first title in 2017. Although &lt;em&gt;New State &lt;/em&gt;isn’t its first mobile entry, following the launch of PUBG Mobile in 2018, it’s the first to have been made by the game’s original developer, PUBG Studios. Development of the original PUBG Mobile was handled primarily by Chinese tech giant Tencent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZgTyPn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Strong anti-cheat” measures have been promised&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aySGaS"&gt;PUBG Studios emphasizes that New State will come with “strong anti-cheat” measures at launch, and that the company will be actively monitoring the community to catch problems before they grow too widespread. The PUBG games have had big problems with cheaters in the past, with &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ywj3/inside-the-worlds-largest-video-game-cheating-empire"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that one cheat-making group allegedly made over $70 million selling cheats for PUBG Mobile. PUBG is far from the only game to have had these problems, however. Other companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724037/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-system-kernel-level-driver"&gt;Activision&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games"&gt;Valve &lt;/a&gt;have made news recently with their efforts to prevent cheating in their games and hardware, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBZJMh"&gt;Like previous PUBG games, &lt;em&gt;New State &lt;/em&gt;is centered around multiplayer matches. Up to 100 players enter a map, and one player or squad emerges victorious. There’ll be four maps available at launch in &lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt;, including franchise staple Erangel, and PUBG Studios is promising to regularly update it with new content over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjlDMD"&gt;Away from mobile, Krafton plans to release another PUBG-related game for PC and consoles by next year, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-18/coding-prodigy-behind-hit-game-pubg-eyes-ipo-worth-billions?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported in January&lt;/a&gt;. There are also plans for a new survival horror game set in the PUBG universe three centuries in the future, which will release in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwakPS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s95wND"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit took a peek underneath the Apple Watch Series 7’s larger display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 7 teardown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQtiqu6CTaHpkru5HduODV1SUKA=/0x245:5843x4140/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70029041/Apple_Watch_S7_21_guide_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 teardown | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/53688/three-former-apple-engineers-helped-us-tear-down-apple-watch-series-7" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dYGSz2"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;our review of the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, Dieter Bohn called it the best smartwatch while noting the new model’s changes as “smaller iterations” year-over-year than we previously expected. Even those small improvements required some reengineering. To appreciate those efforts, the folks from&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F53688%2Fthree-former-apple-engineers-helped-us-tear-down-apple-watch-series-7&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F21%2F22738876%2Fapple-watch-series-7-teardown-ifixit-diagnostic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; iFixit teamed up with former Apple engineers to investigate the new parts&lt;/a&gt; and get some insight into how the changes came to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fJoxT4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2lD2llGLJzk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JmSg7r"&gt;Ex-Apple product designer Tobias is now with &lt;a href="https://instrumental.com/about?utm_medium=Network&amp;amp;utm_source=Partner%20Referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Content&amp;amp;utm_group=ifixit&amp;amp;utm_subgroup="&gt;Instrumental&lt;/a&gt;. He points out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lD2llGLJzk"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt; that by looking at the back of the display, we can see that for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, Apple removed a ribbon cable, combining touch and display signals into one cable instead of two. That helped shrink the device’s bezels, but Tobias says in a video that he’s “fairly certain” the complexity of that change and how it rippled through the supply chain is the reason why this Watch was slightly delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYGtzD"&gt;A more surprising moment is when they found out that the Apple Watch Series 6 battery fits in, and works with, the newer model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDSNXT"&gt;Of course, another element of the teardown is what’s not inside the new Apple Watch — an old diagnostic port. Since the earliest versions, it had been hiding inside the watch’s wristband groove, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690061/apple-watch-series-7-wireless-dock-data-transfer-port-free"&gt;now Apple has replaced it with wireless technology&lt;/a&gt;. Is this a hint at an iPhone without ports? We can’t tell yet, but the teardown will show you how everything came together to make the device less susceptible to cracking, better at resisting dust and water, and just that tiny bit better than the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;
