    <title>WWDC 2021: the latest news from Apple’s annual developer conference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CpiqaJWWcv1rMhdZW6jMew37egc=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417646/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What’s new in the Apple ecosystem?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="K28Qfi"&gt;Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, or WWDC, will run from June 7th through the 11th this year, with the main keynote set for June 7th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. Like last year, &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22085002"&gt;the event will be virtual&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s probably safe to expect another immaculately produced keynote video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFthrB"&gt;Apple is likely to announce updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It’ll be interesting to see what Apple does with the iPad and Mac especially; the iPad Pro is now powered by the same M1 chips as Apple’s best laptops, but its OS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396449/apple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021"&gt;arguably holds it back&lt;/a&gt;.  We’re also still waiting on the pro-focused MacBooks and iMacs. While the current versions are fast, they lack the ports and RAM capacity that professionals are looking for, so we’ll be on the lookout for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;rumored MacBook Pro refresh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QO3Ahi"&gt;We’ll be covering everything that happens on the day, and any news that comes out after, which you can catch up on here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First official images of Honor 50 look weirdly like Huawei’s P50</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/plOQ3XD0AxSEPiHDZ5RvXNmfK1A=/1x0:1231x820/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415268/E3RP8UBVgAAehBM.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1TvJra"&gt;Honor has released a couple of official images for its upcoming 50 series smartphone via its &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3206603957/Kj2gp1BMw?type=comment#_rnd1623057835464"&gt;Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1401833284183621637"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The images focus on the rear of the phone, showing an eye-catching pair of circular camera bumps. The Honor 50 series is currently due to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1399599535077220356"&gt;announced on June 16th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7ODi7"&gt;Amidst a sea of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/12/18663281/google-pixel-4-apple-iphone-11-ugly-square-phone-cameras-modules"&gt;square and rectangular camera bumps&lt;/a&gt;, the dual circle design is an interesting look for Honor’s next flagship. It’s also a style that Honor’s former parent company Huawei is planning to use for &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; next flagship, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464776/huawei-p50-phone-camera-periscope-telephoto-leica-harmonyos"&gt;the similarly-named P50&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible that the two companies finalized their designs before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;Huawei sold off Honor late last year&lt;/a&gt;, but it’ll be strange to see such similar looking devices released from two distinct manufacturers within such close proximity to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4ZZGU2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Honor50series?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Honor50series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;100W Super Fast Charge&lt;br&gt;Hypercurved screen.                                                  Launching in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shanghai?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;, June 16th! &lt;a href="https://t.co/9MAzE0RsDb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9MAzE0RsDb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bhavya (Haya) (@bhavis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1401833284183621637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NTJNMl"&gt;From the images it appears as though Honor’s next handset will have four rear cameras in total. The upper camera circle has one large lens, and it’s joined by three more on the lower bump. In contrast, Huawei’s P50 appears to have three lenses on the upper circle, and a single camera paired with a flash on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFDdLE"&gt;Beyond its design, Honor’s next flagship will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G processor, will feature 100W fast charging, and will also come with a “hypercurved screen.” It may also mark the return of Google’s apps and services to Honor’s devices (including the Google Play Store) if a &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-50-google-apps/"&gt;now-deleted tweet from the company’s German Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. Honor was prevented from including Google’s software because of sanctions placed on its former parent company Huawei, but these are believed to not apply since it became independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y406pk"&gt;A spokesperson from Honor previously declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; as to whether or not Google’s software would be available on the upcoming 50 series. But with an official launch just round the corner, we won’t have long to wait to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rshhL7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile employee files suit after HR asked invasive questions about her OnlyFans account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-saP0D0IsKjlMdLfQxIO6gMz4U8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69407426/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hvfLAr"&gt;A sales rep at a T-Mobile store in Fort Worth, Texas has filed a gender discrimination suit against the company after a member of the HR team inappropriately questioned her about having an OnlyFans account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GycML4"&gt;Caitlyn Stevens had been working at T-Mobile for nearly seven years when a male colleague became angry with her about how she was handling a customer interaction, the complaint says. He approached her “in a physically aggressive manager,” forcing a coworker to step in and stop the man from hitting her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcr5mF"&gt;Stevens reported the incident to the store manager. Rather than disciplining the male colleague who’d allegedly tried to hurt her, the manager relocated Stevens to a different location, according to the complaint. The location got less foot traffic, resulting in fewer sales for employees, Stevens says. “I did not feel like it was fair that I went to a slower location based on what had just happened,” she explains in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kq6rWZ"&gt;When Stevens submitted a complaint to HR, a man on the team called her and began asking questions about her personal life, including “whether she had a ‘sugar daddy’ and whether she had an OnlyFans account.” Stevens was shocked. “I immediately started crying,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I told him I did not feel comfortable and he still continued to ask the questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VLOzl"&gt;According to Stevens, the male HR rep said “we’ve heard that you have an OnlyFans account, is that true?” Then he added, “We’ve heard that people have seen nude pictures of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oRYan"&gt;Stevens says the questions felt violating. “I felt sexually harassed, I felt uncomfortable,” she says. “The nature of the questions, when I’m literally reporting a physical assault, is not okay.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvPhAN"&gt;Stevens’ attorney, Vincent White, a partner at White, Hilferty and Albanese, says the incident shows T-Mobile sided with Stevens’ male colleague over her. “T-Mobile chose to stand with a man who had a history of violence in the workplace over a woman who was a high performer at the company for seven years,” he said in a statement. “Caitlyn Stevens’ personal life had nothing to do with store operations, while threatening coworkers with violence hinders the productivity and well-being of the entire workplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3DF1D"&gt;This isn’t the first time that a woman has been shamed or retaliated against for having an OnlyFans account. In April 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/mechanic-fired-onlyfans-account-indiana"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that a mechanic in Indiana was fired from her job after her bosses found out she was making amateur porn on OnlyFans outside of work. In December 2020, the &lt;em&gt;New York Post &lt;/em&gt;tried to “out” an EMT who was making ends meet through OnlyFans (whatever the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; was trying to do here backfired — the publication was widely criticized for “doxxing someone simply for trying to earn a living” &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/onlyfans-medic-lauren-kwei-new-york-post-interview-1104943/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The incidents point to how far some companies will try to go to control the lives of their workers, while also refusing to pay people enough to allow them to maintain a single stream of income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5IINI"&gt;Stevens turned down a settlement in order to speak out about what happened. “I think she chose a much harder path here, but she realizes that this is indicative of a broader trend that many women are facing and feels strongly about changing the culture by telling her story,” says Ariella Steinhorn, founder of Lioness Strategies, a communications firm assisting in Stevens’ case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fErus"&gt;Stevens has taken a medical leave of absence due to the stress of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvZkmd"&gt;T-Mobile did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei teases its upcoming P50 flagship phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Huawei P50" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wwJ9hdrUkEV_R4Nm77RuwLEJxBs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377115/huaweip50.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behold, the P50’s mammoth-sized camera array&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lXhnzs"&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22227756"&gt;Huawei’s HarmonyOS&lt;/a&gt; livestream, the company provided a first look at its upcoming P50 series phone. Few specs were given, and it didn’t talk pricing or tease a release date, but the sizzle reel did reveal a close-up look at its interesting camera array. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPYJGs"&gt;Four camera lenses are visible, along with two flashes. It’s tough to say exactly what we’ll be getting with this phone in terms of megapixel count and sensor size; the photo below confirms that Huawei is working alongside Leica with its optics. We’ll have to wait to see if Huawei improved on its periscope telephoto lenses that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21444946/huawei-p40-pro-plus-vs-iphone-pixel-10x-zoom-camera"&gt;my colleague Sam Byford saw great results with on the P40 Pro Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Huawei P50" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z2YxM8rkri-ytMpf8ftE2x6ax28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554597/huaweip50lens.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The teaser hinted at Huawei’s continued camera partnership with Leica.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eDsTGF"&gt;The company claims it will “lift mobile photography to a new level.” Given that the size of the camera bump seems to have increased compared to the P40 Pro Plus (which we deemed “the smartphone zoom king”) it seems reasonable that Huawei might have crammed some even larger sensors and lenses in the P50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmz3VF"&gt;You can see the tease time-stamped in the YouTube video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="04bL1K"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y2101ics8jc?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=7039&amp;amp;start=7039" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9UadeN"&gt;As for the rest of the phone, all we have to go on so far is what Huawei executive Richard Yu said during the livestream: that it will have a “lightweight design” and an “iconic” design language. The P50 will likely ship with Huawei’s new HarmonyOS operating system built in, but it didn’t confirm it in video (or even show the display powered on, for that matter). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvZbXc"&gt;As for when it might release, the company said that it is “trying to figure out how to make this great product available to you.” That reads to me as Huawei — like all tech companies right now — dealing with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363232/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-pandemic-consoles-cpus-graphics-cards-cars"&gt;impacts of a global semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;US sanctions placed on the company have slowed its production of in-house parts&lt;/a&gt;, which might also be causing supply strains around its Kirin processors. To that end, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463666/huawei-matepad-pro-harmonyos-tablet-features-specs"&gt;the MatePad Pro tablet&lt;/a&gt; it announced today has a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor instead of one of Huawei’s own processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rd3ZaI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Huawei’s Watch 3 is its first HarmonyOS watch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463529/huawei-watch-3-pro-harmonyos-smartwatch-features-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Huawei announces HarmonyOS update for its smartphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bpl6v5xN7q1wNLOHD-XmJNtn_gM=/90x0:1038x632/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377091/u970l2SYwX.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="96iVZo"&gt;Huawei has announced that its HarmonyOS operating system is coming to its smartphones via a forthcoming update. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/y2101ics8jc?t=6792"&gt;Huawei’s consumer business CEO Richard Yu says&lt;/a&gt; the company is updating around 100 of its devices globally to the new operating system, which also includes tablets like the MatePad Pro. In theory, it’s a big change from its previous phones, which have run the open-source version of Android with Huawei’s own services replacing the Google software it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension"&gt;been unable to include&lt;/a&gt; on new devices as a result of US sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YFibo"&gt;HarmonyOS will initially come to recent flagships like the Mate 40, P40, and Mate 30 series, before releasing on more devices later in the year. Older phones like the Mate 9, Mate 10, P20, and P10 will receive the update in the first half of next year, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZLvmRm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The update is coming to recent flagships as well as older models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7h0hNo"&gt;The company advertises that HarmonyOS allows its phones to offer more seamless connectivity across different devices, including easier pairing with compatible headphones and speakers via a drag-and-drop interface. There’s also improved support for homescreen widgets, Huawei says, which have a similar look to what we saw with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;iOS 14 last year&lt;/a&gt;. The operating system is also said to be better at returning to previously opened apps without losing your place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXFO41"&gt;The Chinese tech giant first announced HarmonyOS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798251/huawei-harmonyos-hongmengos-smartphones-internet-of-things-operating-system-android"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and the first device announced with the operating system was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/10/20798260/huawei-honor-smart-tv-vision-pro-harmonyos-china"&gt;Vision TV&lt;/a&gt; from its then-sub brand Honor (it later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;sold off the brand&lt;/a&gt; due to the pressures created by ongoing US sanctions). However, at last year’s Huawei developer conference, its consumer business CEO Richard Yu hinted that the operating system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430275/huawei-harmonyos-smartphones-release-date"&gt;could appear on smartphones in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlzd7a"&gt;Despite being marketed as a brand-new operating system, reports have suggested that HarmonyOS shares a lot of code with the open-source version of Android that it’s replacing. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;did a deep dive into HarmonyOS&lt;/a&gt;, and reported that it “is essentially an Android fork.” Huawei did not respond to our requests for comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4LaOS1"&gt;As well as phones, Huawei has also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22227707"&gt;new MatePad tablets running HarmonyOS&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the new HarmonyOS-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22227570"&gt;Huawei Watch 3 smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QVGFEg"&gt;Discovery is merging with WarnerMedia, and it’s &lt;a href="https://ir.corporate.discovery.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2021/Discovery-Inc.-Announces-Warner-Bros.-Discovery-As-New-Name-For-Proposed-Leading-Global-Entertainment-Company/default.aspx"&gt;now announced&lt;/a&gt; a new name for the combined company: Warner Bros. Discovery. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/warner-bros-discovery-will-be-name-of-media-colossus-formed-in-merger-11622567102"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the name was first revealed during a staff meeting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPlaCJ"&gt;The merger was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;announced last month&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;amp;T said it would spin off WarnerMedia — the entertainment giant containing Warner Bros., HBO, DC Comics, and CNN, among many others — and that Discovery would take over the new company. But they didn’t have a new name prepared on the day the deal was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VT6VKq"&gt;Discovery CEO David Zaslav will be in charge of the merged group. WarnerMedia is by far the bigger company, though, with around three times the 2020 revenue and a roster of iconic characters and properties. Discovery brings to the table a huge archive of reality TV shows and a growing news and sports business in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9w3TS"&gt;“We believe it will be the best and most exciting place in the world to tell big, important and impactful stories across any genre – and across any platform: film, television and streaming,” Zaslav said in a statement today. The combined company is borrowing a line from the Warner Bros. classic &lt;em&gt;The Maltese Falcon &lt;/em&gt;for its slogan, “The stuff that dreams are made of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8Nb5e"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery expect the merger to wrap up in mid-2022, assuming it clears regulatory hurdles. AT&amp;amp;T shareholders will own 71 percent of the new company, so it’s really more like WarnerMedia is being freed from AT&amp;amp;T and picking up Discovery along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dliZyY"&gt;The hope is that the combined entertainment giant can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444031/warnermedia-discovery-merger-hbo-max-streaming-giant"&gt;become an even bigger player in streaming&lt;/a&gt; than the two are independently today. WarnerMedia runs HBO Max, which has been fairly successful so far, though it remains smaller than Netflix and Disney Plus. Discovery only recently launched Discovery Plus. Zaslav has said the combined company will put $20 billion per year toward new content, a number rivaling Netflix and exceeding Disney Plus, and that he hopes to eventually reach 400 million homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKDvCp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction June 1st, 3:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The deal is expected to close in mid-2022, not in mid-2020 as this article initially misstated, which would require a time machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s latest 11th Gen processor brings 5.0GHz speeds to thin and light laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1yJS7TmWuo1Cc0MXZtu2OI9JTE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69364881/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7WOe68"&gt;Intel made a splash earlier in May with the launch of its first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;11th Gen Tiger Lake H-series&lt;/a&gt; processors for more powerful laptops, but at Computex 2021, the company is also announcing a pair of new U-series chips — one of which marks the first 5.0GHz clock speed for the company’s U-series lineup of lower voltage chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0df8VH"&gt;Specifically, Intel is announcing the Core i7-1195G7 — its new top of the line chip in the U-series range — and the Core i5-1155G7, which takes the crown of Intel’s most powerful Core i5-level chip, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WnkU6O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel announces its new 11th Gen Tiger Lake CPUs, available on laptops this fall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5pSqBq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"&gt;Like the original 11th Gen U-series chips&lt;/a&gt;, the new chips operate in the 12W to 28W range. Both new chips are four core / eight thread configurations, and feature Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics (the Core i7-1195G7 comes with 96 EUs, while the Core i5-1155G7 has 80 EUs.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmgxVm"&gt;The Core i7-1195G7 features a base clock speed of 2.9GHz, but cranks up to a 5.0GHz maximum single core speed using Intel’s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology. The Core i5-1155G7, on the other hand, has a base clock speed of 2.5GHz and a boosted speed of 4.5GHz. Getting to 5GHz out of the box is a fairly recent development for laptop CPUs, period: Intel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512501/intel-9th-gen-laptop-desktop-processors-5ghz-update-specs-speed-features"&gt;first laptop processor to cross the 5GHz mark&lt;/a&gt; arrived in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykakbu"&gt;Along with the new processors, Intel has also announced its latest 5G modem solution for laptops — a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18250061/intel-qualcomm-m-2-5g-modules-computer-pc-laptop"&gt;M.2 card&lt;/a&gt; that device makers will be able to incorporate into their designs, called the Intel 5G Solution 5000. (While Intel famously sold off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition"&gt;smartphone 5G division to Apple&lt;/a&gt;, Intel has continued its efforts in other areas of the next-generation connectivity standard.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2NmZP"&gt;The new modem is a collaboration between Intel, Mediatek (which is handling the modem firmware) and Fibocom (which is actually manufacturing the modules), and will offer sub-6GHz 5G support and integrated eSIM technology. Intel says that Acer, Asus, and HP will all be offering laptops combing Intel’s Tiger Lake chips and new 5G Solution 5000 cards later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE Axon 30 Ultra review: the right stuff for the right price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Specs for less&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="P1dvF9"&gt;The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra is a high-end device that checks all the right hardware boxes. Snapdragon 888 processor? Check. Fast refresh rate screen? Check. A metric ton of rear-facing cameras? Check, check, check, and check. It’s also priced well, starting at $749 while many of its competitors start around the $1,000 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxpM46"&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra delivers on many fronts, like its high-quality screen and flagship-level performance. For some, that will be enough. However, it falls short in more subtle ways that you won’t see on a spec sheet. Its novel camera array is let down by uneven, heavy-handed processing. There’s also a stray bug here and there, which can range from harmless (a 5G on / off toggle appears twice in a quick settings menu) to more annoying (the camera shutter noise going off even in silent mode). ZTE may iron out these bugs in future updates, or they won’t, and you’ll be the obnoxious parent with the noisy smartphone camera during your child’s dance recital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wJJMY4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Axon 30 Ultra offers top-notch performance with a large, lovely screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D0XZjf"&gt;And even though all of the key hardware is there, a few flagship-y features have been omitted to hit the Axon 30 Ultra’s more aggressive price point. There’s no IP rating for water resistance and no wireless charging. The phone doesn’t work on Verizon either, just on T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T, and 5G service on T-Mobile is limited to one band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2drbo"&gt;If those factors aren’t dealbreakers and you’re comfortable working around the occasional quirk, then the Axon 30 Ultra offers top-notch performance with a large, lovely screen at a lower price than the competition. We don’t see too many of those high-performance / lower cost premium phones in the US to challenge the heavyweights of the Android world, and it’s nice to have an alternative. But it does lack some of the polish and a few features that distinguish the more expensive competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RISD3i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10523685"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9CB5vm7q1v7wttz73DMdCW-o9i8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541699/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 30 Ultra’s screen is curved on the edges for a more immersive feel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NBY3pw"&gt;ZTE Axon 30 Ultra screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="F2OVYN"&gt;At 6.7 inches, the Axon 30 Ultra’s screen is about as big as they come these days. It’s a 1080p OLED with a refresh rate up to 144Hz. You can set it manually to 60, 90, 120, or 144Hz, or let it switch automatically between those rates based on the content you’re viewing. That 144Hz rate is a little faster than the 120Hz rate you’ll find on most high-end devices, but I’m not sure I could tell the difference between them if I didn’t know which was which. The bottom line is that every swipe, scroll, and animation looks incredibly smooth on the 30 Ultra’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTCogS"&gt;Generally speaking, it’s just a really nice screen. Contrast is rich, the bezels are slim, and the panel curves over the sides of the phone; marketers love to call a screen like this “immersive,” but that actually feels like a fair descriptor. It’s a little tough to see outside in bright light, but it’s still usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMM5vd"&gt;That big screen makes the Axon 30 Ultra a big device. It’s comfortable enough to hold, and the curved screen and back panel help, but I definitely can’t reach my thumb clear across the screen while using it one-handed. There’s Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back panels and the frame is aluminum, giving the whole phone a solid, premium feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OBllqlbe-u4OEX7RujUiRbvUw1k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541698/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra offers Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l74KmZ"&gt;Phone performance also meets the “premium” bar, thanks to that Snapdragon 888 processor. It feels very snappy jumping between apps, pinching and zooming around Google Maps, and scrolling through Twitter. I’m also happy to report that the in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is quick and responsive, too — it gave me a little thrill with every unlock and password manager authentication. It’s a feature that goes the extra distance to making this feel like a highly responsive, premium device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52B1Z7"&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra’s 4,600mAh battery is big enough and consistently got me through a day of moderate use. However, I was conservative with some battery-draining settings like screen refresh rate, and all of my use was on Wi-Fi, so I expect you could fully drain the battery over the course of a day if you really went for it. Wireless charging is, as mentioned earlier, not an option here, but the phone supports 65W wired charging with the included charging brick, and it is plenty fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPTv60"&gt;Android 11 comes preloaded on the Axon 30 Ultra, and ZTE says an Android 12 update will come at the end of the year or in early 2022. The company doesn’t give a firm timeline for security updates but says it generally provides them for around three years. Not the worst support policy by far, but not among the very best. ZTE’s Android interface is called MyOS, and it’s a straightforward affair that doesn’t try to get too fancy. There are a truly overwhelming number of shortcuts in the fully expanded quick settings menu accessed by swiping from the top of the screen, but you can rearrange and whittle them down to your heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZMSnp4xWK8VPPsKzNKLSuU3NKws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541697/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameras galore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xNBIzj"&gt;ZTE Axon 30 Ultra cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qjDNQk"&gt;Rather than one high-resolution main camera complemented by several lower-resolution sensors, ZTE has chosen to put three 64-megapixel sensors in the Axon 30 Ultra’s rear camera array. You’ll find a standard wide-angle main camera with optical stabilization, a 35mm-equivalent wide-angle for portraits, and an ultrawide. There’s also an 8-megapixel 5x telephoto camera with optical stabilization. It’s a lot of cameras, and none of them are throwaways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYlN8t"&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra’s cameras are impressive, but they’re also a little frustrating. First, the good: these three 64-megapixel cameras all capture a lot of detail in good light, which I’d expect from the main camera, but that isn’t always the case with ultrawides since they tend to have lower resolution chips. The telephoto module offers 5x true optical zoom — results aren’t great indoors or in dim light, but with plenty of available light, it’s much better than the digital zoom alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owRAuH"&gt;I also really like the portrait lens, which is wider than the telephoto options most other smartphone cameras use. This is a personal preference; I like getting more of the scene in portrait photos, you may not. There’s no option to digitally zoom in while using portrait mode if you don’t like the wide-angle look, and portrait mode photos (with artificially blurred backgrounds) can only be taken with the dedicated portrait lens or the selfie camera. Something to consider if wide portraits are really not your thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LW4sU9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10523726"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e8ARRZ"&gt;Now the bad: image processing (particularly color and saturation) is inconsistent between cameras, and two photos from the same camera can vary noticeably with slight shifts in composition or subject positioning. Images from the main camera often look oversaturated. Most of the time it’s subtle enough not to bother me much, but then I’ll take a picture of my orange cat and he’ll look like a Cheeto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bm86wQ"&gt;Portrait mode photos suffer some misses, too: subject separation from blurred backgrounds can look a little clumsy, and the lack of OIS in the portrait camera means you’re more likely to see slight blur in dimmer conditions, even without much camera movement. The wider focal length also means you’ll need to crank up the blur if you want to obscure a distracting background, which makes the subject cut-out problems more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sDGqA5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;when the Axon 30 Ultra does get things right, images look really good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zqwvia"&gt;Maybe these shortcomings are more frustrating because when the Axon 30 Ultra does get things right, images look really good. Exposure is well balanced, all four cameras are genuinely useful, and each of them offers an impressive level of detail retention. I’d entertain leaving my dedicated camera at home more often with this combination of focal lengths and capabilities, but image processing is too much of a wild card for me to feel comfortable with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCWFDO"&gt;One of the Axon 30 Ultra’s most annoying bugs lives in the camera app, too: the camera shutter sound is permanently stuck on, even with every volume control set to silent. There’s no way to turn it off in the camera settings menu or the main settings menu. I hate this. Maybe some people could live with it. Maybe you can root your phone and eliminate the problem yourself. Maybe ZTE will fix the issue soon. All I know is that I cannot live a shutter-sound-on lifestyle and it’s the kind of thing I might return a phone over, no matter how good the pictures look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mH6bRMCt-aI9NDyBwx9TNIZnS1I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541700/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra is missing a few flagship-y features like wireless charging, but it doesn’t skimp on build quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KuqBgm"&gt;The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra is exactly what it appears to be: a lower cost alternative to the big Android flagships with top-tier performance and a great screen. I wouldn’t recommend it to just anyone, and you need to be comfortable either living with a couple of quirks or navigating a way around them. You don’t quite get the same level of polish or reassurance that you would from a Samsung, OnePlus, or Google device, but in return you get excellent performance for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9oJVY"&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra has a healthy price advantage over the other big-screen-big-performance competition like the $1,069 OnePlus 9 Pro and the $999 Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus. If you’re willing to concede some screen real estate, then its advantage narrows compared to the OnePlus 9 ($729) and standard Galaxy S21 ($800). With either of those options, you’ll get the same excellent performance and a few other benefits, like wireless charging and more sophisticated image processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WqvMNv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra has a healthy price advantage over the other big-screen-big-performance competition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QrI7E8"&gt;Of course, it’s an important caveat that the Axon 30 Ultra doesn’t work on Verizon. That will rule out a significant number of prospective customers in the US. And I wish the cameras lived up to their hardware potential more often. If that’s not much of a concern, you’re not a Verizon customer, and your priorities are set on a big screen and snappy day-to-day performance, then you have a great option in the 30 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="m4pRSn"&gt;All that said, I can’t see a reason not to buy the Axon 30 Ultra if none of the above concerns you. You’ll get excellent performance, a massive screen with a silky smooth fast refresh rate, and great camera hardware — and you can rub it in your friends’ faces when you pay several hundred dollars less for your phone than they did.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phones to buy if you’re a phone enthusiast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S29L-Q-yzH5YBo5UIFHUQriIaeU=/472x0:5587x3410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69355961/DSCF5519.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mistakes were made&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Come make bad decisions with us&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mWHafX"&gt;There are plenty of buying guides for figuring out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;best phone to buy&lt;/a&gt; at a given time, across a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;wide variety of prices&lt;/a&gt;. We have two of them, in fact. But if you’re a dyed-in-the-wool phone enthusiast, you don’t need a guide that’s going to give you the best rational recommendation. You need something that’s going to help you scratch your new gadget itch in the most satisfying way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwnkhO"&gt;I’m here for you because, well, I’m one of you. This is the internet’s premiere buying guide for phone enthusiasts. We’re not going to focus on practical, rational choices, nor are we going to concern ourselves with budgets. These are the dream phones, the ones you buy not as a utilitarian tool, but for the fun of playing with a new piece of tech that you’ll probably sell or trade in for a loss in six months. I’m not even going to single out a specific model that you should buy, because you’re likely buying a new phone every year (or maybe more!) anyway. This is all about throwing caution to the wind, diving deep into a hobby, and buying something you don’t need but absolutely want. Budgets be damned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HQWhbW"&gt;The best folding phone because you know you need one in your collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cyP7p8"&gt;Folding phones are the future, right? You can’t call yourself a Real Phone Enthusiast without one in your life. Hands down, the best folding phone you can buy right now is Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G. It’s got everything you might want from a modern smartphone, but it also opens up into a tablet-sized screen that lets you put more than one app side-by-side or look at a giant version of Google Maps. It’s easy to justify because you can tell yourself that you will get SO MUCH WORK done on it, right after you finish watching that YouTube video. Promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8bHVj"&gt;The Fold 2 costs more than most laptops, you have to baby it, and there’s a really good chance the screen will crack or break on you even if you are careful, but that’s just the price you have to pay to be on the bleeding edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jGK8Wn"&gt;The best iPhone for when you’re double-fisting an Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="odv92P"&gt;Look, I know that you know that everyone in the world has an iPhone and it’s the farthest thing from an “interesting” phone. But at the same time, it’s hard to ignore what Apple’s doing, and really, iMessage and the Apple Watch are pretty great. Lots of people carry an iPhone alongside an Android phone, and you could be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgHcF9"&gt;The best iPhone for doing this is the iPhone 12 Mini. It does everything its bigger siblings can do, but it can easily fit in a secondary pocket and isn’t a burden to carry around. The battery life is kinda lousy, but who cares, that’s why you have a second phone on you anyway, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="QAq06D"&gt;The best phone for seeing what this “gaming phone” trend is all about&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DYsaub"&gt;Gaming phones are so hot right now (unless they’ve got a great cooling system) — it seems like a new model is released every three months. You can’t call yourself a true phone enthusiast without being up on this trend, and the best one to dip your toes into it with is the Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUdoj9"&gt;The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate has a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of features that can make any mobile accomplisher swoon. A massive battery. A ridiculously high refresh screen. An OLED screen on the back you can customize to show whatever you want. A bunch of accessories to make gaming better. 18GB of RAM! How could you not buy this phone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="UxUeAC"&gt;The best phone for pretending you’re going to use a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="62OqLx"&gt;Writing on a phone screen with a pen is so cool! It &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; futuristic and is just so natural. At least, it is for the first week until you forget about it and it never leaves the little garage built into the side of the phone again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYMIss"&gt;If you’ve been telling yourself that little “I’m gonna be a stylus person” lie, you need a phone that supports one and it’s hard to see buying anything other than Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20. It’s got a low latency S Pen, a bunch of software features that can utilize the stylus, and all of the other bells and whistles of a modern smartphone, which means it works quite well long after you’ve forgotten about the stylus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hZjFO7"&gt;The best phone for messing around with the Android 12 beta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oBnkTF"&gt;Okay, I said I wasn’t going to recommend anything rational in this guide, but this is perhaps the recommendation that makes the most sense: if you want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442051/android-12-beta-download-google-io-2021"&gt;mess around with the Android 12 beta&lt;/a&gt; but don’t want to install it on your main phone, you should just buy a Google Pixel 4A. It’s only $350 (that’s just $20 more than it costs to fix a broken screen on an iPhone 12 Pro Max) and can work with Google’s latest and greatest software even before it’s released to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QeuvA"&gt;You know the Android betas are going to be messy — battery life is going to be bad, there will be lots of bugs, certain apps might not work correctly — so you don’t want to put it on a device you actually need to rely on. Once the beta period is over, the Pixel 4A is a great device for experimenting with the aftermarket ROM world. Get a Pixel 4A and flash those ROMs to your heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SrmHOI"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Microsoft Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eiZDop"&gt;The best phone for making people go “Whoa, is that a phone?”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zcDQoO"&gt;As a phone enthusiast, you already know this harsh truth: the Microsoft Surface Duo is not a good phone. It has an old processor. The camera is worse than any iPhone of the past five years. The battery life is decidedly Not Great. It gets hot doing simple tasks. There are SO MANY software bugs. It’s got a generation-old version of Android. It doesn’t even support wireless charging or NFC payments! Oh yeah, and there’s that questionable build quality to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J93WFK"&gt;But there’s something undeniably cool about the Surface Duo, like it’s a device from the future coming here to bless us in the early 21st century. It’s so thin, it has two screens, the hinge is incredibly neat. Open it up in public and you’re sure to get someone to ask “wow, is that a phone?” which we all know is the ultimate goal here. You can then show them all of its cool features, right after it’s done rebooting itself for the fifth time that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qGH04z"&gt;The best phone for telling yourself that you don’t need an actual camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rwPQXC"&gt;For years now we’ve been told that phone cameras are so good that you don’t need an actual camera. The iPhone 12 Pro Max might be the best example of that yet. It’s got a bigger sensor! It’s got three focal lengths! It can shoot video in Dolby Vision HDR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIhX55"&gt;At the end of the day, it’s still a phone camera and can’t really hold a candle to the image quality or creative control you get with a larger mirrorless camera. But hey, it’s fun to live in that lie and you can totally see the difference between the 12 Pro Max images and other phones. When you blow them up on a big screen. And zoom in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KwtDVn"&gt;The best phone for saying “you can’t get this in the US”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oAaPTd"&gt;Perhaps the ultimate phone flex is pulling a phone out of your pocket that nobody else is going to have. If you’re in the US, the Oppo Find X3 Pro is that phone. It’s got features you can’t get on any American phone and a design you won’t see everywhere, like a microscope camera and softly rounded camera bump. Sure, it won’t really work great on the cellular networks here, importing it is an expensive hassle, and you won’t have any warranty whatsoever. But just think of the envy on your friends’ faces when you tell them they can’t have this phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fsQZrc"&gt;The best phone for when you realize that Pixel phones aren’t great, but you don’t want a Samsung either&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7LwpXZ"&gt;Google’s Pixel phones have such great software and then… mediocre everything else. Samsung phones have incredible hardware but are laden with heavy software and actual ads inside of the stock apps. The OnePlus 9 Pro splits that difference — it has software that’s similar to Google’s on hardware that’s virtually a Samsung with a different logo on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMwn3Y"&gt;The 9 Pro is just what the phone enthusiast ordered: a high-end, bells-and-whistles device with All Of The Specs but none of the cruft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="yVVHIu"&gt;The best weekend phone for when you’re “disconnecting”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4j7b9k"&gt;Here comes the weekend, with all of its promises of relaxation and enjoyment. You don’t need a phone that’s going to make you more productive, you need something that’s going to slip into your pocket and won’t distract you with a colorful display unless you absolutely need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhFwR6"&gt;The Z Flip 5G is this phone. You can flip it closed to ignore it and then pop it open and have a full smartphone inside, complete with every feature you get on non-flippy phones. You’re making a compromise without &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; making a compromise, because we all know that you had no intention of actually disconnecting for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Check if your Verizon or AT&amp;T phone will keep working after the networks’ 3G shutdowns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cell tower (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TDf8X3YimwrbxzTcsIyKJga5Z18=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69353302/cell-tower-stock_1020.1419980290.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;US wireless carriers plan to shutter their old 3G networks next year.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="93mvKT"&gt;Major US wireless carriers are gearing up to shut down their old 3G networks — a process that has been fraught with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215453/verizon-3g-shutdown-paused-delay-network-old-phones"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;miscommunication&lt;/a&gt; as companies alert customers with older phones that it’s time to upgrade. To that end, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have published guides to which devices will stop working after their 3G networks go offline next year. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qP1RJt"&gt;Verizon has delayed its CDMA 3G network shutdown several times but is now firmly committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358628/verizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022"&gt;shutting the network down by December 31st, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. All 3G basic phones and smartphones will lose service, but some 4G devices will be impacted as well — namely, those that don’t support VoLTE (Voice over LTE). A few connected devices are affected, too; take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/knowledge-base-218813/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s full guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7DbZk"&gt;Taking the opposite approach, AT&amp;amp;T has published a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/idpassets/images/support/wireless/Devices-Working-on-ATT-Network.pdf?source=ECAuAT10600aff12A&amp;amp;wtExtndSource=100122946&amp;amp;CI=CJ_AFFILIATE&amp;amp;RI=CJ1&amp;amp;RD=37922269&amp;amp;tfn=aff&amp;amp;cjevent=38f3c68bbf2911eb81ee1d8c0a1c0e0c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;complete list&lt;/a&gt; (spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/will-my-phone-work-on-att-after-3g-shutdown/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) of exactly which phones, tablets, and smartwatches &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; keep working after its 3G shutdown on February 22nd, 2022. (Separately, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/security/atandts-3g-shutdown-plans-are-harmful-even-deadly-warns-alarm-industry/d/d-id/769737"&gt;concern in the alarm industry&lt;/a&gt;: many home security devices use AT&amp;amp;T’s 3G and it’s possible that users won’t be able to replace them in time.) In any case, AT&amp;amp;T makes it easy to understand which mobile devices will keep functioning after the network shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnH2r5"&gt;T-Mobile’s 3G shutdown is a bit more complicated.
