    <title>Xiaomi’s new concept phone has a waterfall display on all four edges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lgGTlMqtQwPXYx4fLZv56jPtFZo=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68773384/EtcXdw7VoAEVfih.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jK59Er"&gt;Xiaomi has &lt;a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/02/05/xiaomi-debuts-its-first-quad-curved-waterfall-display-concept-smartphone/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its latest phone concept: a “quad-curved waterfall display.” This means that the unnamed phone’s screen not only has deep 88-degree “waterfall” curves on the left and right sides, but on the top and bottom as well, leaving no room for ports or buttons. Xiaomi says this is intended to “extend the limits of the display to infinity” and enable “a true, port-free unibody design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8of3rK"&gt;The obvious question is how that could possibly work at the screen’s corners, and based on the promotional imagery it looks like Xiaomi is simply leaving them blank with small, rounded cutouts. Not quite infinity, then, but still a neat trick — although for people who already don’t like the comparatively modest curved displays on phones like the Galaxy S21 Ultra, this sounds like their nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CbxKUBgz5BU8XR-wBqxC5EDGuI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22283412/mi.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bsJheq"&gt;Announcing a concept device entirely through renders doesn’t quite have the impact of showing it off in person, as was common pre-COVID. A Xiaomi representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this phone does actually exist and that they’ve used it themselves, for what that’s worth. The display is the result of “countless breakthroughs in glass bending and laminating technology,” according to Xiaomi, and “represents the sum of 46 groundbreaking patents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IO23F"&gt;This concept phone follows last week’s announcement of seemingly outlandish Xiaomi tech, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;“Mi Air Charge” truly wireless charging system&lt;/a&gt;. And back in 2019, Xiaomi revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/24/20881378/xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-announced-wrap-around-screen"&gt;the Mi Mix Alpha phone&lt;/a&gt;, which featured a display that wrapped around almost the entire device, though it ultimately never went on sale. This latest concept may well never make it into a commercially available device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o57Ycd"&gt;Xiaomi will announce global availability for its considerably more conventional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;Mi 11 flagship phone&lt;/a&gt; at an event next Monday, February 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4qesDBfRl8uxcnh9I5VpOAtCo-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22283414/EtcOaq7VcAA9Xkm_1.jpeg"&gt;

    <title>Niagara is a minimalist Android launcher I wish I’d had on my bus commute</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sHQI40ORAsdl-YM_pTV2MbVvYYk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771065/DSC00106.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Niagara Launcher puts your apps within easy striking distance of your thumb.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOd31n"&gt;After a couple years of beta testing, Niagara Launcher is now &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;available for download from the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. It’s designed to replace the default Android app drawer and home screen grid with a layout that’s easier to access with one hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZIrlX"&gt;You pick your favorite apps to pin on the home screen, and the rest are accessible under an alphabetized list on the right side of the screen in easy striking distance of your thumb. It’s quick and very responsive; you can either tap on the part of the alphabet you’re aiming for or swipe up and down to scroll your list of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eS7Yah"&gt;Niagara also allows you to take quick action from the home screen by swiping across any app to bring up a list of options, like setting a new timer in the clock app or starting a session with Strava. Favorited apps will also show a preview of notification content on the home screen, and a swipe will expand this to show the full text without opening the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ukD9Cp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Favorited apps will also show a preview of notification content on the home screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2csS7"&gt;These basic features are available with the free version, but customizing your home screen further with additional widgets and displaying your battery life percentage requires an upgrade to the paid pro version, which costs $6 per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fr5uw5"&gt;Niagara features a clever design, and it would really come in handy on a big phone. I also would have appreciated it on my standing-room-only bus commutes in the Before Time, when I often clung to a rail with one hand for dear life while checking my email with the other. It’s pretty handy on a smaller phone, too, for a more informative look at your notifications without requiring you to open an app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hONDG7"&gt;The free version does not contain ads, which is another plus. Yet while the launcher does offer the basics, it’s a little bit of a letdown that it doesn’t let you add something as simple as a weather widget without paying for the upgrade. Overall, though, Niagara offers a clean look and a unique solution for those of us with one-handed woes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is weighing an anti-tracking feature for Android, following Apple’s lead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7GqZ7rzl3eJHMMEzH_uM2rn3p38=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770894/acastro_190228_1777_vpn_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OQOo4A"&gt;Google is considering developing an Android alternative to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253366/apple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch"&gt;upcoming App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt;, a new planned opt-in requirement the iPhone maker will impose on developers that demands they ask for permission to track iOS users across apps and websites. The news, first &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/google-explores-alternative-to-apple-s-new-anti-tracking-feature?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported on Thursday by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, underscores the increasing pressure on large tech companies, many spurred on by Apple, to take more proactive measures to better protect user privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkP3j3"&gt;Google won’t say whether it is indeed working on an anti-tracking privacy measure for Android. But in a statement, a Google spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “We’re always looking for ways to work with developers to raise the bar on privacy while enabling a healthy, ad-supported app ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2S3M4"&gt;First announced at Apple’s developer conference last summer, App Tracking Transparency effectively slides a system-level opt in between an app’s tracking capabilities and a user’s preferences. If the user says they would rather not be tracked, there’s nothing the developer can do to get around that because Apple will disable a developer’s ability to gather the so-called Identifier for Advertisers code, or IDFA. That code both lets advertisers track users from one app or website to another for ad targeting while also helping advertisers measure the effectiveness of ads, such as whether a user ends up purchasing a product they saw on one app by using the mobile website of the merchant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vdCIpJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s take on App Tracking Transparency may not be as severe&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CWkW9z"&gt;Apple intends to police developers using audits and other methods to enforce its policies, which include potentially suspending or banning apps from the App Store if a developer does not comply. Both Facebook and Google have publicly expressed concern for how Apple’s opt-in requirement could negatively affect their mobile advertising networks. But Facebook has gone a step further and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;begun waging a public relations war&lt;/a&gt; against Apple over the change by complaining it will harm small businesses and accusing Apple of being self-serving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNoHfl"&gt;Google’s take on App Tracking Transparency would likely not be as severe, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports. Instead of forcing opt-in requirements on app developers, the Android alternative may resemble some of the upcoming privacy controls planned for Google’s Chrome browser, in which the company seeks to end some of the more insidious tracking technologies on the web today by developing less invasive alternatives and giving users more opt-out mechanisms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cf9YCA"&gt;Google’s work to develop new privacy practices and standards for the web is known as the &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox"&gt;Privacy Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;. As part of that ongoing project, Google has taken steps to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349538/google-changes-ads-data-cookies-privacy"&gt;phase out third-party cookies on Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and is working on tools that allow advertisers to target groups of users instead of directly targeting individuals. All of this could inform how Google develops an anti-tracking measure for Android, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter team up to crack down on hackers who steal rare usernames</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3xvqURkdPcl31BNC6cwc4Hxgy0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770421/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ssQNvO"&gt;Instagram has disabled hundreds of accounts that were stolen as part of online hacking operations designed to gain access to and sell rare and coveted usernames, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Both TikTok and Twitter also took action on some of the accounts belonging to the same hackers, &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/02/facebook-instagram-tiktok-and-twitter-target-resellers-of-hacked-accounts/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+KrebsOnSecurity+%28Krebs+on+Security%29"&gt;reports journalist and cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJ6KGp"&gt;The Facebook-owned platform set its sights mainly on the community surrounding OGUsers, a website well-known for trafficking in stolen usernames and helping facilitate the hacking of these accounts through methods like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping"&gt;SIM swapping&lt;/a&gt;, which is when a user gains control of someone’s phone number and uses it to reset passwords and take control of social media handles. News of Instagram’s enforcement was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-instagram-cyber-idUSKBN2A42HY"&gt;first reported on Thursday by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKTe4L"&gt;“Today, we’re removing hundreds of accounts connected to members of the OGUsers forum. They harass, extort and cause harm to the Instagram community, and we will continue to do all we can to make it difficult for them to profit from Instagram usernames,” a Facebook spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The disclosure is notable because it’s the first time the platform has publicly shared information regarding moderation against username hackers. Earlier this week, Instagram released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262154/instagram-recently-deleted-feature-update"&gt;new feature that lets people recover deleted posts&lt;/a&gt;, in the event a hacker takes control of their account and wipes it clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bXQ8C5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook and Instagram are taking action against online username-stealing communities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IwDrTZ"&gt;Krebs reported on Thursday that the crackdown was something of a joint effort, with Twitter and TikTok also taking action against popular OGUsers community members at the same time on those companies’ respective platforms (although it’s unclear how much coordination there was between the three companies or how far-reaching TikTok and Twitter’s enforcement was). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnmiCJ"&gt;“As part of our ongoing work to find and stop inauthentic behavior, we recently reclaimed a number of TikTok usernames that were being used for account squatting,” TikTok told Krebs in a statement. “We will continue to focus on staying ahead of the ever-evolving tactics of bad actors, including cooperating with third parties and others in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiNeLO"&gt;In addition to disabling the accounts that were stolen, rendering them worthless, the social platforms have also disabled some accounts of well-known OGUsers middlemen who act as intermediaries during username transactions by holding funds in escrow in exchange for a cut of the fee, reports &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydl6Sr"&gt;OGUsers made headlines last summer when a small cohort of hackers affiliated with the site allegedly participated in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327769/twitter-bitcoin-scam-news-updates"&gt;unprecedented Twitter hack &lt;/a&gt;that involved resetting the passwords on the accounts of dozens of high-profile individuals and companies, including Elon Musk and Barack Obama, and using their access to run a bitcoin scam. Like the individual at the center of the Twitter hack, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355746/twitter-hack-teen-hearing-zoombombed-zoom-call-judge"&gt;then-17-year-old Graham Ivan Clark&lt;/a&gt;, many of the hackers Instagram is cracking down on today and those who frequent OGUsers are minors, often drawn into the community by the allure of stealing and retaining a rare username of their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFNLnl"&gt;These usernames tend to be single words — in rare cases, individual letters or numbers — and they can fetch tens of thousands of dollars on underground markets for stolen digital goods. And because platforms like Instagram and Twitter have &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870"&gt;rules barring the buying and selling of accounts&lt;/a&gt;, the hackers interested in procuring one of these coveted handles often resort to illegal means to obtain them. SIM hacking is a popular method, but standard phishing as well as sustained online harassment, extortion, and even swatting are other known techniques, notes &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook blocked in Myanmar after users protest military coup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zd_JGZjsu8EAFvkhSde4wNIbgLg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767792/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GAwt4K"&gt;Myanmar’s government has blocked access to Facebook in the country, after users turned to the company’s services to protest &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22260076/myanmar-coup-military-suu-kyi-explain"&gt;this week’s military coup&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement given &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/myanmar-blocks-facebook-access-after-coup-11612436184?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook confirmed&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the country’s telecoms providers had been ordered to block its services, adding, “We urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with family and friends and access important information.” Myanmar’s government has ordered the services to be blocked until Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yK9O0"&gt;The block comes after users reportedly turned to the social network to protest after the military ousted elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and detained her along with other members of her party. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes that users on Facebook were sharing photos of themselves banging pots and pans as a sign of protest, as well as images of a three-fingered salute — a gesture that’s become a sign of resistance in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WDVKsH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook is the internet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RskwSX"&gt;Telecoms provider Telenor &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Myanmar-Coup/Myanmar-military-blocks-Facebook-as-activists-call-for-protests"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that it has followed the government’s orders, saying it has “decided to comply with the directive, while expressing grave concerns regarding breach of human rights.” The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;reports that an internet monitoring organization, NetBlocks, confirmed that Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all unavailable via the state-owned Myanmar Posts and Telecommunications’ network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzTrDH"&gt;Facebook is an integral part of Myanmar’s internet ecosystem. “For the majority of Myanmar’s 20 million internet-connected citizens, Facebook is the internet” was how a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bsr-facebook-myanmar-hria_final.pdf"&gt;report from 2018&lt;/a&gt; put it, and &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;notes that Messenger is the primary communications channel for most of its citizens. It’s believed around half of the country’s population holds a Facebook account, meaning any attempt to block the service is a significant move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GaOnI"&gt;This close relationship between Myanmar’s internet and Facebook has created problems. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18068104/facebook-business-social-responsibility-myanmar-report"&gt;Facebook admitted&lt;/a&gt; that it hadn’t done enough “&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/11/myanmar-hria/"&gt;to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence&lt;/a&gt;,” after critics said its platform had &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook-idUKKCN1GO2PN"&gt;played a role in genocidal violence in the country&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook said it was investing in “people, technology and partnerships to examine and address the abuse of Facebook in Myanmar.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NKSWW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjIwHm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s next folding phone is coming on February 22nd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mkhnGnxiwkQIkLnmrqkWocgmnoU=/0x0:690x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761147/matex2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KEqkw4"&gt;Huawei will announce a new flagship foldable phone later this month, according to a &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1839167003/K0bsQcYma"&gt;Weibo post&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s official page. Based on the name, the Mate X2 sounds like it should be a more substantial followup to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238269/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-price-release-date-specs-mwc-2019"&gt;original Mate X&lt;/a&gt; than Huawei’s last foldable phone, the faster and slightly tweaked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;Mate XS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lFCft"&gt;Unless Huawei is being deliberately cryptic, the teaser image for the Mate X2 actually suggests that the phone could possibly switch to a different folding screen design with the flexible panel on the inside, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold line&lt;/a&gt;. The previous Mate X phones had a single panel that wrapped around the outside when closed, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22149866/royole-flexpai-2-hands-on-folding-phone"&gt;Royole’s Flexpai devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzTHsP"&gt;Otherwise, there’s not much in the way of details on the Mate X2 yet. It’s likely that it’ll have the same Kirin 9000 processor found in the Mate 40 Pro, and of course Huawei probably still won’t be able to include Google apps and services on board, limiting the device’s viability outside of China unless something changes unexpectedly quickly with the new Biden administration’s approach to sanctions. Huawei’s hardware is always worth paying attention to, though, so stay tuned for more news and details on February 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s HarmonyOS appears to just be a forked version of Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="huawei" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5WlBTNUf0uld9UdFsx5duTpxpE=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68758861/VRG_ILLO_1777_Huawei_004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4bmwHs"&gt;HarmonyOS is Huawei’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798251/huawei-harmonyos-hongmengos-smartphones-internet-of-things-operating-system-android"&gt;alternative operating system&lt;/a&gt; that was created after the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;banned in the US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension"&gt;lost its Android license&lt;/a&gt;. The reality is the operating system is less of a new alternative and more of a slapdash fork of Android 10, according to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;a new report from Ron Amadeo at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvu2dR"&gt;HarmonyOS was initially pitched as a wholly distinct OS from Android and iOS, something that would be just as at home on smart home appliances (like the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873710/huawei-vision-4k-tv-announced-features-mate-30-pro-event"&gt;Honor Vision TV&lt;/a&gt;) as it would on smartphones. The announcement was a hopeful promise that losing access to US businesses wouldn’t stop Huawei from innovating, but Amadeo’s experience with the beta highlights some disappointing discoveries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eujOB3"&gt;Getting developer access requires a two-day background check that includes sending copies of your passport, personal ID, and credit card to Huawei&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yqieKq"&gt;You don’t actually run the beta OS in its emulator; it’s streamed to you, Google Stadia-style, from (presumably) a phone running the beta in China&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iwqJcC"&gt;Most importantly, HarmonyOS seems to be a fork of Android 10 with the word “Android” find-and-replaced with “Harmony”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Ow4yn5"&gt;HarmonyOS was likely always going to be most popular in China, but the fact that the new OS appears to be a continuation of Huawei’s EMUI skin with potentially slower access to Android updates through the Open Source Android Project is a major strike against it being used anywhere else. It might be good enough to not offend the US government and satisfy Chinese authorities, but quick text edits and an invasive application process do not an appetizing operating system make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXXBHz"&gt;Read &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;Amadeo’s whole deep dive&lt;/a&gt; of detective work dissecting the beta, along with some jabs at Huawei’s fluff-filled developer documentation for a hypothetical “super virtual device,” over at&lt;em&gt; Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The LG Wing and Pixel 5 have been cleared to use coveted C-band 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3zDe2Rw_CMqlm1rwozgZR-9J9sM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68758421/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The unusual LG Wing is one of only a few devices approved to use C-band 5G so far.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1M945v"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; owners have something to look forward to: the Federal Communications Commission has approved these devices to use faster C-band 5G frequencies, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/lg-wing-google-pixel-5-get-a-new-future-with-c-band-access"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; tipster&lt;/a&gt;. The two phones have joined an exclusive company made up of some of the first devices approved to use the new frequencies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; phones and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt; are the only others that currently offer support for these frequencies in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RoS9N"&gt;C-band will deliver a much-needed speed boost to 5G in the US, particularly for Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers. Currently, their nationwide networks rely mostly on slower low-band spectrum. This swath of so-called mid-band frequencies went up for auction at the end of 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/c-band-bidding-wraps-at-%248091b-/d/d-id/766706"&gt;US carriers bid a record $80.9 billion&lt;/a&gt; to secure blocks of spectrum for their use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xvx0Jx"&gt;These frequencies won’t be available for use until late 2021 / early 2022, but LG and Google appear to be getting ahead of the curve. With this FCC approval, the companies can offer software updates to enable the use of C-band frequencies on these specific devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MNKs3z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G: everything you need to know","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="em7U0J"&gt;As things stand now, not every 5G phone works with every kind of 5G frequency. Some devices, particularly budget models, support only low- and mid-band. Others are also compatible with high-band like Verizon’s Ultra Wideband, which the carrier indicates by selling certain models branded as “UW.” C-band will complicate things even more; manufacturers need to get FCC approval to retroactively add support to their existing devices so they can take advantage of the new spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLZ6OY"&gt;No doubt C-band will be a welcome addition to 5G networks in the US, but it’s one more thing to be aware of if you plan to buy a new phone this year. T-Mobile customers won’t need to worry as much since that carrier’s network already uses other mid-band frequencies. But if you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T and plan on hanging on to your phone for a few years, it’s worth getting a device that either supports C-band now or will in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfC8rr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z84kAx"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxX7FH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s ‘recently deleted’ feature lets you change your mind about deleting a post</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vfP2kGzAgjMJyc1NrFLv__e5ttI=/308x0:2108x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757513/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_9.17.13_AM__1_.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ZsiAN"&gt;Instagram is making it easier to bring back deleted posts. The company is rolling out a “recently deleted” feature in the app that’ll allow you to review content you’ve deleted, including photos, videos, reels, IGTV videos, and stories, and restore them. Instagram is positioning this feature as helpful against hacks, particularly if hackers gain control of an account and start deleting content. Starting today, users will need to confirm they’re the account owner through either text or email in order to permanently delete or restore content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFAPUG"&gt;Deleted items will stay in the folder for 30 days, and if not touched, they will automatically delete after that point. Deleted stories are the exception, however: they will only stay in the recently deleted section for 24 hours before they’re permanently removed. To access the folder, navigate to Settings &amp;gt; Account &amp;gt; Recently Deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqelnN"&gt;Clearly, Instagram wants to give people chances to keep their content before permanently removing it. The app already offers an archive, or a way to keep posts without them being publicly available, and with this feature, it’s allowing people to keep their posts as an option, even if they want to initially delete them. Instagram benefits from having more content, and thereby more data, on users. The more it can encourage people to keep their posts, the better it is for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6j79qN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 2/2, 12:22 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story initially stated that users need to confirm they’re the account holder in order to access the feature in general, but they actually only need to do so to permanently delete or restore content. We’ve updated to reflect this change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus will soon let you cast workouts to a smart TV using AirPlay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SDpy89xOjXeCMZCaS-pAHgnAd_Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68752687/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6UNsj9"&gt;Apple’s latest watchOS 7 and iOS 14 beta releases indicate a new casting feature for Apple Fitness Plus subscribers is on the way, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/apple-fitness-is-adding-airplay-casting/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPUfEv"&gt;The upcoming software updates will allow AirPlay casting of Fitness Plus workouts to compatible smart TVs, which include any with AirPlay 2 compatibility. That’s good news for Fitness Plus users who may not own an Apple TV, which was previously the only way to get an audio or video workout playing on a bigger screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgoL0T"&gt;Fitness Plus was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437578/apple-fitness-plus-classes-subscription-health"&gt;announced in September of last year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174574/apple-fitness-plus-watch-iphone-release-date-price"&gt;launched in December&lt;/a&gt;, and the paid service costs $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year for access to guided workouts. The service requires at minimum an Apple Watch Series 3 and a paired iPhone 6S or newer, both running the most up-to-date iOS 14 software releases. At launch, the only way to stream a workout from your TV was to have an Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHovFh"&gt;Now, with the watchOS and iOS releases on the horizon, Fitness Plus users need only an Airplay 2-compatible set. Here’s a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fhome%2Faccessories%2F%23section-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F1%2F22260722%2Fapple-fitness-plus-airplay-workouts-tv-new-feature-ios-14-5#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full list of available TVs that meet the requirements&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
