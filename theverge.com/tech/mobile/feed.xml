    <title>It’s 2022, and the Surface Duo is finally getting Android 11 </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nMessnesE1lF-i5Ll_UiG-dAeOI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426723/vpavic_4176_20200905_0142.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo is getting Android 11 at last.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a5fKdZ"&gt;At the beginning of this month, my colleague Monica Chin published an article with the headline “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/1/22862649/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-missed-update"&gt;It’s 2022, and the Surface Duo still doesn’t have Android 11&lt;/a&gt;,” pointing out that Microsoft hadn’t brought Android 11 to the dual-screen phone despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690003/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-release-date"&gt;having said in September&lt;/a&gt; that it was working on delivering the by the end of 2021. That’s finally changing, as Microsoft has begun to roll out Android 11 for unlocked Surface Duos in North America and Europe, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/24/surface-duo-android-11-ota/"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3WUrd"&gt;Not every Surface Duo will be getting the update right away; if you have a Surface Duo that’s tied to AT&amp;amp;T, it sounds like you’re going to have to wait just a bit longer. “For locked or unlocked AT&amp;amp;T Surface Duos, we are testing this release and it is pending final validation,” according to &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/surface-duo-update-history-fe857377-c3ae-12f6-98e9-32982b5665f1"&gt;Microsoft’s page about the update&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpTWVW"&gt;Now, the wait begins for Android 12 — which still hasn’t arrived on the Surface Duo 2. However, &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-fails-deliver-android-11-surface-duo-end-2021"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft apparently plans to bring Android 12L, which is designed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824287/google-android-12-beta-1-release-large-screen-devices-tablet-pixel"&gt;improve the Android 12 experience on bigger screens&lt;/a&gt;, to Surface Duo devices at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google sued by DC and three states for ‘deceptive’ Android location tracking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7kQ1_-NJyQ7dkqZGCJ3IG6XmCA0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70425814/acastro_181130_1777_google_bias_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dVZNdX"&gt;The attorneys general of three states and the District of Columbia are &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23191075/DCv.Google_1_24_22_.pdf"&gt;suing Google&lt;/a&gt; for the allegedly deceptive collection of location data on Android. The complaints, which build on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272625/arizona-ag-sues-google-location-tracking-android-allegations"&gt;a 2020 lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed by the Arizona Attorney General, allege that Google’s “complex web” of settings obfuscated whether users were sharing their location at a given moment. Furthermore, they allege Google pushed Android users with “repeated nudging, misleading pressure tactics, and evasive and deceptive descriptions” to share more information either “inadvertently or out of frustration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Li42HM"&gt;“Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy and control what personal data the company could access,” said DC Attorney General Karl Racine in a statement. “The truth is that contrary to Google’s representations it continues to systematically surveil customers and profit from customer data.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oY1o1"&gt;Racine’s suit, filed today, accuses Google of violating DC’s Consumer Protection Procedures Act. State attorneys general from Washington, Texas, and Indiana are also filing similar suits in their own jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vokGOu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2022-01/DCv.Google%281-24-22%29.pdf"&gt;The DC complaint&lt;/a&gt; claims that Google’s settings “purport to give consumers control over the location data Google collects and uses. But Google’s misleading, ambiguous, and incomplete descriptions of these settings all but guarantee that consumers will not understand when their location is collected and retained by Google or for what purposes.” Like the earlier lawsuit from Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, the DC suit draws heavily on &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-science-technology-business-ap-top-news-828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb"&gt;a 2018 &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; that found “many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you’ve used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vaulnv"&gt;Reached for comment, Google denied the claims in the suit, pointing to recent changes like the ability to auto-delete location history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdDUKW"&gt;“The attorneys general are bringing a case based on inaccurate claims and outdated assertions about our settings,” said Google policy spokesperson José Castañeda. “We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mrv2R9"&gt;An Arizona judge, meanwhile, dealt a blow to the Arizona lawsuit last week by &lt;a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/01/26/judge-denies-ags-demand-for-summary-judgment-in-google-fraud-case/"&gt;denying a request&lt;/a&gt; for summary judgment, saying there wasn’t strong enough evidence that Google had actually misled consumers. The judge recommended the case move forward with a jury trial to resolve “a myriad of factual issues,” a path that Brnovich indicated he will pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: Microsoft to acquire Activision,  Google building a headset, and the 5G battle with airlines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X6tr9eW2vwUXLTGtoIJJkAYbrnM=/99x0:1101x668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416465/Activision_Blizzard_Merge_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7uk013"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where we discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kb4LEK"&gt;The biggest news in tech this week was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;Microsoft acquiring game publisher Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for $68.7 billion. On today’s &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks with games reporter Ash Parrish and senior reporter Alex Heath about the acquisition, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;the issues behind the culture&lt;/a&gt; at Activision Blizzard, and what this means for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889457/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-mobile-gaming-candy-crush"&gt;gaming space in the future. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jt0c8k"&gt;The crew also discusses Alex’s scoop this week that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22892152/google-project-iris-ar-headset-2024"&gt;Google is building an AR headset&lt;/a&gt;, internally codenamed Project Iris, that it hopes to ship in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V52eo3"&gt;Later in the show, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;policy editor Russell Brandom joins to discuss the ongoing battle between the FAA, AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, and airlines over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;activating 5G towers around airports&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893641/antitrust-big-tech-reform-amazon-google-apple-klobuchar-grassley"&gt;tech antitrust bills&lt;/a&gt; developing in Congress this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Want to preorder Samsung’s next Galaxy phone sight unseen? You can</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nwwFyhC7ZPVVKpAaM-7gBbzqu-g=/15x0:1065x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414132/s22U.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1476660792527306754" target="_blank"&gt;evleaks (Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WA4EOF"&gt;For the launch of Samsung’s next flagship smartphones — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"&gt;the Galaxy S22, S22 Plus, and S22 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, we think — the Korean electronics giant will once again let you signal your intent to buy its phones &lt;em&gt;before they’re even announced&lt;/em&gt;, much less go on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iq7k0V"&gt;So if you’re the kind of person who absolutely &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; the new Samsung handset before anyone else (except influencers, journalists, and the like), you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgsVu5GbT1T" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this page at Samsung’s site&lt;/a&gt; to reserve a preorder for one of these unannounced phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdVcCO"&gt;If it’s anything like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202683/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-s-pen-preorder-reserve" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335591/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-preorder-reserve" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;occasions&lt;/a&gt;, you won’t need to plunk down a virtual wad of cash just yet — you’re simply reserving a slot to order the phone later, typically after the company’s actual smartphone keynote (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893640/samsung-unpacked-february-2022-galaxy-s22-ultra" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;coming February, the company just confirmed&lt;/a&gt;) ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="C1x8wX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung confirms February Unpacked, hints at the end of the Note line","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893640/samsung-unpacked-february-2022-galaxy-s22-ultra"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vZ4vx5"&gt;Like before, you’ll also get $50 of credit towards other Samsung Galaxy products when you preorder, so maybe there’s a free case or charger in your future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LEQb1"&gt;While we don’t have official details on what the new phones are quite yet, they have leaked fairly extensively as usual, and the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, in particular, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expected to effectively be the new Galaxy Note, stylus and all&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung mobile president TM Roh threw some gas on that fire &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/editorial-setting-a-new-standard-for-smartphones-in-our-changing-world" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a blog post today,&lt;/a&gt; too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="N8T6m4"&gt;We know many of you were surprised when Samsung didn’t release a new Galaxy Note last year. You loved the unparalleled creativity and efficiency of the  Galaxy Note series, which enabled you to switch from gaming nirvana to high-octane productivity in the blink of an eye. You raved about the lifelike S Pen, which many say rivals putting ink to paper. And we haven’t forgotten about these experiences you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xjUcBQ"&gt;“At Unpacked in February 2022, we’ll introduce you to the most noteworthy S series device we’ve ever created,” he adds later — clearly a play on the word noteworthy — and says that “you will help Samsung rewrite the future of smartphones once again.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDq6oK"&gt;If you’re still not convinced the Note is merging, there’s this video too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AatdJO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_kk-AfcbNI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj20J3"&gt;Otherwise, Samsung’s hinting the new phone will have a brighter camera for better night photos, claiming it will offer “game-changing Nightography,” and earlier this month, the company announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/17/22888966/samsung-exynos-2200-soc-chip-announced-amd-gpu-rdna-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new Exynos processor with AMD RDNA 2 graphics&lt;/a&gt; that might feature in the S22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DNQ7e"&gt;For a better sense, I’d suggest looking at the many leaks we’ve covered, which go over a variety of likely specs, including a wide array of cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AbhmFh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s Galaxy S22 lineup takes shape in unofficial leaks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"},{"title":"Samsung’s leaked Galaxy S22 Ultra is just straight up a Galaxy Note now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"},{"title":"Samsung’s next tablet lineup could include a 14.6-inch ‘Ultra’ model with a notch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/16/22886595/samsung-tablet-lineup-ultra-notch-rumor"},{"title":"Samsung leaks new notched tablet on its own website","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890937/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-tablet-android-leak"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mjkMUb"&gt;And then, as always, I would suggest waiting for the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This controller turns your Android phone into a portable Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A good solution for mobile Game Pass games... or at least some of them&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="92GeMI"&gt;It seems unlikely that Microsoft will ever make a portable Xbox. Between Sony’s failure with the Vita, Nintendo’s dominance of the market with the Switch, and Microsoft’s device-agnostic business model, there isn’t really much need for such a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPRfa3"&gt;That doesn’t mean there’s no demand for portable Xbox games, though. Microsoft has been pushing cloud gaming hard with Xbox Game Pass, as well as the ability to stream games directly from your own Xbox console to your phone. And even though a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22813749/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-touch-controls-stats"&gt;surprising number of players&lt;/a&gt; are doing this with touchscreen controls — I know people who swear by the touch version of &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, believe it or not — it’s not an ideal setup for most Xbox games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ljy59s"&gt;That’s why I was interested to try the RIG MG-X, a mobile controller from Nacon. It’s an officially licensed Xbox controller that works with just about any Android phone, giving it all the buttons you’d find on a standard Xbox One pad. This should make it a good fit for Game Pass games on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yuk8Fx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10988921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="237Ui6"&gt;Mobile controllers aren’t a new idea, and there are solid options for Android out there already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;like the Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt; — including a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.razer.com%2Fap-en%2Fgaming-controllers%2Frazer-kishi&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F21%2F22894588%2Fnacon-rig-mg-x-review-xbox-mobile-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently released Xbox-specific version&lt;/a&gt;. The RIG MG-X, though, has an appealingly straightforward design for a product category that can be a little awkward, which makes for a sleeker approach when coupled with the Xbox buttons. It’s nice not to have to think about which icons map to which commands; you can just naturally use the same buttons you’d have on a conventional Xbox setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMHOfZ"&gt;The controller has a gap in the middle that extends out to clamp around your phone, which connects over Bluetooth. Nacon says it should work with any phone running Android 6 and above with a screen up to 6.7 inches; I mostly used it with a Vivo X70 Pro Plus, which is a giant phone with a 6.78-inch screen, and it works fine. (It does not, however, work with iPhones at all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W1GS06"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bluetooth is a trade-off I’m okay with&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x73HKp"&gt;This is quite a chunky device, and it’s wider than an Xbox controller even before you extend it to insert your phone. That’s not necessarily a bad thing — it feels well-built and and I wouldn’t have a problem tossing it into a bag when traveling. The use of Bluetooth instead of a USB-C connector is a trade-off I’m okay with, because it makes for a more compatible design and ensures the controller can be used with the phone in a case. It does mean that you have to manually pair with the phone, though, and charge the controller itself over USB-C from time to time; Nacon quotes around 20 hours of battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcCHId"&gt;Overall, the RIG MG-X’s controls are small but effective. The analog sticks aren’t as big as a full-size Xbox controller’s, but they’re bigger than a Nintendo Switch Joy-Con’s and feel more satisfying to use. The face buttons are also quite small but tactile and clicky, while the D-pad is accurate enough despite being a little mushier than I’d prefer. I have big hands and I found the RIG MG-X to have reasonably good ergonomics over time for most games.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/13Ug_-3zq2hC3bJTSff4TluciaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184163/IMG_1854.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The RIG MG-X’s triggers are its biggest flaw.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GYgtaC"&gt;There is one exception, though, when it comes to the triggers. For some reason they’re unusually difficult to press in all the way, which is a big problem for games like racers where you need to hold them down a lot. A game like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where you’re regularly making individual squeezes to fire weapons is okay, but I was wondering why I was losing so many races in &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; before figuring out that I didn’t have my foot pressed firmly enough on the gas. You can do it, but it takes more force than any other controller I’ve ever used, and it’s not at all comfortable for extended play sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DSpRO"&gt;It’s unfortunate that this isn’t a good &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; controller — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;you may have heard that it’s a pretty good game&lt;/a&gt; — but it does work well for most other genres. You can use it for non-Xbox games, of course, whether they’re from the Play Store or elsewhere — I played a lot of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; with it, and you even get native Xbox button indicators in the menus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3kwWJX"&gt;The RIG MG-X is a decent controller with a single big flaw, so just know what you’re getting into if you’re a fan of racing games. I happen to be one, so that was disappointing for me, and I’d personally go with the Xbox version of the Razer Kishi for that reason. But for lots of other Xbox games, this is a solid solution that gets you closer to a portable Xbox than ever before, and other than the triggers I prefer its design to the Kishi. This month Nacon also announced the MG-X Pro, which looks much more like a standard Xbox controller — hopefully the triggers are better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung confirms February Unpacked, hints at the end of the Note line</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Note 20" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7f1_k7i0r25GLZ3oVXQxTON1BUY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414137/dbohn_201004_4226_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Note 20 will likely be the last of its kind.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PoO0Kw"&gt;Samsung will host an Unpacked event next month, the company has confirmed in a press release authored by president TM Roh, and the writing is on the wall for the Galaxy Note series. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/editorial-setting-a-new-standard-for-smartphones-in-our-changing-world"&gt;The release&lt;/a&gt; hints that more Note features will be coming to the Galaxy S series — specifically the next Ultra phone in the lineup, which looks poised to take on the Note’s built-in stylus and related productivity features. This all but seals the Note series’ fate, which Samsung left in ambiguous territory last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EloU0"&gt;Things looked doubtful for a renewal of the Note series when 2021 came and went without a new Note device. Roh’s post acknowledges the disappointment from Note fans and that this feedback has been taken into account in designing “the most noteworthy S series device we’ve ever created.” To drive home the point, the post ends with a rallying cry to “help Samsung rewrite the future of smartphones once again” and an invitation to “[g]et ready for the ultimate Ultra experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I2bP6K"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_kk-AfcbNI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DCbb7W"&gt;This doesn’t come as much of a surprise. Last year’s S21 series took a half step toward absorbing the Note series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22226594/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-stylus-support-price-unpacked-event"&gt;when it incorporated S-pen support&lt;/a&gt;. When the S22 leaks started to roll in, it began to look more obvious that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;the S-series Ultra, in particular, would more or less become the new Note&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a built-in stylus silo. We expect to get all of the details at Samsung’s February Unpacked event, though the exact date and time are still unknown. Until then, Note fans can hold out some hope that the stylus features they love haven’t been forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA estimates 78 percent of US planes can now land at airports with 5G C-band</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="American Airlines Boing 777 Landing At London Heathrow" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fD2icf3k1Ghz8TmN1Cp9po2kK7o=/0x0:5400x3600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413591/1229178652.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There were concerns some altimeters might not properly filter 5G signals.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X5cObI"&gt;The FAA &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that an “estimated 78 percent of the U.S. commercial fleet” have been cleared to land at airports with 5G C-band, even under low-visibility conditions. The agency’s statement comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891634/faa-att-verizon-5g-c-band-rollout-battle-airlines-buffer-zones"&gt;a week of controversy&lt;/a&gt; surrounding the rollout of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891286/att-5g-rollout-select-metro-areas-faa-delay"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available"&gt;Verizon’s&lt;/a&gt; upgraded cellular tech, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;saw US airlines warning of “catastrophic disruption”&lt;/a&gt; to travel and shipping and some international airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;announcing they’d halt flights to some US airports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wN2QVN"&gt;At issue are concerns that some radio altimeters won’t properly ignore signals from the new 5G transmitters. While there are precautions that should keep this from happening, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;creating buffer zones around airports&lt;/a&gt;, an incorrect altimeter reading could cause real problems during a low-visibility landing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0vNnj"&gt;Given the high stakes, the FAA has said that only planes with altimeters that it has tested and cleared will be allowed to land in sub-optimal conditions at airports where the new 5G tech has rolled out. You can read our explainer of the situation, which goes into detail about the last-minute confusion, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="btYEdc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FAA has quickly added altimeters throughout the week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IslnZH"&gt;On January 16th, the agency announced that it had cleared two altimeters, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891725/faa-radar-new-altimeter-clearance-5g-c-band-rollout-airlines-boeing-777"&gt;bumped up to five on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. It said the cleared altimeters were installed in “some” versions of planes like the Boeing 737, 747, and 777. The FAA changed that language on Thursday, saying that the 13 cleared altimeters should cover “all” Boeing 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, 787, MD-10/-11, and Airbus A300, A310, A319, A320, A330, A340, A350, and A380 models. It also notes that “some” Embraer 170 and 190 regional jets are covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRv7Sn"&gt;The FAA is still predicting that some altimeters won’t pass the test and will be “too susceptible to 5G interference.” Planes equipped with those models won’t be allowed to land at airports with the new 5G tech in low-visibility conditions — which could prevent airlines from scheduling any flights using those planes to airports of concern, given the unpredictability of weather and the disruption such a diversion would cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72mUwf"&gt;The carriers have been frustrated with the FAA and airlines for their handling of the situation. Their rollouts have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;been delayed multiple times&lt;/a&gt;, and on Tuesday, AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;put out a statement&lt;/a&gt; lambasting the FAA’s “inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services.” Verizon followed with a similar statement that also mentioned other countries’ rollouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbTyQR"&gt;You can read the FAA’s full statement &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;on its 5G page&lt;/a&gt;, under the “FAA Statements on 5G” heading. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boost Celero 5G review: budget phone with budget battery life</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Boost’s first 5G phone is cheap but unremarkable&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ukL1pq"&gt;Boost Mobile, the MVNO owned by the Dish Network as a result of the Sprint / T-Mobile merger, is in a tricky spot. Not only does it need to expand its user base for nationwide 5G service, but it also needs to migrate over a million Boost customers from Sprint’s CDMA 3G network to its 4G / 5G service (operated by T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T) soon since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/23/22741762/tmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost"&gt;T-Mobile will be shutting down Sprint’s CDMA network by March 31, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. This means the carrier will need to convince its many customers to upgrade to newer 4G or, more preferably, 5G phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJv8Us"&gt;That’s where Dish’s first self-branded phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22697318/dish-5g-game-279-boost-mobile-exclusive-5g-phone-prepaid"&gt;$279.99 Celero 5G&lt;/a&gt; (though often discounted to less), comes into play. This Android phone with iPhone-like looks works better than you’d expect and takes decent photos in good lighting conditions. Unfortunately, it has the exact same price as the popular and well-reviewed Samsung Galaxy A32 5G that’s also available at Boost, making the Celero a direct competitor. So how does the Celero 5G stack up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wloz9j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10954511"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Celero 5G’s silver back cover" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDWJHBxlyr5CXKDjc9NhGN0OSh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098805/gsin_190404_4933_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Celero 5G’s plastic body actually makes the phone more lightweight and comfortable to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Q51CwH"&gt;Celero 5G Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MjNajL"&gt;Like T-Mobile’s REVVL V Plus 5G and AT&amp;amp;T’s Radiant, the Celero 5G is made by Wingtech Technology and custom-designed for Boost (when you plug the phone into a computer, the phone is named “WT Celero 5G”). At first glance, it looks like an iPhone clone: it has an all-round silver trim, square camera array, and the unmistakable rims around the camera lenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tp0or"&gt;While its matte silver back cover is surprisingly smudge-resistant, its smooth surface makes the phone way too easy to slide off tables and hands — you’ll want to get a case to protect it. For a big phone (it measures 6.56 x 3 x 0.33-inch (166.60 x 76.20 x 8.40mm)), the Celero’s all-plastic body and beveled edges make it comfortable to hold, and it’s not too heavy either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Closeup of the Celero 5G’s power button" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZyCvq8Ct59l-U9QZM33Du8cr8ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098806/gsin_190404_4933_0003_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The placement of the Celero 5G’s power and fingerprint sensor is too low and recessed for easy access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A closeup of the bottom of the Celero 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2XTbUN1GuPYJSnR21TiXjH36KR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098807/gsin_190404_4933_0004_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Celero 5G’s 3.5mm audio jack is located at the bottom of the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KYi1dO"&gt;The power button and integrated fingerprint sensor on the Celero are too low and too recessed to use easily, however. As a result, it takes an extra second to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor — because I’m usually fumbling for the power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oqrFrR"&gt;Celero 5G Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4zJeD8"&gt;The Celero 5G’s screen is big but dim: you need to set the screen brightness to around 100 percent to use it comfortably indoors (you’ll be squinting at this screen outdoors). It has a large 6.5-inch LCD display that is only 720p in resolution, which means high-resolution photos and videos won’t look the sharpest here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGKj1j"&gt;For a sub-$300 phone using the &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dimensity-700-vs-Dimensity-720_13199_12994.247596.0.html"&gt;“fast mid-range SoC” MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor&lt;/a&gt; and 4GB RAM for support, the Celero 5G can handle basic tasks without any significant lag. I was able to cycle between my many opened tabs and apps quickly and could even play a YouTube video while I read an article. Like the Samsung A32, the Celero comes with just 64GB of internal storage, but the Celero has a microSD card slot that can support up to a 2TB card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="g2qLIG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Celero 5G’s display is dim and low-resolution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0QbKaI"&gt;I played a round of &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite,&lt;/em&gt; and the Celero 5G handled the game like a champ. The responsive touchscreen made it easy to move my Charmander around the battlefield, even as the attack moves became more complicated. When I plugged in my wired headphones into its bottom-facing audio jack, I could hear a vocal track on the game’s theme music that I’d previously missed. Its bottom-firing mono-speaker is passable: it managed to play the demanding “Dance at the Gym: Mambo” from the 2021 &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack with clarity, if not a bit too loudly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cY4NzL"&gt;Although I appreciate that this phone is running a mostly unmodified version of Android 11, the Celero is unfortunately full of bloatware. In addition to the usual suspects like a folder worth of Amazon apps, there are two folders called “Lifestyle” and “Games’’ that contain a bunch of app shortcuts that the phone will download if you click on the “Add” button. There is even an App Spotlight app that shows you 24 app shortcuts the carrier is encouraging you to download (including &lt;em&gt;The Epoch Times&lt;/em&gt;). To make matters worse, every time you wake or turn on your phone, you will see three apps doing some sort of configuration in the background, but it’s not clear how to disable those processes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWoJmE"&gt;As Dish’s first self-branded phone, it’s hard to know if and when the Celero will receive any OS or security updates to extend its lifespan. This is a far cry from more established brands like Samsung, which have a four-year software commitment on the A32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3xpRV"&gt;The battery life on the Celero 5G is not as long as its 4,000mAh battery would imply. Although I managed to get about 8 hours and 15 minutes of screen time before I had to recharge it, that was with very moderate use. I was only on Wi-Fi to listen to a couple of podcasts, post on Twitter, check email, and chat with family on Google Hangouts. If you use mostly 4G or 5G on this phone, you’ll probably need to keep the charger or a portable battery close by because the Celero might not last a full day of heavy use. The included 15W charger is not exactly a fast charger either: it took over two hours to fully recharge the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A4UaIl"&gt;Celero 5G Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Closeup of the Celero 5G’s rear cameras" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nSiJcKjP46v0jttLhpuJYDH5__o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098808/gsin_190404_4933_0005_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Celero 5G’s cameras are pretty basic and not suitable for night or sports photography.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h3Zgcp"&gt;The Celero 5G’s cameras are the standard fare for its class: it has a 16-megapixel rear camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth sensor, and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies. With good lighting and the right framing, you should be able to get some good photos with good details to share online. However, I wouldn’t use this phone to take action or night photography because these cameras just aren’t capable enough for more challenging situations. The front camera, on the other hand, can capture relatively bright selfies even in dim lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zn42Wa"&gt;Like other budget phones, the Celero’s ultrawide photos tend to skew yellow, especially when you compare a photo taken with the main camera of the same scene. Whether I take outdoor holiday decoration photos or indoors inside a diner, the ultrawide camera has a knack for inexplicably boosting the yellow channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="77JkcT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10954550"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bITS9Q"&gt;Worst of all, the Celero’s camera app is annoying to use. It can take an extra second to switch between the main and the ultrawide cameras or different modes, which might be the difference between you getting or missing the shot. It also takes about two seconds to process a live focus shot, so you’ll need a steady hand and patience when using this mode. When I tried to take a photo that happened to have a QR code, the app kept asking me if I wanted to visit that website, even after I repeatedly tapped “No.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EPlgm0"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Celero 5G’s silver back cover" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4M0ExMH_y5UcI_d8jbdBZvWTxeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098811/gsin_190404_4933_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Celero 5G has tough competition from budget 5G phones from Samsung, Motorola and OnePlus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cdKDPA"&gt;As much as I enjoyed the $279.99 Celero 5G for its iPhone-like looks and capable performance, I have a hard time recommending it over the same-priced Samsung Galaxy A32 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzivR5"&gt;For the same money, the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G offers a bigger battery at 5,000mAh, a better 48-megapixel main camera, C-band 5G compatibility, and four years of software support from Samsung. With the Celero, it’s hard to know if it’ll get software support like security updates, from whom and for how long, not to mention its smaller battery and less powerful cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYk2yt"&gt;Boost also offers the $249.99 Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G, which is $30 cheaper than the Celero, comes with double the internal storage at 128GB, and also features a 48-megapixel camera. The best-in-class OnePlus Nord N200 5G is even cheaper at $239, and it includes a 1080p display with a 90Hz refresh rate, though it’s not clear if this unlocked phone will be compatible on Boost’s network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cq9KHM"&gt;I wish Boost would give the Celero 5G a permanent price cut, like its current promotional price of $139.99 or lower. This would make it a whole lot easier to recommend the Celero despite its shortcomings — shorter battery life, more bloatware, untested brand. But without that significant discount, the Celero 5G is not your best bet at Boost.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The battle between the FAA, AT&amp;T, Verizon, and airlines over 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-Xzg8u4OPAGaRV_gkHXYUO1OyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70409844/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;C-band’s rollout has endured months of controversy&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="u8qDaU"&gt;When AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon spent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;tens of billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; for the rights to use the C-band spectrum for their 5G service, the carriers saw it as a way to expand their networks and make them faster. Those plans, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;sparked a feud&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which warned that the cell signals could interfere with the altimeters that pilots use to land in conditions with low visibility. (&lt;em&gt;Could&lt;/em&gt; is a keyword — if everything is working correctly, there shouldn’t be problems, but with jets that can hold hundreds of people, it’s understandable why the FAA and airlines would want a lot of wiggle room.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSD8JL"&gt;Before the carriers activated their C-band equipment, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;FAA created rules around&lt;/a&gt; how airplanes could land in low-visibility conditions. The carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;agreed to delay their rollouts in November 2021&lt;/a&gt;, pushing the date to January 5th, and also said they’d &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22801008/verizon-att-midband-5g-c-band-lower-power-six-months"&gt;run their equipment at lower power around airports for six months&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873765/faa-verizon-att-airport-5g-carriers-buffer-zone"&gt;creating buffer zones&lt;/a&gt; and allowing the regulator more time to analyze the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFrZ9z"&gt;Then, the FAA requested another delay. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863964/faa-fcc-verizon-att-c-band-5g-airports-proposal-rejected"&gt;The carriers initially rejected it&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;cutting a deal&lt;/a&gt; to push the date back to January 15th. As that deadline neared, there was a flurry of activity. A coalition of airlines and shipping companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;claimed that the rollout could cause “catastrophic disruption”&lt;/a&gt; if it went through, and the carriers announced that they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;put further limits on their rollout around airports&lt;/a&gt; but lambasted the FAA in their statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SH2ca3"&gt;The same day, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;several international airlines announced&lt;/a&gt; that they were canceling flights to certain airports in the US. (The president of Emirates &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/business/emirates-5g-quest/index.html"&gt;had some scathing remarks&lt;/a&gt; about how the situation was handled, calling the rollout “one of the most delinquent, utterly irresponsible issues [...] I’ve seen in my aviation career” and saying that the airline didn’t have vital information until a few days before the rollout.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9p4oBF"&gt;On the 19th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891286/att-5g-rollout-select-metro-areas-faa-delay"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; activated their cell networks, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891725/faa-radar-new-altimeter-clearance-5g-c-band-rollout-airlines-boeing-777"&gt;FAA cleared additional altimeters&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it should allow “an estimated 62 percent of the U.S. commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports where wireless companies deployed 5G C-band.” The story is continuing to evolve as airlines announce delays or that they’ll be continuing service. You can follow the story as it continues to unfold here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FAA says some 777s are cleared to fly to airports with 5G C-band</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cell Tower" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ax_faz-fwHHNCiwSmYTuhaA2Td8=/104x0:3967x2575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70409265/1234861974.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dD3Tcr"&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-5g"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that more planes will be able to land in low-visibility conditions despite the rollout of 5G C-band, including some models of the Boeing 777 aircraft that’s used by many international airlines. According to a statement from the regulatory agency, it’s cleared three more models of radar altimeters as safe and reliable, even in areas where the upgraded cellular technology has been rolled out. This change comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;several international airlines announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that they were suspending flights to some US airports due to the 5G C-band rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaDJzM"&gt;According to the FAA’s statement, which you can read in full below, it cleared three additional altimeters on Wednesday morning, after clearing two on January 16th. The FAA has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;been in a back-and-forth with AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that the companies’ cell towers could interfere with equipment needed to safely land planes in low-visibility conditions. Earlier this month the carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;delayed their rollouts&lt;/a&gt; to give the FAA more time to test and clear altimeters, and have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;said they’ll limit C-band expansion around certain airports&lt;/a&gt; that frequently have low visibility conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="imFEfj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new approvals clear an estimated 62 percent of US commercial airplanes for low-visibility landings at airports with C-band&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vNvq3y"&gt;With the additional safety buffer that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon announced on Tuesday, this should clear some models of Boeing 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, MD-10/-11 and Airbus A300, A310, A319, A320, A330, A340, A350, and A380. The FAA says that these new approvals should “allow an estimated 62 percent of the U.S. commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports where wireless companies deployed 5G C-band.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmJlHK"&gt;While 62 percent of airplanes seems low, it’s higher than the FAA’s previous estimates; when the agency announced its new list of approvals on January 16th, it said they covered around “45 percent of the U.S. commercial fleet.” The administration has also said that, despite Wednesday’s clearances, “flights at some airports may still be affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KCQjG"&gt;There were hints that this change would be coming — earlier on Wednesday, ANA and Japan Airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;announced that they would be resuming normal operations&lt;/a&gt; thanks to an FAA notification that cleared the 777 (the FAA’s announcement wasn’t public at the time). In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, US-based Southwest Airlines said that it “expects minimal disruptions today after the telecomm companies announced their delay in 5G expansion near U.S. airports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPLOSE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The FAA’s full statement: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uC5tjQ"&gt;The FAA issued new approvals Wednesday that allow an estimated 62 percent of the U.S. commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports where wireless companies deployed 5G C-band. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvmJDo"&gt;The new safety buffer announced Tuesday around airports in the 5G deployment further expanded the number of airports available to planes with previously cleared altimeters to perform low-visibility landings. The FAA early Wednesday cleared another three altimeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CfYzH"&gt;Even with these approvals, flights at some airports may still be affected. The FAA also continues to work with manufacturers to understand how radar altimeter data is used in other flight control systems. Passengers should check with their airlines for latest flight schedules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boHBij"&gt;Airplane models with one of the five cleared altimeters include some Boeing 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, MD-10/-11 and Airbus A300, A310, A319, A320, A330, A340, A350 and A380 models.&lt;/p&gt;
