    <title>Verizon is once again giving you a reason to turn 5G off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pseg15ozbBJ1ekOK1tx7GNjk29k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets.sbnation.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68932592/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m9ufjc"&gt;Verizon 4G appears to be getting even better than its nationwide 5G network, according to &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/tested-verizons-new-4g-beats-5g-big-time"&gt;new tests conducted by &lt;em&gt;PCMag’s&lt;/em&gt; Sascha Segan&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22305899/verizon-support-turn-off-5g-save-phone-battery"&gt;last week’s tweet&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that users turn off their phone’s 5G to conserve battery life, there seems to be a multitude of reasons for Verizon customers to stick with 4G right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ihm2K"&gt;Additional spectrum is making the difference for Verizon 4G right now, and not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;C-band spectrum&lt;/a&gt; that’s been in the news recently. This is CBRS, a set of frequencies that sits near C-band. Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/verizon-dish-cable-top-list-cbrs-auction-winners"&gt;bid $1.89 billion on CBRS&lt;/a&gt; licenses last year and has been putting the newly acquired spectrum to work for its 4G service in certain locations (there are likely technical reasons, which Segan explains in his post, why Verizon isn’t using this spectrum for 5G just yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bAjyeB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DbCy0Z"&gt;Segan found a couple of these spots and tested CBRS-assisted 4G speeds versus 5G. With the exception of range-limited, super-fast Ultra Wideband 5G, 4G won by a landslide. In one location, 4G download speeds reached 815 Mbps, while 5G based on Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (that’s the widespread but slower variety known as DSS) only hit 358 Mbps. This was a test of just a couple of locations of course, but Segan points out that it bodes well for the kinds of improvements we can expect when C-band becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7g2IS4"&gt;So is there any reason for someone on Verizon to keep 5G active rather than switching to 4G? Maybe, Segan tells us. “If you’re in a spot with Verizon’s ‘UWB’ millimeter-wave 5G, it’s absolutely terrific. UWB is the fastest form of 5G available today. But the DSS ‘nationwide’ 5G just isn’t providing any advantage right now. I’d say, turn it off if you can and check back in a few months to see if they’ve improved the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yyj77b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’ll be the C-band spectrum that will likely make the difference for Verizon 5G&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LrUdv7"&gt;The silver lining, of course, is that Verizon 4G is actually good — and getting even better for some. In the long term, it’ll be the C-band spectrum that will likely make the difference for Verizon 5G. “If you’re buying a Verizon phone soon and you’re interested in future performance, make sure it has C-band,” Segan says. In the meantime, unless you live next door to an Ultra Wideband cell site, you can probably turn off 5G and rest assured that you’re getting the best network performance possible for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQYJq6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spice up your daily pandemic walk with these apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7JTL09TXMNTLmfl06h24EoUsf-k=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68931867/final.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Keep the routine fresh&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="vfp7Lm"&gt;As you may have heard one or two times, we’re now roughly a year into COVID and pandemic lockdown life. To fill the void in our lives that was once occupied by social gatherings, visiting family, and breathing indoor air freely, many of us have turned to new hobbies and habits. Some of them are even healthy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEv0XJ"&gt;Taking a daily or, if I’m being honest, &lt;em&gt;semi&lt;/em&gt;-daily walk is a lockdown habit that has seen me through These Unprecedented Times. I’m &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roobeekeane/status/1347644813320073220?s=20"&gt;not alone, either&lt;/a&gt; — without gyms or really anywhere else to go at all, lots of us have embraced (or at times, endured) a daily walk around the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5qr1L"&gt;To be sure, it’s not always easy. I got tired of walking by the same houses and the same pieces of fossilized trash about six months in. It rains a lot where I live and that can turn an otherwise pleasant walk into a real bummer. Other days, the motivation just isn’t there and the mailbox is as far as I get. But a few tricks along the way have helped me and fellow &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers stay committed to the walk ritual. Here are some techniques to keep your pandemic walk routine fresh and the apps that can help you put them into practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BIctUh"&gt;Find a new route&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vw0WdGgH1BgVp5TrwbEgDrqQfgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354699/footpath.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footpath helps you map out new routes and gives you key information like elevation change along the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bEBgeP"&gt;This year I’ve embraced the life-changing magic of hauling myself out of my own neighborhood and going on a walk somewhere else. It feels counterproductive driving somewhere to take a walk, but it really does help shake things up when I’m burned out on my usual route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zvSG2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alltrails.com/"&gt;AllTrails&lt;/a&gt; is an app popular with hikers, but it’s also great for finding nearby parks and trails you may not know about, whether you’re in an urban spot or farther from the city. There’s also an active community who leave helpful tips, like whether the restrooms are a horror show or if the parking lot is a hotspot for break-ins. All of its basic features are available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZygxB3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://footpathapp.com/"&gt;Footpath&lt;/a&gt; is another good tool to help identify a new route, whether it’s close to home or somewhere unfamiliar. Use the app’s detailed street map to draw roughly where you’d like to go; the app will snap your route to the nearest streets and pathways. Footpath gives you important details about the route like mileage, elevation gain / loss along the way, and even a time estimate that factors in hills so you know what you’re getting into. You can trace out the full route or draw a path to a destination you’d like to reach and the app can create a loop route back to your starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEtefm"&gt;The free version will help you brainstorm some new walks, but more advanced features like turn-by-turn navigation — iPhone only for now but coming to Android soon — require an Elite subscription ($23.49 annually). Alternatively, you can add Elite features to individual saved routes for a one-time fee of $1.99 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Rmyp3f"&gt;Make it mindful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="khOWzU"&gt;Any therapist or Silicon Valley CEO will tell you about the benefits of meditation. My brain is too noisy for a traditional sitting-and-breathing meditation, but I find walking meditations a lot easier to get into. &lt;a href="https://app.www.calm.com/program/wAzjO76/mindful-walking"&gt;Calm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.headspace.com/meditation/walking-meditation"&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; (each is $69 for an annual subscription) offer walking meditations of various lengths; the ones offered by Headspace are tailored to more specific circumstances, like walking in a city or just back and forth at home. There are also plenty of free options if you search YouTube or your streaming music service of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aES93I"&gt;Find something to tune into&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/05OGacEC6uRchhIWbp9WT1AFXww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354708/apple_time_to_walk_apple_watch_airpods_01252021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time to Walk is an Apple Fitness Plus feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vhm8rP"&gt;Finding a bite-sized podcast to listen to during walk time is a nice bonus incentive to take a break and head out the door. &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2rTT1klKUoQNuaW2Ah19Pa?si=b5snZO3iT66QKGQPD24Yqw"&gt;NPR’s &lt;em&gt;Short Wave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a quick ten-ish minutes with episodes every weekday. One of my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues uses her walk to catch up on &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/06iGnWl5EnkJktsKhSNeAQ?si=brnULdIcRHi2RbOUrfm4lQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gamertag Radio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Or check out an audio book from your local library with the &lt;a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/"&gt;Libby app&lt;/a&gt; to make walk time double up as your reading time. And for something a little more freeform, use the time to listen in on a conversation on &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; or Twitter Spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONIgIv"&gt;If you’re an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-fitness-plus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22320002%2Fwalking-apps-pandemic-strava-footpath-alltrails-seek" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; subscriber, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248678/apple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes"&gt;Time to Walk&lt;/a&gt; is a great option. Featured celebrities like Dolly Parton share stories, recorded as they walk in places that are meaningful to them. It’s a nice, reflective experience with a diverse range of hosts. You will need a subscription to Apple’s $79 / year fitness service and an Apple Watch, so it’s more likely to be an option if you’re already invested in those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LOz6NS"&gt;Gamify it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f12e8YMF5OIjGprB0TbULvPTCmw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354714/seek.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seek helps you identify local animals and plant life, rewarding you with badges as you observe more species.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WFthGB"&gt;It works on kids and it works on adults: when all else fails, turn it into a game. Tracking walks on &lt;a href="https://www.mapmyrun.com/app"&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/mobile"&gt;Strava&lt;/a&gt; can give you that extra sense of accountability and accomplishment when you get back home and tap the “finish” button. It’s a neat little trick that works on my lizard brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJypyF"&gt;Or, do as another of my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues does and take note of local critters and plant life with the &lt;a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app"&gt;Seek app&lt;/a&gt;. It uses your phone’s camera to identify plants, birds, and other kinds of fauna. Best of all, it will keep track of species you’ve indentified and award badges as you identify more. Badges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="asxYQT"&gt;Of course, that’s just the real-life version of the classic catch ‘em all game. Another &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer uses that oldie but goodie &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/en/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to keep her neighborhood walks interesting. If you missed its rise in popularity the first time around, here’s the gist: several years ago, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; tricked a bunch of us into going outside to look for AR characters in real-life locations. Once you find them, you can capture them by flinging virtual pokéballs at them on your phone screen. Keep it casual and just see how many different pokémon you encounter and capture on your walk route, or seek out rarer pokémon more aggressively. It’s your world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish will acquire Republic Wireless to boost adoption of its 5G network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dish CES 2013 stock 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vT4b1z_8LQ21vhIofV1Y4UMdnHw=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68930225/20130110-625A1517VERGE.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nathan Ingraham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XzUfOf"&gt;Satellite television provider Dish Network has announced its plan to acquire cell carrier Republic Wireless, &lt;a href="https://about.dish.com/2021-03-08-DISH-to-acquire-Republic-Wireless"&gt;Dish said on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The acquisition, when it closes, will give Dish roughly 200,000 wireless customers to help boost its 5G network, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;Dish plans to launch later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Dish says Republic Wireless customers won’t see any immediate changes to their plans and won’t have to take any action on their accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADtNcx"&gt;Dish became a major player in the telecom business last year when it finalized its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;purchase of Sprint’s Boost Mobile business&lt;/a&gt; for $1.4 billion, as part of a sale Sprint was required to make to merge with T-Mobile. Dish has since signaled its intentions to launch a 5G network in the US by buying up costly spectrum and acquiring small cell carriers, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352496/dish-ting-mobile-acquisition-tucows-network-tech"&gt;Ting Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, to acquire the necessary technology and the customer base to turn its investments into viable future businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="woeYRT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dish is building out a nationwide 5G network it plans to launch later this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FVeCGv"&gt;Republic Wireless is an MVNO, or a mobile virtual network operator, that leases network infrastructure from T-Mobile. Like the Ting acquisition, which gave Dish access to Ting parent company Tucows’ backend mobile services, the Republic Wireless acquisition will turn the carrier’s existing Relay division into a vital tool for Dish’s telecom push. Dish says Relay will continue to be a standalone business, but it will also become a customer of the network’s 5G division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noMj40"&gt;“Relay provides communication and productivity solutions for frontline teams in hospitality, facilities management, manufacturing, healthcare and education,” the press release says, “and it will become a wholesale customer on Dish’s 5G network.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRXeKX"&gt;“Republic has created a loyal following and established a brand known for innovation, customer service and value. We plan to build upon that strong foundation,” Dish COO John Swieringa said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbtoVG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 8th, 3:42PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that Republic Wireless’ Relay division will continue to operate as a standalone business. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo overtakes Huawei to lead Chinese smartphone market for first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KE_veaLpsdmmpG5MQIUdKpc8ApY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68927938/DSCF7293.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M3PqSc"&gt;Oppo has become the best-selling smartphone brand in China for the first time ever, &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/oppo-becomes-number-1-smartphone-brand-china-first-time-ever/"&gt;according to figures from Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt;. Counterpoint’s report says that Oppo managed to capture 21 percent of the world’s biggest smartphone market in January, ahead of Vivo and Huawei, which both achieved 20 percent. Apple and Xiaomi rounded out the top five with 16 percent apiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwWkpF"&gt;Oppo’s sales were up 26 percent year on year and increased 33 percent from the previous month. Counterpoint says that the new Reno 5 series had a successful launch due to offering better specs at a lower price point than the earlier Reno 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EktVGt"&gt;But for Oppo to gain market share, someone has to lose it, and the report shows that Huawei’s smartphone troubles are taking hold in China too. Counterpoint says Huawei has increased its focus on the premium market because of component shortages caused by US sanctions, so Chinese distributors have been focusing on other brands for volume. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;Huawei’s sale of Honor&lt;/a&gt;, which was also sparked by sanctions, will cut its market share down further, with Honor now considered a competitor as opposed to an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v720FG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Introducing the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOFindX3Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOFindX3Pro&lt;/a&gt;, our latest high-end flagship series. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AwakenColour?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AwakenColour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/GxerLioEq3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GxerLioEq3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1368748571101597698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U8NFzq"&gt;These figures are just for one month, but Counterpoint expects Huawei’s share of the market to continue its decline throughout 2021. Oppo will look to capitalize on the opportunity with the launch of its latest flagship phone, the Find X3 Pro, which is being announced in full on Thursday. If you want an early look, the company just tweeted a teaser that doesn’t leave a whole lot to the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mABC7X"&gt;The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing AT&amp;amp;T for providing nonpublic information to 20 different analyst firms so they would lower revenue estimates ahead of earnings, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-43?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. That let AT&amp;amp;T “beat” expectations for the quarter when the information-sharing took place, turning what could have been some nasty headlines in the financial press into a win instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7kq7R"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20500640-sec-complaint-against-att"&gt;SEC’s complaint (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T learned in March 2016 that its quarterly results would fall short of estimates due in part to “a steeper-than-expected decline in smartphone sales.” As you might recall, we used to live in a world where carriers like AT&amp;amp;T subsidized part of the cost of your smartphone, but by then AT&amp;amp;T had passed that cost along to the customer — which meant far fewer customers were upgrading them every year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NHVe1"&gt;This quarter was going to be AT&amp;amp;T’s worst-ever for smartphone upgrades: a record low of just 5 percent, according to the complaint. As a result, AT&amp;amp;T expected that its consolidated gross revenue “was expected to fall more than $1 billion below the consensus estimate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLmm7w"&gt;Here is what happened next, from the complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eCN37P"&gt;Fearful of a revenue miss at the end of the quarter, AT&amp;amp;T’s Chief Financial Officer instructed AT&amp;amp;T’s IR Department to “work the analysts who still have equipment revenue too high.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VBQK5"&gt;In turn, the Director of Investor Relations (“IR Director”) instructed Womack, Evans, and Black to speak to analysts privately on a one-by-one basis about their estimates in order to “walk the analysts down”—i.e., induce analysts to reduce their individual estimates. The goal was to induce enough analysts to lower their estimates so that the consensus revenue estimate would fall to the level that AT&amp;amp;T expected to report to the public—i.e., AT&amp;amp;T would not have a revenue miss, which would have been the company’s third consecutive quarterly miss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TQtoRe"&gt;In their calls, the three IR executives “intentionally disclosed material nonpublic information regarding AT&amp;amp;T’s results to date,” the SEC alleges. Of the 20 analyst firms listed in the complaint, all of them lowered their revenue estimates — and many took AT&amp;amp;T’s 5 percent number directly. The SEC suggests that AT&amp;amp;T’s executives hid the fact that these numbers weren’t the kind that are supposed to be shared, so analysts may not have known that they shouldn’t have had access to that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1t1w8"&gt;Executives emailed amongst themselves the day before its Q1 2016 earnings in relief, the complaint shows. The company’s CFO even &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveCBenoit/status/1367955623321735179"&gt;apparently told&lt;/a&gt; the CEO that two analyst updates “may do it for us,” with the CEO replying, “Good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kG4VX5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is AT&amp;amp;T anxiously pushing analysts to lower estimates so that a single quarter of earnings doesn't create bad headlines, even though the results stink. And it goes all the way to the top, per the SEC. &lt;br&gt;Just another reminder of what CEOs actually care about in private. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qxbMNvVsYQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qxbMNvVsYQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dave Benoit (@DaveCBenoit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveCBenoit/status/1367955623321735179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPHf9Z"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T ended up reporting $40.535 billion in revenue for Q1 2016, barely beating the revised consensus analyst estimates by less than $100 million, according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLASME"&gt;The company disputed the SEC’s allegations &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/att-disputes-sec-allegations-301241737.html"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that “there was no disclosure of material nonpublic information”.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMB2Sf"&gt;“The information discussed during these March and April 2016 conversations concerned the widely reported, industry-wide phase-out of subsidy programs for new smartphone purchases and the impact of this trend on smartphone upgrade rates and equipment revenue,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtEuMa"&gt;“Not only did AT&amp;amp;T publicly disclose this trend on multiple occasions before the analyst calls in question, but AT&amp;amp;T also made clear that the declining phone sales had no material impact on its earnings,” it continued. “Analysts and the news media frequently wrote about this trend and investors understood that AT&amp;amp;T’s core business was selling connectivity (i.e., wireless service plans), not devices, and that smartphone sales were immaterial to the company’s earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tencent-branded RedMagic gaming phone launched with 165Hz screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J-SCNrcWjZGJVFlJcmOJZY1R2ts=/390x0:4610x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68915577/3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jt4Wf9"&gt;RedMagic, the gaming brand of ZTE subdivision Nubia, has launched a new smartphone in collaboration with Chinese tech and gaming giant Tencent. The RedMagic 6 and 6 Pro are high-end devices available to order now in China, with a global launch coming later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQdVcr"&gt;The RedMagic 6 has an Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, active fan cooling, and a 6.8-inch 1080p OLED display with a refresh rate of 165Hz, making it the fastest phone screen on the market today. RedMagic is also claiming a single-finger touch sampling rate of up to 500Hz, or up to 360Hz with multitouch. The touch-sensitive capacitive “shoulder triggers” on the side, meanwhile, are sampled at up to 400Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6jJmx"&gt;The RedMagic 6 Pro is mostly identical, but it comes with up to 18GB of RAM and has a faster 120W charging system that RedMagic says can fully charge the 4,500mAh battery in just 17 minutes. The non-Pro 6 has a bigger 5,050mAh battery but a slower 66W system that takes 38 minutes for a full charge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HN1LvaJwULNtfRUY6d00qgw3GI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347425/4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QKP5kY"&gt;The Tencent collaboration is quite unusual. RedMagic says that the phone’s software is optimized for Tencent apps like WeChat and QQ, with 50 percent faster read and write speeds. Tencent’s Solar Core gaming software is also preloaded, and the company promises it improves game response speed, frame rates, and network latency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="no35i3"&gt;The RedMagic 6 starts at 3,799 yuan (~$585) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but you can pay almost twice as much for a fully loaded 18GB/512GB RedMagic 6 Pro — that’ll cost 6,599 yuan (~$1,020). Global pricing will likely be different, however; RedMagic will announce international release plans on March 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile saw Verizon telling people to turn off 5G and thought ‘why stop there’</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G_W5zbjTDzh-7AjfR5thnxMN3ys=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets.sbnation.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68914288/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EMvZYc"&gt;T-Mobile has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;busy hawking its 5G network&lt;/a&gt;, recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;spending many additional billions to expand it&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it &lt;em&gt;kinda&lt;/em&gt; awkward that it’s also been caught telling users to turn off 5G to save battery life (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saschasegan/status/1367473288398729223?s=20"&gt;via Sascha Segan&lt;/a&gt;). Didn’t Verizon just make this same gaffe mere days ago? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22305899/verizon-support-turn-off-5g-save-phone-battery"&gt;It sure did&lt;/a&gt;. But instead of learning from the example, T-Mobile appears to have pulled a hold-my-beer: where Verizon told users to switch to LTE, many of T-Mobile’s support documents tell users to go &lt;em&gt;all the way back to 2G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOpONa"&gt;In case you’re not aware, switching to 2G (which T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g%2Fnetwork-apn-and-volte-samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g%23steps3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;handily tells you how to do&lt;/a&gt;) will make your phone next to useless as a data device: the maximum theoretical speed you could get from a 2G connection would be around 1Mbps (though many top out at closer to 256Kbps). Even 1Mbps is 25 times slower than what the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;FTC considers to be acceptable broadband speeds&lt;/a&gt;, and 300 times slower than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Ffast-mid-band-5g-new-cities-towns-location-coverage&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the average 5G mid-band speeds T-Mobile has bragged about&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="my6Y0X"&gt;(Never mind that T-Mobile is also in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21336397/t-mobile-require-support-volte-2021-5g-lte"&gt;phasing out 2G signals &lt;em&gt;for good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though the 2G shutdown has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/05/t-mobile-3g-shutdown-reportedly-delayed-until-2022/"&gt;been postponed to 2022&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;From the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s21-5g%2Fbattery-life-samsung-galaxy-s21-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;support page for the Samsung Galaxy S21 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;5G&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k2lAUs"&gt;T-Mobile probably realized that this kind of advice was not a great look, but the company’s cover-up has also been amusingly slow. Earlier today, it removed the “Toggle from 5G/LTE to 2G” advice from the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; example &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/t-mobile-like-verizon-also-tells-users-to-turn-off-5g-to-save-on-battery"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g%2Fbattery-life-samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G&lt;/a&gt;), and the second one (the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s21-5g%2Fbattery-life-samsung-galaxy-s21-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 5G&lt;/a&gt;) had its support page updated shortly before we wrote these words. It also didn’t take long to find the advice to turn off 5G and/or 4G on the pages for the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Flg-wing%2Fbattery-life-lg-wing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Foneplus-nord-n10-5g%2Fbattery-life-oneplus-nord-n10-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s20-plus-5g%2Fbattery-life-samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy S20+ 5G&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fgoogle-pixel-4a-5g%2Fbattery-life-google-pixel-4a-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 4a 5G&lt;/a&gt; (which weirdly only mentions turning off 4G, not 5G). That’s likely an incomplete list, but you get the picture: the nudge to pick T-Mobile’s slow 2G network showed up a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIVMBH"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:9luReeBj72AJ:https://www.t-mobile.com/support/devices/android/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g/battery-life-samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us"&gt;Here’s a Google Cache version&lt;/a&gt; of the first T-Mobile support page from March 1st.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKbNQI"&gt;I will say that T-Mobile is right in one way: turning my phone down to 2G would likely make it so slow that I’d just give up trying to use it, and my phone probably would last a lot longer. If you’re struggling with battery life on your phone, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20698309/android-phone-batter-save-drain-how-to"&gt;plenty of things you can try&lt;/a&gt; that don’t involve slamming the brakes quite that hard.&lt;/p&gt;

Part of a trio of services T-Mobile is calling WFX, Home Office Internet is designed to complement customers’ standard home internet with a separate cellular-based Wi-Fi network. The goal is to provide a reliable, secure connection for business customers without having to worry about sharing bandwidth with the rest of the household. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mV9Kd"&gt;Home Office Internet is an extension of the LTE-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;wireless home broadband consumer service&lt;/a&gt; that’s being piloted now, and it works in basically the same way. Users receive a router and can self-install the network. It uses 4G and 5G signals and, like the consumer service, includes a potentially important caveat: customers are subject to deprioritization slowdowns at times when the network is busy. That’s an annoyance for anyone but would be particularly bad for customers trying to conduct business on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUSuHp"&gt;Home Office Internet will be available to businesses starting March 22nd, and at launch T-Mobile says 60 million households will be covered. The company aims to expand that to 90 million households by 2025. T-Mobile didn’t share any updates on the consumer home broadband service, which remains in testing in certain markets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators call on FCC to quadruple base high-speed internet speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Janet Yellen Confirmation Hearing For Treasury Secretary Before Senate Finance Committee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxcU2F0IVLZoMntp4hEn5oqPCt0=/0x0:5374x3583/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909919/1230675894.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6A0XFv"&gt;The federal government’s definition of high-speed broadband has remained stagnant over the last six years, sitting at 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up since 2015. But faced with pandemic-fueled network loads and a new push for infrastructure spending, lawmakers are getting ready to upgrade that definition. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344741/2021_0304_Bipartisan_Broadband_Speed_Letter_FINAL__1___1_.pdf"&gt;In a letter to government leaders&lt;/a&gt; Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators called for a quadrupling of base high-speed broadband delivery speeds making 100Mbps down and 100Mbps up the new base for high-speed broadband. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUMUQu"&gt;“Going forward, we should make every effort to spend limited federal dollars on broadband networks capable of providing sufficient download and upload speeds and quality,”  Sens. Michael Bennet (D-CO), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Angus King (I-ME), and Rob Portman (R-OH) &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344741/2021_0304_Bipartisan_Broadband_Speed_Letter_FINAL__1___1_.pdf"&gt;wrote to the FCC&lt;/a&gt; and other agencies. “There is no reason federal funding to rural areas should not support the type of speeds used by households in typical well-served urban and suburban areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rR7OeW"&gt;The letter calls on the FCC and other agencies to change their definitions of “high speed broadband” to anything above 100Mbps down and 100Mbps up — a shift that would prohibit the FCC from identifying an area as being served with broadband unless it met those speed criteria. It’s a complete change of pace from the FCC under former Chairman Ajit Pai’s leadership, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;which established&lt;/a&gt; the previous 25 / 3Mbps standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv6jGE"&gt;“We find that the current speed benchmark of 25/3 Mbps remains an appropriate measure by which to assess whether a fixed service is providing advanced telecommunications capability,” the FCC’s report said earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXhF1C"&gt;The current base speeds for high-speed broadband aren’t nearly enough for a moderately sized family working from home. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;Zoom recommends&lt;/a&gt; 3.8Mbps upload speeds for just one 1080p video, and the shift to remote schooling and work has forced many families to run multiple simultaneous streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmEMFX"&gt;“Ask any senior who connects with their physician via telemedicine, any farmer hoping to unlock the benefits of precision agriculture, or any student who receives livestreamed instruction, or any family where both parents telework and multiple children are remote learning, and they will tell you that many networks fail to come close to ‘high speed’ in the year 2021,” the senators wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyqIxM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 3/4/21 at 8:15AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated quotes to reflect final text of the letter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s $260 Redmi Note 10 Pro has a 120Hz screen and a 108-megapixel camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jltKGHYnQkYNli9YcfnYVoHLGc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909890/DSCF7567.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gL9v7g"&gt;Xiaomi has announced its Redmi Note 10 line, the latest in its phone series that’s titanically popular in India and beyond. As is tradition for the Redmi Note phones, the 10 series brings some high-end features to much lower price points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ShkYe"&gt;The Redmi Note 10 Pro is the main attraction here, with several variants including the Note 10S, Note 10, and Note 10 5G adjusting various specs to meet different price points. The Note 10 Pro’s standout feature is its 6.67-inch 1080p OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVULZW"&gt;The Note 10 Pro also has a 108-megapixel primary camera alongside an 8-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel “telemacro”, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. On paper, that puts its camera setup in reach of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;Xiaomi’s new Mi 11 flagship&lt;/a&gt;, though the Note 10 Pro’s 1.55-inch 108-megapixel sensor is a little smaller. The holepunch selfie camera, meanwhile, is 16 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Is_OcSDViqMD2ts3YzIE2xsXkd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344632/DSCF7564.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DxgQOC"&gt;Other specs include a Snapdragon 732 processor, 6GB or 8GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of storage, a 5,020mAh battery, 33W fast charging, a microSD card slot plus two separate SIM card slots, stereo speakers, a fingerprint sensor in the power button, and a headphone jack. The biggest omission is wireless charging, but that’s not a surprise for a device in this price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPmWz8"&gt;Xiaomi wouldn’t provide full international pricing details ahead of the launch, but the Indian variant of the Redmi Note 10 Pro is called the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max and starts at Rs. 18,999 (~$260) for a model with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The non-Max Indian Note 10 Pro is identical but has a 64-megapixel main camera instead and starts at 15,999 (~$220) for the 6GB/64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
