    <title>The LG Wing and Pixel 5 have been cleared to use coveted C-band 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3zDe2Rw_CMqlm1rwozgZR-9J9sM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68758421/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The unusual LG Wing is one of only a few devices approved to use C-band 5G so far.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1M945v"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; owners have something to look forward to: the Federal Communications Commission has approved these devices to use faster C-band 5G frequencies, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/lg-wing-google-pixel-5-get-a-new-future-with-c-band-access"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; tipster&lt;/a&gt;. The two phones have joined an exclusive company made up of some of the first devices approved to use the new frequencies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; phones and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt; are the only others that currently offer support for these frequencies in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RoS9N"&gt;C-band will deliver a much-needed speed boost to 5G in the US, particularly for Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers. Currently, their nationwide networks rely mostly on slower low-band spectrum. This swath of so-called mid-band frequencies went up for auction at the end of 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/c-band-bidding-wraps-at-%248091b-/d/d-id/766706"&gt;US carriers bid a record $80.9 billion&lt;/a&gt; to secure blocks of spectrum for their use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xvx0Jx"&gt;These frequencies won’t be available for use until late 2021 / early 2022, but LG and Google appear to be getting ahead of the curve. With this FCC approval, the companies can offer software updates to enable the use of C-band frequencies on these specific devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MNKs3z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G: everything you need to know","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="em7U0J"&gt;As things stand now, not every 5G phone works with every kind of 5G frequency. Some devices, particularly budget models, support only low- and mid-band. Others are also compatible with high-band like Verizon’s Ultra Wideband, which the carrier indicates by selling certain models branded as “UW.” C-band will complicate things even more; manufacturers need to get FCC approval to retroactively add support to their existing devices so they can take advantage of the new spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLZ6OY"&gt;No doubt C-band will be a welcome addition to 5G networks in the US, but it’s one more thing to be aware of if you plan to buy a new phone this year. T-Mobile customers won’t need to worry as much since that carrier’s network already uses other mid-band frequencies. But if you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T and plan on hanging on to your phone for a few years, it’s worth getting a device that either supports C-band now or will in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfC8rr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z84kAx"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxX7FH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s ‘recently deleted’ feature lets you change your mind about deleting a post</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vfP2kGzAgjMJyc1NrFLv__e5ttI=/308x0:2108x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757513/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_9.17.13_AM__1_.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ZsiAN"&gt;Instagram is making it easier to bring back deleted posts. The company is rolling out a “recently deleted” feature in the app that’ll allow you to review content you’ve deleted, including photos, videos, reels, IGTV videos, and stories, and restore them. Instagram is positioning this feature as helpful against hacks, particularly if hackers gain control of an account and start deleting content. Starting today, users will need to confirm they’re the account owner through either text or email in order to permanently delete or restore content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFAPUG"&gt;Deleted items will stay in the folder for 30 days, and if not touched, they will automatically delete after that point. Deleted stories are the exception, however: they will only stay in the recently deleted section for 24 hours before they’re permanently removed. To access the folder, navigate to Settings &amp;gt; Account &amp;gt; Recently Deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqelnN"&gt;Clearly, Instagram wants to give people chances to keep their content before permanently removing it. The app already offers an archive, or a way to keep posts without them being publicly available, and with this feature, it’s allowing people to keep their posts as an option, even if they want to initially delete them. Instagram benefits from having more content, and thereby more data, on users. The more it can encourage people to keep their posts, the better it is for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6j79qN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 2/2, 12:22 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story initially stated that users need to confirm they’re the account holder in order to access the feature in general, but they actually only need to do so to permanently delete or restore content. We’ve updated to reflect this change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus will soon let you cast workouts to a smart TV using AirPlay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SDpy89xOjXeCMZCaS-pAHgnAd_Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68752687/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6UNsj9"&gt;Apple’s latest watchOS 7 and iOS 14 beta releases indicate a new casting feature for Apple Fitness Plus subscribers is on the way, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/apple-fitness-is-adding-airplay-casting/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPUfEv"&gt;The upcoming software updates will allow AirPlay casting of Fitness Plus workouts to compatible smart TVs, which include any with AirPlay 2 compatibility. That’s good news for Fitness Plus users who may not own an Apple TV, which was previously the only way to get an audio or video workout playing on a bigger screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgoL0T"&gt;Fitness Plus was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437578/apple-fitness-plus-classes-subscription-health"&gt;announced in September of last year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174574/apple-fitness-plus-watch-iphone-release-date-price"&gt;launched in December&lt;/a&gt;, and the paid service costs $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year for access to guided workouts. The service requires at minimum an Apple Watch Series 3 and a paired iPhone 6S or newer, both running the most up-to-date iOS 14 software releases. At launch, the only way to stream a workout from your TV was to have an Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHovFh"&gt;Now, with the watchOS and iOS releases on the horizon, Fitness Plus users need only an Airplay 2-compatible set. Here’s a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fhome%2Faccessories%2F%23section-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F1%2F22260722%2Fapple-fitness-plus-airplay-workouts-tv-new-feature-ios-14-5#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full list of available TVs that meet the requirements&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung drops Galaxy Z Flip 5G price $250, but it’s still expensive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x1rEv6nMTrS-68XftPrhm4NwTgY=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68751847/Galaxy_Z_Flip_5G_Mystic_Bronze_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HZ6H7K"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-z-flip/buy/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dropped the price of its folding flip phone&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Z Flip 5G, by $250. It’s now $1,199.99, which, on its face, looks like a fairly big drop from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333566/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5g-announced-price-release-date-1449-99"&gt;original asking price of $1,449.99 in July 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ptu2Ng"&gt;However, there are two things to keep in mind about the price change. First, this phone is about six months old and is the same design as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;non-5G version released last February&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung phones are famous for seeing early and aggressive deals; now that trend is hitting its folding phones, too. So while a price drop is nice to see, it’s not exactly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXvEby"&gt;Second, $1,200 is still very expensive for a phone that has essentially the same specs and functionality as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;Galaxy S20 FE 5G&lt;/a&gt;, which can be had for $700 (or less if you can find a deal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3JJGe"&gt;The news of the price drop comes after Samsung’s president of mobile, TM Roh, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;promised to make folding phones&lt;/a&gt; “more accessible to everyone” in 2021. It also comes after Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253844/samsung-earnings-q4-fy-2020-profits-covid-display-mobile"&gt;latest earnings announcement&lt;/a&gt; in which it said it would expand its portfolio of foldable products — specifically citing that it plans an “expansion of the foldable category including the Galaxy Z Fold and Galaxy Z Flip.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MgH2z"&gt;We were already expecting a new version of the Z Fold (which opens up to the size of a small tablet) sometime this year with support for styluses, but it’s unclear when Samsung may release that. As for the Z Flip, it’s unclear what this price drop means for the timing of the next one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rb4SMW"&gt;But the biggest question around folding phones isn’t about when new ones will come; it’s about how much they will cost. While it’s definitely true that $1,200 is $250 less than $1,450, there’s still a very big price premium for customers who want their phones to fold down into smaller packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz0E0Y"&gt;The Z Flip is easily the best flip-style folding phone on the market, but it’s a small market. The only other viable competitor is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;Motorola Razr 5G&lt;/a&gt;, which, as of this writing, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-razr-gen-2%2Fp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F1%2F22260357%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-price-drop-1200#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has also been discounted&lt;/a&gt; to $1,200 from its original $1,400 asking price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Bd6B9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21417432/foldable-phones-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-flip-5g-microsoft-duo"&gt;Folding phones are still luxury products&lt;/a&gt;, in other words. These flip phones cost nearly 50 percent more than comparable non-folding devices. It’s good to see the Z Flip 5G become “more accessible,” but unless that price difference can get smaller, folding phones will continue to be curiosities instead of mass-market devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g4OOeh"&gt;

    <title>Facebook prompt will encourage ad tracking opt-in ahead of Apple’s privacy push</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z68YP0IKo3HUEpIFV749ErIJVD0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68751770/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wU7A49"&gt;Facebook will begin showing a prompt on its mobile app for the iPhone and iPad that’s designed to convince users to allow ad tracking, in preparation for an upcoming privacy change in which Apple will force developers to obtain permission to track users across apps and websites in the future. The new screen, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/facebook-strikes-back-against-apple-ios-14-idfa-privacy-change.html"&gt;first reported on Monday by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, will be shown to users globally starting today and will provide Facebook with early data on how Apple’s privacy change might affect the social network’s business, ahead of Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253366/apple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch"&gt;planned update in early spring&lt;/a&gt; that will make the opt-in request mandatory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUuqg1"&gt;The prompt will give users a page of information detailing why Facebook thinks a user should give the company permission to track them on iOS. The company argues doing so will make ads more personalized and help support businesses that rely on advertising. Apple’s upcoming change, which it first detailed at its developer conference last year, will let users opt out of letting apps collect the so-called Identifier for Advertisers, or IDFA, code, which companies share with one another to track a user across apps and websites and to measure the effectiveness of digital ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RPd30e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple’s new prompt is designed to present a false tradeoff between personalized ads and privacy.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YHjX7V"&gt;Facebook has spent the last few months &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/ios-14-apple-privacy-update-impacts-small-business-ads"&gt;citing the potential harm to small businesses&lt;/a&gt; posed by Apple’s new privacy measures, which Facebook says will lead to less effective advertising and potentially lower revenues. The company has even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;taken out full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; railing against Apple’s changes, and both &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-ceo-zuckerberg-says-it.html"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/apple-ceo-tim-cook-says-f.html"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt; have made a series of increasingly hostile public remarks against the other company’s business models. Now, Facebook says under App Store rules allowing developers to educate consumers, it’s using its new prompt “to help people make a more informed decision.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ghw1Dx"&gt;“Apple’s new prompt is designed to present a false tradeoff between personalized ads and privacy; when in fact, we can provide both. Apple is doing this to self-preference their own services and targeted advertising products,” a Facebook spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “To help people make a real choice, we’re also showing a screen of our own to provide more information about how we use personalized ads, which support small businesses and keep apps free. Agreeing to our screen doesn’t result in Facebook collecting new types of data; it just means that Facebook can continue to give people better experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k03wG3q_uPaExC2O-CCo7Jlx4bk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273120/106832756_1611957023306_Test_screens_FINAL.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qBP3d7"&gt;The prompt is intended to preface the system-level pop-up Apple will make mandatory in an upcoming iOS 14 release this spring. Notably, Facebook does not use the word tracking, but instead asks to “use your apps and website activity,” while the Apple pop-up that follows spells out that Facebook is asking for permission to “track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.” Developers have been able to ask for permission since the release of the new operating system last fall. Yet few have done so, while Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delayed its implementation of the opt-in requirement&lt;/a&gt; in September of last year to give developers more time to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTLxHy"&gt;In this case, however, Facebook is asking for permission early in an effort to prepare itself for what may be a substantial amount of its users who decline to opt into ad tracking. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-looks-to-take-its-fight-with-apple-to-court"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, some internal estimates at the company predict fewer than 20 percent of Facebook users agreeing to allow tracking on iOS. Regardless of the choice a user makes if they see the pop-up today or sometime in the next few weeks, Facebook intends to honor the choice when Apple makes the opt-in requirement mandatory, according to CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Thoo7t"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board, the independent body empowered to review the social network’s most complex platform moderation decisions, is now &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.secure.force.com/apex/VisualAntidote__HostedFastForm?f=i6VO6LLfXbOt%2Bdjzhn2zNj%2B5yLrazO6pIHWc5cVT/zWMmmWJHflKUJzl708kZWe1"&gt;accepting public comments&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;“indefinitely” ban former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the US Capitol attack on January 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbAFa6"&gt;The two posts in question include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;one-minute video Trump posted to his account on January 6th&lt;/a&gt; repeating false claims that the US election was stolen from him and offering words of sympathy to the Capitol rioters, some of whom were, at that moment, continuing to endanger the lives of Congress members and Capitol police. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGP9tH"&gt;The second is a written post in which Trump wrote, “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously &amp;amp; viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly &amp;amp; unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love &amp;amp; in peace. Remember this day forever!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGmSfP"&gt;Facebook removed the video, took down the post, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22218009/trump-facebook-ban-block-posting-24-hours-capitol-riot"&gt;subsequently banned Trump from its platform and Instagram for 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; before saying the ban would remain in place indefinitely and at the very least through Inauguration Day. Although Trump’s pages remain live, he has not been permitted to post anything on Facebook or Instagram since January 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RJuJBC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Oversight Board has the power to overturn Facebook’s decision&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4IohG7"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242616/facebook-refers-decision-suspend-trump-oversight-board"&gt;referred its decision to the Oversight Board&lt;/a&gt; last week, citing the unprecedented actions company leadership felt compelled to take after Trump’s incitement of a riot that left five people, including one police officer, dead. The Oversight Board, which was formed last year and is made up of 20 experts from around the world with a large degree of background and employment diversity, expects to make a decision by the end of next month. The board took on its first batch of cases last month, but it announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;first rulings on five cases earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, upholding only one removal and overturning four others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kze5r"&gt;“We believe our decision was necessary and right,” Facebook’s Nick Clegg, its vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a statement last week regarding Trump’s ban. “Given its significance, we think it is important for the board to review it and reach an independent judgment on whether it should be upheld.” Facebook is looking for clarity on not just whether it made the right decision to ban Trump, but also in what circumstances it should take comparable action against political leaders in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NcgYBT"&gt;Now, the Oversight Board wants the public to weigh in, too. The board is looking for comments regarding whether Facebook’s decision “complied with the company’s responsibilities to respect freedom of expression and human rights” and what it should do should a similar situation arise in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rs5gtJ"&gt;It’s also looking for comments on how the company should “assess off-Facebook context in enforcing its Community Standards,” particularly when there is a threat of real-world violence; how it should “treat the expression of political candidates, office holders, and former office holders”; and whether Facebook’s rules around account enforcement like suspensions and bans should be made more accessible, as well as appeals around that enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeSn5O"&gt;The board is similarly looking for feedback on what considerations should be made to ensure Facebook’s rules are applied consistently around the globe, especially when weighed against Facebook’s “newsworthiness” exemption. That exemption is what Facebook has relied on in the past when defending its choice to keep up controversial Trump posts, like Trump’s comments &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21277135/facebook-walkout-protest-virtual-president-donald-trump-posts"&gt;regarding protests against police brutality last summer&lt;/a&gt;, and content from other world leaders that may violate its standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09gnjX"&gt;The Oversight Board says it will accept public comments until 10AM ET on February 5th, and it lists a number of requirements — submissions must be written in English and be no longer than two pages when written in 12-point Times New Roman font, to name a couple — that must be met to be considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xggYEa"&gt;The guidelines say only the Oversight Board will view the submissions to protect privacy and security, and those who decide to give feedback will be given a choice whether to have any of it published or attributed to them publicly as part of its deliberations and eventual ruling. The ruling will contain any public feedback in an appendix attached to the decision so long as the writer consents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUZhN6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi says its ‘Air Charge’ technology works over several meters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-sAPh7Ly0LkMErzbgevFocGK60=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68738358/Lark20210129_110714.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RArVhf"&gt;Xiaomi has &lt;a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/01/29/forget-about-cables-and-charging-stands-with-revolutionary-mi-air-charge-technology/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; “Mi Air Charge Technology,” a wireless charging system that the company claims is able to charge devices “within a radius of several meters.” Multiple devices can be charged at 5W at the same time, according to Xiaomi, and physical obstacles apparently don’t reduce charging efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX2fpH"&gt;Xiaomi says the technology will also work with smartwatches and fitness bracelets. Another goal is to make “living rooms truly wireless,” with speakers, lamps, and smart home devices all being powered by the same remote system. A Xiaomi representative confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, however, that no commercial products will include the technology this year, and declined to provide a timeframe for release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzrwjL"&gt;Here’s how Mi Air Charge Technology works, in Xiaomi’s words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="J40LtW"&gt;The core technology of Xiaomi’s remote charging lies in space positioning and energy transmission. Xiaomi’s self-developed isolated charging pile has five phase interference antennas built in, which can accurately detect the location of the smartphone. A phase control array composed of 144 antennas transmits millimeter-wide waves directly to the phone through beamforming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDIHy0"&gt;On the smartphone side, Xiaomi has also developed a miniaturized antenna array with built-in “beacon antenna” and “receiving antenna array”. Beacon antenna broadcasts position information with low power consumption. The receiving antenna array composed of 14 antennas converts the millimeter wave signal emitted by the charging pile into electric energy through the rectifier circuit, to turn the sci-fi charging experience into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4vsiv"&gt;Needless to say, you should be skeptical about the prospects of this technology making it to market until evidence suggests otherwise. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14124938/energous-truly-wireless-charging-apple-ces-2017"&gt;Companies like Energous&lt;/a&gt; have been making announcements about “truly wireless charging” at CES and beyond for several years, but the technology is yet to gain serious traction. Xiaomi has demonstrated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522730/xiaomi-mi-80w-wireless-charging-technology-announced"&gt;wireless charging engineering breakthroughs&lt;/a&gt; in the past, however, and has the advantage of owning a huge hardware ecosystem that it could theoretically leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple retakes second place in smartphone shipment rankings as sanctions bite Huawei</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-6LsWukqqwnnP59jaU2neKAvi0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734773/akrales_201018_4238_0435.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pesyUj"&gt;Apple overtook Huawei to reclaim its spot as the second-bestselling smartphone manufacturer in the world in 2020, according to new research reports from &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-shipped-record-iphones-q4-2020-global-smartphone-market-continues-recover/"&gt;Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-shipment-Q4-2020"&gt;Canalys&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung was still the leading seller in terms of number of smartphones shipped, while Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo took the next three spots, according to Counterpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwdPw2"&gt;It was just under a year ago that the same research analysts reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114885/huawei-overtakes-apple-2019-analysts-strategy-analytics-counterpoint-research-canalys"&gt;Huawei had overtaken Apple&lt;/a&gt; to take second place in 2019. But since then, US trade sanctions seem to have hit Huawei hard. The Chinese company’s smartphone shipments were 21 percent lower in 2020 compared to 2019, according to Counterpoint, and Huawei dropped out of the top five entirely in the fourth quarter of the year. It’s the first time in six years Huawei hasn’t been in the top five, Canalys notes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jmUFPMliIJ3tH4ZYKyDlfXYvSGY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22265688/msedge_yHAlKBDDrF.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-shipment-Q4-2020" target="_blank"&gt;Canalys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s smartphone shipments dropped out of the top five in Q4 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QAHESd"&gt;Although Huawei was still able to hold on to the number three spot overall, thanks to domestic sales in China (where it reportedly shipped 70 percent of its phones in 2019), Xiaomi seized the opportunity to expand internationally and saw shipments increase by 17 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. However, the fastest-growing smartphone brand in 2020 was reportedly Realme, which shipped 65 percent more phones than it did in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhyalT"&gt;Apple’s gains were more modest, increasing by 3 or 5 percent year over year depending on whether you ask Counterpoint Research or Canalys. The latter notes that Apple shipped the most iPhones ever in the fourth quarter of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q13uhFOoULy8NsTeIXRBNF4PxbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22265691/msedge_cg52VaBVpy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-shipped-record-iphones-q4-2020-global-smartphone-market-continues-recover/" target="_blank"&gt;Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counterpoint Research reports that Apple overtook Huawei last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HxLL2G"&gt;Although it’s still the bestselling smartphone manufacturer in the world, both reports suggest that Samsung’s smartphone business is losing market share. Both Canalys and Counterpoint say its shipments fell 14 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. It’s still around 50 million smartphones ahead of second place Apple, but the gap appears to be narrowing. Counterpoint says that the South Korean electronics giant is facing stiff competition from Apple at the high end of the market and from Chinese manufacturers in the midrange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9173w"&gt;Overall, the entire smartphone market was reportedly down compared to 2019. Canalys reports that shipments were down 7 percent, while Counterpoint reports a bigger 10 percent decline. Counterpoint blames the pandemic and resulting lockdowns for the drop, but notes that shipments began to pick up in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s profits rose in 2020 despite the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5fyUHE"&gt;Samsung Electronics has &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fy-2020-results"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its fourth-quarter earnings, confirming that the company made more money in 2020 than the year before despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating profit was up to 35.99 trillion won ($32.1 billion) off 236.81 trillion won ($211.5 billion) in revenue for the year, increases of 29.6 percent and 2.78 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEz8rU"&gt;Samsung says its fourth-quarter results were helped by its “company-wide efforts to ensure a stable supply of products and services globally” in the pandemic environment. Quarterly profit was up 26.4 percent year-on-year, largely driven by the display and memory businesses, though the latter was down quarter to quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ANV36K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S21 review: nice for the price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1gqgzi"&gt;Samsung’s display business had its highest ever quarterly earnings, which the company mainly attributes to high demand from major smartphone manufacturers. (Samsung doesn’t spell it out, but this was the quarter that Apple outfitted its entire new iPhone 12 lineup with OLED panels.) Samsung also reduced its losses from larger displays like TVs and monitors, and calls out a greater demand for contactless services as a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qb3f1d"&gt;Samsung expects mobile profit to increase this quarter thanks to the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 series&lt;/a&gt;, and says it plans to expand its lineup of foldable devices. The display division, meanwhile, expects OLED penetration to continue to increase throughout the smartphone market and beyond, with wider applications in laptops, tablets, and cars. The company will also pursue growth with foldable and slidable displays.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next iOS 14 beta will begin forcing developers to ask for permission to track you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ck1xmBMqNbXEgXByF6K_VwzAzk4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732132/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aaqfdv"&gt;Apple’s new privacy feature requiring developers ask  for permission to track iOS users for ad targeting is at last going live in the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8rm6injj&amp;amp;1611853021"&gt;next iOS 14 beta&lt;/a&gt; with a planned full release some time this spring for non-beta users, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87OaT5"&gt;The announcement coincides with Data Privacy Day, as well as a speech on privacy from Apple CEO Tim Cook later today at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in Brussels. Apple initially planned for the feature to go live with the launch of iOS 14 last fall, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delayed its implementation to 2021&lt;/a&gt; in September of last year to give developers more time to comply. Today’s announcement narrows the launch window to “early spring,” but Apple is not commenting further on when exactly we might see it go live for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nd7oq5"&gt;Called App Tracking Transparency, the new opt-in requirement will mark a significant shift in how mobile app developers are able to collect data on iPhone owners and share that data with other firms, including data brokers, to aid in advertising. As it stands right now, Apple lets iPhone owners dig into their settings to disable this type of tracking. Now, instead of forcing users to be proactive about disabling it, Apple will demand developers ask for permission first or risk suspension or removal from the App Store if they don’t comply or try to skirt the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QVqaP8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;App Tracking Transparency will force developers to ask for permission to track iPhone users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUxx5P"&gt;The primary way advertisers are able to, say, know when you are shopping for a new hat on one app before serving you ads for that same hat on another app is that a unique identifying code, the so-called Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), is linked to your device, collected by the first app, and shared with the second. That allows those apps to serve targeted ads and to measure whether the ad actually worked, for instance if you ended up purchasing that hat you saw in an Instagram ad by clicking an ad for the company’s online store in Google Chrome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwxSJD"&gt;Apple’s new opt-in requirement will make it so developers must have express consent from iOS device owners to allow their IDFA to be collected and shared across apps. App makers can still use other information you give them for the purpose of targeting advertising even if you opt not to let the app track you, but that information cannot be shared with another company for the purpose of ad tracking under Apple’s new policy. The sharing with other third-party companies is effectively what Apple refers to when it uses the word “tracking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHsXc9"&gt;Apple intends to strictly police any attempt to get around the opt-in requirement. For instance, it says app developers will not be allowed to disable app functionality of any kind if users say no to the opt-in, and that developers will also be barred from charging money or incentivizing users with in-app perks or giveaways to sway their decision one way or the other. Any app that tries to replace the IDFA with another identifying piece of information, like an email address, will be in violation of the opt-in requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBsYIk"&gt;Apple says the rules will also apply to its own apps, and the company already lets users disable personalized advertising the company serves within the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks app using data it collects from your device. (It’s worth noting that ad personalization is not the same as ad tracking. App makers can still personalize ads based on first-party data you provide them directly, but they must honor a user’s choice not to share that data for tracking purposes.) Apple has no history of sharing the information it collects with other companies, either, and it makes that clear in its ad personalization toggle in the iOS settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgmZqk"&gt;This is expected to affect both the companies that run ad networks, like Facebook, and the companies paying for the ads, like the aforementioned unnamed hat seller. That’s precisely why Facebook has come out as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures, which include not only this new opt-in requirement but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;app privacy labels it launched on the App Store last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yKojm"&gt;Facebook has positioned itself as a champion of small businesses that risk getting hurt by this privacy change, and small businesses do rely on Facebook’s ad network and its powerful targeting tools to reach customers. Past privacy changes to Apple’s mobile Safari browser did also have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;legitimate negative consequences for ad-supported businesses&lt;/a&gt; like news websites. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is an ad-supported news website.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6AgPuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook has emerged as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jA9whl"&gt;But in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; and statements to the press, Facebook has gone a step further and cast Apple as a hypocrite trying to exempt itself from the rules it forces on other developers and as greedy for encouraging app business models that rely less on advertising and more on subscriptions, of which Apple would theoretically get a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nw5Hub"&gt;“Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on an &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-ceo-zuckerberg-says-it.html"&gt;earnings call on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “This impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world, including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes.” Zuckerberg added that, “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people but the moves clearly track their competitor interests.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYOygv"&gt;Apple has consistently defended its choice as a way to give users more freedom over their privacy and refuted Facebook’s claims it intends to hold its first-party software to different standards. The showdown has emerged as one of the largest and most visible tech company feuds in recent memory, though it’s clear now Facebook has little to no leverage in the situation despite its defensiveness and public posturing. The changes are imminent, and Facebook will be forced to comply as it was with the privacy labels last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBm6te"&gt;To further hammer home its privacy philosophy, Apple has created a new online guide it’s calling “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fprivacy%2Fdocs%2FA_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F28%2F22253366%2Fapple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A Day in the Life of Your Data”&lt;/a&gt; that breaks down common ad tracking and targeting practices in the mobile app and web industries and presents statistics on the prevalence of these practices. Apple cites a study that found the average mobile app contains six trackers that share your data with other apps, and that a “large and opaque industry has been amassing increasing amounts of personal data.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6M300o"&gt;“A complex ecosystem of websites, apps, social media companies, data brokers, and ad tech firms track users online and offline, harvesting their personal data. This data is pieced together, shared, aggregated, and monetized, fueling a $227 billion-a-year industry,” the guide reads. “This occurs every day, as people go about their daily lives, often without their knowledge or permission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTlXLA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 28th, 9:05AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified language around the differences between ad personalization and ad tracking to point out that iOS app makers can personalize ads but only using first-party data provided to them directly. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
