        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor’s new foldable, the Magic V.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRv9FC"&gt;Former Huawei sub-brand Honor has just announced its first foldable smartphone, the Honor Magic V. It uses a similar folding form factor to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold devices, combining a large internal folding display with a smaller external display that can be used while the device is folded. Today is the foldable’s Chinese launch, where its price starts at ¥9,999 (around $1,569) for its 256GB storage model. It will go on open sale on January 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puGB6W"&gt;The Magic V’s flagship feature, its internal folding screen, measures 7.9 inches from corner to corner, has a resolution of 2272 x 1984 with a refresh rate of 90Hz, and an aspect ratio of 10:9. That’s slightly bigger than Samsung’s Z Fold 3, whose internal screen is 7.6 inches with a resolution of 2208 x 1768. Honor says the Magic V’s internal screen is like using two 21:9 screens side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWMekK"&gt;The Magic V’s external screen is also slightly larger than the Z Fold 3 at 6.45 inches (compared to 6.2 for Samsung), with a resolution of 2560 x 1080, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 21:9 aspect ratio. Honor says this will help make the device more usable when you don’t want to unfold it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pqAqKnxfPipygOI4i1AW1A6XFeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158005/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_12.32.15_PM.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M4iOVM251Pj5YM_WPRwb-g8SZHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158009/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_12.29.52_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Honor&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor’s foldable, folded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jym1Eh"&gt;When folded, the Magic V measures 72.7mm wide, 14.3mm thick, and has a height of 160.4mm, and when unfolded it expands to 141.1mm wide and is 6.7mm thick. That’s slightly wider than Samsung’s latest Z Fold, while being slightly thinner overall when folded. Honor’s foldable is slightly heavier, however. It’s available in three colors: orange, silver, and black, and Honor CEO George Zhao says it should survive being folded and unfolded 200,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hr0esu"&gt;Internally, the Magic V is running Qualcomm’s latest chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, which is paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage. It’s got a 4,750mAh battery that can be charged at up to 66W, which gives you a 50 percent charge in 15 minutes. It’s 5G compatible and is running Honor’s Magic UI 6.0 software on top of Android 12, which supports the display of multiple app windows at the same time, Honor says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNoWvQ"&gt;In terms of cameras, Honor has included a trio of 50-megapixel sensors on the rear of the foldable, which include a main sensor, an ultrawide camera, and something Honor is calling a “spectrum enhanced camera.” We’ve followed up with the company for details on what exactly this third camera does. The Magic V has a pair of 42-megapixel selfie cameras, one embedded in the outer display, and one embedded in the inner folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NjOIA"&gt;Honor joins an increasingly long list of companies that have either announced or have started to sell foldable smartphones. Most recently, we saw Oppo announce its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price"&gt;Find N&lt;/a&gt; late last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Honor’s former parent company Huawei&lt;/a&gt; also have foldable devices of their own. We’ve followed up with Honor to find out if, or when, the Magic V might see a global release. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA lists 50 airports that will have 5G buffer zones ahead of C-band expansion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cell Tower" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0DUnadgi6Re0qcDz56wmLp5nbTk=/104x0:3967x2575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70364482/1234861974.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8YJChP"&gt;With AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon set to bring their 5G expansion live on January 19th, &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-5g"&gt;the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has chosen&lt;/a&gt; 50 airports (&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2022-01/50%20Airports%20with%205G%20Buffer.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) that will have buffer zones to help prevent flight disruptions (via &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-faa-details-50-airports-that-will-have-5g-buffer-zones-2022-01-08/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/faa-selects-airports-for-5g-buffer-zones-11641609361"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Safety regulators picked airports based on location, traffic volume, and the likelihood of low visibility — all factors that may increase cancelations, delays, and diversions as both carriers roll out 5G C-band service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOd3oM"&gt;As pointed out by the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, notably busy airports like Chicago O’Hare, Orlando International, Los Angeles International, and Dallas / Fort Worth International are included on the list, along with airports in locations that are often impacted by foggy conditions, such as Seattle / Tacoma International and San Francisco International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e2kesa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will turn off 5G transmitters at buffer zones for six months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4QT6vg"&gt;The FAA notes that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have agreed to turn off their 5G transmitters at these specific buffer zones for six months, which should “minimize potential 5G interference with sensitive aircraft instruments used in low-visibility landings.” Some airports — including major hubs like Hartsfield / Jackson International and Denver International — didn’t make the list, either because they aren’t in locations where 5G C-Band deployment will take place, or they can’t permit low-visibility landings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cX0Ttp"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have been itching to deploy their improved 5G service ever since they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;spent a combined $70 billion last year&lt;/a&gt; on securing chunks of the C-band spectrum, which should provide a middle ground in terms of 5G speed and coverage — something that both carriers’ 5G service is currently lacking. The two currently offer 5G service using super fast high-band millimeter wave technology that only covers small areas, as well as the low-band spectrum, which provides a lot of coverage with slow service akin to 4G LTE. T-Mobile already offers mid-band 5G service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;but it isn’t in the C-band range&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BZJsj"&gt;Both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T were originally set to switch on their 5G expansions on December 5th, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;air safety fears delayed the launch&lt;/a&gt; twice. The carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863964/faa-fcc-verizon-att-c-band-5g-airports-proposal-rejected"&gt;ended up rejecting the FAA’s request&lt;/a&gt; to delay the rollout until January 5th but later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;came to an agreement&lt;/a&gt; to turn on service on January 19th, giving the FAA additional time to account for potential flight disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QcGBwX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Samsung is showing off the foldables of the future at CES</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GABMbrADflCB0KQDm994LxD_LtI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360697/Screen_Shot_2022_01_07_at_9.27.00_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vZmPbp"&gt;Samsung is arguably leading the charge on folding phones, and even though the first Galaxy Fold got off to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938653/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-updated-android-price-specs-features-hinge"&gt;a rocky start&lt;/a&gt;, last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; were impressive devices that delivered on the promise of how handy a device with a folding screen can be. But the company isn’t stopping with those form factors; at CES 2022, it showed off a bunch of prototype folding devices that could hint at foldables to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCzqCZ"&gt;Take the Flex S, a multi-foldable device that can stretch all the way out to a triple-wide screen. Or the Flex G, a pocket-sized device that folds &lt;em&gt;inward&lt;/em&gt; to protect the screen. There’s a device with a right rail that slides out to add some screen real estate. And Samsung even showed off a 17-inch folding laptop that’s not unlike the one Asus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867624/asus-zenbook-17-fold-oled-foldable-laptop-tablet-specs-price-release-date"&gt;announced at CES&lt;/a&gt; (though Asus is promising that its device will come out this year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ90MF"&gt;There’s a lot to get excited about, and you can see Samsung’s latest foldable tech in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzdwfCZ9XKY"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApO4Tc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 10 Pro gets a better RAW mode and a wider ultrawide camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GsB40f87Eyxw1A4ckKegdYWtmGQ=/0x49:1173x831/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70357604/OnePlus_10_Pro_Black_Headshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus continues to lean into partner Hasselblad’s image tuning expertise and branding.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sraOKr"&gt;OnePlus is sharing a few more details about the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22849868/oneplus-pro-china-launch-january-11th-design"&gt;OnePlus 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a focus on camera specifications. If you were hoping for lots of hardware upgrades from this second-gen partnership with Hasselblad, it looks like you’ll have to keep waiting — with the exception of a new ultrawide, these updates are primarily software-based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKzEpi"&gt;To recap some basic camera specs that we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs"&gt;learned earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, the OnePlus 10 will offer a triple rear camera — likely the same 48-megapixel main, 50-megapixel ultrawide, and 8-megapixel telephoto configuration as last year. There’s a 32-megapixel front-facing camera, which is a significant resolution bump from the 9 and 9 Pro’s 16-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzC3Sw"&gt;A notable update is the addition of a shooting mode called RAW Plus which, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174433/apple-ios-14-3-pro-raw-iphone-12-pro-max-update-features"&gt;Apple’s ProRAW format&lt;/a&gt;, combines the benefits of computational photography and RAW image capture. The OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro offered a traditional RAW mode, so this is a nice improvement for those who want to tinker with data-rich RAW files while retaining the advanced image processing that smartphone cameras are so good at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UNir2z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vlrPdg"&gt;All three rear cameras can be used in the updated Hasselblad Pro Mode to control exposure settings and shoot 12-bit RAW files. We really liked the intuitive Pro Mode on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro, so we’re eager to check out the latest version. There’s a new manual video recording mode, too, called Movie Mode. It offers control over ISO and shutter speed as well as access to a LOG shooting format that better lends itself to post-capture color grading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1EJNZ"&gt;The 9 and 9 Pro cameras featured color tuning by Hasselblad, and OnePlus continues to lean into that aspect of the partnership. In this iteration, it combines its own (also Oppo’s own) “Billion Color Solution” and Hasselblad’s color science to bring 10-bit color to each of the phone’s three rear cameras. That should make for smoother color gradations in images — provided that you’re looking at them on a screen capable of displaying all of those colors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNmthcFuANzn8jtQlWZiFsLFHEI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23148621/OnePlus_10_Pro_150__Ultra_wide_Portrait_Watermarked.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The view from OnePlus’ new ultrawide lens is very wide indeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ek8K6j"&gt;On the hardware side, there’s a new ultrawide camera sensor with an extreme 150-degree field of view — somewhere in the ballpark of 5mm in 35mm terms. If you want to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; go for a dramatic shot, this lens can be used in combination with a new fisheye mode. For a slightly narrower view, the ultrawide offers a 110-degree mode, which is closer to the 14mm equivalent offered by the 9 and 9 Pro, and uses AI distortion correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCzpZB"&gt;There’s one more hardware change to note: it looks like OnePlus dropped the monochrome camera. This was a low-resolution chip that was included in previous models to assist when shooting black-and-white images. That was the claim, anyway. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"&gt;struggled to find it making any difference&lt;/a&gt; in monochrome images and my colleague Jon Porter has bemoaned its existence for years, describing it at turns as “baffling” and “pointless.” The renders of the 10 Pro that we’ve seen thus far show three useful-looking cameras along with a flash and nothing that looks like a little monochrome sensor in sight. If that’s the case: farewell, monochrome camera, we hardly knew what ye did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XaGyd"&gt;Outside of camera updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs"&gt;what we’ve learned about the OnePlus 10 Pro so far&lt;/a&gt; is not surprising at all. It will come with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, a 120Hz screen, and 50W wireless charging — in line with previous OnePlus flagships and checking all the “2022 Android flagship” boxes. It’s due to launch on January 11th in China with availability in other regions later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S22 lineup takes shape in unofficial leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/32zktFFnAMLjHdM6OpQD25akSMk=/0x0:1566x1044/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70353729/s22_lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, the Galaxy S22 Ultra, S22 Plus, and S22.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Unbox Therapy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAWmRy"&gt;A video from Unbox Therapy has shown off what appears to be three dummy units of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S22 series of phones, giving an early look at the design of the handsets. Although the video has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qhk3Wfc3Ps"&gt;now been delisted&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHJ34Bbu8OI"&gt;reuploaded on other channels&lt;/a&gt;, and a screenshot was &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/05/galaxy-s22-size-leak-video/"&gt;taken by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The video emerged alongside other details of the upcoming phones, including camera specs, and images of a new fast charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUhauT"&gt;This isn’t the first time footage of Galaxy S22 dummy units has leaked online. Twitter leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1470530973712498692"&gt;OnLeaks posted similar footage&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of last month. Unbox Therapy’s video appears to corroborate these previous designs, and also shows the handsets more clearly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TDpQqH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Well, OK... &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Samsung?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Samsung&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS22?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS22&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS22Plus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS22Plus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS22Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS22Ultra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dummy?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Dummy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/CD8rnHhStx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CD8rnHhStx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1470530973712498692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Do48z1"&gt;The three handsets shown in Unbox Therapy’s video are thought to be the S22 Ultra, the S22 Plus, and the regular S22, though these names may not be final. The S22 and S22 Plus appear to have similar designs to last year’s S21 devices, with camera bumps across the top left side of their backs. Both dummy units appear to have triple camera setups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWMgTH"&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xeetechcare/status/1478674235916980224"&gt;leaked spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; suggests the regular S22 will have a more compact 6.1-inch display (the S21, for reference, had a 6.2-inch display). This compares to a reported &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s22-plus-design-renders-exclusive/"&gt;6.55-inch display for the S22 Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Previous reports suggest &lt;a href="https://zouton.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s22-2021-exclusive-launch-edition-price-renders-design"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; will have a 50-megapixel main camera paired with extra ultra wide and telephoto cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cgt6ft"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;First Look at Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra / S22 Specs Sheet!   Introducing  SuperClear Lens!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/nyEFGrPtAH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nyEFGrPtAH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zaryab Khan (@xeetechcare) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xeetechcare/status/1478674235916980224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NfK032"&gt;In line with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;previous leak from last month&lt;/a&gt;, the S22 Ultra appears to have a very Galaxy Note-style design, with a squared off top and bottom and a built-in holder for an S Pen stylus. There’s also no camera bump around the phone’s reported four cameras. A leaked spec sheet suggests these will consist of a primary 108-megapixel sensor, a 12-megapixel ultrawide, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto, and a 10-megapixel 10x periscope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DsWeo"&gt;Interestingly, the spec sheet mentions that this main 108-megapixel sensor could have a lens made of “Super Clear Glass,” which appears to be branding for some kind of Gorilla Glass. In an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orxS9qJsRkY&amp;amp;t=4s"&gt;accompanying video&lt;/a&gt; to the spec sheet leak, Zaryab Khan speculates that this new lens could be designed to reduce the appearance of small bright dots that can appear in camera footage taken at night (a problem we’ve had &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/71m3SDGa220?t=760"&gt;with the iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, for example)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdi283"&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1478702640355844096"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s Roland Quandt&lt;/a&gt; has shared images of what appears to be a fast-charger for the S22 Ultra. It’s 45W and has just a single USB-C charging port, which suggests we might be looking at an increase in charging speeds compared to the 25W S21 Ultra (Samsung previously offered 45W charging on the Note 10 Plus). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U3thqf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's that 45W PD Charger for your new S22 Ultra (EP-T4510)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the pic I posted a while back for this was obviously the wrong one. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jZw8Gu4Giq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jZw8Gu4Giq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roland Quandt (@rquandt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1478702640355844096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="meDhOD"&gt;It’s currently unclear exactly when these phones might all be announced. Samsung launched the S21 series in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227561/samsung-galaxy-s21-event-news-announcements-biggest-products-unpacked"&gt;mid-January last year&lt;/a&gt;, but has typically opted for February launches for previous lineups. Given ongoing supply chain issues and a global chip shortage, it’s anyone’s guess as to when the S22 handsets may eventually make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is doing great, according to HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/StipGqIgGVVr1QwQ-4LfUd8v_Ww=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352645/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PMtWzM"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s latest subscriber figures make it seem like HBO and its sister service HBO Max are doing pretty well — great, even! In a &lt;a href="https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/atnt2/sec/sec-show.aspx?Type=html&amp;amp;FilingId=15462042&amp;amp;CIK=0000732717&amp;amp;Index=10000"&gt;regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt; this week, AT&amp;amp;T revealed that it beat its projected year-end goal with 73.8 million total subscribers between HBO and HBO Max (even after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738967/hbo-max-subscriptions-q3-2021-amazon-exit"&gt;breakup with Amazon&lt;/a&gt;). Not too bad, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83dm4C"&gt;But that win comes after a year of highly anticipated movie debuts meant to balloon subscriber numbers, and it’s still tens of millions of subscribers behind rivals like Disney Plus and Netflix. The numbers also come with some pretty big caveats. In other words, hold the applause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yogjgp"&gt;For one, AT&amp;amp;T’s figures (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/global/hbo-max-2021-subscriber-att-warnermedia-1235147025/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;) conflate two separate services — HBO, its cable business, and HBO Max, its streaming service — and they don’t distinguish how many subscribers each service has individually. WarnerMedia spokesperson Jaclyn Mandelbaum told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that more information “will be broken out in AT&amp;amp;T’s earnings in a couple weeks” but declined to specify figures for each service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CEJD0H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2021 should’ve been HBO Max’s year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AH0iOr"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s growth also looks less impressive given the high-profile content slate it served over the last year, including titles like &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;, and the third season of &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;. On top of that, HBO Max added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444063/hbo-max-ad-supported-tier-announced-pricing-release-date"&gt;lower-priced tier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278287/hbo-max-international-launch-june-2021-latin-america-europe-warnermedia-streaming"&gt;launched internationally&lt;/a&gt; partway through the year — both of which should have helped boost its subscribers substantially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VaM2I"&gt;Disney Plus added more than twice as many subscribers over a similar time period. Disney’s streaming service, which launched roughly six months before HBO Max, reported &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-earnings-for-fiscal-2021/"&gt;118.1 million paid subscribers&lt;/a&gt; as of October 2021, up from &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/disney-plus-hits-86-8-million-subscribers-1234850846/"&gt;73.7 million&lt;/a&gt; about a year earlier. HBO’s 73.8 million record, on the other hand, is only up from &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/q4_earnings_2020.html"&gt;61 million subscribers globally&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDW2u6"&gt;Streaming data is virtually impossible to tackle on a one-for-one comparison level for myriad reasons, not the least of which being that everyone is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;playing by different rules&lt;/a&gt;. That’s to say nothing of how piracy, account-sharing, and features like auto-play can significantly skew a truly accurate picture of subscriber and title success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXRAWN"&gt;Last year should’ve been HBO Max’s year to win. It’s going to have to find new ways to grow without the help of a highly anticipated day-and-date slate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HMD has five new sub-$250 Nokia phones coming to the US soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dXioUsd6x8fR5-uUDFXezX04piM=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70349795/HMD_New2022_Packshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, the Nokia 2760 Flip, C100, G400, C200, G100.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bvnagr"&gt;HMD, the company behind modern Nokia-branded phones, has announced five new “US exclusive” phones coming in the first half of this year. None of these are flagships: there’s only one 5G device, and all five are set to retail for under $250. HMD has also revived a classic Nokia design as a modern feature phone — the Nokia 2760 — a flip phone that inherits its name from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_2760"&gt;original 2007 handset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytpmPp"&gt;The company isn’t fully detailing the specs of the five phones today and says it plans to release this information closer to each handset’s launch. Instead, it’s emphasizing that the phones will be available across a wider range of US wireless providers, which now include Dish Wireless and Consumer Cellular in addition to T-Mobile and TracFone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hY2SVP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The original Nokia 2760 was released in 2007&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="czU073"&gt;In descending order of price, there’s the $239 G400, which is due for release in Q2. It’s a 5G phone with a triple rear camera array consisting of a 48-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro. Interestingly, its 6.6-inch display has a 120Hz refresh rate, which is relatively uncommon at this price point. It has a 5,000mAh battery and comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsgOp5"&gt;Then there’s the $149 G100, a 4G phone with a 6.5-inch display, 5,000mAh battery, and a fingerprint sensor built into the power button that’s also due for release in Q2. Both the G100 and G400 are part of HMD’s midrange G-series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAnGIm"&gt;HMD’s also bringing two phones to the accessible, value-focused Nokia C-series range. There’s the $99 C100 (due in Q1) and $119 C200 (releasing in Q2). The C100 has a relatively compact 5.45-inch display, a relatively low-resolution 8-megapixel rear camera, and a 3,000mAh battery. The C200 is slightly larger with a 6.1-inch display and has a bigger 4,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbvOIW"&gt;Finally, there’s the $79 Nokia 2760 Flip, a clamshell feature phone releasing in Q1. It’s running KaiOS, which offers a limited amount of smartphone-style services like Google Maps, and its focus is on durability and reliability with a target customer age of mainly 55 and above. There’s also an emergency button on its side that can be configured to call a contact and share your location, and a small external screen for notifications. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vivo launches ‘color-changing’ V23 Pro with dual-camera notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1YJxQIx9CTDImK8kNsOBLzSMtVw=/0x0:2304x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70349280/V23_Series_Lifestyle_CGI___10.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GkhF8b"&gt;Vivo has announced the V23 and V23 Pro, the latest phones in the company’s mainstream V series that sells a ton in India and other Asian countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMQbem"&gt;The most unusual feature is the Sunshine Gold model’s ‘color-changing’ exterior that apparently shifts colors completely when exposed to sunlight. Vivo says the material took two years to research and develop; if you leave it in the sun for about thirty seconds, the phone will turn to blue-green before gradually returning back to the original gold.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VUSS3HXrMnCwBE394n4QxqjPdkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146721/V23_5G_Gold.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Plot twist: these phones are both gold.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CN50eX"&gt;The other standout feature is the display’s notch that houses two selfie cameras, a 50-megapixel main unit and an 8-megapixel ultrawide on both phones. The selfie camera system also supports eye-based autofocus. The V23 Pro has a 108-megapixel main camera on the back while the V23’s is 64 megapixels; both are joined by 8-megapixel ultrawide and 2-megapixel macro sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ja5bB6"&gt;The V23 Pro’s screen is a 6.56-inch 90Hz 1080p OLED panel with curved edges. The V23, however, has a flat 6.44-inch 90Hz 1080p panel, and the sides of the phone itself are also flat, similar to an iPhone 12 or 13. The other main difference between the two phones is the processor — the V23 has a MediaTek Dimensity 920, while the V23 Pro has a Dimensity 1200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pb2sS"&gt;In India, the V23 will sell for Rs. 29,990 (~$400) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, or Rs. 34,990 (~$470) for 12GB/256GB. The V23 Pro costs Rs. 38,990 (~$520) for 8GB/128GB and Rs. 43,990 (~$590) for 12GB/256GB. The phones are also launching in countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, and will come to other markets in APAC, the Middle East, and Europe “over the next few months.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 10 Pro’s official specs are not the least bit surprising</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aECyOaqUHp_yzswqP9Z10n-wxb4=/0x0:6750x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348558/OnePlus_10_Pro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OnePlus 10 Pro | OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O5xlWi"&gt;Rather than announce all of the details of the OnePlus 10 Pro flagship, OnePlus is choosing to space out the details in drips and drabs. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22613909"&gt;First, it released an official teaser image&lt;/a&gt; that revealed the design of the phone alongside a China release date of January 11th. Now, it’s announcing the phone’s specs, which include the newest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, ultra fast charging, and a 5,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpZFls"&gt;If you’ve been keeping up on Android news the past few months, none of these details will come as a surprise. Flagship Android phones in the US all tend to feature Qualcomm’s most powerful processor and if there’s any interesting news here, it’s that OnePlus is getting a small jump on Samsung and becoming the first major smartphone to use the new chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zY2nCD"&gt;The rest of the specs are exactly what you’d probably expect. Though, unfortunately, OnePlus is still leaving out a few key details like the amount of RAM on each model, prices, precise screen sizes, and release dates outside of China. In any case, here are a few of the specs it’s revealing today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="w5kB6W"&gt;Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IMUVv3"&gt;Rear camera: 48MP + 50 MP + 8MP, Dual OIS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nUJbSy"&gt;Front camera: 32MP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O8Gz5l"&gt;Display: 120Hz “Fluid AMOLED with LTPP”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HcdE8s"&gt;Battery: 5,000mAh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MWFiwr"&gt;Wired charging: 80W SuperVOOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9uHOIw"&gt;Wireless charging: 50W AirVOOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NxpCD9"&gt;OS: OxygenOS 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ogvvID"&gt;Dimensions: 163 x 73.9 x 8.55mm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="dVNg1T"&gt;There are a few things to note in that list. Along with picking up Oppo’s operating system, the OnePlus 10 is also using Oppo’s branding for its fast-charging system. Until now OnePlus had the same system but used its own Warp Charge brand. Branding aside, the rated speeds are still ridiculously fast. The dimensions also tell us that the OnePlus 10 Pro is a very large phone, nearly the size of a Galaxy S21 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMJ3MD"&gt;As with any Android phone these days, there have been plenty of rumors to fill in the gaps. We’re expecting RAM options to either be 8GB or 12GB, with 128GB or 256GB of storage. As for the rest of the details, including a rumored April release, we’ll need to wait for OnePlus to provide more details in its next announcement — or the one after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHZOgA"&gt;Why do companies like OnePlus and Google space out the details on their new phones instead of giving us a single announcement? Your guess is as good as ours, but the obvious one is probably the right one: it gives them multiple bites at the Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon joins T-Mobile and AT&amp;T by offering a truly unlimited mobile plan</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VkTGlc"&gt;Verizon has &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/power-verizon-5g-ultra-wideband-coming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;updated its unlimited plans&lt;/a&gt; in anticipation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;new 5G spectrum coming online &lt;s&gt;tomorrow&lt;/s&gt; soonish&lt;/a&gt;. The new plans cost the same and include the same level of access to the carrier’s Nationwide and Ultra Wideband 5G networks, but the priciest Get More plan receives a notable upgrade: unlimited monthly “premium data.” That puts it on even terms with the other major carriers’ top-tier unlimited plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llbC6h"&gt;The plans previously known as Start, Play More, Do More, and Get More Unlimited are now called 5G Start Unlimited, 5G Play More Unlimited... you get the idea. The Get More plan ($90 / month for one line with autopay) previously included 50GB of premium data each month — once customers reached that limit, they’d be subject to slowdowns during times of network congestion. The new 5G Get More plan does away with that monthly cap.&lt;/p&gt;

The new 5G Get More plan also includes a boost in premium mobile hotspot data: 50GB, up from 30GB. The Play More and Do More plans now offer 30GB compared to 15GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKZTDq"&gt;One thing remains the same, though: customers on the basic Start Unlimited plan won’t have access to the faster Ultra Wideband network at all — just slower Nationwide 5G. That’s no great loss at the moment, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;when C-band joins the call&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll be a real bummer.&lt;/p&gt;
