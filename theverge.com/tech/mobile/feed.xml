    <title>Vivo finally adopts wireless charging with new X70 Pro Plus flagship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VvNw_B1RXfeUxBh1ueLvdoreV1E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838079/vivo_X70_Series_Photo_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1f8OIT"&gt;Vivo has announced the X70 series, its latest line of flagship phones. It sees the company further extend its camera partnership with renowned lens company Zeiss while refining the blueprint laid down by the X50 and X60 phones from the past year-plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfwdW3"&gt;The X70 Pro Plus is the top-of-the-line device, featuring a Snapdragon 888 Plus processor, a 6.783-inch (yes that’s the stated spec) 1440p OLED screen, and a 4,500mAh battery that uses Vivo’s 55W FlashCharge technology. More importantly, it has 50W wireless fast charging that also works with Qi. This is Vivo’s first ever phone to support wireless charging, which should make it a more viable switching option for anyone who’s already put Qi chargers all over their house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9QWaP"&gt;The X70 Pro Plus’ Zeiss-branded camera array includes a 50-megapixel main sensor, a 48-megapixel gimbal-stabilized ultrawide, a 12-megapixel telephoto, and an 8-megapixel periscope telephoto. Vivo has added three new simulated bokeh modes based on the optical characteristics of classic Zeiss glass, including Distagon, Planar, and Sonnar. The Pro Plus also has a new Vivo-designed image processor called the Imaging Chip V1 that’s designed to improve performance in noise reduction and motion compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NHxEAVX3jccigTqloEf670PS-eM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836445/vivo_X70_Pro_Photo_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XVn4nW"&gt;The X70 Pro and X70 have smaller 6.56-inch 120Hz displays, Mediatek Dimensity 1200 processors, and 44W FlashCharge — but still no wireless charging. The X70 Pro’s camera system bumps the ultrawide down to 12 megapixels, while the X70’s triple array includes a 40-megapixel primary and two 12-megapixel sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WL6CLI"&gt;Vivo hasn’t given full pricing or release information for the X70 series except to say that it’s “gradually rolling out in markets such as India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates, and more” from today. We’ll bring you more as we have it — the X70 Pro Plus in particular is looking like a compelling device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG claims its ‘Real Folding Window’ beats folding glass, will ship in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1u4QfWnyjomjhiJqSwTaxDhj11w=/16x0:835x546/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826689/lg_chem_folding_glass.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sY01G8"&gt;Bendable glass was supposed to unlock &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek"&gt;a future straight out of science fiction&lt;/a&gt;: phones that fold. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;the actual glass we got&lt;/a&gt; wound up relying on factory-installed plastic screen protectors to avoid shattering when you fold it. Now, LG wants to cut out the middleman by improving the plastic instead: the company &lt;a href="https://www.lgchem.com/company/information-center/press-release/news-detail-8713?lang=en_GLOBAL"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; its “Real Folding Window,” a cover material it claims will be as hard as glass but without the whole cracking issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ms8LSb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More PET, less glass&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GWUE2"&gt;What’s the secret? Well, LG doesn’t quite say in its press release, only that it’s a “new material” that it uses to coat both sides of a sheet of plastic film — PET film, to be precise. (PET is probably best known as the plastic in your soda bottle.) The idea is that if you apply that coating to the plastic and then apply that cover material to a flexible OLED panel, you’ll have a folding screen that lasts longer and with a less noticeable crease than today’s folding devices. LG says it should be more competitive on price, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8m2GD"&gt;In fact, LG says the coated PET should work with tablets, laptops, and rollable-screen phones, too, like the one we’re still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296298/lg-rollable-denial-not-on-hold-or-cancelled"&gt;waiting for LG to decide whether it will cancel&lt;/a&gt;. Also, it sees potential for devices where the screen folds &lt;em&gt;outward&lt;/em&gt;, not just inward like we’ve seen with Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;Moto Razr&lt;/a&gt;. LG also says it sees “significant improvements to the fold lines that occur on the folding parts of the screen.” Maybe it could unlock a lot more of the wacky folding phone designs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"&gt;we’ve seen in prototypes and patent applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vqLyt3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A field guide to the wacky future of foldable phones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"},{"title":"Folding phones are the stuff of science fiction","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DczbVu"&gt;LG’s current timeline doesn’t see it commercializing this tech until 2023, though, and it’s not clear how it’ll actually stack up to glass in other ways (like clarity) when it arrives. Samsung’s on the PET train, too; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;as we’ve written&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 3 cover their ultra-thin glass (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;technically made by German manufacturer Schott&lt;/a&gt;) with a “Stretchable PET” layer that we found far superior to the gummy screen protector Samsung had to ship on prior models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGplI1"&gt;Samsung is reportedly ramping up production of folding screens for other phone makers as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;including Google&lt;/a&gt;. And it has been reportedly &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2077"&gt;working with Corning&lt;/a&gt;, which has been building its own folding glass to compete with Schott. Having even more competition from LG is a good thing if you’re a gadget lover hoping foldable prices will come down to earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qszr7b"&gt;Even without the additional suppliers, Samsung is already pushing folders hard: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;we called Samsung’s $1,000 Galaxy Z Flip 3 “the first folding phone for normal people”&lt;/a&gt; and thought the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; was “nearly normal” as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oCeZiM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Folding glass: how, why, and the truth of Samsung’s Z Flip","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"},{"title":"Forget the Note — Samsung’s foldables are coming for the Galaxy S as well","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620397/samsung-fold-flip-future-galaxy-s-past"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FJ221J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fashion follows function: what’s next for the phone industry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 3 in Samsung’s stylish new case." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/egc6EhRtvEHgq_sa2mXeZSySdt4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807645/vpavic_210831_4739_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KsdFVb"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is a totally normal phone with One Weird Trick: it folds. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Dan Seifert explained in our full review&lt;/a&gt;, it’s the beginning of a new phase for foldables, one where buying a folding phone is something that could appeal to anybody, not just techies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6wHfV"&gt;Samsung is promoting the phone in the ways Samsung usually does, touting features and spec improvements. But it’s also doing another thing: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r75GjfTy2_w"&gt;promoting the phone as something stylish&lt;/a&gt;. A full-on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsLP5SLsUY0"&gt;music video ad with BTS&lt;/a&gt; joins online vertical video ads that are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r75GjfTy2_w"&gt;as focused on the clothing and pockets the phone fits&lt;/a&gt; in as the phone itself. In essence, it’s the latest in a long time of tech companies trying to make the case that their phones are fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MJ77E"&gt;That’s nothing new, but it’s still notable because with the Z Flip 3, it’s so &lt;em&gt;explicit.&lt;/em&gt; Sure, there’s a spec argument about how its improved pocketability is a good reason to buy the Flip, but really that’s not its central appeal. The Z Flip is interesting because it’s different and because it looks better than your average phone. And maybe, if Samsung is very lucky, the fact that it’s a flip phone could connect it to the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/y2k-style-celebrity-runway-trend"&gt;Y2K fashion trend happening right now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3urvw"&gt;The smartphone industry operates a lot like the fashion industry. Both have seasonal lineups (often in the spring and fall), both have a wide range of prices for products that do essentially the same thing, both encourage you to put a premium on a brand label, both have big communities of people who obsessively follow every trend &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an even larger group of people who couldn’t care much less, and, of course, both have entire industries of influencers and journalists whose job it is to track the changes in those industries. (Hi, welcome to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 3 in Samsung’s stylish new case." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ypeSPQ6QAiO7qCV5whpg1OnlXvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22818674/vpavic_210831_4739_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 in Samsung’s stylish new case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mYbTSA"&gt;There are plenty of other parallels to draw, but the key difference between fashion and phones is that phones have been sold on the basis of their technological progress. This year’s phone performs &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; or is faster or has some new thing it’s capable of that last year’s phone can’t do. And though there are obviously technical enhancements to clothing, usually the main reason to buy the new stuff is to stay on trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gOszr"&gt;With fashion, the impetus is to participate in what’s new and what’s &lt;em&gt;now. &lt;/em&gt;Phones have usually been about participating in &lt;em&gt;the future&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEc15H"&gt;And though I don’t think the march of technological progress in phones is going to grind to a halt, I do think that we’ve reached a point where the differences between a cheap phone and an expensive phone aren’t about basic functionality anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hk7PBO"&gt;Expensive phones are about quality and brand — sure, the camera works better, but you’re also getting a nicer screen, better materials, and whatever cachet comes with that phone’s brand. Sounds a lot like fashion, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWaSiQ"&gt;Apple has, of course, been pushing its phones as fashionable objects (or at least as stylish ones) for some time. It has the stronger brand and cultural cachet — both of which matter in fashion! But Apple’s influence and the overall technological trends have led most phones to look basically the same: big flat glass on the front and back, metal rails, camera bump. The only places for expression are the shapes of the rails and the color of the glass. Yawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uTI5YF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As the feature differences between cheap and expensive phones get smaller, brand and style will become more important differentiators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="82ET1o"&gt;Is the Z Flip 3 more stylish than other phones? That’s something I’ll leave you to decide. At minimum, it’s a phone that breaks out of the boring flat-glass-slab sameness of every other smartphone out there. That is meaningful, and it (pardon the pun) communicates something about you to the people who see it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQp9Xo"&gt;The Z Flip 3 also has many other cultural connotations. It’s a green bubble, it’s a Samsung, it’s a techy thing, it’s not common. All of these are reasons to like (or dislike) this phone, and few have anything to do with the refresh rate of its inner display (which is great, btw). The tech of the Z Flip 3 is actually boring, if I’m honest, but the phone itself is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xkVQx"&gt;What would it mean for the next iPhone or next Galaxy phone to not have any technical improvements &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; but simply look different? We already know that form factor changes drive huge sales numbers for Apple. We’ve already seen the same basic dynamic happen with the various iPods Apple cycled through year after year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaSEFQ"&gt;One more thing: like clothing, phones participate in our perception of &lt;em&gt;ourselves&lt;/em&gt;. In some cases, that can arise from the physical thing itself — but more often, it’s how you choose to use it: what apps you keep on your home screen, how often you use them, whether you let yourself get sucked in for hours on end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93oDi6"&gt;That’s one reason that cases are such a big and important business. It’s not just about protecting the phone; it’s about expression. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/14/17441686/verizon-at-t-phone-case-designer-selection-next-gen-store"&gt;Ashley Carman has written about just how big the case business is&lt;/a&gt; and how closely big carriers are following fashion trends to make cases that people will want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="SgtKea"&gt;[Helena Elicerio has] been the company’s phone case product manager for the past two years. She previously worked in fashion as a buyer-merchandiser for companies like Gap and Delia’s, where she did essentially the same job she does now — evaluating products, trend spotting, and designing — except with clothing.&lt;br&gt;“When I was in fashion, one of the things people used to always make fun of me for was that I always changed my phone cases,” she says. “I don’t think anybody tied [cases] immediately back to a fashion accessory. I have an iPhone, but it looks exactly like everyone else’s, so this is how I can show my personality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2OhzUN"&gt;This whole analysis may seem overwrought, but I think a better way to put it is under-analyzed. I’ve long believed that we do not take gadgets as seriously as we should as cultural objects. It’s tempting to say “It’s just a phone,” but I believe that’s the equivalent of saying “It’s just a jacket” or “It’s just a dress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4YhFwi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of thinking strictly about “design” with phones, it’s time to start thinking about fashion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ncxCQC"&gt;Part of the importance of clothing is what it communicates to others. But the more important part is how it makes us feel. Confident, comfortable, bold, fit, stylish, or simple: clothing is about more than simply covering our bodies. And after clothing, what other physical object is on your person every day? Why shouldn’t its features include those feelings in addition to its megapixel count? I would argue that it does but that we’re doing a bad job of talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2mR4B"&gt;I believe that when it comes to phones, we’ve been too set in a design mindset instead of a fashion mindset. We’ve accepted the idea that form must follow function but that truism doesn’t apply to clothing, not really. And as the functionality of phones ceases to be a significant differentiator, something else will take its place. If we don’t understand what that new differentiator is, why it matters, and how it operates, we’re setting ourselves up to be snowed by the companies that do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qu7eFr"&gt;Tech operates in our culture like fashion does. And when you get right down to it: clothing is also technology, just very, very old technology. The way we see ourselves is mediated — and has always been mediated — by technology. Phones are fashion and fashion is culture, and all of that is way more complicated than it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTpPIn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PxFTi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niantic admits it needs to communicate better with Pokémon Go players</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pokemon Go" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TiCSj5sU9zyrQNHl1wdX2afZbic=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804127/jbareham_160711_1134_0005_02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRurPf"&gt;Last month Niantic sparked a backlash in the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; community when it announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605874/pokemon-go-pokestop-distance-halved-us-new-zealand"&gt;reverse some of the changes&lt;/a&gt; it made last year to make the game more playable while staying at home. The company said it would set up a “task force” to figure out the best way to move forward and would announce its findings by today, September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUoay0"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22642030/niantic-pokemon-go-pandemic-interaction-distance-80-meters"&gt;announced last week&lt;/a&gt;, the first main point of action is that Niantic will keep the 80-meter interaction distance for pokéstops and gyms everywhere around the world, after first saying it’d revert to the pre-pandemic 40-meter distance first in the US and New Zealand. Niantic now says it realizes that altering mechanics like this in a real-time, region-specific manner is impractical, and will apply features in the same way across the globe going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CqScUa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We went through a rough learning experience.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qmcMo1"&gt;“We went through a rough learning experience recently when we had to adjust the game settings for New Zealand quickly in response to their lockdown,” executive producer Steve Wang says in a statement. “This experience taught us that we are not going to be able to effectively adjust the experience on a country-by-country basis in real-time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgCYzC"&gt;Wang says that while the increased interaction distance will stay, the team still believes that discovering things in the real world is an important part of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; and plans to “develop new ways that motivate and reward Trainers for exploring and exercising in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWMetl"&gt;The other main finding of the task force was that Niantic “has a lot of room to grow when it comes to communication with our players.” To that end, the company says it’ll post bi-monthly developer diaries to “share the latest priorities, events, and features,” and will engage in “regular conversations with community leaders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kXUWa"&gt;Niantic isn’t giving a whole lot of new, concrete information here, but it’s quite unusual for a gaming company to call itself out like this. What will ultimately matter most, of course, is how it handles similar situations in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Midrange Samsung Galaxy S21 FE appears again in leaked manual</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pZZyie-EG6IUu6-eJO8tlaTIF0E=/1x0:1147x764/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801948/msedge_cwyTkgz4Rn.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render of the unannounced phone from the leaked manual.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-5g-user-manual-makes-no-mention-of-microsd-slot/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_CNo4aG0QZ2u7M8IsX0IwJps0YlMeItRJH4K0Ll1_CzQ-1630443096-0-gqNtZGzNArujcnBszQ0l" target="_blank"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qYtVdr"&gt;A user manual for Samsung’s Galaxy S21 FE (aka “Fan Edition”) has been &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-5g-user-manual-makes-no-mention-of-microsd-slot/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_CNo4aG0QZ2u7M8IsX0IwJps0YlMeItRJH4K0Ll1_CzQ-1630443096-0-gqNtZGzNArujcnBszQ0l"&gt;published online by &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, giving us another look at the unannounced midrange counterpart to the company’s Galaxy S21 flagship. As you’d expect from a manual, the document spends more time outlining how to use the phone than it does describing its specs, but it’s a guide for what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHbW9V"&gt;For starters, images included in the manual appear to confirm that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1400945475558199298"&gt;previously leaked renders&lt;/a&gt; are accurate. That means we’re looking at a similar design to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt;, albeit seemingly with a less premium finish. Three cameras are shown on the S21 FE’s rear while on the front there’s an in-display fingerprint scanner and a hole-punch notch for a selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-XbCbJJT3RrrhDqLSUVxy0rvuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819522/msedge_K8x7I5KuYH.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One section of the manual describe’s the phone’s reverse wireless charging feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9wSAPz"&gt;Other details mentioned in the manual include an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, an ultra-wide camera, and support for Samsung’s Wireless DeX software to allow the phone to mirror its display to supported TVs and use its screen as a touchpad. There’s no sign of a headphone jack, microSD card slot (which appeared on last year’s S20 FE), or an included charging brick in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncznlI"&gt;In terms of specs, &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; notes that previous rumors claim the phone will be powered by a Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 processor depending on the market, which would put it roughly in line with the Galaxy S21 flagship from earlier this year. Its battery is expected to have a capacity of 4,500mAh, with support for 25W fast charging and reverse wireless charging also mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2SlIL"&gt;The question now is when, if ever, we might see the phone officially announced. Earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;Samsung was forced to deny reports&lt;/a&gt; that it had cancelled production of the unannounced phone due to production difficulties caused by the global chip shortage. The emergence of a user manual suggests the phone will see an official release, though it doesn’t outright confirm it. For reference, last year’s Galaxy S20 FE was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451701/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-price-release-date-specs-features"&gt;announced on September 23rd&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of its release on October 2nd, suggesting we might not have long to wait to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Retailer leak suggests Google’s Pixel 6 will have 23W wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-qv5vUzcehk_Pc9n9yiH5-Y2z1M=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69800616/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tELnPI"&gt;Google may be working on a new wireless charging stand for its Pixel phones, according to a leaked image of a retail inventory backend mentioning a “Google Pixel 23W WL Stand” &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/31/exclusive-googles-new-pixel-stand-for-the-pixel-6-should-support-23w-fast-wireless-charging/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The name suggests the charger could support 23W wireless charging, and if Google does end up releasing this stand, it seems likely that the upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro would support 23W charging as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lW-ybK-aHCSF8Z4WcoegbJT7GoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22818317/Pixel_Stand_23W_668x445.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/31/exclusive-googles-new-pixel-stand-for-the-pixel-6-should-support-23w-fast-wireless-charging/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Android Police’s&lt;em&gt; image seemingly revealing the existence of a new Pixel Stand.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CiWQpx"&gt;That wireless charging speed, if accurate, would be more than the iPhone 12’s maximum 15W wireless charging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514850/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging-speed"&gt;with a MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt; and surpass the 10W wireless charging offered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17941176/google-pixel-stand-wireless-charger-announcement-price-release-date"&gt;by the original Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt; (which is still available on &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_stand?hl=en-US"&gt;Google’s online store&lt;/a&gt;). Google hasn’t replied to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEe95k"&gt;The company revealed the first details about the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;earlier in August&lt;/a&gt;. They seem like promising devices, especially with their new Google-designed Tensor system on a chip, and 23W wireless charging could make them an even more enticing purchase. Google plans to release those phones this fall, and if this new charging stand is real, it seems likely it will come out alongside them — especially since the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628702/google-pixel-6-charger-not-included"&gt;won’t ship with an included charging brick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung adds new foldable features to its older Z Fold and Z Flip phones with One UI 3.1.1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buD9WNxv5g64Fx49Rs1fERJ5Kw0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798834/vpavic_200907_4181_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="osL0Cu"&gt;Samsung’s new Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 phones add a bunch of clever new features designed for foldable phones as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/featurestories/samsungs-one-ui-3.1.1-bring-next-level-foldable-experiences-to-galaxy-z-series-users"&gt;One UI 3.1.1 update&lt;/a&gt;, but if you already own a Fold 2, Z Flip, or even the original Galaxy Fold, you’ll still be able to get some of the new additions without shelling out for a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PUS8kAXRx8uLumDtDMpWnUamNkw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817418/Screen_Shot_2021_08_31_at_12.32.22_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GLFk6Z"&gt;Available on all five foldable models is the new Drag and Split feature, which — as the name implies — allows you to tap and drag on a link to open it side by side with the original webpage or message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWWtZP"&gt;Samsung’s larger Fold models will also be getting the adjustable app windows for its multitasking mode, allowing you to adjust the height and width of the individual apps when you have multiple apps open at once. The older models will also get the automatically rotating app function, custom aspect ratios, and a newly added split view for messaging apps. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hlnuZ_QEOjBJus5XCBqAGI6Zts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817410/Untitled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TyEcbMre1ZTAoCPORr58VsZ6uDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817412/04_Set_Aspect_Ratio_for_Apps.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1Emj4"&gt;Lastly, for both the Z Fold 2 and the earlier Z Flips, Samsung is adding the option to force apps to use its “Flex mode” that puts video content on one half of a folded display, with playback controls on the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E41n3o"&gt;Samsung has worked to help keep its older foldables relevant even while rolling out new software features on its newer devices before. It offered a similar update for the original Fold last year when it released the Galaxy Z Fold 2 that added several new features it had introduced with the second-generation foldable. It’s a testament to how new the foldable field is in general. Samsung is still figuring out the best ways to use these new form factors, but it’s also not leaving behind early adopters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YmwIP"&gt;The One UI 3.1.1 update should be rolling out to Fold 2 and Z Flip owners starting today, while the original Galaxy Fold is expected to get the update “around a week later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGwFMQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcBvah"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new Z Flip and Z Fold get battery-protection feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TlX0XDeaSythk3kZHm40Zlpm27w=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69796778/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Flip 3. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rfgWFP"&gt;The Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 have inherited a battery protection that was previously exclusive to Samsung’s tablets, which when enabled is designed to maximize the lifespan of batteries, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-3-and-z-flip-3-have-tablet-like-battery-protection-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The “Protect battery” feature limits the devices’ charge level to 85 percent, preventing the full charge to 100 percent that’s believed to wear down batteries over years of use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFdn3B"&gt;The feature, which is available in the Settings app under Device Care &amp;gt; Battery &amp;gt; More battery settings, comes with the obvious trade-off of limiting the max battery life you’ll get out of either phone per charge. In our reviews we noted that both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; average around a day of battery life by default, which means you might have to commit to a midday top-up if you’re only charging to 85 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GAIxMTE82Jpdst1iupx3VlQSDWQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22816692/Screenshot_20210830_123117_Device_care.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Protect battery feature in the Samsung Settings app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bMDNAs"&gt;That might be a price worth paying if you want to get as many years of use as possible out of the pricey flagship phones, especially considering the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum#:~:text=Is%20all,custom%20glue."&gt;difficulty of repairing either device&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0S0Jug"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; notes that this isn’t the first time Samsung has included the Protect battery feature on its devices. But this is the first time it’s appeared on one of the company’s phones. The feature is available with One UI 3.1.1 on the two foldables, but reportedly hasn’t appeared on its other smartphones &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s10-s20-note-10-note-20-get-one-ui-3-1-1-updates/"&gt;with the same update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjCLaj"&gt;Other smartphone manufacturers already offer similar battery protection features. However, while Samsung’s feature won’t ever let a device’s battery charge beyond 85 percent, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210512"&gt;Apple’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054830/oneplus-optimized-charging-battery-overnight-overcharging-percentage"&gt;OnePlus’s&lt;/a&gt; equivalent features only temporarily limit their charging levels to 80 percent, before aiming to top up their batteries to 100 percent just before they’re unplugged to limit the time spent fully charged.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile CEO calls latest data breach ‘humbling,’ claims it’s committed to security</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="T-Mobile Kicks Off $3 Billion Bond Sale To Buy 5G Spectrum" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2V0H5We63VdhnL-hKeUivSOYQgw=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69788941/1231755320.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2NwJ4"&gt;A recent T-Mobile data breach &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;coughed up the information of more than 50 million people&lt;/a&gt;, including some who aren’t current customers or never were. The 21-year-old hacker who says they’re responsible for the attack already did &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105"&gt;an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; calling its security “awful,” and now CEO Mike Sievert is speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zn26vr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is T-Mobile’s fifth incident in four years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17ezIQ"&gt;Sievert says he’s taking a moment to update us now that the breach is contained and the investigation is “substantially complete.” “Keeping our customers’ data safe is a responsibility we take incredibly seriously and preventing this type of event from happening has always been a top priority of ours,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fcyberattack-against-tmobile-and-our-customers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;he writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBxgkw"&gt;It’s true that these attacks happen to many companies, but it’s hard to take the statement as sincere when T-Mobile has had at least five breaches since 2018. That includes this one, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security"&gt;two in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, plus one each for 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAdfgU"&gt;To do something about it, T-Mobile is partnering with cybersecurity firm Mandiant and consultants at KPMG to tighten things up. Will that put an end to this ridiculous streak of insecurity? No one can know, but that’s more than the “sorry for any inconvenience” notes released &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcustomers%2F6305378821&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcustomers%2F6305378822&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of the past breaches, and of course, all the subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637797/tmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans"&gt;got a free year of Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Too bad it’s only happening after a hacker made off with enough IMEI/IMSI, driver’s license, and social security data to spend the next few years stealing identities and phone numbers at will.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There’s a tiny tube amp in this super pricey Astell &amp; Kern music player</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qj4Sdc"&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern’s latest portable music player is as high-tech as it is extravagantly expensive. &lt;a href="http://aknewsroom.armourhome.co.uk/2021/08/27/astellkerns-latest-aultima-sp2000t-portable-digital-audio-player-packs-a-next-gen-triple-amp-system/"&gt;The $2,399 A&amp;amp;ultima SP2000T&lt;/a&gt; releases in October, and it stands out from the brand’s previous models like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/8/15752152/astell-kern-kann-review-audiophile-pmp"&gt;Kann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18518150/astell-kern-kann-cube-audiophile-pmp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Kann Cube&lt;/a&gt; with a new triple amp system. These things are never affordable, and the price might seem especially out there if you’re content with listening to music from a streaming service on your phone. But there’s some real engineering swagger in effect here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoQaKO"&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern managed to fit a tiny tube amp inside of this device. Specifically, it uses &lt;a href="https://korgnutube.com/en/"&gt;a Korg Nutube 6P1&lt;/a&gt;, which conceptually operates just like larger tube amps, only it’s small enough to fit in a device that can go in your pocket. To avoid any interference that the resonance of the tubes might generate, Astell &amp;amp; Kern says it developed a modular structure on the PCB just for the tubes, fixing them with silicone to minimize vibrations. The best part of the press release is that it says its design “uses magnetic forces to float the amp in the air to reduce internal noise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFeiKo"&gt;Audiophiles reading this have every right to be skeptical that Astell &amp;amp; Kern can reproduce the effect of a tube amp with such minuscule hardware, but it at least deserves some credit for trying. Check it out in action below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_lqdmIZNEYjqezZgxbkSgzwPqMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22809604/astellandkern7.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fe5okP"&gt;When you’re using the A&amp;amp;ultima SP2000T, it’ll let you switch between its OP-AMP setting for “ultra-clarity and a dynamic playback,” the tube amp mode for a “uniquely warm” sound, and a hybrid mode that blends the best of both modes into one. Additionally, this model has an ESS ES9068AS quad DAC for further enhancing the way your music sounds. This is apparently Astell &amp;amp; Kern’s first player to feature a quad DAC, as well as the Replay Gain utility, which adjusts the volume of all of your music (up to 24-bit / 192kHz) to the same level, so one song isn’t quieter than the other. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Astell &amp;amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tUwgXcceOaZDdFuE7MPxTLt_rMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22809612/akultima.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Astell &amp;amp; Kern&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yFN7nK"&gt;Now, for some specs. The player is compatible with 2.5mm, 3.5mm, and 44.mm plugs. It has a five-inch 1080p touchscreen, which might be the least impressive thing about it. You can charge it and transfer files via its USB-C port. It’s also Wi-Fi ready, supporting the company’s AK File Drop utility that lets you transfer files wirelessly via PC, phone, or even an FTP on the same network. You’ll obviously get the best sound quality with a set of high-end, wired headphones or earphones, but it also supports Bluetooth 5.0 with 24-bit aptX HD and LDAC codec support. Lastly, it has 256GB of flash storage built in, but it supports up to 1TB via microSD. It has a 4,200mAh battery, which the company says will get you about nine hours of FLAC playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfGcDP"&gt;For people with the sort of budget that allows this kind of purchase, this seems like something you may want to try before you buy. It’s possible that Astell &amp;amp; Kern created something great that defies its pocket-sized stature, but it’s just as likely that this has some overly ambitious first-gen quirks to iron out. You’ll be able to find out yourself when it releases in October.&lt;/p&gt;
