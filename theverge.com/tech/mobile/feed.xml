    <title>AT&amp;T spins out DirecTV as a $16B company, a quarter of what it paid in 2015</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qcUNkMMrtzKhjg0-UgELFsKl6xo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876637/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="keg3YK"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T today announced plans to spin out its various video businesses — DirecTV, AT&amp;amp;T TV, and U-Verse — into a new company that it will jointly control with TPG Capital. The deal sees AT&amp;amp;T holding on to a 70 percent stake in the company, with TPG getting the other 30. “The transaction to separate AT&amp;amp;T’s US video business into New DirecTV implies an enterprise value for the new company of $16.25 billion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1gjto"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T paid a total of $67 billion to buy DirecTV: it landed the satellite provider &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/18/5727276/att-acquires-directv"&gt;for $48.5 billion in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest was debt that AT&amp;amp;T took on. With this “premium new video entity” valued at less than a quarter of that, you can see how just how badly the original mega-acquisition has fared. “We certainly didn’t expect this outcome when we closed the DirecTV acquisition in 2015,” AT&amp;amp;T John Stankey said on a call with analysts and investors after the news was made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPdvuQ"&gt;The deal for this new company, which will be led by AT&amp;amp;T US video boss Bill Morrow, is expected to close in the second half of 2021. AT&amp;amp;T will net $7.8 billion as part of the pact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AHRlOq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AT&amp;amp;amp;T tried to buy out the streaming wars — and customers are paying for it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21115181/att-direct-tv-time-warner-acquisition-debt-streaming-wars"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GbwZay"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says that all content deals — including NFL Sunday Ticket — will move along to the “new” DirecTV. The company is also insisting that its WarnerMedia channels like CNN, TBS, and TNT will remain a core part of the video properties. “Customers aren’t going to see a change” in bundles or programming in the near term, Stankey said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24mN8c"&gt;Activist investors have long urged AT&amp;amp;T to deal with its DirecTV problem; Elliott Management has said the transaction produced “damaging results.” DirecTV’s business has continued to suffer declining subscribers as consumers have shifted en masse to streaming entertainment. But AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20747190/directv-now-rebrand-att-tv-streaming-app"&gt;deeply confusing branding choices&lt;/a&gt; for its video services hasn’t helped matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3RBdH"&gt;“Today’s announcement lines up with the evolution of our business,” Stankey said on the call. “We’re coming off a year where we saw strong wireless subscriber growth,” Stankey said, and he also called HBO Max “an important part of our future.” Stankey added that AT&amp;amp;T examined “every possibility under the sun” for what to do with its video assets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter planning a feature to let you auto-block and mute abusive accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yMhBh6q_mT1LeR1BX2CSpVlLSMc=/0x83:1898x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875042/twitter_auto_block.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter safety mode mockup. | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dgZp9v"&gt;Twitter plans to introduce a way for you to automatically block and mute abusive accounts, the company announced at its Analyst Day presentation on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6TFyA"&gt;It appears the feature will be a toggle you can turn on in a new “safety mode,” according to a slide in the &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_presentations/Analyst_Day_2021/3_AnalystDay2021_Kayvon-Dantley.pdf"&gt;Analyst Day slide deck&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s Twitter’s description of how the toggle will work if you flip it on: “Automatically block accounts that appear to break the Twitter Rules, and mute accounts that might be using insults, name-calling, strong language, or hateful remarks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bi2JPu"&gt;With the new safety mode, Twitter will automatically detect accounts that “might be acting abusive or spammy” and limit how those accounts can engage with your content for seven days, according to the slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsNNmW"&gt;We’ve asked Twitter for more information about the new features and will update this article with anything we hear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3xAsg"&gt;Twitter has historically struggled with abuse on its platform and has released a number of features over the years to help reduce offensive content, such as letting people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20874847/twitter-feature-launch-us-japan-rollout-hide-replies"&gt;hide replies&lt;/a&gt; and letting users control &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362514/twitter-reply-limiting-features-all-users-harassment-rollout-available-now"&gt;who can reply to an individual tweet&lt;/a&gt;. The company also has some automated tools in place to remove abusive tweets, and it said in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20929290/twitter-abusive-tweets-automated-removal-earnings-q3-2019"&gt;that it removes&lt;/a&gt; more than 50 percent of abusive tweets before users report them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG: New State is a futuristic new battle royale game for Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FG35rvlSegFMS6_TcQniVYhW-0w=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68871803/PUBG_NEW_STATE_Key_Art_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t2yXxQ"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; universe is expanding with a new mobile title for iOS and Android called &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State, &lt;/em&gt;which catapults the battle royale ahead in time for a more futuristic take on the massive multiplayer genre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRcioC"&gt;Set in 2051, &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt; takes place years after the current &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; games (which are set in approximately modern times) on a new map called Troi and promises to bring with it a slew of near-future weapons and vehicles, like drones and deployable combat shields. Based on the early images, it’s a similar vibe to fellow shooter &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s semi-futuristic military tech from games like &lt;em&gt;Black Ops 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJD19c"&gt;The new game is also set to dive deeper into the &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/"&gt;lore of the overall &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; universe&lt;/a&gt;, which is apparently a thing that surprisingly exists for a game whose most notable cultural signifier is the use of a cast-iron skillet as a weapon. What the time jump will mean for beloved &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; characters like &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/en/character/lunchmeat"&gt;Lunchmeat&lt;/a&gt;, though, will have to wait for the game’s release. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVi79IthSp1c0u7cD0MoZHZZuoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326840/PUBG_NEW_STATE_Screenshot_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kSJ0pM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; also promises to shake up the formula for &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; games, with in-game weapon customization options that will allow players to modify their weapons within a match in a way that sounds similar to &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;’ weapon attachments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCeBU6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; marks the third battle royale game under the &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; umbrella — although, unlike its mobile cousin &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt; will be developed by PUBG Studio, the company behind &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, the PC and console version of the original game. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21399585/pubg-mobile-update-esports-tournament-2-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; is actually a separate title&lt;/a&gt; developed by Chinese tech giant Tencent.) And despite the mobile nature of the title, PUBG Studio is making big promises of “ultra-realistic graphics that push the limits of mobile gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccKBKW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State &lt;/em&gt;will be available on Android and iOS later in 2021, with alpha tests also set for later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6FdkD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niantic permabanned a million cheaters since the start of 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IAIHap2RcPU4L-zQ6OvV48cmIcA=/0x44:841x605/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870246/Qto1N_hg.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rPYazP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;creator&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Niantic &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/cheatingupdate-022321"&gt;has published a blog post&lt;/a&gt; detailing some of its anti-cheat efforts, and it seems the company has been busy. Since the start of 2020, Niantic has issued over 5 million “punishments” to players caught cheating, with over 20 percent of those being permabans. Doing the math, that’s over a million people who have gotten the boot in just over a year. This includes bans from &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6pOfy"&gt;The post did contain some encouraging news about the player base: apparently over 90 percent of people stopped cheating after they received their first warning. That’s a wonderful thing to hear, because it’s relatable; I also like to live just on the edge until someone tells me to knock it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ci9eY5"&gt;While it looks like 2020 was a bad year for people trying to cheat at &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, it was also rough for Niantic, as it tried to figure out how to adapt its games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22189424/pokemon-go-covid-2020-safety"&gt;which are all based on going outside and walking around&lt;/a&gt;, to a locked-down world. The developer had to make adjustments, not just to its anti-cheat software, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178230/pokemon-go-coronavirus-niantic-updates-temporary-discounts-inside"&gt;to the mechanics of the games as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and AT&amp;T just spent almost $70 billion on spectrum to improve their 5G networks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Bs9FQcNFugaRY6eJ7o9M0O050g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870113/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oxXD2Q"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-announces-winning-bidders-c-band-auction"&gt;much-anticipated results&lt;/a&gt; of the FCC’s Auction 107 are in, with Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T spending big as anticipated on the coveted C-band spectrum. Verizon in particular spent nearly twice as much as AT&amp;amp;T, with a total spend of $45.4 billion. AT&amp;amp;T’s total bid adds up to $23.4 billion. T-Mobile is in a distant third at $9.3 billion, which was also expected thanks to the strong midband spectrum holdings that the company already had following its acquisition of Sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGtcsG"&gt;There’s nothing outright surprising here: we’ve known for a while that the total bidding added up to &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/c-band-clock-phase-auction-tops-charts-80-9b"&gt;over $80 billion&lt;/a&gt;, and that Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T in particular would be the top bidders. Those two carriers’ nationwide 5G networks currently rely on narrower low-band frequencies that offer speeds not much greater than 4G LTE — and extremely fast millimeter wave frequencies that face significant coverage challenges. If there’s any surprise here, it’s just how much more Verizon spent than AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ottI2"&gt;What remains to be seen is if the new spectrum will help either carrier catch up to T-Mobile. &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/verizon-wont-catch-t-mobile-with-c-band---analysts/d/d-id/767264"&gt;Some analysts&lt;/a&gt; don’t think it will. In any case, the new frequencies won’t become available until the end of the year at the earliest, and even then, they will be available in limited locations first.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will match Google’s $1 billion news investment after Australia showdown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHo09DKZBQZKKO5MM6xiH9I43-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868185/mdoying_180411_2400_0130still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eAjQQQ"&gt;Facebook said it plans to invest an additional $1 billion in the news industry over the next three years as a sign of commitment to journalism, following the company’s unprecedented showdown with the government of Australia that involved briefly disabling the ability to read and share news for Australian Facebook users and publishers. The announcement was made as part of a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/the-real-story-of-what-happened-with-news-on-facebook-in-australia/"&gt;blog post from global policy chief Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt; published on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wa0Ym4"&gt;“Facebook is more than willing to partner with news publishers. We absolutely recognize quality journalism is at the heart of how open societies function — informing and empowering citizens and holding the powerful to account,” Clegg writes. “That’s why we’ve invested $600 million since 2018 to support the news industry, and plan at least $1 billion more over the next three years.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yibvQ"&gt;The commitment matches the one Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase/"&gt;made in October of last year&lt;/a&gt;, when the search giant announced it would start paying publishers to create specialized versions of stories and other forms of news content for its Google News Showcase platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sGD8b0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We absolutely recognize quality journalism is at the heart of how open societies function.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ES15xZ"&gt;Notable in this scenario, however, is the way both Facebook and Google reacted to the impending Australian media bargaining legislation that prompted such visceral reactions from the Silicon Valley titans. The law would have forced both companies to the negotiating table with news publishers to hammer out deals for paying for news content to be shared on both the main Facebook app and Google search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUNcaV"&gt;While Google initially threatened to shut off its services in the country, it eventually blinked in the negotiating stage and began &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/google-and-news-corp-strike-deal-as-australia-pushes-platforms-to-pay-for-news.html"&gt;cutting deals with media partners like Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook, on the other hand, did in fact shut off a portion of its service in Australia, in the form of disabling the sharing and reading of news links from both users and publishers for a brief few days starting last week. Facebook then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296778/facebook-ends-australian-news-ban-bargaining-code-google"&gt;reached an agreement&lt;/a&gt; with the Australian government earlier this week and restored the country’s access to news on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcnwoO"&gt;According to Clegg, the company feels the proposed media bargaining law as it was designed prior to the recent compromise was unfair, mainly because it would put too much power in the hands of media conglomerates like Murdoch’s to extract ever-higher payments through a forced negotiation process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3S97G"&gt;“At the heart of it, in Facebook’s view, is a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between Facebook and news publishers. It’s the publishers themselves who choose to share their stories on social media, or make them available to be shared by others, because they get value from doing so,” Clegg argues. “Facebook would have been forced to pay potentially unlimited amounts of money to multi-national media conglomerates under an arbitration system that deliberately misdescribes the relationship between publishers and Facebook — without even so much as a guarantee that it is used to pay for journalism, let alone support smaller publishers.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PGxlu"&gt;Facebook is now free to negotiate deals with news publishers for its Facebook News platform without the fear of forced arbitration, and Clegg says it plans to do that in Australia as it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248814/facebook-news-uk-launch-articles-tab-curated"&gt;currently doing in the UK, the US, and other markets&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook also retains the right to restrict news content for Australian publishers and users as it did last week, but the company has signaled it has no intent to do so if future negotiations remain in good faith. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="azC2BE"&gt;T-Mobile created a lot of buzz this week when it announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;bringing back an unlimited plan&lt;/a&gt; without data throttling. In the age of data caps and deprioritization, that seems like a pretty nice deal — and it might be. But as always, there’s more at play here than T-Mobile just offering a better unlimited plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRP5Eu"&gt;T-Mobile says its new plan, Magenta Max, is truly unlimited. It includes 4K video streaming and high-speed data without deprioritization, where all other “unlimited” plans impose slowdowns once a user hits certain thresholds. T-Mobile chief marketing officer Matt Staneff confirmed in a call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; yesterday that there are no strings attached to the deprioritization bit — it’s all-you-can-eat 5G data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RISIqI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile says its new plan, Magenta Max, is truly unlimited&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zTYmnm"&gt;There is one string to be aware of, though. There is a 40GB cap on tethering, after which customers will get 3G data. But T-Mobile insists there’s no other funny business. For example, there are no limits on 4K video streaming, provided the streaming service you’re using offers it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9wdiI"&gt;That’s notable because, according to the carriers, data deprioritization was imposed out of necessity to maintain network performance. Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/12/14592822/verizon-unlimited-data-plan-announced-2017"&gt;reintroduced unlimited data plans&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16181362/verizon-new-unlimited-data-plan-video-throttling-net-neutrality"&gt;shortly after, it imposed&lt;/a&gt; video quality limits and data deprioritization. In so many words, Verizon claimed this move was necessary because the network couldn’t handle the added congestion of unlimited subscribers. It wasn’t alone: throttling and reduced streaming video quality were standard practices across all major carriers at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T8uDjG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Let’s remember why T-Mobile has all of that sweet, sweet mid-band spectrum: Sprint&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GOrgtW"&gt;So how can T-Mobile afford to offer truly unlimited data now? According to the company, the difference is 5G. Specifically, the mid-band frequencies that T-Mobile uses for much of its 5G network allow for higher data capacities than 4G and are more robust than the narrow low-band frequencies Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T rely on for their nationwide 5G coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLE3N8"&gt;But let’s remember why T-Mobile has all of that sweet, sweet mid-band spectrum: Sprint. The acquisition gave T-Mobile access to Sprint’s network, but it also effectively cut major wireless carrier options in the US from four to three. A federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132924/tmobile-sprint-merger-approved-federal-court-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;allowed T-Mobile to go ahead with the deal&lt;/a&gt;, but under certain terms, that would help boost competition and (hopefully) consumer choice in other ways. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sprint / T-Mobile" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-InIUQ-LGioMTtAPRzCh4DYJ40w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9568273/IMG_20171025_120004_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s strong 5G network is due to its acquisition of Sprint last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Izcydv"&gt;T-Mobile’s follow-through on those conditions has been a mixed bag. It did as promised by spinning off Sprint’s prepaid Boost Mobile business and selling it to Dish Network. Dish was allowed to lease T-Mobile’s network as an MVNO while it builds its own 5G offerings, another part of the deal. The good news is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;Dish looks to be serious&lt;/a&gt; about bringing its network online soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uj08h"&gt;The bad news is Dish’s current wireless business &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/dish-sheds-363k-wireless-subs-warns-t-mobile-3g-shutdown"&gt;looks a little shaky right now&lt;/a&gt; and could face further setbacks if T-Mobile moves ahead with its 3G CDMA shutdown early next year, which many of Dish’s customers currently use. While that doesn’t technically violate the terms of the agreement, Dish chairman and co-founder Charlie Ergen &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/open-ran/dish-to-launch-5g-in-major-city-by-end-of-q3-/d/d-id/767565"&gt;called it an “anti-competitive” move&lt;/a&gt; that would clearly benefit T-Mobile and harm Dish’s efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTaUYh"&gt;So while T-Mobile’s unlimited plan is undoubtedly good for customers who sign up for it, the deal that made it possible might have weakened the US cellular industry as a whole. It’s possible, though, that we may see other benefits from T-Mobile offering this plan as it might put pressure on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T to follow suit. It wouldn’t be the first time the self-named Uncarrier pushed the more established companies to expand their offerings. (See also: the return of unlimited plans several years ago.) We’ve asked AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon for comment and will update this article if we receive information from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TMDSOq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile has extra incentive to attract new customers in the short term&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dv6Dk0"&gt;Another reason T-Mobile may be offering this plan now is to take advantage of its comparatively strong 5G performance before AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon get their hands on more mid-band spectrum as a result of the &lt;a href="https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction107"&gt;recently concluded C-band auction&lt;/a&gt;. It won’t be until the end of this year or early 2022 that their customers will start seeing the benefits of the additional frequencies, so T-Mobile has extra incentive to attract new customers in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdPax2"&gt;It’s also likely that the specifics of the plan will shift as the market and networks change. Wireless plans are notoriously complicated, and carriers will continue to change them when it makes good business sense to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AON4wV"&gt;So what’s a phone plan shopper to do? The best bet might be to jump on a good deal like this while it’s around if it makes sense for you and / or your family. Existing subscribers are often grandfathered in when plans inevitably change and may get to hang on to some of the benefits. Carriers are going to look out for their bottom line, so it’s a good idea to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTixTZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung now lets you return a new Galaxy Z Fold 2 or Z Flip foldable after 100 days</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUiqDAVQreHNadozWuHKui33ck4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68863967/vpavic_200907_4181_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gtd5Xt"&gt;Samsung is extending the return period for its newest foldable phones to 100 days, the company announced on Tuesday. That means buyers of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G and Z Flip 5G can purchase either device, use it for more than three months, and return it for a full refund. Samsung is calling this new program “Buy and Try,” and it’s the first time the company has launched a return initiative as generous as this for its mobile phones. The prior return window was 15 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJTHTD"&gt;“This new initiative will help consumers try and see if a foldable device is right for them, as part of Samsung’s commitment to making foldable devices more accessible for everyone,” a Samsung spokesperson said in a statement. Samsung says the program is launching today for purchases of either device made through its website and will run until April 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUTGlw"&gt;The Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G&lt;/a&gt; is technically the fourth iteration of the company’s foldable line, and it released last fall as a vastly improved version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938653/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-updated-android-price-specs-features-hinge"&gt;original (and severely flawed) Galaxy Fold&lt;/a&gt;. It costs $1,999.99, though Samsung is &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold2-5g/buy/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling the device on its website for $1,499.99&lt;/a&gt; with an eligible trade-in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLIyhF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 5G&lt;/a&gt; is Samsung’s third take on a foldable phone. Following a discount, it now retails for $1,199.99, though Samsung says you can &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-z-flip/buy/?link=galaxy-z-flip-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get one for as cheap as $649.99 with an eligible trade-in&lt;/a&gt;. Both store pages for the devices on Samsung’s website carry notices of the new 100-day return offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWc7tP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new partnership aims to improve haptic feedback on Android devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Qualcomm Lofelt" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NDLypBfVTwnmXPYkTS4tEVU9_s0=/69x0:807x492/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68862616/0_66eU5_KB84vIXV7A.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LLRmGy"&gt;Haptic feedback on Android phones running the Snapdragon 888 chipset might get noticeably better starting in the second half of 2021. Qualcomm recently announced (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/23/qualcomm-and-lofelt-join-forces-with-aim-to-improve-android-haptics/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that it’s working independently with a company called Lofelt to enhance haptics through &lt;em&gt;software&lt;/em&gt;, not hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uI46SY"&gt;That initially read as a puzzling decision, since hardware — not software — seems to play the bigger role in the quality of the vibration. But this actually sounds very clever, definitely more clever than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/21/11993380/put-some-bass-on-your-wrist-basslet"&gt;Lofelt’s Basslet vibrating wearable&lt;/a&gt; that it launched on Kickstarter in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxTUdl"&gt;Outside of some high-end LG phones, most Android phones deliver muddy or rattling vibrations that don’t feel that great. Even the best ones can’t compete with Apple’s Taptic Engine it builds in-house and builds into iPhones and Apple Watch wearables. Tactile, punchy vibration probably isn’t high up on the list of many people in terms of must-have features, but it can go a surprisingly long way in making you feel like you’re using a quality product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Qualcomm Lofelt" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wSZE_SMmiA5rHq5F1ZHtuU9fWe0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22323210/0_66eU5_KB84vIXV7A.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RvbHly"&gt;Lofelt has developed a framework and an open API for phone manufacturers (as well as in game controllers “and beyond” &lt;a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/qku6b8nf1d79/6lLhSn0gs9DIb54g7HmQrV/40df630d856a049a228fcd8680a7eaab/Lofelt_Qualcomm_Partnership.pdf"&gt;says the press release&lt;/a&gt;) that can convert universal haptic data into signals that are finely tuned and improved for that device’s specific hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEIpXh"&gt;So, instead of incorporating a standard haptic actuator on the chipset that companies are required to adopt, it developed a more scalable software solution that can work on any phone running the required Snapdragon hardware. Manufacturers can keep making phones the way they want, and Lofelt’s API can help to create a more uniform haptic experience across the vast Android ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fdfbot"&gt;Lofelt CEO and co-founder Daniel Büttner spoke at length on &lt;em&gt;Medium &lt;/em&gt;in a post called &lt;a href="https://medium.com/lofelt/the-keys-to-delivering-better-haptics-on-android-f502403c22e7"&gt;“The Keys to Delivering Better Haptics on Android,”&lt;/a&gt; and it covers everything you’d want to know about why the gap between haptics on Android and Apple devices has been so wide in the past few years. It comes down to fragmentation, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhVxx9"&gt;Apple could set a standard for haptics on both a hardware and software level by which its small batch of phones abide. Android, on the other hand, is the Wild West in terms of haptics, as it is in most other areas. The post illustrates that pretty much the only way forward to improve haptics in Android is through software. Hey, if you can’t reverse fragmentation at this point, you might as well lean into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8tB2z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dream of mid-air wireless charging teased with rollable Oppo X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YnofQDNtJeeqWU0JBdKfWuyPlgY=/88x0:736x432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860411/Jyr8m06UdO.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OHAS6g"&gt;Oppo has teased a new wireless charging solution that works when a phone is up to 10 cm (3.9 inches) away from a charging pad. The company has shown off its Wireless Air Charging tech in a &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4607703588020148"&gt;30-second clip on its Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/press/oppo-to-unveil-innovations-partnerships-at-mwcs-2021/"&gt;coincide with MWC Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;. The clip shows the Oppo X 2021 rollable concept phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;announced in November&lt;/a&gt;, charging above the pad, even when held at an angle. The technology offers charging speeds of up to 7.5W, Oppo says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgVaeJ"&gt;The Chinese manufacturer is the latest to announce a truly wireless air charging solution, following Xiaomi and Motorola’s teases from earlier this year. Back in January, Xiaomi announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;Mi Air Charge Technology&lt;/a&gt;, which it says can charge multiple devices at 5W “within a radius of several meters.” The next day, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-no-contact-wireless-charging/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on a demonstration from Motorola which showed one of its phones charging 100 cm (40 inches) away from a charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CWsriV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"&gt;Your browser does not support HTML5 video.&lt;source src="https://f.video.weibocdn.com/002un6p6gx07KAuN5DFt01041200ctFy0E010.mp4?label=mp4_1080p&amp;amp;template=1920x1080.25.0&amp;amp;trans_finger=0bde055d9aa01b9f6bc04ccac8f0b471&amp;amp;media_id=4607697065279496&amp;amp;tp=8x8A3El:YTkl0eM8&amp;amp;us=0&amp;amp;ori=1&amp;amp;bf=4&amp;amp;ot=h&amp;amp;ps=3lckmu&amp;amp;uid=3ZoTIp&amp;amp;ab=3915-g1,966-g1,3370-g1,1493-g0,1192-g0,1191-g0,1258-g0&amp;amp;Expires=1614082265&amp;amp;ssig=gG5MHIjc46&amp;amp;KID=unistore,video" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="37mkFZ"&gt;At 10 cm, the range of Oppo’s technology is more limited than Xiaomi’s competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-contactless-charging-1203197/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. The video’s presenter makes a very deliberate effort to hold the phone directly above the charging mat. However, the charging is shown working even when the phone is slightly tilted above the wireless charger, and while playing back a video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPJyZN"&gt;Distinctions like this are academic right now since none of these technologies have been released in commercial products. Xiaomi has confirmed its technology won’t be ready to release this year, and the rollable phone that Oppo used for its demonstration also doesn’t have an official release date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A closer look at Wireless Air Charging&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working on or off axis with the charger, you can charge up and use the smartphone at the same time without being tethered to a charging stand or cable!      &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MWC21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MWC21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOxMWC21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOxMWC21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/9iiunPBzPs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9iiunPBzPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1364108983821234178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NVDxYm"&gt;As well as developing wireless chargers that work over longer distances, manufacturers are also working to make standard wireless charging faster. Xiaomi is developing an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522730/xiaomi-mi-80w-wireless-charging-technology-announced"&gt;80W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; solution, which it announced just months after Oppo revealed its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325289/oppo-125w-fast-charging-65w-airvooc-wireless-charger"&gt;65W wireless charging tech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YGJC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 23rd, 6:53AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with official name of charging solution, and more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
