    <title>Verizon’s faster C-band 5G is live and off to a promising start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/klCou6FBnhd32v1B4r5jzh36x3U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408396/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vXuyvi"&gt;Amid an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;ongoing tussle with the FAA&lt;/a&gt; and airline industry, Verizon today flipped the switch on its mid-band 5G deployment, which uses spectrum that the company spent tens of billions of dollars to acquire in the C-band auction. The new, faster level of 5G connectivity will significantly augment Verizon’s “5G Ultra Wideband” network, which, until now, has relied solely on extremely-fast-but-very-hard-to-find millimeter wave spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZWFbT"&gt;Mid-band 5G overcomes many of the hurdles that have made mmW the brunt of jokes from competitors like T-Mobile: it’s actually available indoors, and coverage doesn’t vary as unpredictably from one street to the next. Customers with compatible phones should experience noticeably faster data speeds compared to Verizon’s “5G Nationwide” network that offers widespread signal but with download and upload performance that in many cases isn’t much better than LTE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KqM4F"&gt;In short, 5G is about to feel a lot more real for Verizon customers than it ever has before. Mid-band is a crucial element of Verizon’s long-term 5G ambitions and bridges the gap between the slow 5G Nationwide and barely existent, ultra-fast millimeter wave 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SYFfnVodaBvNx-MyvG_yE1lnq38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179494/Screen_Shot_2022_01_19_at_10.56.22_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7rmd2/cband_live_in_claremont_iphone_12_pro_max_and/" target="_blank"&gt;r/Verizon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;In many cases, C-band speeds are a substantial upgrade from Verizon’s slower “5G Nationwide” and a true leap over 4G LTE.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MpCLCi"&gt;Even on day one, the improvements are promising. Customers were quick to take to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon"&gt;the Verizon subreddit&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday to post a slew of Ookla Speedtest screenshots, with download rates regularly topping 500Mbps and even 800Mbps in some cases. Many are seeing an average downlink between 200 and 400Mbps, far exceeding the performance of 5G Nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5dJeat"&gt;Which devices support Verizon’s new, faster C-band 5G?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiwHtD"&gt;At launch, the list of supported phones and tablets is fairly short. These are the devices that can already connect to Verizon’s C-band 5G:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nyTl9H"&gt;Apple iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tgp345"&gt;Apple iPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (3rd generation), or iPad mini (6th generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dUkQZr"&gt;Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j7667Y"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, S21 Ultra, Z Fold 3, Z Flip 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lGwK67"&gt;Verizon has said that all phones it releases as of now will support C-band 5G, and the carrier expects to offer over 20 compatible phones by the end of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J0MtGT"&gt;Where can I get Verizon’s C-band 5G?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eUWKR5"&gt;Verizon has said it will provide a C-band coverage map at launch, but so far, no such map is available on the carrier’s website — perhaps a consequence of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;eleventh-hour concessions to the FAA&lt;/a&gt;. You can expect just about every major metro market to have some degree of C-band coverage in January: the company has promised to reach “more than 100 million people in 1,700-plus cities around the nation” with the faster flavor of 5G this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cv5XUO"&gt;But it’s a rolling process and won’t be instantly available everywhere. I’m located in downtown Brooklyn and am still riding on the slower 5G Nationwide network as of mid-day Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uMjii0"&gt;How do I know if I’m on Verizon’s C-band 5G?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3cv4p"&gt;Verizon’s C-band 5G shares the same “5G Ultra Wideband” indicator in your phone’s status bar as millimeter wave 5G. That makes things a little confusing, but if you’re suddenly (and consistently) seeing “5G UW” appear in places where you never had it previously, that’s the best evidence that your device is taking advantage of the faster 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Cb94xu"&gt;How fast is it really?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Cj8mhW"&gt;Based on many early tests, pretty fast — and on a different level altogether than 5G Nationwide. Upload speeds aren’t anything spectacular, but many Verizon customers on C-band are getting download rates that range &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7pjbf/lake_county_il_north_of_chicago_is_live/"&gt;anywhere from 200&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7p997/indiana_cband_result/"&gt;500Mbps&lt;/a&gt; and, in the very best cases, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7qe1h/cband_live_in_downtown_la/"&gt;over 800Mbps&lt;/a&gt;. And these are in regions where cellular data had previously often topped out around 60 or 80Mbps, so the upgrade is substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y1txFg"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2022-01-19T16:01:56.193427+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7os2i/cband_in_rochester_ny_is_live/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;C-Band in Rochester NY is live&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/"&gt;verizon&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UTc47i"&gt;Do I need to change my plan to get C-band 5G on Verizon?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HkNPVt"&gt;Not necessarily. The new, faster 5G is included on Verizon’s 5G Play More, 5G Do More, and 5G Get More Unlimited plans. Ahead of the C-band rollout, Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867007/verizon-t-mobile-att-unlimited-plan-5g"&gt;slightly rebranded and tweaked those plans&lt;/a&gt; — with the top plan now offering truly unlimited 5G data. But if you’re on a previous version of those plans, and since actual plan features have changed, in most cases, you’ll automatically be rolled over to the new plans within two billing cycles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQO4A5"&gt;The exception to this is Verizon’s entry-level Start Unlimited plan, which does not include 5G Ultra Wideband whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0ztXEU"&gt;What about the whole airplane safety thing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YhstDY"&gt;Don’t expect to get C-band speeds at your local airport for some time. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have begrudgingly agreed to delay activating C-band 5G around many airports and are creating exclusion zones to address airplane-related safety concerns that continue to be raised by the FAA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G05uF5"&gt;Both carriers have strongly criticized the FAA for being unprepared for this moment. “The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and our nation’s airlines have not been able to fully resolve navigating 5G around airports, despite it being safe and fully operational in more than 40 other countries,” Verizon said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fESPh"&gt;If you’re a Verizon customer and are already using the faster mid-band 5G, feel free to share some of your impressions in the comments. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T begins 5G C-band rollout in limited number of metro areas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="5G Wireless Service To Launch In U.S. Despite Aviation Industry Concerns" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MM_JlKgcNCV4bS6JDyGdiFhbYIs=/53x0:2369x1544/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408374/1365480215.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VvG9W7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.att.com/innovationblog/2022/connectivity.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is lighting up its expanded 5G service&lt;/a&gt; in just eight metro areas in the US on Wednesday, including Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Chicago, Detroit, Jacksonville, Orlando, and South Florida (&lt;a href="https://about.att.com/ecms//dam/snrdocs/pdf/metro-areas-with-c-band.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). This comes after both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;voluntarily limited the activation of C-band spectrum around airports&lt;/a&gt; after facing mounting pressure from airlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRI818"&gt;“Today’s introduction begins in limited parts of 8 metro areas across the U.S. It will expand rapidly as our thoughtful and efficient deployment ramps up throughout the year,” Chris Sambar, AT&amp;amp;T’s executive vice president of technology operations, explains in the post announcing the expansion. “With 17 C-Band-capable devices already available online and in our stores, you can start seeing those speeds today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="89AWZE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meanwhile, Verizon plans on activating towers in 1,700 cities this month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ih1vQ0"&gt;Just one day before Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s scheduled 5G rollout on January 19th, major airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;warned against activating 5G towers for fear of “catastrophic disruption”&lt;/a&gt; to flights operating across the country. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;Air India, Emirates, Japan Airlines, and ANA&lt;/a&gt; canceled some of their flights in advance over concerns that the 5G expansion could &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;interfere with radar altimeters&lt;/a&gt; that aircraft use to make low-visibility landings. Ahead of the rollout, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reached an agreement with both carriers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873765/faa-verizon-att-airport-5g-carriers-buffer-zone"&gt;create 50 buffer zones where AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will shut off transmitters for six months near airports&lt;/a&gt; with high traffic volume and frequent low-visibility conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY1Hnk"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T expressed frustration at the FAA’s failure to “utilize the two years they’ve had to responsibly plan for this deployment,” as well as its “inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services.” AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon’s activation of the C-band spectrum has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;faced pushback by the FAA&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in two delays. And while AT&amp;amp;T is taking a more cautious approach to its rollout, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/get-most-out-of-verizon-5g-ultra-wideband-network" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon plans on activating its network in 1,700 cities&lt;/a&gt; — covering 100 million more people — this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="R7g4Dk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Verizon’s faster C-band 5G is live and off to a promising start","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s newest game is a Hearthstone-style card battler</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3soLivgoPmSLClev-hpOUF06kNQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407076/ARC_5.5_SCR8.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: Arcanium: Rise of Akhan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="34taD1"&gt;Netflix’s foray into the mobile gaming subscription market is showing no signs of slowing down. This week it added a pair of new titles to its service, a card-battling roguelike called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1483559835786518528"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcanium: Rise of Akhan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a hidden object game called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1483590028831993856"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krispee Street&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Both are available to download on iOS or Android free of charge if you’re already subscribed to the streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w50EFY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcanium &lt;/em&gt;follows an increasingly familiar template for Netflix’s mobile game releases, in that it’s a pre-existing title added to the subscription service. The game originally launched in &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1056840/Arcanium_Rise_of_Akhan/"&gt;early access on Steam back in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, where it currently boasts “Mostly Positive” user reviews. Its Steam listing describes it as an “open-world, single-player strategy card adventure” and fusion of the roguelike and deckbuilding genres. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fhLkN0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Dive into a fantasy world where good, evil, magic, and technology collide for the ultimate tale of fellowship and bravery. Arcanium, an open-world single-player strategy card game, is now on Netflix. &lt;a href="https://t.co/vWHgiIY8u4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vWHgiIY8u4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1483559835786518528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cNri42"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Krispee Street&lt;/em&gt; is a hidden object game that almost looks like a digital version of Where’s Waldo based on the webcomic &lt;a href="https://krispee.com/"&gt;Krispee&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-launches-two-new-mobile-games-arcanium-rise-of-akhan-and-krispee-street/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s On Netflix&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that it’s the fourth game from developer FrostyPop to release on Netflix since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772480/netflix-games-apple-iphone-ipad-ios-subscription-app-store"&gt;service’s official launch last November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CtcGty"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1kQyJg6DZ8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nyb7W8"&gt;With the release of the two titles, Netflix now has a dozen mobile games available to download and play free of charge as part of its subscription. It’s still probably not enough to warrant a subscription by itself, but they’re a neat addition, especially when all of them are free from annoying in-app transactions. If you’re already paying for a Netflix subscription, what have you got to lose?&lt;/p&gt;

This comes as cell carriers, federal agencies, airlines, and airplane manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;struggle to reach an agreement&lt;/a&gt; on policies regarding how the rollout should be handled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFj9dm"&gt;ANA cites specific guidance from Boeing, saying that “Boeing has announced flight restrictions on all airlines operating the Boeing 777 aircraft.” Japan Airlines also cites a notification from Boeing, saying that it was told that “5G signals for U.S. mobile phones, which will begin operating in the U.S. on January 19, 2022, may interfere with the radio wave altimeter installed on the Boeing 777.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlWmTF"&gt;Emirates’ announcement is one of the clearest about what’s being canceled. The airline, described as the world’s largest operator of the Boeing 777 &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airlines-scramble-rejig-schedules-amid-us-5g-rollout-concerns-2022-01-18/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says that it’s “suspending flights to the following US destinations from 19 January 2022 until further notice,” listing Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Miami, Newark, Orlando, San Francisco, and Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1A1E5v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Emirates says it’s “working closely with aircraft manufacturers and the relevant authorities”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="837OGu"&gt;The airline will continue to fly to New York JFK, Los Angeles (LAX), and Washington, DC (IAD). Emirates says it’s “working closely with aircraft manufacturers and the relevant authorities to alleviate operational concerns” and that it hopes to start flying to the US again as soon as it’s able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbuBmU"&gt;More airlines were affected as the day progressed. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airlines-scramble-rejig-schedules-amid-us-5g-rollout-concerns-2022-01-18/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Taiwan’s China Airlines will reschedule some flights, while South Korea’s Korean Air Lines switched away from Boeing’s 777 and 747-8 aircraft on six flights to the US, and Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific says it’s prepared to use different planes if necessary. Lufthansa had canceled at least one US flight and was switching from the Boeing 747-8 to the 747-400 aircraft on some US routes. Air India, Singapore Airlines, and Austrian Airlines were also switching out 777 aircraft for US flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSGmYn"&gt;Airline operators in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;warned earlier in the day&lt;/a&gt; that the 5G rollout could cause “catastrophic disruption” to their flight schedules. &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;According to the FAA&lt;/a&gt;, the concern is that the C-band 5G signals could interfere with the radar altimeters used in some planes, creating a safety issue.

Its competitor, Airbus, said that it will be working “as part of a wider industry coalition” to “study the issue further and work toward solutions.” For information on aircraft limitations, it referred to &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-5g"&gt;the FAA’s statements on 5G page&lt;/a&gt;, where a statement from January 16th lists the airplane models that have been approved to land at some airports under low-visibility conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3837yY"&gt;Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline#comments"&gt;both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon announced&lt;/a&gt; that they would voluntarily delay 5G antenna upgrades near certain airports. The chairwoman for the Federal Communications Commission issued a statement saying it’s “essential that the FAA now complete” the process of assessing altimeter performance and the effect C-band 5G communication can have on it with “both care and speed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9vwZG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 19th, 5:27AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information on additional airlines that have been affected with emphasis on Boeing 777 aircraft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T and Verizon are limiting C-band 5G expansion around airports even more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-AVIATION-TELECOMMUNICATION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T4iAQgSV6HjP97Cu82K0kGdmOqU=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70404653/1237809011.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4xeFnP"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have announced that they will push back plans to activate some 5G towers around airports after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;airline operators warned&lt;/a&gt; that the deployment could cause “catastrophic disruption” to travel and shipping. While both carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873765/faa-verizon-att-airport-5g-carriers-buffer-zone"&gt;have an agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; to create buffer zones around 50 airports, AT&amp;amp;T has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s halting the rollout of even more towers than originally planned, and that the decision applies to a “limited number of towers around certain airport runways.” Verizon responded to an email asking if it was planning on doing more than the agreement requires with &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-goes-ultra-wednesday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; that says it’s “voluntarily decided to limit our 5G network around airports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVXv6n"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is clearly unhappy with the situation. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; it said that it will “continue to work with the aviation industry and the FAA to provide further information about our 5G deployment, since they have not utilized the two years they’ve had to responsibly plan for this deployment.” The statement also said that the company is “frustrated by the FAA’s inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it do so in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8wKv8"&gt;Verizon expressed similar frustration, saying: “The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and our nation’s airlines have not been able to fully resolve navigating 5G around airports, despite it being safe and fully operational in more than 40 other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r2GsBH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Airlines claim that C-Band 5G could disrupt sensitive equipment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e6kKSH"&gt;Both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have clashed with airline operators, who claim that their new C-Band 5G towers could disrupt sensitive equipment, making it difficult to land in low-visibility conditions. We have a great explainer that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;breaks down the whole situation&lt;/a&gt;, but the TL;DR is that this is just the latest in a series of delays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kgCgnx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="V5HccX"&gt;In an attempt to finally get the rollout started, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873765/faa-verizon-att-airport-5g-carriers-buffer-zone"&gt;made an agreement with the FAA&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, which would allow them to activate their towers on January 19th, except for in select areas around 50 airports. On Monday, however, several airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;reportedly signed a letter sent to government officials&lt;/a&gt;, again warning about the rollout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7V5CS"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, United Airlines said on Monday that the 5G expansion would “result in not only hundreds of thousands of flight cancellations and disruptions for customers across the industry in 2022, but also the suspension of cargo flights into these locations, causing a negative ripple-effect on an already fragile supply chain.” The airline also said that it “implore[s] the Biden administration to act quickly and apply the same common sense solutions here that have clearly worked so well around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NM6nDi"&gt;For his part, President Biden thanked the carriers “for agreeing to delay 5G deployment around key airports and to continue working with the Department of Transportation on safe 5G deployment at this limited set of locations” in &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/18/statement-by-president-biden-on-5g-agreement/"&gt;a statement on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. He said that his team “has been engaging non-stop with the wireless carriers, airlines, and aviation equipment manufacturers to chart a path forward for 5G deployment and aviation to safely co-exist,” and that work would continue until they found “a permanent, workable solution around these key airports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLhcJG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 18th, 2:53PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add statement from President Biden.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ux39cX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 18th, 2:22PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that Verizon has also stated that it’ll be limiting rollout around airports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US airlines warn of ‘catastrophic disruption’ on Wednesday due to 5G activation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="United Airlines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yR3wkaDo8JQ3vHDqDtxpTFYjHvU=/1x0:5268x3511/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70402433/1237621702.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g0Fg5n"&gt;CEOs from major US airlines including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines have warned that the impending deployment of new 5G spectrum on Wednesday could cause “catastrophic disruption” for flights across the country starting tomorrow. The warning, which was also signed by shipping companies including UPS Airlines and FedEx Express, was issued in a letter from the CEOs &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-major-us-airline-ceos-urge-action-avoid-catastrophic-5g-flight-2022-01-17/"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said that both commercial and cargo flights could be affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAWxrF"&gt;The letter was sent to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, and White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emfBTu"&gt;The 5G spectrum in question is known as C-band, and AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon’s deployments are due to go live on Wednesday, January 19th after suffering multiple previous delays. At the core of the issue are fears that these new C-band airwaves could interfere with sensitive radar altimeters on certain aircraft, my colleague Russell Brandom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;explained earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. Altimeters are critical for landings especially when visibility is limited, and failures in this system were linked to a fatal &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines_Flight_1951"&gt;2009 Turkish Airlines crash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ej6Pz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kxZjie"&gt;“Airplane manufacturers have informed us that there are huge swaths of the operating fleet that may need to be indefinitely grounded” as a result of the new 5G deployments, the airlines wrote in their letter. “Immediate intervention is needed to avoid significant operational disruption to air passengers, shippers, supply chain and delivery of needed medical supplies,” that could cause “chaos” and strand “tens of thousands of Americans overseas.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDyc9K"&gt;“When deployed next to runways, the 5G signals could interfere with the key safety equipment that pilots rely on to take off and land in inclement weather,” United Airlines said in its own statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Without more safeguards, the rollout of this 5G spectrum could “result in significant restrictions on 787s, 777s, 737s and regional aircraft in major cities” and cause “hundreds of thousands of flight cancellations and disruptions for customers across the industry in 2022, [and] also the suspension of cargo flights into these locations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CjG21s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When deployed next to runways, the 5G signals could interfere with the key safety equipment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kq9xgz"&gt;Although there’s technically 220MHz of clearance between the spectrum used by the plane’s equipment and the new 5G spectrum, airlines are worried that the older equipment found in some planes might still be affected. Air safety concerns have already delayed the rollout of C-band from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;to this week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glSd7F"&gt;United is calling for 5G to be implemented “everywhere in the country on Jan. 19, except within approximately 2 miles of airport runways at affected airports.” It indicates the size of this buffer could be reduced after further analysis by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA). On January 3rd, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T previously agreed to take steps to mitigate the potential effect on aviation, including placing buffer zones around 50 airports for six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msu3ya"&gt;C-band spectrum has already been rolled out in &lt;a href="https://www.5gandaviation.com"&gt;nearly 40 countries&lt;/a&gt; without causing altimeter failures according to one tech trade group, and United says the right government policies could allow for a safe deployment in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJ1rql"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have a lot riding on this new spectrum, which they paid $65 billion for in an auction last year. Both need the extra spectrum to handle the traffic demands of 5G, especially given AT&amp;amp;T’s plans to shut down its 3G network next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSAvPz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces first smartphone chip with AMD ray tracing GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JdgzfFADNMneGsNwEeisOZ1I6K4=/50x0:1400x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70401999/exynos.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlSgCH"&gt;Samsung has announced the Exynos 2200, its new in-house mobile processor for smartphones. It’s the first mobile system-on-a-chip to include a GPU with AMD’s RDNA 2 graphics architecture, enabling features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfvFJq"&gt;The collaboration with AMD has been long in the making. The two companies first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/4/18651894/amd-radeon-samsung-graphics-soc-chipset-exynos-smartphones"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a licensing deal in 2019, then AMD &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462678/samsung-amd-exynos-ray-tracing-mobile-soc"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; last year that Samsung’s “next flagship mobile SoC” would use RDNA 2. Samsung recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860530/samsung-exynos-2200-amd-rdna-2-graphics-gpu-january-11th-teaser-chip"&gt;teased&lt;/a&gt; an announcement event for the Exynos 2200 that was supposed to take place on January 11th, but it was mysteriously delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMfCZL"&gt;The Exynos 2200 is manufactured on Samsung’s 4nm EUV process. Samsung is branding this GPU as “Xclipse,” and AMD’s SVP of Radeon GPU tech David Wang says in a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-game-changing-exynos-2200-processor-with-xclipse-gpu-powered-by-amd-rdna-2-architecture"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “the first result of multiple planned generations of AMD RDNA graphics in Exynos SoCs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uTOS3w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S21 FE review: just off the mark","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22880297/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-review-screen-battery-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lyx7H9"&gt;On the CPU side, the Exynoss 2200 uses Armv9 cores: one high-powered Cortex-X2 “flagship core,” three Cortex-A710 cores for balanced performance, and four more efficient Cortex-A510 cores. There’s also an upgraded NPU that Samsung says offers twice the performance of its predecessor, and the ISP architecture is designed to support camera sensors of up to 200 megapixels, one of which Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22653558/samsung-isocell-hp1-gn5-200-megapixel-camera-sensor-announced"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THNPMt"&gt;Samsung’s highest end Exynos chips usually make their way into the company’s flagship Galaxy S phone series, although models sold in the US and certain other markets use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon SoCs. Other phone makers like Vivo occasionally use Exynos chips in their own devices, but we’ll likely have to wait until the presumptive Galaxy S22 is in our hands to find out if AMD’s technology translates into a meaningful leap forward in mobile GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo’s next flagship leaks with OnePlus-esque Hasselblad branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7_ICSM7Op5l5KT4vHKed6DGZn9o=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70399142/1eaf989963bd7d4e0ee82817325daf47.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uI1jRl"&gt;Details on Oppo’s upcoming flagship phone are starting to come together. Multiple leaks are suggesting it’ll be called the Find X5 Pro, with a similar design to last year’s Find X3 Pro and specs broadly in line with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22865569/oneplus-10-pro-camera-specs"&gt;the new OnePlus 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which is already available in China. (OnePlus, of course, is now treated as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543184/oppo-oneplus-merger-brand-pete-lau-bbk-memo"&gt;sub-brand of Oppo&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjJTG2"&gt;The Find X3 Pro wasn’t sold in the US, but it did make its way to Europe and was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"&gt;one of the best phones of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Renders recently &lt;a href="https://prepp.in/news/e-509-oppo-find-x5-2022-launch-exclusive-5k-renders-expected-dates-specifications-and-more"&gt;released by OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt; show a device with a camera bump that flows into the rest of the back panel in a similar fashion to the Find X3 Pro, although the camera configuration has changed and doesn’t appear to include the previous phone’s unique ring light-equipped “microscope” camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SyCJBJ"&gt;Alleged real-world photos that corroborate the &lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt; renders have also now appeared online, showing a white model of the phone with Hasselblad branding, just like OnePlus’ latest flagships. There’s also a shot of the device’s settings menu that says it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, like the OnePlus 10 Pro, as well as Oppo’s own new chip, the MariSilicon X. This is an NPU used for image processing; it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22833796/oppo-air-glass-ar-glasses-announced-china-release-date"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; late last year alongside Oppo’s Air Glass AR device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJnymw"&gt;There are other specs that have been floating around Chinese social media channels that can’t be verified but don’t sound very surprising, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs"&gt;as with the OnePlus 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Oppo’s previous two Find X flagships were announced in March, so we should get official details fairly soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T, Dish, and T-Mobile spend billions on more 5G spectrum </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SG5J4lOul3g8Ig7s8E6mBkatZkM=/0x27:4774x3210/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70394713/1187777086.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zn3KZ1"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, Dish, and T-Mobile dropped billions of dollars in a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction to acquire more 5G spectrum licenses in the midrange 3.45GHz to 3.55GHz band, according to a report by the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-dish-spend-billions-on-spectrum-for-5g-services-11642188054"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HA5pFV"&gt;While AT&amp;amp;T was the biggest spender at $9 billion, Dish spent $7.3 billion, and T-Mobile followed behind at $2.9 billion. Verizon was notably absent from the auction. A number of smaller players also made the list, like Three Forty-Five Spectrum, which you can view on &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/atandt-dish-win-big-in-andromeda-auction-verizon-gets-nothing/d/d-id/774625"&gt;Light Reading’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YDLbhD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the third-largest FCC auction yet, with total bids reaching about $22.5 billion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxTIvd"&gt;The auction officially ended in November, but the FCC hasn’t publicly disclosed the winning bidders until now (&lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-379256A1.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). Total bids reached about $22.5 billion, making it the third-largest FCC spectrum auction yet. Only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;last year’s $80 billion C-band auction&lt;/a&gt; (over half of which was contributed by Verizon), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/29/7945035/fcc-aws-3-spectrum-auction-largest-ever"&gt;2015’s $44.9 billion AWS-3 auction&lt;/a&gt; top this amount of spending, as pointed out by &lt;a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/fccs-345-ghz-5g-auction-now-third-largest-in-aggregate-bids"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next TV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB3yi4"&gt;When it comes to using the 3.45GHz band, however, &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt; says that companies will have to deploy new radios on cell towers that have the ability to broadcast signals across it. Smartphones that support C-band may already be capable of using the band, &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt; also notes, as they both fall under the 3rd Generation Partnership Project’s (3GPP) n77 technical standards that cover 3.3GHz to 4.2GHz, which existing 5G smartphones already use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="110NtU"&gt;Although the 3.45GHz band operates closely to C-band, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes that it’s not as likely to interfere with aircraft equipment. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;set to deploy their expanded 5G C-band services on January 19th&lt;/a&gt; after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;delayed the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;rollout twice&lt;/a&gt; due to aircraft safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s critical Pixel 6 January update is here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-kvqmfhip2vzuFHX3kE0wobOMMs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70391322/akrales_211020_4802_0471.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The January update promises to fix numerous bugs reported by Pixel 6 owners.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IRabhh"&gt;Google is in the process of releasing a much-anticipated update for Pixel 6 phones. Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mishaalrahman/status/1482073557064638467"&gt;Android expert Mishaal Rahman noted&lt;/a&gt; that Google posted &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota"&gt;OTA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/images"&gt;factory images&lt;/a&gt; to its developer site for the January 2022 patch. That means anyone can sideload the update to their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; now, and the official over-the-air update has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1482098746779447305"&gt;already arrived on some devices&lt;/a&gt; (including some owned by &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Crc7jX"&gt;In an email, Google confirmed the rollout has begun, and that the software will automatically roll out over the next week, depending on your device and wireless carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBcYtF"&gt;Using the phones’ built-in checker may start the process now, and if it doesn’t, &lt;a href="https://flash.android.com/welcome"&gt;sideloading&lt;/a&gt; is still an option. However, waiting for the regular rollout instead of doing a manual install may be the best way to go, given the trouble caused by December’s update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26RgBb"&gt;This patch includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832212/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-bug-fixes-fingerprint-sensor"&gt;numerous bug fixes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820593/google-pixel-december-feature-drop-quick-tap-to-snap-shortcut-ultra-wideband-nearby-share"&gt;a few new features&lt;/a&gt; that Pixel 6 owners have been anxiously awaiting. It’s supposed to tweak the fingerprint sensor, camera, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788072/google-pixel-6-stand-wireless-charging-fast-23w-qi"&gt;23W wireless charging with the second-generation Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt;. On the Pixel 6 Pro, you can use its ultra-wideband chip for digital car key access to compatible BMWs. This update also adds the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734993/pixel-6-snapchat-feature-tap-camera"&gt;Quick Tap to Snap&lt;/a&gt;” integration that Google and Snapchat touted during the devices’ launch event and new bass controls for the Pixel Buds A-Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXwjy1"&gt;Google originally intended to ship those features in the December update but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860191/pixel-6-pro-google-december-feature-update-paused"&gt;halted and ultimately removed the files&lt;/a&gt; from its site when users complained of connectivity troubles after installing the patch. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143183382/december-2021-update-paused?hl=en"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; that the January update has fixes for those bugs, and includes &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/139017133/google-pixel-update-december-2021?hl=en"&gt;the December update’s fixes&lt;/a&gt; to address bugs that have driven &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1481108783996751874?s=20"&gt;at least one well-known Pixel 6 user&lt;/a&gt; to ditch the phone entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uUwIo"&gt;With the images public and &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2022/01/14/pixel-6-january-update-release-date/"&gt;one Canadian telecom company&lt;/a&gt; citing Monday, January 17th for the release, we thought the patch would arrive next week, but it’s already here. That’s none too soon for people who bought the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro expecting to get a premium device. While the hardware is truly flagship-level, the software experience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22881882/android-12-google-pixel-6-pro-bugs-oneplus-oxygenos-12-samsung-one-ui-4-update"&gt;hasn’t always been smooth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS9v0s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 14th, 4:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the update is rolling out now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3HM1V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 14th, 4:55PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to note Google’s confirmation of the update, and that it includes both the December and January changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
