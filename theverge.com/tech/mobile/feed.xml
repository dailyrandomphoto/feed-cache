    <title>We regret to inform you that T-Mobile is selling a 5G-branded gin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCOhGBVo2e8RQPnT2cd8PGEkZNk=/0x160:3833x2715/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69494965/5gin_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s 5G-branded gin and ginger beer go on sale tomorrow.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FCFBBq"&gt;Whatever the reason, 5G-themed gin is now something that exists in the world, courtesy of T-Mobile. Ostensibly, “Ultra Capacity 5Gin” exists to celebrate a T-Mobile milestone: covering 300 million people with its low-band extended range 5G network and 150 million covered by its better midrange ultra capacity 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJtDl0"&gt;But maybe it just came down to the company seeing Ryan Reynolds having a good time, selling gin*, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/25/20982199/ryan-reynolds-mint-mnvo-t-mobile-ownership-deadpool-detective-pikachu"&gt;enjoying ownership of a wireless company&lt;/a&gt; and it thinking, “Let’s get in on that.” Or perhaps as the Mariners were &lt;a href="https://www.lookoutlanding.com/2021/5/18/22443250/tigers-make-justin-dunn-look-good-mariners-make-spencer-turnbull-historic"&gt;on the receiving end of yet another no-hitter&lt;/a&gt;, some marketing execs out for a night at ol’ T-Mobile Park drowned their sorrows in one too many $20 G&amp;amp;Ts and got to thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Yo9VQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With notes of pine, citrus, and unfulfilled Sprint acquisition promises&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Giq2mj"&gt;The corporate-branded gin nobody asked for is &lt;a href="https://heritagedistilling.com/"&gt;produced by Heritage Distilling&lt;/a&gt;, the Northwest’s preferred purveyor of flavored vodkas and Seahawks-themed whiskey. There’s a non-alcoholic option, too: Extended Range 5Ginger Beer, made by Jones Soda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPyy9h"&gt;If this sounds appealing and your home bar would benefit from a gin with “approachable piney notes” and a label with loud magenta branding, then you can &lt;a href="https://t-mobile5gin.com/"&gt;order a bottle for $30 starting tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;. The ginger beer also goes on sale tomorrow at $10 for a six-pack. Just do us a favor if you order some: maybe pour one out for that fourth wireless carrier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;T-Mobile was supposed to help set up&lt;/a&gt; after the Sprint merger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfunIO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Technically, Ryan Reynolds &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.diageo.com/en/news-and-media/features/diageo-to-acquire-aviation-gin-and-davos-brands/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;sold his gin company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for $610 million last August. Spiritually, he’s still kicking around as part-owner, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA continues to spend big on mobile games with $1.4 billion Playdemic acquisition </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Irn2xXyAD4JZUlFd1SuiM4zWFPI=/0x0:1520x1013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69494935/970613582.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MJtKBV"&gt;EA is adding to its roster of mobile game developers &lt;a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Electronic-Arts-Acquires-Playdemic-Makers-of-the-Highly-Successful-Golf-Clash-Mobile-Game-From-Warner-Bros.-Games-and-ATT/default.aspx"&gt;by purchasing Playdemic&lt;/a&gt;, known for &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt;, from WarnerMedia for $1.4 billion. The company says it plans on using Playdemic’s experience to help make future mobile games and that it’s interested in using &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt;’s mechanics with other franchises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJ25s3"&gt;It’s possible that EA could be purchasing Playdemic not only to gain ownership of a successful mobile game (&lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt; has over 10 million installs &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdemic.golf.android&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;on the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;), but because there’s opportunity for EA to incorporate some of its other series — &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22440408/ea-sports-pga-tour-release-date-course-list-majors"&gt;it makes the PGA golf games&lt;/a&gt; after all, which could tie in well with a mobile golf game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGbdXX"&gt;EA seems to be focusing on mobile gaming recently — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273187/ea-glu-mobile-acquisition-kim-kardashian-hollywood"&gt;also purchased mobile developer Glu&lt;/a&gt; in February for $2.1 billion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Tz28y"&gt;WarnerMedia, Playdemic’s former owner, is currently going through a transition, as it’s being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444031/warnermedia-discovery-merger-hbo-max-streaming-giant"&gt;spun out from under AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; to join with Discovery. &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/electronic_arts.html"&gt;The company says&lt;/a&gt; that it’s divesting from Playdemic as “part of [its] overall strategy to build games based on Warner Bros. storied franchises.” Indeed, if you go to &lt;a href="https://www.warnerbrosgames.com/games"&gt;Warner Bros. Games’ website&lt;/a&gt;, it’s dominated by franchises like Lego, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat (with &lt;em&gt;Scribblenauts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt; being the only real exceptions). It also has upcoming games like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340247/gotham-knights-delay-release-date-2022"&gt;DC universe-based &lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. WarnerMedia says the rest of its games will become part of the combined Warner-Discovery company after the deal is settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nHEWk"&gt;Mobile gaming has become a big focus for companies as the market has exploded. EA competitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9662214/actvision-blizzard-buys-candy-crush-king-5-9-billion"&gt;Activision purchased &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;-maker King&lt;/a&gt; for $5.9 billion in 2015, and its &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/static-files/af35383a-0db9-44de-b0b2-180eac785930"&gt;recent earnings&lt;/a&gt; show that the division is now bringing in more money than Blizzard. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22458279/valorant-mobile-spinoff-riot-games"&gt;Many popular PC and console games&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and EA’s own &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; have also gotten mobile ports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Entire London Underground to receive mobile coverage by end of 2024</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oi7tmLPQ_VhIi2tPFTYTTD-p4AA=/0x0:3508x2339/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69485133/32177.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TfL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STMn8o"&gt;By the end of 2024, passengers on the London Underground will have mobile reception across the entire network of stations and tunnels, London’s mayor Sadiq Khan &lt;a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2021/june/mayor-fulfils-commitment-and-confirms-high-speed-mobile-coverage-across-tube-network"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Popular stations, including Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Bank, Euston, and Camden Town will be hooked up by the end of 2022, with coverage expanding in phases over the ensuing months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCWmIi"&gt;The announcement comes just over a year after 4G coverage was introduced on the eastern half of the Jubilee line, between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700451/london-underground-4g-tunnels-cellular-reception-mobile-phones"&gt;Westminster and Canning Town, in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Transport for London (TfL), the city’s transport authority, says the upcoming infrastructure will support 5G networks as well as 4G, but that it will be up to mobile operators themselves to offer support for the next-generation mobile network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f3HhcE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Full internet access will be available across the tube”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mKJkb8"&gt;“I promised Londoners that if they re-elected me for a second term as mayor I would deliver 4G throughout the tube network,” London’s mayor Sadiq Khan said in a statement. “It’s already up and running on the eastern half of the Jubilee line and I’m delighted to announce today that I am fulfilling that commitment and full internet access will be available across the tube, with key central London stations such as Oxford Circus and Euston set to benefit before the end of next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhHeKw"&gt;TfL is working with BAI Communications to offer coverage across the network. The work will involve laying over 2,000km (1242 miles) of cabling within tunnels and stations. As well as offering mobile coverage to tube passengers, the project should also have benefits for mobile coverage in the city more generally. The fibre cabling installed in the London Underground’s tunnels will also connect to buildings and other infrastructure like street lighting and bus stops, allowing small mobile transmitters to be installed and increase coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYSYnP"&gt;The announcement comes as ridership on the London Underground has plummeted as a result of the pandemic, with huge financial implications for the transport authority. In June, the UK government &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-57315385"&gt;agreed to give TfL a third bailout&lt;/a&gt; to keep services running, bringing the total to over £4 billion (around $5.6 billion). TfL says providing mobile reception across the network will bring in more revenue over the 20-year contract term with BAI. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked memo confirms OnePlus will become an Oppo sub-brand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eazb8F1EOXEhg_jl4VVlp5HArkE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69480030/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0073_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xzw8gJ"&gt;Last week OnePlus CEO Pete Lau said in a forum post that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;the company will “further integrate” with Oppo&lt;/a&gt;, but didn’t elaborate on how that’d work in practise. Now, leaker Evan Blass has obtained a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1405914905363034118"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; that serves as a talking points memo for use by OnePlus PR, and it explains the integration in plainer terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78T6vb"&gt;“With the integration, OnePlus becomes a brand within Oppo, however will continue to function as an independent entity,” reads the most pertinent answer. The memo also says that Lau’s role as chief product officer at Oppo will make him responsible for the product strategies of both Oppo and OnePlus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldYpRL"&gt;This isn’t particularly surprising. Here’s what I wrote last week following Lau’s post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vNtQy6"&gt;Reading between the lines, it sounds like OnePlus will essentially be treated like a label of Oppo’s, maintaining a separate consumer-facing operation but with business activities merging in areas beyond product development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xmfGUq"&gt;The memo confirms that this is essentially what’s going to happen, removing any need to read between the lines. “With the merging of both the firms, we will have more resources at hand to create even better products,” it says. “It will also allow us to be more efficient in our operations.” OnePlus and Oppo had already merged their R&amp;amp;D departments around the turn of the year, so the further integration is more to do with streamlining day-to-day business operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLYfgZ"&gt;OnePlus customers shouldn’t necessarily expect too much to change — the shared ownership and supply chain meant that there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/15/17467348/oneplus-6-vs-oppo-r15-pro-vivo-bbk"&gt;similarities&lt;/a&gt; between Oppo and OnePlus phones for as long as OnePlus has existed. But now that OnePlus is acknowledging the relationship out loud instead of acting like it’s a scrappy startup, all eyes will be on the company’s next round of flagship phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Unite will launch first on Nintendo Switch in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gYafg7bSO3pT3ZxUlJNXiCJ9w5Y=/0x0:1329x886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466685/unitenew.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3984Wl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301541/pokemon-unite-team-game-strategy-tencent-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the team-based, five vs. five strategy game co-developed with Tencent’s TiMi Studio Group, now has a release window — and it’s soon. It’s coming first to Nintendo Switch in July 2021, followed by a release on mobile devices in September. Presumably, it’ll be released on both iOS and Android, but specific platforms weren’t confirmed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B10MAj"&gt;In case you can’t decide which platform you want to play the game on, don’t fret too much, as &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; will support cross-play between Nintendo’s console and mobile devices. &lt;a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/NEW-INFORMATION-REVEALED-FOR-Pokemon-UNITE"&gt;The Pokémon Company announced&lt;/a&gt; that the game will also support cross-progression, which can be enabled by signing in with either your Pokémon Trainer Club account or Nintendo Account on the devices that you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFCoJW"&gt;The game will be free to start, with optional in-game purchases available, including the paid “Aeos gems” currency. You’ll get Aeos coins and tickets just from playing the game, which can unlock cosmetics and other items. There will be season battle passes that you can level up over time to earn in-game rewards. Those paid Aeos gems I mentioned earlier will let you pay to get rewards in the battle pass if you don’t want to put the time in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nynjC"&gt;Like my colleague Andrew Webster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21302958/pokemon-unite-esports-competitive-gaming-league-of-legends"&gt;said last year when the game was announced&lt;/a&gt;, a strategy-laced &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game might seem like a strange combination, and it’s splashing onto the scene years after MOBAs like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; exploded in popularity. Yet, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; has a familiar cast of characters, and that might be enough to open the genre up to a new wave of fans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus integrates further with Oppo, if that’s even possible</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PreLxGWjXgAkVLh2rVaTwuyIo_8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465329/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro. | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DTWuj"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has announced a “new journey” for the company including a plan to “further integrate our organization with Oppo.” Lau made the announcement by way of a &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/a-new-journey-for-oneplus.1454492/"&gt;post on OnePlus’ forums&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we’re at a turning point for the future of OnePlus” and “we must adapt as a team and a brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85hr9Q"&gt;It sounds like a dramatic move for OnePlus, the company Lau started with Carl Pei after ostensibly leaving Oppo in 2013. OnePlus made its name with rebellious marketing and hype-driven online retail strategies, portraying itself as a smarter alternative to bigger smartphone brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1xwGeW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was always clear that OnePlus had ties to Oppo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3aHu8H"&gt;But it remained a private company with ownership tied up in Oppo and the shadowy BBK Electronics empire, and it was clear from OnePlus’ phones that there were still at least some ties to Oppo. Components like display panels were often seemingly identical, and even supposedly proprietary technology like the Dash fast-charging system was cross-compatible with Oppo’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXKvIi"&gt;“OnePlus and Oppo are two completely independent companies,” a OnePlus representative told me &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/15/17467348/oneplus-6-vs-oppo-r15-pro-vivo-bbk"&gt;three years ago&lt;/a&gt; by way of explanation. “R&amp;amp;D, finance, sales channels, daily operations, etc operate independently. The two parties share some common investors. OnePlus leases Oppo’s manufacturing line and shares part of the supply chain resources with Oppo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aO5T4K"&gt;Lau says that OnePlus will continue to operate independently, despite the further integration with Oppo. But he hasn’t said exactly what would be integrated, and given the existing commonalities between the two brands’ products, it’s not obvious what this will actually mean for consumers. Lau says OnePlus will continue to operate its own events and customer feedback channels, for example, but adds that Oppo’s greater resources should help OnePlus be more efficient with software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lwW0B4QWWEGX6noYMYXJbc3Y74s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664475/DSC_0784.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Oppo Find X3 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qZaPx2"&gt;It’s not a big secret that OnePlus and Oppo have been coming closer to an explicit reunion in recent years. Lau became Oppo’s chief product officer last year while keeping his role at OnePlus, and the two brands merged R&amp;amp;D departments back in January. More recently, OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344054/oneplus-9-oppo-coloros-in-china-hydrogenos"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’d start using Oppo’s ColorOS for its phones in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFOvaO"&gt;Reading between the lines, it sounds like OnePlus will essentially be treated like a label of Oppo’s, maintaining a separate consumer-facing operation but with business activities merging in areas beyond product development. Will this manifest itself in tangible changes to OnePlus devices? Who can say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DHs4XT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Oppo Find X3 Pro review: the Chinese phone to beat","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Kr3ROx"&gt;If you’re a OnePlus fan, though, there’s no reason to view the closer ties as a bad thing. The company has long left its “flagship killer” roots behind, now competing at the high end with expensive “Pro” phones while offering a range of cheaper Nord devices at the low-to-mid range. Oppo, for its part, releases far more phones a year than OnePlus (mostly in Asia), but its high-end flagships are every bit as good. The latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"&gt;Find X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite phone of the year so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qarkGX"&gt;Whether OnePlus would admit it or not, the company has always been associated with Oppo behind the scenes. The biggest change here is that OnePlus is now saying so out loud — while making the association even tighter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leica phone announced by SoftBank in Japan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOBU2_fK_41ENIQWpT0H1W67TMs=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465217/leitz.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zzd58N"&gt;SoftBank has announced a Leica-branded phone for the Japanese market. Leica has lent its name to phone camera systems before, but this Leitz Phone 1 is the first time the Leica brand and iconic red dot has taken precedence on a smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYoJyG"&gt;The camera system is of course going to be paramount for a device like this, and the hardware here is certainly unusual. There’s a single 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor — the biggest in any phone — with a 19mm-equivalent f/1.9 ultrawide lens, meaning other focal lengths need to use digital zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SB59G"&gt;If that sounds familiar, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439883/sharp-aquos-r6-japan-biggest-phone-camera-sensor-1-inch"&gt;Sharp announced the exact same thing a month ago&lt;/a&gt;. The Aquos R6 has the same Leica-branded camera system — though the Leitz Phone 1 makes it look a lot bigger — and other specs like its 120Hz Pro IGZO OLED screen are also a match. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jCzqb7S-ARMaHwm6Nw-C6Wl1s8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664394/leitz2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Bundled accessories for the Leitz Phone 1.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wrYfpg"&gt;On the other hand, the Aquos R6 doesn’t come with a lens cap and matching case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vqucke"&gt;SoftBank is also selling the Aquos R6 alongside the Leitz Phone 1, and isn’t attempting to hide the similarities behind the two phones. Instead, it’s positioning the R6 as a model for someone who just wants the Leica camera, and the Leitz Phone 1 for those who value Leica’s hardware design. And besides, what could be more in keeping with Leica tradition than tweaking existing products with a red dot? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LO6MRq"&gt;Preorders for the Leitz Phone 1 start tomorrow in Japan. It’ll cost 187,920 yen, or about $1,700.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo’s rollable concept phone is pure potential lacking polish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/td2nqlX7F45OVr3-qrdFdSELt60=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69461161/akrales_20210604_4621_07.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But no sign of a commercial release&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="JHp5O3"&gt;Two hundred thousand. That’s the magic number of times Oppo wants its rollable X 2021 concept phone to be able to expand and contract before it’ll consider it durable enough to turn into a commercial device. That’s 200,000 times the device will need to be able to transform from a 6.7-inch phone into a 7.4-inch mini tablet, and 200,000 times it’ll need to successfully contract back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v44URM"&gt;But as it stands, Oppo says the Oppo X 2021 is durable enough to manage just half that, at 100,000 cycles. In theory, that’s already enough for around five and a half years of use if you open and close it 50 times a day, but as we’ve seen with early foldable devices, these figures sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18411510/samsung-galaxy-fold-broken-screen-debris-dust-hinge-flexible-bulge"&gt;don’t translate into the real world&lt;/a&gt;. The number shows the scale of the work Oppo still has to do on its concept, which it unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;last November&lt;/a&gt; during its second annual “Inno Day” celebration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1DKwlP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Oppo wants it to be durable enough to survive 200,000 transformations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vnx2QA"&gt;In durability terms, Oppo thinks it’s halfway toward turning its rollable phone from a concept into reality. But after having spent an afternoon using the company’s prototype device for myself, it’s clear that hitting this arbitrary number is far from the only challenge Oppo is facing in bringing this device to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEbDMH"&gt;At first glance, the Oppo X 2021 looks like a regular 6.7-inch smartphone, designed to do everything you’d expect a regular smartphone to be able to do. But at the tap of a button, the phone starts to whir and unroll its display to 7.4 inches in size, bringing it closer to the form factor of a small tablet. Similar concepts have been announced by competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;ranging from LG&lt;/a&gt; (prior to its announcement that it’s quitting the smartphone industry) to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;TCL&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first such functional device we’ve actually been able to try out for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="ZEGdci"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10609222"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZtRAz"&gt;It’s a cool magic trick, so naturally there’s a series of complicated mechanisms working behind the scenes to make it all possible. That whirring sound is coming from a pair of motors inside the X 2021, which are expanding the phone’s dynamic frame into its full size. Meanwhile, the screen itself is rolling around the left hand side of the phone, curving around a 6.8mm axis that Oppo says allows the screen to unroll with “virtually no trace.” Behind this screen are a series of metal slats, which slot together to support the screen regardless of whether it’s expanded or contracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWth97"&gt;There’s a lot going on inside the phone, which puts the overall device on the heavier, bulkier side. Held next to my own iPhone 12 Pro, the Oppo X 2021 is thicker at 10.7mm compared to 7.4mm, and heavier at 278g (compared to 189g). That’s a substantial difference, but it’s in a similar ballpark to existing plus-sized devices on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RSIILO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A bigger screen for gaming, reading, or watching a film&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h5rzzd"&gt;A transformation from 6.7 inches to 7.4 inches might not sound like too big a change, but it’s much larger when you consider the phone’s aspect ratio is also changing. You start with a roughly 19.85:9 widescreen display (with a resolution of 1175 x 2592) and end with a screen that’s got an aspect ratio closer to 4:3 (or 4.36:3 to be exact, 1785 x 2592). Effectively, it turns into a device that’s just a tad smaller than a 7.9-inch iPad Mini. It might not be enough to turn it into a productivity powerhouse, but it’s enough to make watching films, gaming, reading, or looking up a map a less cramped experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCeXDf"&gt;On the face of it, it’s a similar promise to the one the likes of Samsung and Huawei have made with their foldable phones, wrapped up in an even more unproven form factor. But Oppo’s approach has a number of theoretical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSUqPy"&gt;For starters, Oppo’s rollable design means the telltale crease that has sat along the middle of every foldable released so far is all but absent from the X 2021. Look closely and you’ll spot a slight rumple on the left hand side of the screen, but it’s barely visible, even when the phone is showing a mainly black image. We’ve long held that the creases found on foldable devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; aren’t nearly as much of a problem once you’re actually using the device, but that’s not much consolation when you’re spending over $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2i7aHz3ogG8lqH-32INWGKhsrBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657752/akrales_20210604_4621_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slight imperfection can be see on the screen while unrolled...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iF_pBRLQul-2u0ZYIghTPIEXmRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657749/akrales_20210604_4621_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;... but it’s much less obvious when the screen is turned on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ykq2Q4"&gt;The X 2021’s minimal crease is thanks to the fact the screen doesn’t need to bend anywhere near as sharply as it rolls round the edge of the phone. Oppo says the screen’s bend radius is 6.8mm, a comparatively gentle curve. The Oppo X 2021 currently uses a plastic display, but this radius leaves the door open for the company to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;folding glass in future iterations&lt;/a&gt; (one manufacturer, Schott, says its glass can be bent at a radius of under 5mm). However, Oppo would not reveal any firm plans to use folding glass in future models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ai1oPv"&gt;There’s also the fact that a rollable design gives you access to a lot more potential screen sizes than a folding one. Its maximum and minimum sizes will always be the same, but there’s no reason it couldn’t stop expanding at the 7.2, 7, or 6.8-inch mark. Similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524338/lg-rollable-tv-available-price-on-sale-korea"&gt;LG’s rollable TV&lt;/a&gt;, the phone could theoretically adapt to different aspect ratios, rather than leaving you with unsightly black bars while you’re playing a game or watching a film at a specific aspect ratio. But none of this functionality was available on the prototype I used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cneoi"&gt;That’s not to say that a rollable design doesn’t come with its own tradeoffs. The most obvious of these is that unlike a foldable, which lets you open up its display as quickly as a book, Oppo’s device takes the better part of two or three seconds to fully extend. It felt slow enough that you might not bother if you were in a hurry to check map directions. The company admits its electric motors also introduce another potential point of failure, which would need to be solved ahead of a commercial release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/biwz-hmrvJTdjjOkjRQYnOA7EZ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657750/akrales_20210604_4621_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone’s USB-C charging port saw a lot of use during the demonstration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DccVXm8Fvahd6qR1LSi56Gvs23E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657753/akrales_20210604_4621_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oppo X 2021 (right) vs an iPhone 12 Pro (left).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d55Leo"&gt;There’s also the question of what effect having these motors inside a phone will have on its battery life. During my demonstration (which, granted, involved repeatedly expanding and contracting the phone in a way you’d never do in normal usage), the X 2021 needed to be recharged more than once. It was a prototype, which wouldn’t have any of the battery optimizations of a consumer product, but it’s still unclear what effect these motors could have on the eventual device’s battery life in more normal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20Yccv"&gt;Beyond simple practical concerns like these, there are also questions about whether Android is equipped to deal with devices with changing display sizes. When we reviewed Samsung’s latest foldable, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;, last September, we found that the company effectively had to build a completely new layer of software on top of Android to make its foldable device work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrLitJ"&gt;Oppo has ambitious plans for the X 2021’s software. The prototype runs Oppo’s ColorOS fork of Android and is able to run dual apps side by side, or display two windows of the same app to make use of the extra screen real estate. But so far, most of these features are limited to Oppo’s own built-in apps, and it’s still working with third-party developers to get them to enable support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0od3HV9ydpZHToWtxSEB4rsODcM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657751/akrales_20210604_4621_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear of the phone gives few hints about the device’s flagship feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DujENx"&gt;Oppo is making no attempt to hide the fact that its X 2021 concept is a work in progress. The device I used lacked many of the basic features you’d expect out of a modern smartphone. There was no biometric security, no selfie camera, and adjusting the device’s volume involved awkwardly tapping the side of the display in the absence of physical volume buttons. Even its flagship feature, the rolling, was a bit clumsy and unpredictable — you’re supposed to be able to expand and contract the phone with a simple swipe, but I could only reliably get it to work with a double tap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJBLh4"&gt;But even as an in-development device, Oppo’s X 2021 represents one of the most advanced rollables we’ve seen. TCL may have announced a similar device, but at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/5/21165069/tcl-foldable-trifold-phone-hands-on-rollable-concept-prototype-display-tablet"&gt;last hands-on event&lt;/a&gt; its prototype was nonfunctional. Oppo’s prototype might be light on both hardware and software features, with an unproven level of durability, and a finicky transforming process. Ultimately, though, it fundamentally does the thing Oppo promised it’d do, and the company is happy to let press handle the device in a way that its competitors have yet to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TgePAY"&gt;In an industry that’s dominated by increasingly anonymous black rectangles, it’s hard not to root for new form factors like the one Oppo is showing off with the X 2021. Now it needs to actually make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anMWyF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isfffc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor confirms Google’s apps will return to its phones with new 50 series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFP2N2ReVrDq1ocj9nT7bP6vZfw=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69460186/4f3a20f2_7289_4a1e_c995_e7b942aae685__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor 50 in silver, copper, green, and black.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="crQozq"&gt;The Honor 50 series will be able to ship with Google’s apps and services, Honor officially announced today as it launched the Honor 50 and Honor 50 Pro in China. In a statement, Honor says its phones will go through Google’s security review and that “Honor devices will therefore have the option to have Google Mobile Services (“GMS”) preinstalled on compatible devices, in accordance with Google’s licensing and governance models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IG9OAn"&gt;“Consumers will be able to experience Honor smartphones and tablets equipped with GMS,” the company said. A spokesperson confirmed that the “Honor devices” referred to in the statement include the newly announced Honor 50. The device will be available for preorder in China on June 25th and will come to international markets such as France, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UK at a later date at a price that’s to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EZlG5M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Consumers will be able to experience HONOR smartphones and tablets equipped with GMS”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1I9tsI"&gt;Honor hasn’t been able to ship Google’s apps and services, including the Google Play Store, on its phones since its former parent company Huawei was placed on the US’s entity list, forcing Google to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension"&gt;pull its Android license&lt;/a&gt;. What’s changed with the 50 series is that Huawei sold off Honor at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;end of last year&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the company to work with Google once again. Huawei, meanwhile, is still unable to use Google’s software and is positioning its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463715/huawei-harmonyos-smartphone-mate-40-30-20-p40-p30-device-updates"&gt;HarmonyOS as a replacement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blZ8l1"&gt;Reports about the return of Google’s software to Honor’s phones &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-50-google-apps/"&gt;emerged last month&lt;/a&gt;, after the company’s German Twitter leaked the news in a now-deleted tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Honor&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phones have four rear cameras in a pair of circular camera bumps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NtlCPb"&gt;Turning to the devices themselves, the most eye-catching thing about the Honor 50 and Honor 50 Pro are their rear cameras, which are arranged into a pair of circular bumps. The phones have four rear cameras in total, including a 100-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel wide-angle, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth camera. On the front, the Honor 50 Pro has a pair of selfie cameras, combining a 32-megapixel camera with a 12-megapixel ultrawide, while the Honor 50 just has a single 32-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fN2MUt"&gt;Both phones have a 120Hz display, though the Honor 50 Pro’s is slightly bigger at 6.72 inches compared to 6.57 for the regular Honor 50. Available colors include silver, bronze, green, and black. Internally, they’re powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G processor. The 50 Pro has a 4,000mAh battery that can be fast charged at up to 100W, while the regular 50 has a 4,300mAh battery and supports 66W fast charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uTe1b"&gt;The return of Google’s software to Honor’s phones is unlikely to make much of a difference in China, where phones typically ship without the Play Store. But their absence has made Honor and Huawei’s phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;pretty hard to recommend&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere. When the Honor 50 eventually releases in the West, that could all change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXKN0v"&gt;In China, the Honor 50 will start at 2,699 yuan (around $422), while the Honor 50 Pro will start at 3,699 yuan (around $578). Alongside the two flagship phones, Honor is also announcing the cheaper Honor 50 SE, which will start at 2,399 yuan (around $375).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can sign up to learn when Dish’s under-construction 5G network will launch near you </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dish has some ambitious targets ahead of it as it prepares to launch its own 5G network.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TQQI89"&gt;With the clock ticking down toward its deployment goal this fall, Dish Network has &lt;a href="https://launch.5gmobilegenesis.com/"&gt;launched a website&lt;/a&gt; with more information on its forthcoming 5G network. There’s not much to the site — just a slightly cryptic name (Project Gene5is) and a link to sign up for a notification when the service is available in your area. Its appearance was &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-5g-signups-50b8654d-7aa5-4112-b22d-bd2ee0de1ec1.html"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s no mention of it or the Project Gene5is name on Dish’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dish.com%2Fwireless%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F15%2F22535566%2Fdish-network-5g-availability-project-genesis" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;main wireless network page&lt;/a&gt;. Still, it’s an indication that Dish is moving in the right direction toward a network launch, which it needs to do if it’s going to hit its ambitious targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5L8Upd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;Dish has promised&lt;/a&gt; to bring its under-development 5G network to life later this summer starting with Las Vegas. That’s just the first stepping stone toward its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8931827/dish-carrier-plans-5g-network-tmobile-sprint-us-confirms"&gt;larger goal of covering 70 percent of the US population&lt;/a&gt; by June 2023. This would put Dish in position as the country’s missing fourth wireless carrier, and setting the company up to be that fourth carrier was a condition of the T-Mobile / Sprint acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCCrfG"&gt;Things haven’t exactly gone smoothly for Dish since then. The company is in the middle of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;dispute with T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; over its impending CDMA network shutdown, which is scheduled for January 1st, 2022. Dish argues that this is much sooner than it had anticipated, and a significant number of its Boost Mobile customers — acquired as part of the Sprint merger deal — could lose service entirely as a result. This might be an unwelcome distraction for Dish, but on an investor call earlier this year, chairman Charlie Ergen was as bullish as ever on the company’s ability to get a brand-new network off the ground — in his words: “This isn’t our first rodeo.”&lt;/p&gt;
