    <title>Google Fi is offering $100 to upgrade your 3G phone before it stops working</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-NdljImFs0d0G5zgAlypHSwcftE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68461500/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="60j1FS"&gt;Google Fi will stop activating non-VoLTE phones in January, and encourage customers with older phones to upgrade with a $100 credit provided they purchase a new phone from the Fi store and activate it before December 31st, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/04/google-fi-volte/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfR1r4"&gt;Google’s hand is forced in the matter. Customers subscribe to Fi, but as an MVNO, Fi actually piggybacks on T-Mobile and US Cellular’s networks to provide coverage. Since T-Mobile has already announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21336397/t-mobile-require-support-volte-2021-5g-lte"&gt;its own plans to phase out support for non-VoLTE phones&lt;/a&gt; starting in January 2021, Fi has to as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TzjZ75"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Requiring VoLTE all but assures 3G’s days are numbered&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NN5wBe"&gt;VoLTE stands for “Voice over LTE”, which is the handling of phone calls over LTE data rather than older 3G tech. VoLTE calls are typically clearer, with fewer drops in connection, though they’re completely unavailable to older phones that only use 3G radios and even some early LTE models as well. Google stopped activating 2G and 3G phones August 4th of this year &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/faq/"&gt;according to the Fi FAQs&lt;/a&gt;, but requiring VoLTE all but assures 3G’s days are numbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOBEHY"&gt;There’s no hard date for the end of 3G service at Fi, but it is coming, and until Google makes an official announcement, your best bet is to look for when T-Mobile ends its coverage. T-Mobile gained a lot of sway over what Fi can offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202726/tmobile-sprint-acquisition-ceo-finished-john-legere-steps-down"&gt;when it purchased Sprint&lt;/a&gt;, giving it control over both of the biggest networks Fi relied on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fxo3Gf"&gt;There’s actually a couple cheap options on the Fi store that could serve as a quick fix. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;We like Google’s Pixel 4a&lt;/a&gt;, which normally sells for $349, but there’s also options that you could get &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/moto-g-power"&gt;for less than $100&lt;/a&gt; with Google’s current holiday promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CB5irS"&gt;Upgrading to better cell service is a long term good for the usability of phones, but it is an inconvenience to customers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/17/17582370/verizon-stops-3g-activations-smartphone-network-shutdown"&gt;Verizon already made its change&lt;/a&gt; a while back, phasing out elements of 3G services in favor of LTE and 5G over time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21336397/t-mobile-require-support-volte-2021-5g-lte"&gt;T-Mobile’s&lt;/a&gt; plans are a bit more abrupt. There’s an intense focus on upgrading to 5G that seems to be motivating all of this, which is especially inconvenient because around 30 million Americans &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/3g-use-america-1067961/"&gt;still used 3G exclusively as of 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Unless customers are able to upgrade, they could be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People are putting their routers in jail to protect themselves from harmless Wi-Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fN9xrBVL1WdSwlUcBkrP6l0ACq4=/0x71:1860x1311/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451248/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_3.37.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KDdXDD"&gt;Please do not put your internet router in a Faraday cage. Please do not put your internet router in a Faraday cage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZcUIg"&gt;If you’re reading this, as someone who uses the internet, this may seem obvious. A Faraday cage, after all, blocks electromagnetic radiation and signals from escaping. Putting one around your router would, by very similar physics, prevent those same radio waves that &lt;em&gt;carry your internet &lt;/em&gt;from reaching your devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OcnGxT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So apparently putting Faraday cages around routers has become a thing for the 5g conspiracy nuts and there are companies out there ready to cash in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My sides are in orbit. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mGcud5Kb70"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mGcud5Kb70&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;—  Ansgar Odinson  (@AnsgarTOdinson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnsgarTOdinson/status/1334015546979803137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OrIa5V"&gt;And yet, an entire cottage industry of con artists looking to make a quick buck by selling “router shields” that claim to fix the issue and protect you and your loved ones from your Wi-Fi has popped up this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqCjER"&gt;The grift is a clever one — the Faraday cages are being sold at fairly ridiculous prices for metal boxes (typically between $70 to $100 on Amazon), meaning that sellers are likely making a considerable profit here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlX4Y"&gt;And the products themselves, while based entirely in conspiracy, aren’t entirely lying, unless it’s about their claims that these boxes “should not at all affect signal range and internet speed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHANZk"&gt;Putting what effectively amounts to a Faraday cage around your router to block electromagnetic radiation will do exactly that. It’ll block almost all the signal from your router, as any number of the amusing Amazon reviewers complaining about degraded signal strength and internet speeds have learned:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FyhzMUhp7awMcJnOtlEYSwTRmJA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142174/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_3.11.25_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B23LyZ"&gt;Equally ironic are reviews complaining that the shields aren’t working at all and that their internet is working just fine:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u2Gd58mEet420OGFklA2okf8b3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142111/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_9.21.00_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dwISc3"&gt;That’s likely due to poorly designed cages — some of them appear to simply be overpriced &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DecoBros-Cabinet-Basket-Organizer-Silver/dp/B00COC66A0/ref=sr_1_35?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=mesh+storage+container&amp;amp;qid=1607026454&amp;amp;sr=8-35&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mesh storage boxes&lt;/a&gt;. (Also amusing are the sellers concerned about cheaper “counterfeit” copies of their shields, who have taken to boasting about their “original” designs or US origins to appeal to buyers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsXCbx"&gt;The conspiracy has been going on for some time, with some Amazon listings that date back years, but catapulted to the spotlight this week after a viral tweet from Twitter user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnsgarTOdinson/status/1334015546979803137"&gt;@AnsgarTOdinson&lt;/a&gt;. Recent (and equally nonsensical) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21276912/5g-conspiracy-theories-coronavirus-uk-telecoms-engineers-attacks-abuse"&gt;conspiracies about 5G cellular networks&lt;/a&gt; — which operate using similar swaths of the electromagnetic spectrum as Wi-Fi routers — also likely helped contribute to the spread of the conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vw6emr"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Everything you need to know about 5G|70098" data-volume-uuid="9c3b53f77" data-volume-id="70098" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-753" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BEEvbr"&gt;All of this is completely beside the point: routers &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; emit harmful electromagnetic radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKMaZ2"&gt;As we’ve written many times here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, nearly all wireless technology — be it AM / FM radio, cellphone networks for calling, LTE, 5G, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and even the IR remote you use to turn on your television — is based on transmitting and receiving signals broadcast on some part of the electromagnetic spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZJkkD"&gt;When we talk about “electromagnetic radiation,” we’re just describing a wave of photons traveling through space. Even light — what you use to see — is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and a harmless one at that (despite having a far higher frequency than any radio or microwaves used for cellular or internet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="a7VksH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G coronavirus conspiracy theorists are endangering the workers who keep networks running","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21276912/5g-conspiracy-theories-coronavirus-uk-telecoms-engineers-attacks-abuse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EWgoZe"&gt;Wi-Fi — and 5G internet and all those aforementioned forms of wireless communication — all are fundamentally similar in how they work and are a form of what’s called non-ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing means that it doesn’t have enough energy to move any electrons from atoms and degrade cells, which is the kind of danger that you probably think of when the word “radiation” comes to mind. But it’s just not physically possible for your internet router to do that, and your router is no more of a danger to you than a TV remote or your car’s radio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fN0lg5"&gt;Look, I get it. “Radiation” is a scary word, and the idea that your internet router is sending out invisible, harmful energy could be concerning, if it were remotely true. But fortunately, based on all the current scientific evidence (as described by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/cell-phones/do-cell-phones-pose-health-hazard"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/cellular-phones.html"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;), that “danger” just isn’t there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SlgjwG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Does phone radiation give you cancer?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/18/16751954/phone-radiation-cancer-link-studies"},{"title":"Cellphone radiation poses no real harm to humans, new research says","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/2/16966578/cellphone-radiation-cancer-national-toxicology-program-study-rats-mice"},{"title":"Cellphone radiation may never stop scaring people, no matter what","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/5/17202600/cell-phone-radiation-cancer-national-toxicology-program-wireless-health-effect-fears"},{"title":"The FCC says 5G is safe, again","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20793813/5g-fcc-safe-airwaves-rf-emission-standards"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="udMlqB"&gt;Of course, there is a tragedy inherent in debunking this router conspiracy: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is a website, and anyone using one of these router shields may not be able to access the internet to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Developers can now sign up for Apple’s reduced 15 percent App Store cut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of a group of apps on an iPhone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dpqJ8RliLpAJvP1Ksqi_Wb0ASqQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68450369/1228782512.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWPPg9"&gt;Apple has opened enrollment in its new small business program that will allow eligible app developers to receive 15 percent more from App Store sales, the company &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6lyxewwp"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Apple says “the vast majority of developers on the App Store who sell digital goods and services are eligible” and all developers need to do to qualify is complete the company’s enrollment form &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QG4Pw"&gt;Apple announced the new program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, marking a significant change in how the App Store is structured. Under the new terms of the program, eligible developers making under $1 million per year in App Store sales and in-app purchase revenue are eligible for the reduced commission rate of 15 percent for the following year. Apple typically takes 30 percent of all App Store revenue on digital items as per its longstanding policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpZWkP"&gt;Although Apple has never released specific figures regarding how much developers earn per year or how much the App Store grosses, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/apple-app-store-had-estimated-gross-sales-of-50-billion-in-2019.html#:~:text=Apple's%20App%20Store%20platform%20grossed,Store%20alone%20would%20be%20no."&gt;analysts estimate&lt;/a&gt; the App Store is responsible for more than $50 billion in sales in 2019, while analytics firm Sensor Tower estimates about 98 percent of developers are responsible for just 5 percent of that amount and would qualify for the new program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WsDTM"&gt;Here, in Apple’s words, are the basics as outlined by &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;its new FAQ&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uE8Opq"&gt;Existing developers who made up to 1 million USD in proceeds in 2020 for all their apps, as well as developers new to the App Store, can qualify for the program and the reduced commission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wcYOuQ"&gt;If a participating developer surpasses the 1 million USD threshold, the standard commission rate will apply for the remainder of the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t7MsLL"&gt;If a developer’s proceeds fall below the 1 million USD threshold in a future calendar year, they can re-qualify for the 15% commission the year after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p7ov6D"&gt;Developers must identify any Associated Developer Accounts to determine proceeds eligibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0swbGW"&gt;Apple has set a deadline of December 18th, 2020 at 10AM PT / 1PM ET for submitting enrollment, with a January 1st, 2021 start date for when the proceeds adjustment takes effect. The FAQ states that if a developer applies after the deadline, they must wait until 15 days after they are approved to see the reduced commission rates, and approval may not happen until well into spring of next year. If you’re a new developer with no proceeds, you can submit enrollment to the program and see the reduced App Store rate immediately upon approval if your app is then live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlqdsL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgkfhV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter turns off threaded replies because they made conversations hard to read</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7eyOqB-ff0RemVulJa5kE7I7cwc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449979/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6QgdNa"&gt;Twitter has been experimenting with threaded replies for some time as a way to potentially make replies easier to read and follow. But the company has decided to end those experiments because of user feedback, it announced on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHs05V"&gt;“We asked and you let us know this reply layout wasn’t it, as it was harder to read and join conversations,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334544255298232320"&gt;the company wrote in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; published today. “So we’ve turned off this format to work on other ways to improve conversations on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JvPAXT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Your feedback shapes Twitter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We asked and you let us know this reply layout wasn’t it, as it was harder to read and join conversations. So we’ve turned off this format to work on other ways to improve conversations on Twitter. &lt;a href="https://t.co/pA4Yd0QfyW"&gt;https://t.co/pA4Yd0QfyW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334544255298232320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IQ6v7g"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1334552671462641664"&gt;follow-up tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the company said threaded replies made conversations harder to read and join and that people wanted more context about who they were talking to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VOylI6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some learnings:&lt;br&gt;*the new look made convos harder to read &amp;amp; join – we’re exploring other ways to make this easier.&lt;br&gt;*you want more context about who you're talking to – we're working to add this.&lt;br&gt;*you want more control – we’re iterating on our convo settings.&lt;a href="https://t.co/UzS08x4Jcf"&gt;https://t.co/UzS08x4Jcf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Comms (@TwitterComms) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1334552671462641664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MsqWwU"&gt;Twitter is also shutting down its beta app, which the company called twttr, designed for experiments like threaded replies. “For now we’re turning [twttr] off so we can work on new tests to improve the conversation experience on Twitter,” the company said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334545842972332032"&gt;in another tweet&lt;/a&gt;. People currently using twttr will lose access for now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1334552672435720193"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;, but Twitter is exploring potential next steps for the app as it develops future plans to test new products, a Twitter spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cr1Poq"&gt;

&lt;p id="IZX49V"&gt;Trying to follow more than even a few replies on most tweets can be a headache (see: the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/12/18222558/kara-swisher-jack-dorsey-twitter-interview-conversation-karajack-livetweet"&gt;infamous Twitter conversation&lt;/a&gt; between CEO Jack Dorsey and &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; co-founder Kara Swisher), and threaded replies were Twitter’s attempt to make tracking them more straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSoG0Q"&gt;Twitter first signaled it was considering threaded replies back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17807092/twitter-threading-replies-status-update-product-test-update"&gt;in August 2018&lt;/a&gt;, rolled them out along with twttr &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18262457/twitter-twttr-beta-app-threaded-replies-hands-on"&gt;in March 2019&lt;/a&gt;, added them to the iOS app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117608/twitter-ios-app-replies-design-ui-change-update"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;, and revised how threaded replies looked for some on iOS and the web &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249011/twitter-threaded-conversations-test-ios-web-lines-indents-interface-hiding-like-retweet-buttons"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems the product change was one users didn’t like, so Twitter is reverting back to its old system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSrMN1"&gt;Hopefully, the company comes up with a new solution at some point. But for now, we’ll be stuck scrolling forever on high-reply tweets to figure out exactly what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos now lets you set a changing wallpaper that pulls images from your memories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MO_Bg18DwZNEv_C95AYK4biQwus=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449069/1BEB77B1_EB2C_4E1F_A9C1_1B863908E956.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t3IMGi"&gt;Android users who are bored of their usual wallpapers are in luck: an update to Google Photos now allows users to set their wallpaper as a random, rotating cast of saved photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yE8l3J"&gt;Version 5.22 of Google Photos automatically includes the update, so if you go to your phone’s wallpaper selector and look at the live wallpapers, you should see the option for one called “Memories.” Once selected, your phone will start pulling photos from the Memories section of Google Photos to cycle between as a background. You’ll then be able to preview what you’ll see as a wallpaper before confirming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SekiEk"&gt;The main catch here is that Google defines what &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/photos/relive-your-best-memories-new-features-google-photos"&gt;counts as a memory&lt;/a&gt; based on its machine learning algorithms, so you won’t be able to really decide what shows up. Photos could range from gorgeous vistas to a photo of your sad home office lunch. Who knows! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oEW9b"&gt;Of course, you might as well try this out now if you’re ever going to, considering Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;is eliminating&lt;/a&gt; unlimited, free photo storage on June 1st, 2021. Google Photos will start charging for storage over 15GB, which is beyond a bummer. If you think you might end up switching services, now’s the time to try out a live wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Royole returns with a better folding phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gTO_lySveZO7vK50rtkouFR3yDs=/48x0:561x342/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68447874/DSCF74642.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The FlexPai 2 is a big improvement&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7k7Fme"&gt;Remember the first folding phone? No, not Samsung’s ill-fated original Galaxy Fold — the one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/5/18067116/royole-flexpai-flexible-display-foldable-smartphone-tablet-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;beat it to market&lt;/a&gt;. In hindsight, and honestly in foresight back then as well, Royole’s FlexPai was a hurried attention grab that existed solely to attain world-first status. But it’s not like it came out of nowhere; Royole had been set up several years earlier solely to develop flexible screen technology, so it’s understandable that the company would want to get ahead of Samsung to show off what it could do. A flex, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGko9G"&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18174278/royole-flexpai-foldable-phone-android-ces-2019"&gt;the FlexPai was bad&lt;/a&gt;. But now there’s a FlexPai 2, and it’s surprisingly pretty good. I’ve been using a Chinese model for a while and can report that it’s a big improvement over the original, with some neat refinements to the design. Samsung won’t have much to worry about, but that’s not necessarily the goal here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbYyRO"&gt;Royole doesn’t just see itself as a consumer electronics company. It has partnerships with hundreds of brands that see it providing flexible display and sensor technology to the likes of AirBus, Toyota, and Louis Vuitton. A Royole representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company is pleased with the FlexPai 2’s performance in China so far, but wouldn’t disclose sales data. At roughly $500 cheaper than Samsung’s Galaxy Fold 2, though, it’s worth a look however many units it sells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQXLfS"&gt;Royole also says it plans to announce global availability early next year. As such, this isn’t a full review of the FlexPai 2 — my review unit was loaded with Chinese-only software, so I can’t tell you much about the daily-driver experience. I can, however, tell you that the hardware is quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7KeW_1f_7b2AzcZ52pPa01Bj_f8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140904/DSCF7461.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;When unfolded, the FlexPai 2 is roughly the size of an iPad mini.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4FfxbRpJOLuFoVf2Xx8wWFq-3Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140905/DSCF7457.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The FlexPai 2 runs Royole’s WaterOS Android 10 skin.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ikAyN_D5h3HitC12hfZqqR_sKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140906/DSCF7465.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The FlexPai 2 is about the size of a passport when folded.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bjUggI"&gt;The FlexPai 2 folds the opposite way to Samsung’s Galaxy Fold devices; that’s to say that the main screen goes around the outside of the curve rather than the inside, so it remains exposed when the hinge is closed. It’s the same approach seen in Huawei’s Mate X folding phones. When folded, the FlexPai 2 is about the same size and shape as a passport, while the unfolded screen is comparable to an iPad mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y72o3B"&gt;You really get three screens in one with the FlexPai 2, although you only use one at once. The display is a 7.8-inch 1920 x 1440 4:3 panel which turns into a 5.5-inch 1440 x 900 16:10 panel or a 5.4-inch 1440 x 810 16.9 panel when folded, depending on which half you’re looking at. The reason it doesn’t fold evenly is because there’s a large bezel on one side of the screen that houses the phone’s quad cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebkGsb"&gt;Build quality is solid, although a slightly thicker plastic gasket on the opposite side of the screen to the cameras betrays the need for a little more durability protection than on your average smartphone. The phone feels great when unfolded, though, with a 6.8mm-thick slimline metal frame, and the hinge is smooth and torquey, without the awkward rubber concertina of the original FlexPai. One advantage of Royole’s new design over Samsung’s is that it can be folded tight without leaving a gap between the two halves of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ol4DgmeOlkkDIh9RevGsPWXQqM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140909/DSCF74642.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PnCZst"&gt;The disadvantage is apparent in the display. The OLED panel itself looks decent enough, with good contrast and brightness, and while the resolution isn’t class-leading it’s sharp enough at 308 ppi. The problem is that because the screen has a larger bend radius than the Galaxy Fold’s, which folds at an acute angle on the inside, more of that crease is visible when the phone is unfolded. Basically, the crease is much bigger. I don’t find it too distracting, as it’s only really visible when light catches it the wrong way. But you can definitely feel the hinge behind the screen whenever you swipe across the middle, which isn’t ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zEFfg"&gt;I can’t really speak to durability other than to say I haven’t seen any problems in my month-plus with the device. I asked Royole for details on its own ULT-NSSP material used in the “Cicada Wing” display, and a representative wouldn’t confirm whether it was plastic or glass, only saying it’s “composed of ~100 micro-nano materials.” They also said it’s “shatterproof and functional after close to two million folds,” which makes me think it’s plastic. It definitely feels like plastic. But so does Samsung’s “ultra-thin glass,” so. Just know that Royole is not yet the one to make folding screens feel premium to the touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaSaSC"&gt;The FlexPai 2 has high-end specs inside, with a Snapdragon 865 processor, up to 12GB of RAM, and a 4,450mAh battery. I found performance to be pretty good, with few of the software issues that plagued the original FlexPai whenever you wanted to switch up the orientation. As I mentioned before, I haven’t been able to use this as a primary device because of its onboard software, but Royole’s WaterOS does seem to have been improved quite a bit from the original FlexPai.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RntZ8-bUMhjFKrmUeCc87QGrAyI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140907/DSCF7462.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The FlexPai 2’s hinge is much sleeker than the original’s.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TXO0Jb"&gt;At 9,998 yuan, or roughly $1,500, the FlexPai 2 is still not exactly cheap. And Royole’s status as a newcomer to the mobile industry is another good reason to view the device with suspicion. But my experience of the hardware has been fairly positive, and Royole’s screen technology may well find itself into phones from other companies at some point; ZTE has been touted as an early partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="nr6yef"&gt;It’s still hard to recommend buying a folding phone from anyone, but Royole does deserve some credit for making a major improvement on its initial effort. The original FlexPai was a hasty attempt at notoriety, but its sequel feels like a much more credible device. If Royole can nail the software and maybe get the price down a little further for a Western release, it could be worth a look if you’re enamored with the form factor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Put Baby Yoda on your wrist with Vodafone and Disney’s Neo smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMPc4e_rqCPanLh6k1-Bc6sIAIA=/141x0:831x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68427783/Tablet_L_460x1844_TheChild.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vodafone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S11oSF"&gt;European mobile carrier Vodafone has partnered with Disney to launch a new wearable for kids called &lt;a href="https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/press-release/vodafone-unveils-neo-the-game-changing-smart-watch-designed-for-kids-and-featuring-iconic-characters-from-disney-pixar-marvel-and-star-wars/"&gt;the Neo&lt;/a&gt;. Vodafone says the Neo combines its technological capabilities with Disney’s entertainment chops to offer a wearable that gives kids a sense of independence while letting parents stay in contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUL28t"&gt;The Neo’s most notable feature is its Disney branding. The Yves Béhar-designed watch lets kids choose from a collection of “Sidekicks” that will hang out on the main clock screen, including The Child / Baby Yoda / Grogu from &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, Buzz Lightyear from &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;, and Minnie Mouse. Vodafone says the Sidekicks will animate throughout the day, and the company plans to add more characters over time at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgVeLJ8M96k5GiI0TNnLACTmlzk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137589/1300x910_uk.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the Neo smartwatch with the Vodafone Smart app for controlling privacy settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MgtV38"&gt;Besides the injection of Disney charm, the Neo is mostly focused on keeping parents in touch with their kids, with a few added smartwatch features (though all of this requires a Vodafone subscription). With the watch, parents can call, text, and get updates on their kid’s location from the companion Vodafone Smart app. Parents can use the same app to create a “circle” of trusted contacts for texting and calling and limit screen time with Quiet Mode. To boost kid’s “independence,” the Neo can also receive calendar updates, check the weather, track activity, and take photos with a built-in 5-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F012Ev"&gt;Wearables for kids are not a new category, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Ftimex-familyconnect%3Fsku%3D610214661166&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22056770%2Fdisney-vodafone-neo-smartwatch-children-yves-behar-star-wars-baby-yoda#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; has its own take, and you can also get your Baby Yoda fix with the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fverizon-gizmowatch-disney-edition%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22056770%2Fdisney-vodafone-neo-smartwatch-children-yves-behar-star-wars-baby-yoda#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GizmoWatch Disney Edition&lt;/a&gt; at Verizon. Even Apple has gotten into the game with Family Setup in watchOS 7, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21518711/apple-watch-family-setup-test-review-features-explainer"&gt;we looked at earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The problems with smartwatches for kids are twofold: parents have to decide how much of their child’s privacy they’re willing to sacrifice to keep them safe, and usually, these watches aren’t very great in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqWeov"&gt;Vodafone says the Neo won’t be released in Europe until early 2021, where it should retail for £99 with £7-a-month subscription. If the Neo’s specific Disney wrapper piques your family’s interest, you can &lt;a href="https://eshop.v.vodafone.com/uk/neo-smart-kids-watch"&gt;sign up for the waitlist today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfYBX1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 3rd, 7:30PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Added mention of the Verizon GizmoWatch Disney Edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 promises faster speeds, better cameras, and more powerful AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6a14hgx76gzOvv3hgM8fBuQEU0o=/0x0:9504x6336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68344585/Snapdragon_888_Reference_Design.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z9hSKi"&gt;Qualcomm teased the Snapdragon 888, its latest 5G-equipped flagship smartphone processor, on the first day of its Snapdragon Tech Summit. But at the day two keynote, the company provided all of the details on the new chipset, which will be the brains powering almost every major 2021 Android flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9KveO"&gt;First off, the basic specs: the new processor will feature Qualcomm’s new Kryo 680 CPU, which will be one of the first devices to feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;Arm’s latest customized Cortex-X1 core&lt;/a&gt; and promises up to 25 percent higher performance than last year’s chip with a maximum clock speed of 2.84GHz. And the company’s new Adreno 660 GPU promises a 35 percent jump on graphics rendering, in what it says is the biggest performance leap for its GPUs yet. The new CPU and GPU are also more power-efficient compared to those on the Snapdragon 875, with a 25 percent improvement for the Kyro 680 and a 20 percent improvement on the Adreno 660.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LIPU5J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;25 percent faster CPU and the biggest GPU performance jump yet for Qualcomm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vYhpfn"&gt;Another key difference between the Snapdragon 888 and last year’s 865 is that Qualcomm has finally integrated its 5G modem directly into the SoC. That means manufacturers won’t have to deal with finding the space (and power) for a second external modem. Specifically, the Snapdragon 888 will feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142381/qualcomm-x60-modem-5g-phones-faster-power-efficient-5nm-carrier"&gt;Qualcomm’s 5nm X60 modem&lt;/a&gt;, which the company announced back in February, and it will enable better carrier aggregation and download speeds up to 7.5 Gbps on new devices. The Snapdragon 888 will also support Wi-Fi 6 as well as the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;6GHz Wi-Fi 6E standard&lt;/a&gt;, which should boost that rollout by making it the default on most Android flagships. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LdtnwNqp5q7047kNwkKFGZ0I_VY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137067/Snapdragon_888_Mockup.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OTWpU2"&gt;As is tradition for a Snapdragon update, Qualcomm is also putting a big emphasis on its camera improvements. The new Spectra 580 ISP is the first from Qualcomm to feature a triple ISP, allowing it to do things like capture three simultaneous 4K HDR video streams or three 28-megapixel photos at once at up to 2.7 gigapixels per second (35 percent faster than last year). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SViRM7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Capture three simultaneous 4K HDR video streams at once&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G0tDND"&gt;It also offers improved burst capabilities and is capable of capturing up to 120 photos in a single second at a 10-megapixel resolution. Lastly, the upgraded ISP adds computational HDR to 4K videos, an improved low-light capture architecture, and the option to shoot photos in 10-bit color in HEIF. That said, it’ll be up to phone manufacturers to build cameras that can take advantage of the new features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsXwcb"&gt;The final major changes come in AI performance, thanks to Qualcomm’s new Hexagon 780 AI processor. The Snapdragon 888 features Qualcomm’s sixth-generation AI Engine, which it promises will help improve everything from computational photography to gaming to voice assistant performance. The Snapdragon 888 can perform 26 trillion operations per second (TOPS), compared to 15 TOPS on the Snapdragon 865, while delivering three times better power efficiency. Additionally, Qualcomm is promising big improvements in both scalar and tensor AI tasks as part of those upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4m24b"&gt;The Snapdragon 888 also features the second-generation Qualcomm Sensing Hub, a dedicated low-power AI processor for smaller hardware-based tasks, like identifying when you raise your phone to light up the display. The new second-gen Sensing Hub is dramatically improved, which means the phone will be able to rely less on the main Hexagon processor for those tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9agPT"&gt;All of this adds up to a substantial boost in Qualcomm’s — and therefore, nearly every Android flagship’s — capabilities for what our smartphones will be able to do. The first Snapdragon 888 smartphones are expected to show up in early 2021, which means it won’t be long before we’ll be able to try out the next generation of Android flagships for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor will power the Android flagships of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dHGWnY3DYG6pWSxWMVrDfyD_tRg=/0x0:4936x3291/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68042714/Snapdragon_888_Front_Chip_in_Studio__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y47fNj"&gt;Qualcomm has officially announced the Snapdragon 888 at its Snapdragon Tech Summit, offering a first look at its next-generation flagship smartphone processor. The 888 will power the next wave of 2021 Android flagships from companies like Samsung, OnePlus, LG, Sony, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zmJfw"&gt;In a first for the company’s top-of-the-line 8-series chipsets, the Snapdragon 888 is making a big improvement for 5G: it’ll finally offer a fully integrated 5G modem, unlike last year’s Snapdragon 865 (which required that manufacturers include a separate modem chip inside the cramped interior of a modern smartphone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OybY60"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The future of Android flagships is here&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z9hHpK"&gt;The Snapdragon 888 will feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142381/qualcomm-x60-modem-5g-phones-faster-power-efficient-5nm-carrier"&gt;Qualcomm’s X60 modem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-x60-5g-modem"&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, which jumps to a 5nm process for better power efficiency and improvements for 5G carrier aggregation across the mmWave and sub-6GHz bands of the spectrum. Between the new 5nm architecture and the power efficiency gains from an integrated modem, the new chip looks to offer some substantial battery improvements when it comes to 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvxQx3"&gt;In addition to the 5G improvements, Qualcomm also teased several other advances coming to the Snapdragon 888, including the company’s sixth-gen AI Engine (running on a “redesigned” Qualcomm Hexagon processor), which promises a big jump in performance and power efficiency for AI tasks. The Snapdragon 888 also will feature the “most significant upgrade in Qualcomm Adreno GPU performance,” though specifics on what kind of improvements are coming have yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58DDc6"&gt;Lastly, Qualcomm previewed new photography features that the Snapdragon 888 will enable, including the ability to shoot roughly 120 photos per second at 12-megapixel resolution, thanks to the updated ISP (which is up to 35 percent faster). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4He7pw"&gt;Per Qualcomm’s usual practice, today’s announcement is just a first look at the Snapdragon 888. A more comprehensive overview of the specs and improvements being offered with this year’s chipset will arrive in the Snapdragon Tech Summit’s second day of keynotes, on December 2nd. And given Qualcomm’s near-total dominance when it comes to providing chips for almost every major smartphone in the US, the debut of the Snapdragon 888 isn’t just a first look at Qualcomm’s latest advances: it’s a preview of what to expect from phones like Samsung’s Galaxy S21 lineup and other top Android phones for 2021, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vcAwx"&gt;We’ll have additional details on the Snapdragon 888 tomorrow as the summit continues, so check back for more information soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwtJRk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZVcYT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung rumored to discontinue Galaxy Note line, add stylus support to 2021 Galaxy S and Z Fold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Note20 smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VwJHtx68dVO66jyKz49HEDxIQUQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68042605/dbohn_200817_4133_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U09Ahm"&gt;Samsung will reportedly discontinue its Galaxy Note phone line in 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-smartphone-idUSKBN28B3U5"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as the company contends with falling demand for pricey smartphones caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the company is set to focus on its flagship Galaxy S lineup of phones, while Samsung’s foldable phones (like the Z Flip and Z Fold) will take the place of the Galaxy Note as Samsung’s more experimental premium devices, complete with an optional stylus accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBBCwD"&gt;The idea that Samsung would stop selling the Galaxy Note line of phones in favor of the Galaxy S models makes a lot of sense. In the earlier years of the Note, the two lines of phones were distinct: the Galaxy S models were smaller, more mainstream devices, while the comparatively massive Note lineup hewed closer to a tablet, complete with the iconic stylus that helped set it apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="U0rMBr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Note’s success in popularizing big-screened phones may have been its undoing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8aECpr"&gt;But the Note’s success in popularizing big-screened phones may have proved to be its undoing. When the original Galaxy Note was introduced in 2011, its then-massive 5.3-inch display let it tower over other phones, like the 4.3-inch Galaxy S II that Samsung had released in 2011. But fast-forward to 2020, and phones like the Galaxy S20 Ultra and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra are effectively competiting against each other for the same audience, with far more similar specs, screen sizes, and functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXfvlh"&gt;In an era where Samsung is already developing and shipping cheaper smartphones in mere months — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451701/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-price-release-date-specs-features"&gt;like the Galaxy S20 FE&lt;/a&gt;, which released earlier this year to directly respond to consumer demand for a lower-cost midrange phone that still offered some of Samsung’s more premium features — it’s hard to justify the existence of a second lineup of flagships. That’s especially true when the only real outlier that sets the Note apart today is the stylus, something that Samsung appears to be trickling down to the standard Galaxy S lineup in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V4d1ej"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In a world of giant smartphones, the Note doesn’t stand out anymore&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EPhDgg"&gt;The other factor is the Galaxy Note lineup just isn’t that special anymore. In prior years, Samsung used the Note to experiment with some of its bolder and more interesting new innovations and design changes. For instance, the Note lineup helped popularize the edge display and featured larger swappable batteries, an IR blaster, the removal of the microSD card slot, and several generations of influential Galaxy hardware design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDfYCB"&gt;But its role of Samsung’s futuristic test platform has been wholly usurped by foldable phones like the Galaxy Z Fold, which promise meaningfully bigger screens than the traditional Galaxy S and Note lineups and the kind of bold new hardware that used to be the calling card of the Note. Add a stylus — which Samsung is reportedly planning to offer as an optional accessory — and the Z Fold lineup is a practically perfect heir to the Note lineup’s unique strengths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whw2I7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
