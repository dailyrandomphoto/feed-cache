    <title>WhatsApp launches its ‘View Once’ disappearing photos and videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KSZLcAXWiRCxmmTDWpvTBWGCTZs=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69674643/EN__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: WhatsApp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ByfzID"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/view-once-photos-and-videos-on-whatsapp"&gt;WhatsApp is rolling out&lt;/a&gt; its “View Once” feature today, which deletes photos or videos from your chat after they’ve been opened by the recipient. When sending a photo or video, you can make it view once by tapping the “1” button to the left of the send button. After the recipient opens it, it’ll be deleted. The recipient will be able to see that it’s a disappearing photo, so it’s still the type of thing you’d only want to use for people you trust to not take a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkaq4I"&gt;In June, Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466425/whatsapp-multi-device-support-disappearing-mode-view-once-features-confirmed"&gt;confirmed that the feature would be coming&lt;/a&gt;, though details about when it would release were scarce. &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-rolling-out-photos-and-videos-set-to-view-once/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WaBetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the feature has been in beta for about a month. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7BP8SKBE5QH9dzr94PTwTZ_K8Wo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759545/comp_VIEW_ONCE_EN_16x9_v012_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: WhatsApp&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The recipient will be left with a bubble simply saying “opened.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uYH8tW"&gt;As an example of how the feature could be used, WhatsApp uses the example of sending a photo of sensitive information, like a Wi-Fi password. Of course, there are perhaps other less wholesome uses for this kind of feature. But either way, it’s useful to have an option between the &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/about-disappearing-messages"&gt;app’s disappearing messages&lt;/a&gt;, which currently only go away after a week, and your chat’s permanent record.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OtterBox’s latest gaming clip jumps aboard the MagSafe train</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Otterbox MagSafe gaming clip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xYK6kH2AtpcOyPAWg1Br0zrEG4M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69673837/otterboxmagsafe.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OtterBox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aob8Dy"&gt;OtterBox’s latest gaming controller clip is MagSafe-compatible for iPhone 12 devices, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/xbox-x%7Cs--xbox-one--xbox-elite-wireless-series-2-controllers/mobile-gaming-clip-for-magsafe/77-82969.html#tab5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;and it costs $39.99&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338087/otterbox-mobile-gaming-clip-review-xbox-controller-cloud-price"&gt;previous $30 gaming clip&lt;/a&gt; that we reviewed earlier this year, it streamlines the process of connecting your phone to a controller clip by letting it snap on seamlessly with the help of magnets — in other words, MagSafe technology (TM). This solution is preferable to traditional controller clips that clamp around the edges of your phone’s display. I just wish that this one worked with other phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQis5B"&gt;Some MagSafe-compatible accessories can also charge iPhone 12-series models, but in this case, OtterBox’s MagSafe gaming clip seems to boil down to “it’s a circular magnetic surface.” There are no other special features listed on its product page, aside from being able to detach the magnetic arm from the controller to serve as a phone stand. Also, you don’t need to own an OtterBox MagSafe case, but the company says you’ll get the “best experience and protection” if you do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Otterbox MagSafe gaming clip" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3lTBjPZU0M3ISOevsg-UkFKQGBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759096/otterboxmagsafe2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OtterBox&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The clip can detach from the controller to work in tabletop mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4psGIg"&gt;In terms of controller compatibility, OtterBox says on its site that this new clip will fit the newer Xbox Series X / S controller, the previous Xbox One wireless controller, or the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller. Oddly, it also provides the disclaimer that the clip was designed to “ensure zero interference” with controller functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sa2TTX"&gt;It’s easy to read that and think, “Wait, can magnets interfere with Bluetooth?” If that were the case, Bluetooth speakers, among many other devices, wouldn’t operate properly. What I think it means is that your controller will work normally. Perhaps the company just needed another line to plug in that its product has MagSafe compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mDdod"&gt;The MagSafe gaming clip is available now for iPhone 12 owners who want the convenience of attaching their phone to their gaming clip with magnets and don’t mind paying the $10 premium. Otherwise, you can make do with OtterBox’s previous model that works as intended with practically any phone running a modern mobile OS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme launches MagDart magnetic wireless charging devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_uLABIWNFvtb7IAxYfsNGoK0h4=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671195/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.009___.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5RDuFl"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595550/realme-flash-magdart-wireless-charging-magnetic-android-specs"&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt;, Realme is working on a magnetic wireless charging system for its Android phones, and today it’s revealed a full range of products that’ll use the new technology. Realme is calling the system MagDart, and it’s basically a high-powered take on Apple’s MagSafe system for the iPhone 12 range of phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8jHox"&gt;The key product in the lineup is the 50W MagDart charger, which Realme says is the world’s fastest magnetic wireless charger. It has an inescapably bulky cuboid design that makes room for a cooling fan, but Realme is banking that users will make the tradeoff for faster charging speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oD8xGq"&gt;When plugged into the company’s 65W SuperDart wired charger, Realme claims that the MagDart charger will fill a 4,500mAh phone battery up to 100 percent in 54 minutes. That’s almost as fast as what you get from Realme’s 50W wired charger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UMWayB2ya6IR8I5bD7B1J1qihsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757981/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.011___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RFObBC"&gt;If you don’t want to have to plug a charging brick into a charging brick, Realme is also working on a somewhat sleeker and more convenient 15W MagDart charger, which basically looks like Apple’s MagSafe puck — though Realme points out it’s 26.4 percent thinner and claims faster charging speeds. It’ll fill a 4,500mAh battery in 90 minutes, according to Realme, which would indeed be &lt;a href="https://www.cambrionix.com/magsafe-usb-c-charging-speed-tested"&gt;much faster&lt;/a&gt; than Apple’s own 15W option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RA93AmxmWRjo782pjm_7h35o2XE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757985/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.021___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H9ZFQG"&gt;Wireless charging convenience aside, a major advantage of a magnetic design like MagDart and MagSafe is the potential for slick portless accessories, and Realme has a bunch of those as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6mfuyn"&gt;The 2-in-1 MagDart Power Bank is similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Apple’s recently-released MagSafe Battery Pack,&lt;/a&gt; but it comes with a dock that lets you use the battery as a phone stand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVPrDZ-dVzmqXS8K8vO_CQ9Fbck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758014/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.001___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZKrtej"&gt;The MagDart Case is a carbon fiber-style case for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534618/realme-gt-hands-on-europe-launch-price-specs"&gt;the new Realme GT flagship phone&lt;/a&gt; with a passthrough USB-C port and headphone jack as well as built-in MagDart connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQa74990q8Wpfirf_vgZoOLEsUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758017/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.043___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="mbW209"&gt;The MagDart Wallet is, you guessed it, a three-card sleeve similar to Apple’s MagSafe wallet. But this one has a kickstand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8jKMiMMweJ5mfrbwMxdsjwDKU9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758020/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.040___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="qQDjyf"&gt;Perhaps best of all is the MagDart Beauty Light, a flip-up ring light for selfies that’s powered by reverse wireless charging. It has 60 mini LEDs and a dedicated control button that lets you adjust settings like brightness and color temperature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V5tmot1sqNpTLFLqUmEHiD6E5ks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758023/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.038___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1wpXkD"&gt;Realme hasn’t said anything about a release date or pricing for any of these products, and the sole existing phone confirmed to work with any MagDart device is the Realme GT — and that’s only if you buy the dedicated case. Realme is demonstrating the ecosystem with a “concept phone” called the Realme Flash, which is pictured in the above images and does have MagDart directly built in, but there aren’t any plans to actually release it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhvDRX"&gt;That’s a pretty big catch for what’s ostensibly a launch for a major new ecosystem of products. But if Realme does integrate MagDart into its future phones, it could be a solid differentiator. Wireless charging is consistently one of the key omissions from Chinese phones that otherwise have impressive spec sheets — Oppo only recently adopted the tech, and Vivo is yet to get on board. And since Oppo’s VOOC fast-charging system made its way to OnePlus and Realme phones due to the companies’ shared ownership and supply chain, it’s plausible that the same could happen with MagDart.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s new hotspot plans are built for your #vanlife dreams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W4TuZei39F0XAwRboLP5ZsDXM78=/98x0:1133x690/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69653612/mobile_hotspot_1230x690.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon’s hotspot plans offer mobile data that can be shared with other devices in your luxury camper van, er, house.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Verizon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H6FUdT"&gt;Verizon has introduced &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/plans/devices/hotspots/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new mobile hotspot plans&lt;/a&gt;, with four options to choose from starting at 15GB for $20 per month up to 150GB for $80 per month. They offer standalone and unlimited plan add-on mobile hotspot data that’s ready to be taken on the road. Maybe in a Class B Winnebago Solis with a pop-up sleeping compartment, as featured on &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, south through the redwoods and along the coast and then on through the painted deserts of the Southwest. What? I said that out loud? I mean, hypothetically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRuuTj"&gt;Anyway, the most basic plan, Essential, offers low-band Nationwide 5G and 4G LTE connectivity. The three more expensive plans — creatively named Plus, Pro, and Premium — include Ultra Wideband 5G, which encompasses the very fast, limited-range mmWave flavor of 5G as well as upcoming mid-band spectrum that should deliver broad coverage and fast performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h6QtC8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;some of us (me) pay for unlimited data on Verizon that inexplicably can’t be used via mobile hotspot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B1c2Yg"&gt;The plans promise certain monthly premium data allotments; if they’re exceeded, data will be slower for the remainder of the month. Essential and Plus are available to Verizon customers, while Pro and Premium can be either added to an unlimited plan or purchased as standalone products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jk11h"&gt;This is all well and good, but while we’re on the subject of unlimited plans, let’s not forget that some of us (me) pay for unlimited data on Verizon that inexplicably can’t be used via mobile hotspot. Let’s say (hypothetically) you’re sitting around your freezing cold house in March during a power outage waiting for the heat and the Wi-Fi to come back on and you think you’d like to get a little work done by switching on your phone’s mobile hotspot feature. Nope! Because you picked the cheapest unlimited plan, you’re stuck working on offline Google Docs until the power comes back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkKL9r"&gt;Well, now I (hypothetically) have a couple of options: pay up for a premium unlimited plan (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425022/verizon-t-mobile-att-phone-promotion-magenta-max-5g-c-band"&gt;exactly what The Man wants us to do&lt;/a&gt;), or buy a mobile hotspot, load that baby up with Premium Unlimited hotspot data and take off on a dreamy #vanlife tour of the Pacific Coast in an imaginary Winnebago Solis. The white one, not the red one. Let’s not get carried away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola debuts Edge 20 flagships globally with fast refresh screens and 108-megapixel cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c6wqOigeWXYwlkB318-eVG-AgLc=/0x102:2000x1435/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69651710/Edge_family_2021_sm.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Motorola Edge 20 Pro, Edge 20, and Edge 20 Lite all support 5G and come with a 6.7-inch OLED.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BYOUQf"&gt;Motorola is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21229740/motorola-edge-plus-android-phone-display-features-camera-specs-hands-on"&gt;keeping its return to flagship devices running&lt;/a&gt; for the second year in a row with today’s global announcement of the Edge 20 Pro, Edge 20, and Edge 20 Lite. The top-end 20 Pro includes a periscope-style telephoto lens for the first time in a Motorola device and includes a Snapdragon 870 processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8G23N3"&gt;All three devices support sub-6GHz 5G, offer 108-megapixel rear-facing cameras, and include 6.7-inch OLED screens with fast refresh rates. They’re due to arrive in August in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. While Motorola doesn’t offer specifics, it says that it plans to bring a 5G Edge device to North America this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f8gGM8Ni6wMaaQ40TnvV0kCJ6QE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748778/Motorola_edge_20_pro_Indigo_Vegan_Leather_combo_sm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Edge 20 Pro comes in a handsome indigo vegan leather option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xxwhnE"&gt;Priced at €699 (about $830), Edge 20 Pro comes with many features common to the premium midrange class, including a Gorilla Glass 5 front panel, a 144Hz screen refresh rate, and 12GB of RAM with its capable 800-series chipset. Its main rear camera uses a 108-megapixel 1/1.52-inch sensor and f/1.9 aperture, specs that line up with last year’s Edge Plus camera. There’s also a new 8-megapixel 5x telephoto periscope-style camera with optical image stabilization. A 16-megapixel ultrawide does double duty as a macro camera, along with a 32-megapixel selfie camera around front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62mzj2"&gt;A couple of specs don’t quite measure up to the flagship class, though, which was something we noted about its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241919/motorola-edge-plus-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;“great but not quite good enough” Edge Plus predecessor&lt;/a&gt;. For starters, Motorola is committing to only two OS upgrades for the device, which ships with Android 11 — a policy that lags behind much of the field. The 4,500mAh battery can be charged via fast 30W wired charging but there’s no support for wireless charging. And its IP52 rating means it’s protected against splashes of water, but isn’t guaranteed to survive full submersion like the IP68-rated Samsung Galaxy S21. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J6vMmqTCTBBdwoes7UPsds_xjcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748783/Motorola_edge_20_Frosted_Onyx_hero_sm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Edge 20 offers a 3x telephoto lens rather than the 5x periscope zoom on the 20 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M2tWAB"&gt;The €499 (about $590) Edge 20 gets the same 6.7-inch OLED with 144Hz refresh rate (though just Gorilla Glass 3 on the front), but includes a stepped-down Snapdragon 778 processor. Rather than the periscope zoom, it offers a stabilized 8-megapixel 3x telephoto camera, but its main and ultrawide cameras match those on the 20 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TkhdvJprhyVHhDEIFM43iXokRS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748786/Motorola_edge_20_lite_Cyber_Teal_hero_sm.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Edge 20 Lite packs a bigger 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JazrSK"&gt;The budget-friendliest Edge 20 Lite, priced at €349 (about $415), uses a MediaTek Dimensity 5G-B chipset, includes a 6.7-inch OLED with a slower-but-still-fast 90Hz refresh rate, skips the telephoto camera altogether, and includes a bigger 5,000mAh battery. It maintains the IP52 rating of the other two devices and still includes 30W fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvb9ut"&gt;We liked last year’s Edge phones, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21347201/motorola-edge-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;the more attractively priced midrange Edge&lt;/a&gt;, and a lot of that was thanks to some strong camera capabilities. It’s promising to see Motorola leaning into that strength with a new telephoto lens, though the highest tier device still appears to lack a couple of key specs to compete well in its class. Maybe the midrange will be Motorola’s sweet spot again this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwESPa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction July 29th, 3:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;A previous version of this article stated that Motorola has only guaranteed one Android OS upgrade for the Edge 20 devices; it has committed to two. We regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s P50 announced with Snapdragon 888 and HarmonyOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uhlp_KVEO3mqB6bLNXG4pspHF2o=/0x0:1350x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649677/msedge_IURr7pZvgC.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huawei P50 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9n20KE"&gt;Huawei has announced its latest flagship phones for the Chinese market, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fcn%2Fphones%2Fp50%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F29%2F22598135%2Fhuawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;P50&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fcn%2Fphones%2Fp50-pro%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F29%2F22598135%2Fhuawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;P50 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. They’re the company’s first major phones to launch with HarmonyOS, the company’s own branded mobile operating system, which pairs with Huawei’s typically well-specced cameras and hardware that includes Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 888 processor in some models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enbexA"&gt;The launch of the P50 series has come a little later in the year than the P40 did in 2020, thanks to US sanctions which have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;seriously impacted&lt;/a&gt; Huawei’s ability to produce new phones and restricted its ability to buy chips and other components from companies using US tech. When he first teased the phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464776/huawei-p50-phone-camera-periscope-telephoto-leica-harmonyos"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, Huawei’s consumer business CEO Richard Yu said that a launch date hadn’t been set at the time “for reasons you are all aware of.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YV6Wqz"&gt;These sanctions mean that like other recent Huawei phones, the P50 series won’t include Google’s apps and services if it ever releases outside of China. In fact, according to Huawei, the P50 doesn’t run Android at all, thanks to its own HarmonyOS software. The extent to which HarmonyOS is actually distinct from Android is a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/huaweis-harmonyos-will-rollout-to-100-android-models-over-the-next-year/"&gt;point of some contention&lt;/a&gt;, however, following reports that it’s effectively a fork of Android’s open-source code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8mnC0EjvmrUsSywQErEBjY2xk2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747894/msedge_cpBid3DGiv.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Huawei&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huawei P50.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dOdWfF"&gt;US sanctions have meant that not every P50 uses Huawei’s own Kirin chips. The P50 and one version of the P50 Pro use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fcn%2Fphones%2Fp50%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F29%2F22598135%2Fhuawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fcn%2Fphones%2Fp50-pro%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F29%2F22598135%2Fhuawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sheets&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s site. Qualcomm was granted permission to sell chips to Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565185/us-qualcomm-license-4g-chips-huawei-ban-china-phones"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a version of the P50 Pro shown with Huawei’s own Kirin 9000 processor. The P50 Pro is available with either 8 or 12GB of RAM with up to 512GB of internal storage, while the P50 is available with 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcdRp2"&gt;What you won’t find on the spec sheet of either phone is any mention of 5G. Speaking onstage during the launch event, Huawei consumer business CEO Richard Yu said that US sanctions meant that “5G phones are beyond our reach, and we have to go with 4G by removing the 5G module from our chip design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OawPTQ"&gt;The P50 Pro has a 6.6-inch 120Hz 1228p OLED display, while the P50 has a slightly smaller 6.5-inch 90Hz 1224p OLED display. The P50 Pro has a 4,360mAh battery, compared to a 4,100mAh battery in the P50. Both can be fast charged wired at 66W, and the P50 Pro can be wirelessly charged at 50W. There’s an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPtL2p"&gt;If Huawei’s recent flagships are anything to go by, it’s the P50 series’ cameras that’ll be their most interesting feature. Housed within two circular camera bumps, the P50 Pro has four rear cameras — a 50-megapixel main, 64-megapixel telephoto with a 3.5x optical zoom, a 40-megapixel monochrome, and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide. The P50 has a similar camera bump, but it has one fewer camera lens. It has a 50-megapixel main camera, a 12-megapixel telephoto with a 5x optical zoom, and a 13-megapixel ultrawide. Both have 13-megapixel selfie cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb7QyT"&gt;The P50 Pro starts at 5,988 yuan (around $927) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and will go on general sale in China on August 12th. Huawei says that the first models will ship with its Kirin 9000 processor, with Qualcomm models following at the end of the year. The P50 starts at 4,488 yuan (around $695), also with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and will go on sale in September. It’s unclear if or when either phone will receive a release outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASL3st"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 29th, 10:24AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Richard Yu’s comments about the phones’ lack of 5G support due to US sanctions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung boosts profits and pledges to ‘mainstream’ foldables</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VN8GDHZN3lGUW8I88mgKXi112CY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69648657/vpavic_190731_z_flip_0247_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OdLFlF"&gt;Samsung Electronics has released its second-quarter earnings, reporting 20 percent higher revenue and 54 percent higher operating profit year-on-year despite its mobile division taking a hit due to component shortages. The company made an operating profit of 12.57 trillion won (~$10.97 billion) off 63.67 trillion won (~$55.56 billion) in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z14TCM"&gt;Samsung says its mobile business suffered from the industry-wide component shortage as well as “production disruptions” in its Vietnam factories, some of which were closed after a COVID outbreak. Combined with weak seasonality resulting in less demand, revenue declined from the previous quarter, though it was still up year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hNF4wV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung confirms Z Fold 3 S Pen support as Note line is in limbo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594685/samsung-z-fold-3-stylus-support-note-durability"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="42Li6o"&gt;The semiconductor business continues to be Samsung’s biggest financial driver, contributing more than a third of the company’s revenue and more than half of its profits for the quarter. Samsung says memory demand and price increases were higher than previously forecast, though mobile memory sales were impacted by the same issues as seen by the smartphone division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbOeNE"&gt;Looking forward to the rest of the year, Samsung says it will “solidify its leadership in the premium [smartphone] segment by mainstreaming the foldable category,” while the display division confirmed it’s working on under-screen camera technology. Samsung has an event set for August 11th where it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594685/samsung-z-fold-3-stylus-support-note-durability"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it’ll announce new phones in the Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip lines.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s new prepaid offer is a direct play for the Boost customers it sold to Dish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZrffFC9Q_1SR134a9mRQi1GNxBw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645783/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile is offering customers who switch from an MVNO a discount on an unlimited Metro plan with 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PPbUJx"&gt;T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Fswitch-to-metro-by-t-mobile-get-a-free-5g-phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F28%2F22598163%2Ft-mobile-metro-5g-prepaid-boost-cricket-switch-promotion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;introducing a new prepaid promotion&lt;/a&gt; with incentives for customers on other prepaid MVNOs to switch to Metro by T-Mobile, including waiving switching fees, a discount on an unlimited plan with 5G, and a trade-in offer for a new 5G phone. In other words, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"&gt;it’s doing exactly what it told regulators it wouldn’t do&lt;/a&gt; when it acquired Sprint a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="883y0L"&gt;The US wireless market is lousy with 5G phone trade-in offers and 5G plan upgrades these days, but this one stands out in its direct pitch to lure Boost Mobile customers to T-Mobile’s prepaid brand — the same customers it was ordered to sell to Dish network with the intention of setting the company up as a fourth wireless carrier to replace Sprint. It’s also what Dish warned might be coming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;in a plea to the Federal Communications Commission earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AJZy7t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many Boost customers need a device upgrade by January 1st, 2022, which T-Mobile is happily offering to facilitate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vdm8eb"&gt;The promotion also appears to specifically appeal to Boost customers on Sprint’s old CDMA network — a network T-Mobile owns and operates and announced it would be shutting down on an unusually aggressive timeline. This leaves many Boost customers in need of a device upgrade by January 1st, 2022, which T-Mobile is happily offering to facilitate if they switch to Metro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlQkHS"&gt;“Get half off your unlimited line when you switch from Boost or Cricket by bringing your phone number to Metro by T-Mobile and trading in ANY working device for a limited time. Yes, any — even that old flip phone!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NC1pwS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This new promotion is perhaps its most obvious play yet to win back Boost customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PJpm4H"&gt;The deal provides customers who switch and trade in a phone with a two-year discounted $25-per-month price on an unlimited plan with 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZjE2R"&gt;T-Mobile’s track record of keeping its Sprint merger promises is shaky at best. It has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585761/dish-t-mobile-att-sprint-competition-editorial"&gt;failed to create jobs it said it would&lt;/a&gt;, and while it has technically fulfilled its requirements to Dish Network, like selling Boost and providing wholesale network service, it hasn’t exactly been helpful either. This new promotion is perhaps its most obvious play yet to win back Boost customers — the very customers Dish will need to retain if it’s going to becoming a full-fledged carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Poco’s latest high-performance phone is the $299 X3 GT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GYcao46lxLmIxrh9ooVfJ3lWrNw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643530/DSCF7729_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Poco X3 GT looks very similar to the Chinese version of Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 10 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8COsr8"&gt;Xiaomi spin-off Poco has announced yet another X3 phone. The X3 GT follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344126/poco-f3-x3-pro-snapdragon-860-870-announced-specs"&gt;X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21426866/xiaomi-poco-x3-nfc-hands-on-price-specs-release"&gt;X3 NFC&lt;/a&gt;, this time focusing on performance with a fast 120Hz screen and a new MediaTek processor. It’s mostly a rebranded version of &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_note_10_pro_(china)-10930.php"&gt;Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which was released last month in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHyhTy"&gt;MediaTek is often associated with lower-end devices, but its Dimensity processors for 2021 feature configurations of Arm cores that aren’t too far off what you’d find in a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. The 6nm Dimensity 1100 in the Poco X3 GT has four A78 cores at 2.6GHz and four lower-power A55 cores at 2GHz — compare that to the Snapdragon 888’s single 2.84GHz X1, three 2.42GHz A78s, and four 1.8GHz A55s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJAMcv"&gt;We found the similar Dimensity 1200 to be a capable performer in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;review of the new OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt;. The main difference between that chip and the 1100 is that one of its A78 cores is clocked to 3GHz.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D1p8YLZUojD4vfrhtudsB997qdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745168/DSCF7732_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Poco X3 GT runs Xiaomi’s MIUI.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EHXr2S"&gt;The X3 GT is the fastest charging Poco phone to date, with a 5,000mAh battery that fills up at 67W at a claimed 42 minutes for a full charge. The primary camera has a 64-megapixel sensor, and there’s also an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel macro lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPVZVm"&gt;Other standout features include a proper linear motor for flagship-level haptic feedback, as well as a 6.6-inch 1080p 120Hz LCD display. Since the screen is an LCD, the fingerprint sensor is located on the sleep/wake button on the side, as opposed to under the display as is common with OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BqBQD"&gt;Poco hasn’t provided full release details just yet, but the X3 GT’s starting MSRP is listed at $299, which of course is likely to differ across various markets. It’ll be released first in regions including southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa, and will come with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PkzZGDDed11lv9m_-iJR-bX2BNA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745169/DSCF7731_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The X3 GT has a 64-megapixel primary camera.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rDdvfn"&gt;Last year’s Axon 20 5G from ZTE was the world’s first commercially-available phone to put a front-facing camera underneath its display. It was an impressive step forward for phone technology but there was one big problem: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;the camera sucked&lt;/a&gt;. It took lousy pictures and the module distorted the display in certain settings. Now, ZTE is trying again with &lt;a href="https://www.zte.com.cn/global/about/news/20210727e1.html"&gt;the updated Axon 30&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to offer some improvements over its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0SLBp"&gt;First, a little spec dump. The Axon 30 has a 6.92-inch AMOLED screen with 120Hz refresh rate and FHD+ resolution, all powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 870 5G chipset. There’s a four-camera array on the rear of the device, with a 64-megapixel main, 8-megapixel 120-degree wide-angle, 5-megapixel macro lens, and an additional depth-of-field lens. The battery has a 4200mAh capacity and 55W fast charging, and, as per &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/zte_axon_30_5g_brings_a_secondgen_ud_camera_snapdragon_870_and_55w_charging-news-50255.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you have the options of 6GB / 8GB / 12GB of RAM and 128GB / 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gddVE9"&gt;But the most interesting updates for the Axon 30 are to the under-display camera. For these under-display modules to work, you have to use transparent materials in that area of the screen, which are a fairly recent development and so lower-quality compared to regular display tech. For the Axon 30, ZTE says it’s doubled the pixel density in this area from 200 PPI to 400 PPI, which should make for a more seamless integration with the display. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A comparison of the Axon 20 (left) and Axon 30 (right) under-display screens. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RKuy1r"&gt;ZTE says it’s also improved the under-display camera itself. You can see in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;our hands-on with the Axon 20&lt;/a&gt; last year that pictures from this camera were hazy and soft in good lighting, and introduced a ton of noise in bad lightning. The camera was a great technical achievement, sure, but not on par with regular front-facing lenses. Based on the shot below, though, from popular phone informant Ice Universe (aka @&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/universeice"&gt;UniverseIce&lt;/a&gt;), there may be some improvements with the Axon 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0iOsD4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a selfie with plenty of light outdoors. &lt;a href="https://t.co/24xEir7E8r"&gt;pic.twitter.com/24xEir7E8r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1419993869911924740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gTYLjn"&gt;We’ll obviously have to wait to try the phone ourselves to give you a full evaluation, but don’t hold your breath for any miracles. As Ice Universe notes, the picture above was taken outdoors with plenty of light, an in response to a Twitter user suggesting they need to try out the camera in worse conditions, Ice Universe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1419996698449911810"&gt;responds&lt;/a&gt;: “Such a poor performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iCdyZ"&gt;Another photo from Ice suggests the under-display camera is also visible when the screen is turned off, but that’s hardly a big deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTIfQK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZteAxon30?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ZteAxon30&lt;/a&gt;  But the camera is not completely invisible. When the screen is off, you can see it, just like we can see the fingerprint sensor under the sun. &lt;a href="https://t.co/sNNvReVf3p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sNNvReVf3p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1420001203321139209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P4FCjt"&gt;The ZTE Axon 30 is launching in China first, with &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; reporting that sales will begin on August 3rd. Price start at CNY 2,198 ($338) for the 6GB / 128GB model and CNY 3,098 ($476) for the 12GB / 256GB version. Global availability and pricing will be coming later. &lt;/p&gt;
