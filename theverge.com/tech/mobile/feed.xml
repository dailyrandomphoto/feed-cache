    <title>T-Mobile is offering iPhone owners no-hassle network ‘test drives’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-1kBqP2Ll5BefEiR2iNNntXf0eY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69519885/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you own a compatible iPhone, you can try out T-Mobile just by downloading an app.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gMRljy"&gt;T-Mobile is offering a new, low-stakes way to try out its network for free for 30 days with no additional equipment required. &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ossbsscx/t-mobile-taps-esim-tech-for-free-network-test-drive/d/d-id/770535?"&gt;Identified by &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile’s existing &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Ffree-trial&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F29%2F22555810%2Ft-mobile-test-drive-iphone-esim" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Test Drive program&lt;/a&gt; now works over eSIM with compatible iPhones. All you need to do is download an app, follow the instructions to start the trial with eSIM, and you’re up and running — no billing information required. There’s no change to your current carrier plan or phone number, but you’ll be using T-Mobile data on your device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyeTK3"&gt;The Test Drive program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/15/17693228/t-mobile-free-30-day-trials-network-cities"&gt;has been around in one form or another&lt;/a&gt; since 2014. With the most recent iteration — which is still available to those who can’t use the eSIM feature — T-Mobile will send you a free Wi-Fi hotspot you can connect to with your current phone to try out the network. This new eSIM version offers the same kind of trial (30 days or 30GB, whichever you reach first) with less hassle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwsLJWL1Bz9EiIpop6RzCgoKj0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689051/Tmo_trial.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download the app, enter some information, follow the prompts, and you’re good to go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LXRjoU"&gt;T-Mobile says the eSIM option is a pilot program that it introduced last week. Currently, it only works with unlocked iPhones starting with XS and newer devices that are running iOS 14.5 or higher. If you have an iPhone 12-gen device, you’ll also have access to T-Mobile’s 5G network during your trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr4ZsC"&gt;We gave it a shot and it actually is as easy as it looks — just follow the set-up prompts and you’re good to go. It definitely beats visiting a store or carrying a Wi-Fi hotspot. It is, of course, particularly beneficial for T-Mobile, too; the carrier is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425022/verizon-t-mobile-att-phone-promotion-magenta-max-5g-c-band"&gt;looking to flex its relatively strong 5G spectrum holdings&lt;/a&gt; before Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T start catching up later this year with newly acquired C-band frequencies. Getting more customers to try the network and convert now would help it make the most of its 5G “lead.” But in any case, this is one of the easiest ways we’ve seen to try out a new network without ditching your current provider, and if you’re curious what T-Mobile service is like in your area, it’s not a bad way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ZenFone 8 review: an Android iPhone mini</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The ZenFone 8 delivers flagship-level build quality and performance in a small package&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4C38dH"&gt;After a couple of generations making phones with flip-out cameras and increasingly large displays, Asus has taken the ZenFone 8 in a totally different direction: small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSrT9H"&gt;The flipping camera concept lives on in the also-new ZenFone 8 Flip, but it’s no longer a standard feature across this year’s ZenFone lineup. Instead, starting at $629 for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the ZenFone 8 lands in the upper-midrange class with a conventional rear camera bump and a much smaller 5.9-inch display. An 8GB RAM / 256GB storage configuration is also available for $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwwRdC"&gt;Rather than an attention-grabbing camera feature, the focus of this design has been to create a smaller phone that’s comfortable to use in one hand, which Asus has done without skimping on processing power or higher-end features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1hmwn"&gt;It’s an Android iPhone mini, and it’s fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u3cT9V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10494874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Go0J86tAcMmzjPPXSpyPncCJlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499353/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus designed the ZenFone 8 with one-handed operation in mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FW7hIJ"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 screen and design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IhH9SM"&gt;The ZenFone 8 may be small, but that hasn’t kept it from offering the latest flagship processor: a Snapdragon 888 chipset, coupled with 6, 8, or 16GB of RAM (my review unit has 16GB). I can’t find fault with this phone’s performance. It feels responsive, animations and interactions are smooth, and it keeps up with demanding use and rapid app switching. This is performance fitting of a flagship device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cElERS"&gt;The display is a 5.9-inch 1080p OLED panel with a fast 120Hz refresh rate that makes routine interactions with the phone — swiping, scrolling, animations — look much more smooth and polished than a standard 60Hz screen or even a 90Hz panel. By default, the phone will automatically switch between 120 / 90 / 60Hz depending on the application to save battery life, but you can manually select any of those three refresh rates if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EFkcZ"&gt;The display’s 20:9 aspect ratio was carefully considered by Asus. The company says it settled on this slightly narrower format so the phone would fit more easily into a pocket, and it does. I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits. More importantly, it fits well inside a jacket pocket and doesn’t feel like it’s going to flop out if I sit down on the floor to tie my shoes. The ZenFone 8 is rated IP68 for dust protection and some water submersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2grdcK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o69ULu"&gt;The front panel is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus and houses an in-display fingerprint sensor, while the back uses Gorilla Glass 3 with a frosted finish that’s on the matte side of the matte / glossy spectrum. The front panel is flat, but the rear features a slight curve on the long edges for an easier fit in the hand. At 169 grams (5.9 ounces), it’s heavy for its size, and it feels surprisingly dense when you first pick it up. The phone’s frame is aluminum, giving the whole package a high-end look and feel. There’s even a headphone jack on the top edge as a treat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8XM4b"&gt;The power button (an exciting shade of blue!) is well-positioned so my right thumb falls on it naturally with the phone in my hand. Same for the in-screen fingerprint sensor: the target appears to be positioned higher on the screen than usual, but that actually puts it within a comfortable reach of my thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w8VC5"&gt;I’ll admit up front that I have a personal bias toward smaller phones, but the ZenFone 8 just feels great in my hand. I’ve spent a lot of time using big devices over the last six months, and I’ve gotten used to it. But the ZenFone 8 is the first device that feels like it was adapted to &lt;em&gt;me,&lt;/em&gt; not something I’ve had to adapt to using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UuUZnwxRe3j921AYa4ifsE1k5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499355/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A smaller phone means a smaller battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kpaymP"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 battery and software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8mbHH8"&gt;The phone’s small size makes a smaller battery a necessity — 4,000mAh in this case, much smaller than the ZenFone 6 and 7’s 5,000mAh. I felt the difference in using this phone versus a battery-for-days budget or midrange phone, but I had no problem getting through a full day of moderate use. I even left Strava running for 20 hours by accident, and the battery still had some life in it the next morning. The ZenFone 8 supports 30W wired charging with the included power adapter, which takes an empty battery to 100 percent in a bit more than an hour. Wireless charging isn’t supported, which makes the ZenFone 8 a bit of an outlier in the flagship class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPNxId"&gt;Asus offers a ton of options to help stretch day-to-day battery life as well as the overall lifespan of your battery. There are no fewer than five battery modes to optimize phone performance or battery longevity on a daily basis, and different charging modes let you set a custom charging limit or stagger charging overnight so it reaches 100 percent around the time of your alarm for better battery health. You won’t find class-leading battery capacity here, but rest assured if you need to stretch the ZenFone 8’s battery, there are plenty of options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kj8abO"&gt;The ZenFone 8 ships with Android 11, and Asus says it will provide “at least” two major OS with security updates for the same timeframe. That’s on the low side of what we’d expect for a flagship phone, especially compared to Apple’s typical four- or five-year support schedule. An important note for US shoppers is that the ZenFone 8 will only work with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s LTE and Sub-6GHz 5G networks; you can’t use this phone on Verizon, and there’s no support for the fast, but extremely limited, millimeter-wave 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctgUaWF69tS9vSVEdPG5w8MwvQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507533/DSC00661_rear.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 offers standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8l2mPu"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MbIlch"&gt;There are just two cameras on the ZenFone 8’s rear camera bump, and they are both worth your time. Rather than cram in a depth sensor, macro, or some monochrome nonsense, Asus just went with a 64-megapixel main camera with OIS and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. They’re borrowed from last year’s model, minus a telephoto camera and the flipping mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5utE4G"&gt;As in the ZenFone 7 Pro, the 8’s main camera produces 16-megapixel images with vibrant color and plenty of detail in good light. Images can lean a little too far into unnatural-looking territory, and some high-contrast scenes look a little too HDR-y for my liking. But overall, this camera does fine: it handles moderately low-light conditions like a dim store interior well, and Night Mode does an okay job in very low light, provided you can hold the phone still for a few seconds and your subject isn’t moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bFBXWG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10494947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xx4klZ"&gt;A skin-smoothing beauty mode is on by default when you use portrait mode, and it is not good. Skin looks over-smoothed, unnaturally flat, and brightened, like your subject is wearing a couple of layers of stage makeup. Turning this off improves things significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBkFNw"&gt;The ultrawide camera also turns in good performance. Asus calls it a “flagship” grade sensor, and while that might have been true in 2018, it’s at least a step up from the smaller, cheaper sensors often found in ultrawide cameras. Likewise, the front-facing 12-megapixel camera does fine. Beauty mode is turned off by default when you switch to the selfie camera, and thank goodness for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maIBzp"&gt;There’s no telephoto camera here, just digital zoom. On the camera shooting screen, there’s an icon to jump to a 2x 16-megapixel “lossless” digital zoom to crop in quickly, which works okay, but it isn’t much reach, and it just makes the limitations of the small sensor and lens more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wAwwx"&gt;On the whole, the camera system is good but not great. The lack of true optical zoom or a telephoto camera is a disappointment, but you can’t have everything on such a small device, and I’d personally take an ultrawide before a telephoto any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2yyJwz2m9mIkB8t4cUpzDgDLbuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499354/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 doesn’t sacrifice a flagship experience to achieve its small form factor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZDiMQY"&gt;The ZenFone 8 fills a void in the Android market for a full-specced, small-sized device. The Google Pixel 4A is around the same size, but it’s decidedly a budget device with a step-down processor, plastic chassis, and fewer niceties like an IP rating or a fast-refresh screen. Aside from battery life, which is manageable, you give up very little in the way of flagship features to get the ZenFone 8’s small form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzbIbh"&gt;You have to look to iOS for this phone’s most direct competition: the iPhone 12 mini, which it matches almost spec-for-spec from the IP rating down to the camera configuration. The 12 mini is actually a little smaller than the ZenFone 8, and when you factor in storage capacity, it’s the more expensive choice at $829 for 256GB. However, when you consider that the 12 mini will probably get a couple more years of OS and security support, it may be the better buy in the long run, if you’re flexible in your choice of operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jc0CEI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEL2JQ"&gt;I like the ZenFone 8 a lot, but I’m not sure it’ll find a big audience, at least in the US. Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;having trouble selling the iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, and if there’s one thing Apple is good at, it’s selling phones to US customers. As much as I hate to entertain the idea, maybe we’ve gotten used to giant phones. I love how the ZenFone 8 feels in my hand and in my pocket, but I do notice how much smaller the screen and everything on it seems compared to the bigger phones I’ve used recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Etfrj"&gt;There are also a few important considerations, like the lack of compatibility with Verizon and the comparatively short support lifespan of the phone. If you need the absolute best in battery life the ZenFone 8 can’t offer that, and if you want a class-leading camera, you’ll need to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OIO7v3"&gt;All that said, the ZenFone 8 will be the right fit for a specific type of person, and I can heartily recommend it to my fellow small phone fans. You’ll get flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ pocket-sized Zenfone 8 arrives in the US for $629</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ZenFone 8.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="putYtw"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt;, Asus’ well-specced and compact competitor to the iPhone 12 mini, has launched in the US. The company is currently selling two versions of the phone on &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/category/ZF8"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a model with 128GB of storage which will eventually sell for $629 once its early bird pricing of $599 expires on July 13th, while the other has 256GB of storage and costs $699. Both are equipped with 8GB of RAM and are compatible with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s networks, but not Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jrkGR"&gt;We liked the Zenfone 8 when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;reviewed it last month&lt;/a&gt;. Its 5.9-inch display makes it a relatively compact device in comparison to the rest of the Android market, and its 120Hz refresh rate and Snapdragon 888 processor mean it feels snappy and responsive to use. Its smaller size means its battery life is only okay, and its camera performance could be better, but those might be acceptable compromises if a compact phone is your priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="att6JM"&gt;Unfortunately, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430948/asus-zenfone-8-flip-price-specs-availability"&gt;larger Zenfone 8 Flip&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with a flipping camera mechanism that turns its three rear cameras into selfie shooters, isn’t currently planned for a US release. In Europe, the 8 Flip costs €799, compared to €599 for the regular Zenfone 8.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Palm Pre home button was the first to be the last</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3zOV8whYGjc86JbBpmaliPhGlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518062/dbohn_210622_4651_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The original Palm Pre.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naZwsh"&gt;Physical home buttons are all but extinct on modern smartphones, and the Palm Pre ended them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwC9oK"&gt;It’s not hard to notice that smartphones have steadily shed their buttons throughout the years: keyboards, numpads, call and hang up buttons, directional navigation keys, and more have all fallen to the wayside in favor of more versatile touchscreens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vucRL"&gt;In 2007, the iPhone — with its then-revolutionary 3.5-inch multitouch display — helped to push that trend along by reducing navigation down to a single home button. But even as touchscreen sizes grew and buttons fell away, the humble home button stubbornly stuck around. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/28/18244645/apple-home-button-user-interface-iphone-7-fake"&gt;Apple wouldn’t ditch the button&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade, when the iPhone X arrived in 2017.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSuMvH"&gt;But it was the Palm Pre, and its largely unnecessary center button, that showed home buttons could be removed for good.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8Hu0k23dB3Ulpv_sx22hS6AC3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687394/dbohn_210622_4651_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pre’s home button (left) and the button-less Pre 2 (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XSwpP4"&gt;The original Pre, launched in 2009, may not have seemed like the harbinger of home button doom. After all, the Pre &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a home button, at least for its first iteration. But crucially, the Pre’s home button was effectively a vestigial organ — an appendix that evolution hadn’t quite managed to weed out just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tOma6B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first device to prove that gesture-based navigation could work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ptp40g"&gt;Pressing the Pre’s home button did exactly one thing: brought up webOS’s “Card” app switcher, something that could also be accomplished with a swipe gesture. Everything else about the Pre’s navigation was focused instead on the touch-sensitive area around the button. Gestures were used to return home, go back a screen, pull up a dock of favorite apps, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODSrpW"&gt;The home button itself served more as training wheels for users used to seeing one on other touchscreen devices, rather than a necessary part of the user experience, one that was wholly optional to the actual function of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmxlaN"&gt;It’s no wonder that just a year later the Pre 2 would go on to skip the nearly useless button entirely in favor of an illuminated LED strip for gestures. That familiar-looking white pillbox has been aped by the modern iterations of both iOS and Android for multitasking gestures. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1BGztDEjtgjW8jLrUt6LGbni7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687393/dbohn_210622_4651_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T5dhxV"&gt;There were, of course, issues with Palm’s implementation: some of the gestures were unintuitive, and for users making the jump from a more traditional Palm device, there were a lot of new concepts that had to be learned from scratch. Conversely, more modern smartphones benefit from the advantage of users who are far more familiar with touchscreen interfaces, along with far more real estate to make those gestures work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iG3NY"&gt;But while the Pre would ultimately fail, it still stands out in history as arguably the device with the ultimate home button in the history of smartphones — and as the first device to prove that gesture-based navigation could actually succeed in replacing home buttons. And taking a look at any popular smartphone in 2021, it’s clear that at least in that regard, Palm was way ahead of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSUc2W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNF1f5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked OnePlus Nord 2 renders reveal OnePlus 9-like design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n7ashGDofx1Rz6ONLmrxn6Dfh20=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513991/OnePlus_Nord2_5K2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: 91mobiles and OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6wZqVK"&gt;In 2020, OnePlus expanded its product lineup with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;the midrange OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;, and new leaked renders from &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt; have given us a good look at what the rumored next phone in the Nord line might look like. You can see the renders &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/IpzuSFBc5EM"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt; (which I’ve also embedded at the top of this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xpjOD"&gt;The phone, which I will call the Nord 2 (though we don’t know if that might be the official name) looks to take a lot of design cues from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;the OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;, particularly with the similar-looking rounded rectangle rear camera module and the hole-punch selfie camera. That rear camera module houses 50-megapixel, 8-megapixel, and 2-megapixel cameras, while the selfie camera is 32 megapixels, according to &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d1PxXb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And here comes your very first look at the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnePlusNord2?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OnePlusNord2&lt;/a&gt;! (stunning 5K renders and 360° video)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On behalf of my Friends over &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/91mobiles?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@91mobiles&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/E7QFLTs8f9"&gt;https://t.co/E7QFLTs8f9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/BdxNecaYlh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BdxNecaYlh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1409474091590033411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DVromJ"&gt;As for the screen,&lt;em&gt; 91mobiles&lt;/em&gt; reports that the Nord 2 will have a 6.43-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate and will “probably” have an in-screen fingerprint sensor. The phone will also have a MediaTek Dimensity 1200 system on a chip, up to 12GB of RAM, and as much as 256GB of storage — though that storage “may not be expandable,” according to &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;. The Nord 2 is also rumored to have a 4,500mAh battery and support for 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJWDx5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt; expects that the Nord 2 will be released on July 9th, but we don’t know which markets it could be available in just yet. The original OnePlus Nord didn’t launch in the US, but the product line came stateside with the OnePlus Nord N10 5G and OnePlus Nord N100 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1SNhmt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Nord N10 5G and N100 are coming to the US on January 15th","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"},{"title":"OnePlus Nord review: the right compromises","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>How to watch Samsung’s Galaxy MWC 2021 virtual event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0yK9yhvUblKVEv9BDYwKEe_8oQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513053/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXAYcC"&gt;Samsung is hosting a virtual event for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;Mobile World Congress 2021&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, June 28th, where it promises to share how it’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544257/samsung-google-wear-os-smartwatch-mwc-2021-announcement-preview"&gt;reimagining smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;.” Along with wearables, the company is also supposed to share news on the latest additions to the Galaxy ecosystem and the work it's doing to enhance mobile security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0C0GI"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjfkIL2lrHxAhWFNX0KHVi_BYsQFnoECAYQAw&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22432922%2Fgoogle-io-2021-rumors-news-announcements&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw27o53hsjV_iPz1xRvsOq89"&gt;I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Google announced that Samsung’s Tizen operating system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;would be merging with Wear OS&lt;/a&gt; to serve as the future software powering smartwatches for Android phones (tentatively called “Wear”). There are no rumors to suggest Samsung will offer an in-depth look at those efforts, but recent leaks show that the company does have &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJj52Wl7HxAhUiIDQIHQBqBU0QFnoECAQQAw&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F23%2F22546997%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2xU6T9qVmgE9WrJJYzUSoR"&gt;a new Galaxy Active Smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; in the works it might announce. There’s also a chance Samsung will show off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZjqhH"&gt;The event is set to run for exactly one hour, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/agenda/session/galaxy-ecosystem-new-watch-experience-mobile-security"&gt;Samsung’s MWC event page&lt;/a&gt;, which should hopefully give the company plenty of time to get into all of the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="UFySNo"&gt;When does Samsung’s MWC 2021 virtual event start?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="HlZgDu"&gt;It starts at 10:15AM PT / 1:15PM ET / 7:15PM CET on Monday, June 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Zs0EhM"&gt;How do I watch Samsung’s MWC 2021 virtual event?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="CTAXMG"&gt;We’ll embed Samsung’s livestream above as soon as it’s available. You can also follow along with us at the links below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UHCZUC"&gt;Samsung is streaming the event live on its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfSZvIqYDSM"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/"&gt;Newsroom site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>TCL’s 20 Pro 5G will offer a big screen and wireless charging for $499</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dR9vu_vbJ0aXrin7M11RmOEtP0M=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69512897/TCL_20_Pro_5G_design_14.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s 20 Pro 5G is priced to compete with established midrangers like the Galaxy A52 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E7YSI"&gt;TCL is bringing three of its 20-series phones to the US today, with the $499 20 Pro 5G leading the way. It’s joined by the $249 TCL 20S with a trimmed-down feature set and the $189 TCL 20 SE equipped with a massive display and 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWd228"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382312/tcl-20-series-pro-5g-20l-plus-price-specs-features"&gt;First announced in April&lt;/a&gt;, the 20 Pro 5G is positioned to take on midrange devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;. It features a large curved 6.67-inch 1080p OLED screen, a 48-megapixel main camera with OIS, wireless charging, and sub-6GHz 5G connectivity. The device comes standard with 256GB of built-in storage and 6GB of RAM coupled with a Snapdragon 750G processor. There’s even a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TpQoVsWJ2NLsO5i0_gwDsyPBx5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677990/TCL_20_Pro_5G_Moondust_Gray_Front.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 20 Pro 5G’s screen is slightly curved for a higher-end look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UHbn82"&gt;Qi wireless charging at up to 15W is supported, and the 20 Pro 5G is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery. It ships with Android 11, and TCL says it will get at least two OS platform updates. At launch, it will work on T-Mobile’s 4G and 5G networks and AT&amp;amp;T’s 4G, and will gain compatibility with Verizon’s 4G and low-band 5G networks “in the coming weeks.” Spec-for-spec, it looks like a worthy midrange competitor. Wireless charging is still somewhat scarce in the $500-and-below class, and the 20 Pro offers more built-in storage than the A52 5G or the Pixel 4A 5G for the same price. Throw in a big, 1080p OLED screen, and it’s an intriguing proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="M10LIX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10621344"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gxOUES"&gt;A step down on the price scale, the 20S and 20 SE are equipped to compete with the Moto G and lower-tier Samsung Galaxy A-series devices of the world, with bigger-than-average screens and more generous built-in storage than is typical. The TCL 20S offers a 6.67-inch 1080p screen without the curve on the 20 Pro 5G — and misses out on a few of the higher-tier model’s features like wireless charging and an optically stabilized main camera. It uses a Snapdragon 665 processor with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and offers a bigger 5,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RquAs3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219101/tcl-20-5g-20-se-android-phone-price-specs"&gt;The 20 SE&lt;/a&gt;, as the least expensive of the three, gets a huge 6.82-inch 720p display, Snapdragon 460 processor with 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 5,000mAh battery. It also looks the part of a budget device, with a more prominent chin compared to the 20S and its slimmer bezels as well as a notch for the front-facing camera. Both will work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile; the 20 SE won’t be compatible with Verizon, while the 20S will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dLnjw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 Plus ups the CPU and AI performance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GKYET1A-HGn2YHS5UAlyHS5yQhs=/0x4:5300x3537/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69512467/Snapdragon_888_Plus_QRD___AI.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nCWu9Y"&gt;Qualcomm’s best mobile processor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21672519/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-cpu-gpu-details-performance-ai-isp-photography-specs-release-date"&gt;the Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt;, is getting even more powerful at MWC 2021 with the announcement of the Snapdragon 888 Plus. The upgraded model boasts a boosted clock speed, bumping the Kryo 680 CPU from 2.84GHz up to 2.995GHz (which Qualcomm is optimistically rounding up to 3GHz in its marketing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KV5XWs"&gt;Also getting upgraded is Qualcomm’s sixth-gen AI Engine. Where the base Snapdragon 888 could perform 26 trillion operations per second (TOPS) for AI tasks, the 888 Plus is approximately 20 percent more powerful, capable of 32 TOPS. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c4q637sBl_x4VGCGdK5BRRajoJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22682096/Snapdragon_888_Plus_Logo.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UyGo46"&gt;Midyear refreshes for its top chips are nothing new for Qualcomm, which took similar approaches with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/15/20694498/qualcomm-855-plus-processor-announced-features-specs"&gt;Snapdragon 855 Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/8/21312035/qualcomm-new-snapdragon-865-plus-gaming-performance-faster-cpu-gpu-wifi"&gt;865 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, each serving as more powerful mid-cycle updates for the standard 855 and 865 models. The company also did an additional refresh on the 865 at the beginning of 2021 with the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22233584/qualcomm-snapdragon-870-865-plus-refresh-processor-smartphones-2021"&gt;Snapdragon 870&lt;/a&gt;, a sort of Snapdragon 865 Plus-plus that offered additional improvements and a higher clock speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04r6AE"&gt;It likely won’t be long before the Snapdragon 888 Plus starts to show up, either. Qualcomm says that the first phones with the chip should be announced in Q3 2021. Honor has already said that it’ll be using the new chip in its upcoming Magic 3 flagship, with Motorola, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Asus also planning devices featuring the Snapdragon 888 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;An image of a smart display device from a patent application Verizon filed with the FCC | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://fccid.io/NKR-LVD1-IDU" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mzMYwW"&gt;According to a Friday filing with the Federal Communications Commission (first &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/verizon-smart-display-alexa"&gt;discovered by &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), Verizon is preparing to launch a smart display device based on the Alexa voice assistant. &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/NKR-LVD1-IDU"&gt;The FCC filing shows&lt;/a&gt; a basic-looking device that resembles an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;, with an 8-inch display and front-facing camera, and the specs show it has 4GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, Bluetooth, wi-fi and 4G connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAXnhT"&gt;It’s not clear from the filing what the user interface will look like on its screen but the device, referred to as LVD1, will “wake” when users speak the phrase “Hi Verizon” to it. That would seem to confirm, as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; notes, that the device is part of Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231336/amazon-alexa-auto-ai-custom-digital-assistants-car-makers"&gt;Alexa Custom Assistant program&lt;/a&gt;, which allows companies to build their own versions of Alexa for their branded devices. building Alexa skills specific to certain devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3Zvd4"&gt;A user manual included in the FCC filing indicates the device supports the BlueJeans videoconferencing platform that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223454/verizon-bluejeans-video-zoom-conferencing-rivals"&gt;Verizon acquired last April&lt;/a&gt;, which would be a logical use for it. At the time of the acquisition, Verizon said in a statement that “BlueJeans will be deeply integrated into Verizon’s 5G product roadmap, providing secure and real-time engagement solutions for high growth areas such as telemedicine, distance learning and field service work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pe3mo"&gt;Verizon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbHHE2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord N200 5G review: T-Mobile’s best phone under $250</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re on the Un-carrier, the N200 offers 5G and a high-quality screen for the right price.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6BOFeg"&gt;The answer to whether you should buy the $239 OnePlus Nord N200 5G depends a lot on who your wireless carrier is. If you’re on T-Mobile — and thanks to a generous trade-in offer and a carrier exclusive, you probably are if you’re considering the N200 — then this is a fine, basic device that will allow you to take advantage of the company’s good 5G network at a very low price. The N200 5G will only work on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 4G networks, however, so if you’re with either of those carriers, it’s not your best option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Z2160"&gt;Why does your carrier make such a difference? Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G networks aren’t great at the moment, so using the N200 as a 4G-only device isn’t actually a big deal right now. But they’ll start getting much better over the next couple of years thanks to some newly acquired spectrum, and when that happens, being stuck on LTE could become a real drawback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIgNgq"&gt;The N200 5G has a few things going for it aside from 5G connectivity, starting with a big 5,000mAh battery. It has a large 6.5-inch display with a faster refresh rate that’s one of the best available in this class. You’ll also get three years of security updates, which isn’t &lt;em&gt;stellar&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but is an improvement over the two years more common among sub-$300 phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZaQMw8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10620908"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OQOFEo"&gt;On the downside, the camera system is basic. While overall phone performance is fine for day-to-day email and browsing, it’s a little slow with more processing-intensive tasks. And while you can get by on the 64GB of built-in storage, most people will need to add in the cost of a MicroSD card to their purchase for expanded storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OHbxB"&gt;The N200 is an acceptable, inexpensive 5G device, and it’s even a relatively good deal as a 4G device at the moment. But your mobile carrier and your inclination toward keeping your phone for more than one or two years makes recommending the N200 5G complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hF4edUedso0aYhx715Y3XtHFSZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677496/ajohnson_210623_4644_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N200 5G is one of few devices in its class to offer a screen with 90Hz refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cwU1sh"&gt;OnePlus N200 5G screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sMDXOX"&gt;As far as screens on budget devices go, the N200 5G has one of the nicest out there. It’s a big 6.5-inch LCD panel with 1080p resolution, which is an upgrade from 720p that’s more typical in this class. It also stands out with a faster 90Hz refresh rate, making scrolling and animations look just a little smoother than usual. The screen is usable even in very bright, direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pP5DfO"&gt;The N200’s battery life is very good, thanks to a big 5,000mAh cell. It also supports 18W charging with the included wired charger — not &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; fast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;like OnePlus’ pricier devices&lt;/a&gt;, but good enough to take it from 12 percent to a full charge in about two hours. With moderate use I got two days out of the N200 before I dipped into low battery territory; a full day of heavy use should be no problem, and many will see it last well into the second day, if not longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oBPkla"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most people will need to add a MicroSD card for more space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5gxBHT"&gt;The N200 uses a Snapdragon 480 5G processor, which is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;relatively new chipset designed for budget 5G phones&lt;/a&gt; like this one. It’s coupled with 4GB of RAM and keeps up well in day-to-day use switching apps and scrolling social media. It doesn’t take a lot to push it outside of its comfort zone where you’ll notice slight hesitations and stuttering, especially with intensive tasks like zooming in and out of Google Maps and starting navigation. But considering the price, it feels appropriately equipped to provide usable daily performance over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwKCyE"&gt;While you might be able to get by on the N200’s 64GB of built-in storage, it’s on the lower side and a healthy chunk of that is occupied by system files. Most people will need to add a MicroSD card for more space, so consider that extra $20 or so part of the overall cost of the phone unless you’re really frugal with your storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yjFr7J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the N200’s 5G connectivity works on T-Mobile, but on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon the phone is 4G-only&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8OAKrz"&gt;As noted above, the N200’s 5G connectivity works on T-Mobile, but on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon the phone is 4G-only. It supports sub-6GHz 5G only — no super-fast mmWave, but that’s not a big deal since it’s hard to find and T-Mobile doesn’t offer much of it. There’s also no support for the C-band spectrum that will be put to use for 5G starting early next year, but that would be a bigger deal if the phone could use AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon 5G. It can’t, so it’s not. What you do get access to is T-Mobile’s 5G sub-6 5G network, which is good and has broad coverage, even if it’s not mind-bogglingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTYZKp"&gt;Android 11 is loaded on the N200 out of the box, and OnePlus says it will provide one more major OS platform update during the phone’s life span. It will also get the aforementioned three years of security update support, which is a better-than-average policy for a budget Android phone. OnePlus’ implementation of Android is less fussy than most and is mercifully low on clutter and pre-downloaded apps. It’s a grown-up-looking interface that’s about as close as you’ll get to a “pure” Android experience outside of Google’s own Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHgFURqjsIIuX5f-FJa0V9wrf6M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677497/ajohnson_210623_4644_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N200’s main rear-facing camera uses a 13-megapixel sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vhpB9d"&gt;OnePlus N200 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="m4NjF8"&gt;The N200’s camera performance is acceptable, if a bit disappointing even considering the phone’s price. Included are a 13-megapixel f/2.2 main camera, 2-megapixel f/2.4 macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Around front there’s a 13-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3weoTJ"&gt;That 13-megapixel main camera will do fine for snapshots in good lighting, but it quickly reaches its limits with high-contrast scenes, like landscapes with deep shadows and bright highlights. Noise starts to creep into shots taken in moderate lighting conditions, like interiors, and dark scenes show a lot of smeared details and noise. Night mode works well enough to preserve a little more detail, but it’s only suitable for scenes without moving subjects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cnALW6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10621086"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DWs5CO"&gt;The N200’s camera system may be more of a disappointment considering that the higher-tier Nord N10 5G’s 64-megapixel camera is surprisingly good. The N10 costs $60 more than the N200 (a full 25 percent higher) so it’s not a totally fair comparison, but I can’t help feeling that the N200 could have been a little better equipped. Pixel count isn’t everything, but in this case, a newer, higher-resolution sensor would probably have made a significant difference in detail retention and its handling of high-contrast scenes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xsuqtRm9MA0ww26SXO3QNUW-LRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677495/ajohnson_210623_4644_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re on T-Mobile, the N200 is a good pick for a nice screen and 5G at a low price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XqudbD"&gt;If you’re considering the OnePlus N200 5G because T-Mobile is offering you a good deal on one, then I think there’s a good argument for this phone. It doesn’t offer a lot in the way of nice extras and features, but you will get a good screen, long battery life, and a 5G device that should last a few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHGDJZ"&gt;If you live in an area with poor T-Mobile 5G coverage, or you’re with another wireless carrier, then you’ll be better served by another option. You could save some money and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;go with the $179 4G-only N100&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a lot of the same features. The screen isn’t quite as detailed (720p vs. 1080p) but you still get that 90Hz refresh rate, big battery, and nice OnePlus user interface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NRBOsJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you’ll get a good screen, long battery life, and a 5G device that should last a few years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ABv6hi"&gt;On the other hand, if you can spend a little more, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$279 Samsung A32 5G is worth considering&lt;/a&gt;. The interface is more cluttered and its screen isn’t as nice with its 720p resolution and standard 60Hz refresh rate, but almost every other aspect of the device is meaningfully upgraded, from the camera to wider 5G compatibility to a stronger four-year security support policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2h8CDU"&gt;All of that said, if you’re comfortable with the N200’s shortcomings and you’re tempted by a sweet deal from T-Mobile, I won’t be the one to stand in your way.&lt;/p&gt;
