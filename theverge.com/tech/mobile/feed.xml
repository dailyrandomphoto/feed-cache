    <title>T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert will deliver CES keynote as the Uncarrier moves mainstream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S7LTQS6vVCjV-lBWgtrHMw7oUEQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69640464/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile crafted an underdog image for itself, but its recent moves have looked a lot more mainstream.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6lzkqZ"&gt;Lately, T-Mobile has been looking less and less like the Un-carrier it styled itself as in the past, and much more like A Carrier. To that end, the company made a couple of announcements today: a new 5G coverage milestone, and that CEO Mike Sievert will be delivering a CES keynote in a spot recently occupied by Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IO0Tci"&gt;The Consumer Technology Association and T-Mobile made the keynote announcement today, with (you guessed it) 5G as the topic of the hour. It’s been the topic of that particular keynote slot in a couple of recent years, with Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg whipping up the 5G hype machine and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;covering roughly the same talking points&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJys7T"&gt;Sievert will take the microphone from Vestberg at the start of what’s likely to be a pivotal year for 5G in the US. Verizon will be starting to deploy the C-band spectrum in which it has invested heavily. No doubt, Sievert hopes to shine the spotlight on T-Mobile’s relative spectrum advantage, thanks to its Sprint acquisition last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OQPZl1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile aims to cover 200 million people with ultra capacity 5G by the end of 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wjmiNG"&gt;He’ll also highlight milestones like the one T-Mobile announced today: 305 million people are covered by the company’s slower “extended range” 5G and 165 million covered by its faster, mid-band “ultra capacity” 5G network. With a little less than half a year to go, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fthe-current-state-of-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596307%2Ft-mobile-ceo-mike-sievert-ces-keynote-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile is driving toward its goal to cover 200 million people&lt;/a&gt; with ultra capacity 5G by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKDWXS"&gt;In contrast, Verizon, which has to wait for current tenants to clear off its new C-band spectrum, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-announces-c-band-auction-results" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expects to cover 100 million people&lt;/a&gt; with mid-band 5G in early 2022. Sievert probably &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; discuss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"&gt;the network’s bare-minimum efforts to uphold its merger commitments and help position Dish as a competitor&lt;/a&gt;, even though the deal is responsible for delivering T-Mobile its valuable mid-band spectrum and its relative “lead” in 5G, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ngTHLj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sievert probably &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; discuss the network’s merger commitments to help position Dish as a competitor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K3yMrl"&gt;T-Mobile is eagerly seizing the moment as Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T work to get C-band deployed, but the more time it spends in the spotlight, the harder it will be to maintain its cool, underdog image. In the meantime, we can definitely expect to see less red and a lot more magenta on consumer tech’s biggest stage early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme is the first to bring magnetic wireless charging to Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4RmlaYRbiayre2gsOyyEK7hVgxs=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69637282/rmf.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A leaked image of the upcoming Realme Flash and its MagDart magnetic charger | GSMArena&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tC2r8M"&gt;Realme has teased a new device called the Realme Flash, which it claims will be the first Android phone to use magnetic wireless charging. While it looks to be the company’s take on Apple’s MagSafe system for the iPhone 12 range, Realme is taking a somewhat different approach with the initial hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxGVx9"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/exclusive_realme_flash_is_the_first_android_phone_with_magnetic_wireless_charging-news-50232.php"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Realme will release a magnetic wireless charger called MagDart that’s far bulkier than Apple’s MagSafe puck. Charging speeds are said to exceed the 15W that MagSafe reaches, making it the fastest magnetic charger in the world, but the tradeoff is that the device is much thicker and requires an active cooling fan. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4zLPolC1NORcTTKMk2ztuZWolzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22742663/202107212204175.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gizmochina&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An alleged Realme MagDart charger.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0MYogC"&gt;Realme is also working on a slimmer MagDart charger that looks much more like Apple’s MagSafe puck, &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/07/21/exclusive-first-look-realme-magdart-chargers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmochina&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p78cNv"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;, the Realme Flash will be a flagship phone with a Snapdragon 888 processor. A leaked render of the phone shows that at least one model will have 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. Sources with knowledge of Realme’s plans tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s likely to be announced next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKz04y"&gt;Realme has never included wireless charging in any of its phones before, though it does sell Qi wireless chargers that work with accessories like earbuds. It took many years for sister brand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/13/21218741/oppo-ace-2-wireless-charging-airvooc-announced-china-price"&gt;Oppo to use the technology,&lt;/a&gt; after focusing on the proprietary VOOC wired fast-charge system that was also adopted as Dash Charge in several OnePlus phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nokia’s XR20 is a rugged 5G phone with three years of OS updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EWk9zLOuML5RGakjFRGFx3rkU9Q=/0x70:1646x1167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636026/Nokia_XR20_Workshop__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XR20 includes a 6.67-inch screen and dual rear-facing cameras.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD Global&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OMNx1D"&gt;HMD Global’s newest Nokia device is the XR20, a rugged phone with 5G connectivity that goes on sale in late August for $549. In addition to robust physical protection, the XR20 is well supported on the software side — a big focus for Nokia’s latest devices — as it ships with Android 11 and comes with three years of OS upgrades alongside four years of monthly security updates. Even considering that the first of those updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, is due for release very soon, it’s a policy that’s far stronger than that of most midrange Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUPJRp"&gt;The XR20 has a long list of rugged specs. It’s IP68 rated and can withstand submersion in 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) of water for up to an hour. It also meets other criteria of the MIL-STD 810H standard, like the ability to withstand temperatures from 131° F (55° C) down to -7.6° F (-22° C) and protection against drops from up to 5.9 feet (1.8 meters). Its screen uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335252/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-drop-scratch-resistant-apple-samsung"&gt;Gorilla Glass Victus&lt;/a&gt;, which Nokia boasts is the “toughest screen yet” on one of its smartphones. You can also take comfort in the fact that the phone comes with a two-year extended warranty in the US (three years in the UK). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_F_Ou9mvWc9EIhWZI49TtryylQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22737064/Nokia_XR20_Hero_Image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XR20 meets rugged specifications for water submersion, drops, and extreme temperatures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I7Mdl4"&gt;Beyond its rugged credentials, the Nokia XR20 bears many similarities with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;the non-rugged X20&lt;/a&gt;, starting with its 6.67-inch 1080p screen. It skips the X20’s macro and depth sensors, offering just two rear-facing cameras: a 48-megapixel f/1.79 main and a 13-megapixel f/2.4 ultrawide. Internally, it’s equipped with a Snapdragon 480 processor along with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a combination we found to be adequate with some occasional hiccups in the X20. There’s a 4,630mAh battery and Qi wireless charging is supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vZ3ag"&gt;In terms of raw hardware specs, it’s not positioned to challenge the very best midrange phones like the Samsung A52 5G or the Pixel 4A 5G (making way for the 5A soon), which tracks with Nokia’s recent emphasis on value-driven devices. The X20’s camera didn’t impress us, and the Snapdragon 480 chipset likely won’t provide best-in-class performance, but the XR20 could potentially fill a gap in the market for an affordable, mainstream rugged device with healthy software support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxnldw"&gt;The 6GB RAM / 128GB storage variant will be the only one sold in the US, with availability starting August 24th. That version will sell for £449 in the UK, where a 4GB RAM / 64GB storage option will also be available for £399. Both will be available in the UK from July 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AIZ8HznVWT8VZaeJIACzXGi8NCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741417/Nokia_C30___Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia C30 includes a huge 6,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dt6AkU"&gt;Nokia C30, Nokia 6310 feature phone, and Clarity Earbuds Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="x6p5hg"&gt;HMD is also announcing a couple of other devices for global release: the Nokia C30 and Nokia 6310. The C30 is a big-screen, big-battery affair, with a huge 6.82-inch panel — Nokia’s largest to date — and a 6,000mAh battery. A version with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage will go on sale in the UK in September for £99. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3tLxLATVgQFcA_SNbugAPyHjBNQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741432/TWS_841W_BKGY_A01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia Clarity Earbuds Pro include active noise cancellation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ruxRR1"&gt;The Clarity Earbuds Pro include active noise cancellation, are IPX5 sweat and water-resistant, and offer up to nine hours of use on a single charge (seven with ANC enabled). The included case supplies an additional 36 hours of use without ANC or 28 hours with it enabled. They’ll go on sale in the UK in September for £99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rosKMgq11gQKIA412LQLXCgxv_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741425/Nokia_6310___Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia 6310 features basic 2G connectivity and emphasizes accessibility. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a2pzKM"&gt;Finally, the Nokia 6310 is a 2G-only phone designed with accessibility in mind, including larger buttons and fonts, and users can have texts read aloud. It goes on sale in the UK in August for £49.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung confirms Z Fold 3 S Pen support as Note line is in limbo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Unpacked invitation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mD9JkOpc9idzrzfST51xY0Zj__o=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636009/unpacked.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung Unpacked invitation | Samsunng&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lcbyYm"&gt;Samsung isn’t looking to have many surprises at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;August 11th Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;. Leaks have already revealed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572858/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2021-leak-evan-blass-galaxy-z-fold-flip-3-s21-fe-watch-4-buds-2-date"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;Galaxy smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;new Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Samsung mobile president TM Roh is continuing a recent tradition of &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/unfold-next-era-of-smartphone-innovation/"&gt;publishing a pre-event blog post&lt;/a&gt; that confirms some news, sets expectations, and hints at some additional details. Roh promises improved durability for folding screens, stylus support, and that Samsung will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; release a new Note phone this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rqEbz"&gt;Although the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Unpacked invitation pictured above&lt;/a&gt; didn’t leave much to the imagination, Roh simply comes out and says there will be new foldables this year: “Our third generation of foldable devices will open up amazing new multitasking capabilities and enhanced durability,” he writes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPq2rq"&gt;The key phrase to pay attention to there is “enhanced durability,” a theme Roh hits on again when he touches on the Z Flip 3, writing that it will have “an even more refined style, armed with more durable, stronger materials.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rwygvz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung promises “more durable, stronger materials”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6HrLzz"&gt;Each successive iteration of Samsung’s folding phones has improved screen durability — starting from the total debacle of the first canceled product on through a refined plastic screen and finally “Ultra Thin Glass.” It’s as yet unclear what exactly Samsung will do to improve durability further, but there’s absolutely still &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mgAKSnMH0s&amp;amp;t=621s"&gt;room to improve&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSh29p"&gt;A recent leak shows that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594727/samsung-z-flip-3-fold-water-resistant-ipx8-pen-case"&gt;two folding phones may have IPX8 water resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which could be part of this durability story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rMl0V"&gt;Durability is a vital spec for folding phones, but it will be doubly important for the upcoming Z Fold 3, which Roh confirms will have stylus support. It may not work with the existing S Pens that are designed for the Galaxy S21 Ultra, however, as Roh indicates that Samsung will announce “the first-ever S Pen designed specifically for foldable phones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2GJ3V"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders-exclusive/"&gt;recent leak at &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that there will be a case for the Galaxy Z Fold 3 that will have a place to store the new S Pen, slotted directly in the middle behind the hinge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Df-Rb3lQUoCWfx8LGvHu7TVAxSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741284/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Fold3_Samsung_S_Pen_case_render_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;91mobiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gXEKFS"&gt;Roh is also setting another expectation: there won’t be a Galaxy Note announced this year, writing: “instead of unveiling a new Galaxy Note this time around, we will further broaden beloved Note features to more Samsung Galaxy devices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTCuzn"&gt;Samsung hinted that it might skip making a Note this year in March, when, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;an earnings call, it said&lt;/a&gt; that “it could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year.” That’s likely a reference to the ongoing chip shortage, but there are other question marks around the Note line in general. Now that the regular Samsung Galaxy S21 line has stylus support, it seems the main benefit of getting a Note is having a place to store the stylus. It’s an open question whether Samsung actually intends to continue making Galaxy Note devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oGCSV"&gt;Finally, Roh’s post makes some vague references to “collaborations with trusted industry leaders like Google and Microsoft,” with a hint that it could mean better support for multitasking on the Z Fold 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3jsoD"&gt;Hopefully, it also means that Samsung, Google, and Microsoft are working together to normalize how multitasking works on Android. Ever since folding phones started appearing, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21417432/foldable-phones-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-flip-5g-microsoft-duo"&gt;specter of fragmentation has haunted them&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung and Microsoft each offer different experiences for how to organize and manage different windows on their screens. Although Google has regularly added support for folding features to Android, it hasn’t taken a strong hand in ensuring phones from different manufacturers work in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="txFEyr"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Fold, Flip, or Duo: why fold a phone?|95266" data-volume-uuid="df76ea051" data-volume-id="95266" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-131" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JGhPOe"&gt;Finally, Roh gestures to Samsung’s collaboration with Google on the new Wear OS 3 smartwatch platform. He confirms that Samsung will continue to integrate its watches with its Galaxy software ecosystem, pointing out that both Samsung health and SmartThings will continue to be on the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DDAnd"&gt;Samsung’s fall 2020 Unpacked event will be online only on August 11th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT. You can expect full coverage that day — and likely more leaks before then. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Samsung Flip and Fold leaks show water resistance, renders, and an S Pen case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s91v6aTK9pHTIzOY64XmeW_Nqj4=/151x0:1050x599/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635852/E7Ow9IyXsAAEUyS.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uSyQ2S"&gt;New leaks suggest Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3 will both have IPX8 water resistance, which would put them more on par with Samsung’s non-folding phones. The information was posted earlier by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1417721222054481922"&gt;Max Weinbach&lt;/a&gt; and now corroborated by Evan Blass, who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370"&gt;tweeted the rating &lt;/a&gt;along with what appears to be an image from Samsung showing the phones getting splashed. The water resistance tidbit adds to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;pile of leaks and images&lt;/a&gt; that we’ve seen leading up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Samsung’s August 11th Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;, where the phones are expected to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2X8ud"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-and-z-flip-3-water-resistance-rating-has-a-catch-22683600/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SlashGear &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, the rumored IPX8 rating for the phones doesn’t cover dust resistance, something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498773/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-durability-test-jerryrigeverything-dust-dirt-hinge"&gt;that’s been a bit of a concern&lt;/a&gt; since Samsung started making folding phones. (&lt;a href="https://www.enclosurecompany.com/ip-ratings-explained.php"&gt;This explainer&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of going over how IP ratings work.) However, an official water resistance rating would likely be a relief for those worried about the durability of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;historically expensive&lt;/a&gt; handsets. It also lets the phones fit in better with the rest of Samsung’s flagships, which have &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00077679/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;had water resistance for years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zIjgaI"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T4y9KH"&gt;Blass’ tweet also mentions the camera and screen specs for the phones, as well as the S Pen options that will reportedly be available for the Z Fold 3. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders/"&gt;a separate leak&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve also got an idea how Samsung wants us to attach the stylus to the phone: using a case that fits it in right over the hinge. It’s a similar approach to how Samsung handled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22226594/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-stylus-support-price-unpacked-event"&gt;the inclusion of pen support on the Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, though maybe a touch more elegant. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pen slides in right over the Z Fold 3’s hinge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It kind of looks like the world’s coolest PDA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V0Ymkk"&gt;We’ve also seen what are reportedly &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124267.html"&gt;leaked official marketing renders of the Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;, giving us a good look at the bigger outside screen and re-oriented dual cameras (though they unfortunately don’t show the fun two-tone color scheme we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;seen in previous leaks&lt;/a&gt;). The outside screen on the original Z Flip and Z Flip 5G was tiny, relegating the notifications and clock to a corner of the phone’s cover. The next generation seems to be making it easier for those trying to see their notifications, or take selfies with the main cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gPgUlcWEdkwVchFoVbV4MUvfrRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741706/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Flip_3_1627318291_0_12.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen and cameras on the Z Flip’s lid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fAW29DCD_gs46-2KQLn-JaOCWPE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741711/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Flip_3_1627318229_0_0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124267.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The inside of the phone looks mostly familiar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9rkik0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Steps towards making foldables less of an extravagant purchase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NFnlLS"&gt;The rumors of water resistance and the Z Fold’s S Pen compatibility point towards Samsung’s foldable phones receiving features that its more traditional phones have already gotten. It would be a step towards making them less of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;an extravagant purchase&lt;/a&gt; and more of a practical one, but there’s still a ways to go — even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260357/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-price-drop-1200"&gt;when discounted&lt;/a&gt;, the Z Flip 5G and Z Fold 2 come at a price premium, and can be worse in some ways (looking at you, Z Flip camera).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh3UBc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad could not resist draping the Apple MagSafe Battery Pack in leather </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eR8Yv5PA_p3D1OzappSnyxCJIVM=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619953/nomad_magsafe_battery_pack_leather_case.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hYIuno"&gt;Frankly, now that we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/7/7/22563631/nomad-magsafe-leather-cover-charger-price"&gt;a leather case for your MagSafe charging puck&lt;/a&gt;, it’s all uphill from here. At least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/7/19/22583859/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-thickness-size-shape-plastic"&gt;Apple’s new $99 MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; is something you’ll actually be carrying around and touching on a regular basis, where leather might make it nicer to hold. Perhaps you already have a matching leather case for your iPhone, too? It looks like a nice combo in photos. If you agree, Nomad is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://nomadgoods.com/products/leather-cover-for-magsafe-battery-black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently taking preorders for $30 each&lt;/a&gt;, shipping this November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6ofoO"&gt;(I blame Apple for only releasing the battery in white.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/shkPUKFfkxBYxDHpPmak3RWgBkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734484/nomad_leather_case_magsafe_battery.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8yOFGK"&gt;While you can’t see it in pictures or the description, Nomad tells us it will actually have a hole for the battery’s charging port. One more note: while microsuction tape is much better (reusable, no sticky residue) compared to your traditional Scotch, you should probably know tape is what’s keeping this piece of leather on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbYpln"&gt;I think I’ll wait and see how strong the MagSafe Battery Pack’s magnets are, period, before I put any more leather on a phone. Stay tuned: Dieter’s currently working on that review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0zI4G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Nomad’s confirmation that it will have a cut-out for the MagSafe Battery Pack’s charging port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola’s G100 midrange battery champ is now available in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z_32l8T3w0dnMhLeTfkXSnc6SLY=/0x53:1250x886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619427/motog100.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G100 offers respectable midrange specs like 5G and a Snapdragon 870 processor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWa3Uk"&gt;Motorola is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-moto-g100%2Fp%3FskuId%3D627&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F22%2F22589232%2Fmotorola-moto-g100-price-specs-screen-battery" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now selling the Moto G100 in the US&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;introducing it earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for Latin American and European markets. It comes with midrange specs like a big 5,000mAh battery, 5G, and a 90Hz screen for a $599 MSRP. From now until August 5th, Motorola is offering a $100 discount off the full retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9wLWt"&gt;There are two important footnotes on the G100’s US carrier compatibility: it’s a GSM-only phone, so will work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile but not Verizon, and its 5G connectivity is only compatible with T-Mobile’s 5G network. Outside of that, it appears to be a respectable midrange device, if priced a little on the high end. It uses a Snapdragon 870 processor with 8GB of RAM, sub-6GHz 5G, and a 6.7-inch 1080p display with 90Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui1Wz7"&gt;Motorola’s US phone releases this year have been concentrated around the $200-400 range, making G100 one of the pricier devices the company has introduced stateside recently. While a big battery, faster-refreshing screen, and a higher-tier processor feel fitting of its $599 price tag, its lack of IP-rating and broad carrier / 5G support could set it back against similarly priced peers like the Samsung A52 5G or the Pixel 4A 5G (if you can still find one).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Corning’s new Gorilla Glass protects smartphone camera lenses and lets in more light</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xah9S1vZYGRDEGm9CqBSMH5FeeM=/128x0:1223x730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619421/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_1.03.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Corning&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XZGMF2"&gt;Corning &lt;a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/news/news-releases/2021/07/corning-expands-corning-gorilla-glass-composite-products-to-optimize-performance-of-mobile-device-cameras.html"&gt;has announced a new set of glass composites&lt;/a&gt; to protect the ever-growing number of camera lenses on the back of smartphones and capture more ambient light in the process. The new composites, called Gorilla Glass with DX and Gorilla Glass with DX+, offer “advanced optical performance, superior scratch resistance, and durability” according to Corning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsdd4e"&gt;Technically, this DX variety of composite isn’t entirely new, Corning offered a version of &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/07/19/corning-gorilla-glass-dx-smartwatch/"&gt;Gorilla Glass with DX / DX+ for smartwatches&lt;/a&gt; as early as 2018. But Corning says making the switch to smartphone camera lens covers added additional challenges because the glass needed to be more scratch-resistant and somehow let in more light, two qualities that can be at odds. Corning breaks down how it achieved both improvements in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="45Ltmf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/olO8scCNMu0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mor20n"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/corning-gorilla-glass-dx-for-phone-camera-lenses/"&gt;Corning tells &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Gorilla Glass with DX and Gorilla Glass with DX+ let in 98 percent of ambient light while still being just as scratch resistant as typical Gorilla Glass. In comparison, Corning claims lens covers with traditional anti-reflective coatings only let in about 95 percent of light. Maximizing the amount of light smartphones can gather while cutting down on reflections and glare is helpful for squeezing better performance out of smartphone cameras. It might also provide more information for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18203363/ai-artificial-intelligence-photography-google-photos-apple-huawei"&gt;the variety of computational processes&lt;/a&gt; that are now the norm in smartphone photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAhjZe"&gt;The company hasn’t announced what phones will feature the new glass composites, but Corning does say that Samsung is signed on as the first company to use the new Gorilla Glass camera lens covers. Given the Unpacked event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Samsung has scheduled for August 11th&lt;/a&gt; quickly approaching on the horizon, maybe we’ll see the glass in action sooner than we expect.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t appear that Verizon’s Smart Assistant can do a whole lot.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEtNSY"&gt;We got our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22552037/fcc-filing-shows-verizon-amazon-alexa-smart-display"&gt;first look at Verizon’s Smart Display&lt;/a&gt; last month thanks to an FCC filing. Yesterday, Amazon confirmed the device’s existence &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"&gt;as part of its Alexa Live presentation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s being introduced as part of the Alexa Custom Assistant program that allows third-party device manufacturers to add custom assistants built on top of Alexa technology to their products, and we regret to inform you that it looks just as useless as we first suspected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpVTyh"&gt;Here’s what it offers: standard smart display stuff, like an eight-inch screen, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi connectivity, and of course, Alexa. It also comes with LTE, a spec included in the FCC filing and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/verizons-smart-display-is-real-and-responds-to-hi-verizon/"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; following the announcement. But the purpose of 4G appears to be limited to providing connectivity while setting up or troubleshooting Verizon home internet. Amazon says this will reduce the need to “send service technicians to a customer’s house or have a customer call the Verizon Call Center for help.” So that’s kind of a narrow use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RU8gvM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4v4o9L6A2M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wo4LJA"&gt;There are also Verizon-service-specific commands that can be accessed by saying “Hi, Verizon,” like checking your bill or running a speed test. You know, things you can easily do on your phone or computer. You can ask Verizon smart assistant-type questions, like the current weather, but based on a promotional video published by Amazon it looks like Verizon will... just ask Alexa for you. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HavCIk"&gt;If you ever thought to yourself, “Self, wouldn’t it be great to have a way to check my phone bill hands-free while I eat a sandwich in the kitchen?” then maybe you’ve just found your match. Otherwise, this doesn’t exactly look like the smartest of smart displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgAwlr"&gt;Verizon hasn’t revealed a price or firm release date yet; &lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports that the display will be available later this year in limited beta testing with Verizon home internet customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ capable Nord 2 made better by midrange price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2W5lNlzw3BMBuy6VTfnQgOJ3hQ=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617009/Many_OnePlus_Nord_2s_having_fun.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qwsZhO"&gt;OnePlus has officially announced the Nord 2, a successor to last year’s excellent midrange debut. Like the original, the Nord 2 is releasing in Europe and India, and there are no plans for a US release. In Europe and the UK, prices start at £399 / €399 for its 8GB RAM / 128GB storage model, rising to £469 / €499 for a 12GB RAM / 256GB version (about $550 and $645, respectively). In the UK, preorders open on July 22nd from OnePlus.com and Amazon, and the phone goes on general sale on July 28th. You can read my first-hand impressions of the phone over in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22350856"&gt;full review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="doHCw5"&gt;OnePlus being OnePlus means we already had a good idea of what to expect from the Nord 2 before today. But now we know that in addition to its 50-megapixel main camera, the phone also has an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor on its rear. Round the front, there’s a 32-megapixel selfie camera, although there’s no secondary ultrawide selfie camera like last year’s Nord. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord 2 in blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hC6Eax"&gt;Like the original Nord, the Nord 2 has a 1080p 90Hz OLED display, but on this year’s model it’s ever so slightly smaller at 6.43-inches (compared to 6.44-inches). In Europe, the phone is available in blue and gray, while an additional green color will be available in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukdGY2"&gt;Internally, alongside the &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/nord-2-and-its-mediatek-dimensity-1200-ai-chipset-your-questions-answered.1464619/"&gt;MediaTek 1200-AI processor&lt;/a&gt; that OnePlus revealed earlier this month, in Europe the Nord 2 will be available with either 8 or 12GB of RAM, paired with 128 or 256GB of storage, respectively. There’s also a (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnePlus_IN/status/1417490218521964552"&gt;pre-announced)&lt;/a&gt; 4,500mAh battery with Warp Charge 65 fast charging, which OnePlus claims should be able to charge the phone to 100 percent in under 35 minutes. It’s 5G-compatible (sub-6GHz only) and includes dual-SIM support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGUOFV"&gt;The Nord 2 runs OxygenOS 11.3 out of the box, which &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-2-oliver-zhang-interaction/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt; is the first version of the software to reflect the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;merger with Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus is promising two years of Android updates and three years of security updates for the Nord 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FU1goy"&gt;As well as the Nord 2, OnePlus also used its event today to announce a new pair of true wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22351408"&gt;OnePlus Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which go on sale next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1d7lX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qihfpj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
