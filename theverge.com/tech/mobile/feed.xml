    <title>T-Mobile CEO calls latest data breach ‘humbling,’ claims it’s committed to security</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="T-Mobile Kicks Off $3 Billion Bond Sale To Buy 5G Spectrum" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2V0H5We63VdhnL-hKeUivSOYQgw=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69788941/1231755320.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2NwJ4"&gt;A recent T-Mobile data breach &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;coughed up the information of more than 50 million people&lt;/a&gt;, including some who aren’t current customers or never were. The 21-year-old hacker who says they’re responsible for the attack already did &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105"&gt;an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; calling its security “awful,” and now CEO Mike Sievert is speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zn26vr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is T-Mobile’s fifth incident in four years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17ezIQ"&gt;Sievert says he’s taking a moment to update us now that the breach is contained and the investigation is “substantially complete.” “Keeping our customers’ data safe is a responsibility we take incredibly seriously and preventing this type of event from happening has always been a top priority of ours,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fcyberattack-against-tmobile-and-our-customers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;he writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBxgkw"&gt;It’s true that these attacks happen to many companies, but it’s hard to take the statement as sincere when T-Mobile has had at least five breaches since 2018. That includes this one, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security"&gt;two in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, plus one each for 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAdfgU"&gt;To do something about it, T-Mobile is partnering with cybersecurity firm Mandiant and consultants at KPMG to tighten things up. Will that put an end to this ridiculous streak of insecurity? No one can know, but that’s more than the “sorry for any inconvenience” notes released &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcustomers%2F6305378821&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcustomers%2F6305378822&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of the past breaches, and of course, all the subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637797/tmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans"&gt;got a free year of Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Too bad it’s only happening after a hacker made off with enough IMEI/IMSI, driver’s license, and social security data to spend the next few years stealing identities and phone numbers at will.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There’s a tiny tube amp in this super pricey Astell &amp; Kern music player</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Astell &amp;amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cccVmGKqjPuRUCIjbQJXc-skt0o=/0x0:2234x1489/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784480/akultimahero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qj4Sdc"&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern’s latest portable music player is as high-tech as it is extravagantly expensive. &lt;a href="http://aknewsroom.armourhome.co.uk/2021/08/27/astellkerns-latest-aultima-sp2000t-portable-digital-audio-player-packs-a-next-gen-triple-amp-system/"&gt;The $2,399 A&amp;amp;ultima SP2000T&lt;/a&gt; releases in October, and it stands out from the brand’s previous models like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/8/15752152/astell-kern-kann-review-audiophile-pmp"&gt;Kann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18518150/astell-kern-kann-cube-audiophile-pmp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Kann Cube&lt;/a&gt; with a new triple amp system. These things are never affordable, and the price might seem especially out there if you’re content with listening to music from a streaming service on your phone. But there’s some real engineering swagger in effect here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoQaKO"&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern managed to fit a tiny tube amp inside of this device. Specifically, it uses &lt;a href="https://korgnutube.com/en/"&gt;a Korg Nutube 6P1&lt;/a&gt;, which conceptually operates just like larger tube amps, only it’s small enough to fit in a device that can go in your pocket. To avoid any interference that the resonance of the tubes might generate, Astell &amp;amp; Kern says it developed a modular structure on the PCB just for the tubes, fixing them with silicone to minimize vibrations. The best part of the press release is that it says its design “uses magnetic forces to float the amp in the air to reduce internal noise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFeiKo"&gt;Audiophiles reading this have every right to be skeptical that Astell &amp;amp; Kern can reproduce the effect of a tube amp with such minuscule hardware, but it at least deserves some credit for trying. Check it out in action below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_lqdmIZNEYjqezZgxbkSgzwPqMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22809604/astellandkern7.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fe5okP"&gt;When you’re using the A&amp;amp;ultima SP2000T, it’ll let you switch between its OP-AMP setting for “ultra-clarity and a dynamic playback,” the tube amp mode for a “uniquely warm” sound, and a hybrid mode that blends the best of both modes into one. Additionally, this model has an ESS ES9068AS quad DAC for further enhancing the way your music sounds. This is apparently Astell &amp;amp; Kern’s first player to feature a quad DAC, as well as the Replay Gain utility, which adjusts the volume of all of your music (up to 24-bit / 192kHz) to the same level, so one song isn’t quieter than the other. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Astell &amp;amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tUwgXcceOaZDdFuE7MPxTLt_rMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22809612/akultima.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Astell &amp;amp; Kern&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yFN7nK"&gt;Now, for some specs. The player is compatible with 2.5mm, 3.5mm, and 44.mm plugs. It has a five-inch 1080p touchscreen, which might be the least impressive thing about it. You can charge it and transfer files via its USB-C port. It’s also Wi-Fi ready, supporting the company’s AK File Drop utility that lets you transfer files wirelessly via PC, phone, or even an FTP on the same network. You’ll obviously get the best sound quality with a set of high-end, wired headphones or earphones, but it also supports Bluetooth 5.0 with 24-bit aptX HD and LDAC codec support. Lastly, it has 256GB of flash storage built in, but it supports up to 1TB via microSD. It has a 4,200mAh battery, which the company says will get you about nine hours of FLAC playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfGcDP"&gt;For people with the sort of budget that allows this kind of purchase, this seems like something you may want to try before you buy. It’s possible that Astell &amp;amp; Kern created something great that defies its pocket-sized stature, but it’s just as likely that this has some overly ambitious first-gen quirks to iron out. You’ll be able to find out yourself when it releases in October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hacker claims responsibility for T-Mobile attack, bashes the carrier’s security</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pXBsKWjydj1cjknGWtEqYLTyrtc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69780942/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RiK1Qi"&gt;A person claiming to be behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/15/22626270/t-mobile-investigating-report-customer-data-breach"&gt;T-Mobile data breach&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii"&gt;exposed almost 50 million people’s info&lt;/a&gt; has come forward to reveal his identity and to criticize T-Mobile’s security, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. John Binns told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;that he was behind the attack and provided evidence that he could access accounts associated with it, and he went into detail about how he was able to pull it off and why he did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiPTSg"&gt;According to Binns, he was able to get customer (and former customer) data from T-Mobile by scanning for unprotected routers. He found one, he told the&lt;em&gt; Journal&lt;/em&gt;, which allowed him to access a Washington state data center that stored credentials for over 100 servers. He called the carrier’s security “awful” and said that realizing how much data he had access to made him panic. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, it’s unclear whether Binns was working alone, though he implied that he collaborated with others for at least part of the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="unWKVf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Binns called T-Mobile’s security “awful”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LFRnna"&gt;The information the hacker gained access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii"&gt;includes sensitive personal data&lt;/a&gt;, like names, birthdates, and Social Security numbers, as well as important cellular data like identification numbers for cellphones and SIM cards. T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fadditional-information-regarding-2021-cyberattack-investigation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F26%2F22643277%2Ft-mobile-hacker-data-leak-claims-responsibility-criticizes-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “confident” that it’s “closed off the access and egress points the bad actor used in the attack.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXOl4y"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105?page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report&lt;/a&gt; goes in depth into Binns’ history as a hacker. He claims that he got his start making cheats for popular video games and that he discovered the flaw that ended up being used in a &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/09/satori-iot-botnet-operator-pleads-guilty/"&gt;botnet that attacked IoT devices&lt;/a&gt; (though he denies actually working on the code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vX0k93"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Binns describes a troubled relationship with US intelligence services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gEbWj5"&gt;According to Binns, his relationship with US intelligence services is troubled, to say the least. A lawsuit that appears to have been filed by Binns in 2020 demands that the CIA, FBI, DOJ, and other agencies tell him what information they have on him. The lawsuit also accuses the government of, among other things, having an informant try to convince Binns to buy Stinger missiles on an FBI-owned website, attacking Binns with psychic and energy weapons, and even with being involved in his alleged kidnapping and torture. An FBI response to his lawsuit denied he was being investigated by the bureau for the botnet or having information related to the alleged surveillance, and abduction, and torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4ArHL"&gt;Binns told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that one of his goals behind the attack was to “generate noise,” saying that he hopes someone in the FBI will leak information related to his alleged kidnapping. It’s not likely that Binns’ situation will be improved now that he’s shone a spotlight on himself as the person who hacked one of the US’s major carriers. However, if his reports about how he gained access to a vast trove of T-Mobile data are true, it paints a concerning picture of the carrier’s security practices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will let you unlock your Z Fold 3’s bootloader, but at the cost of your cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/knM-Jr7vnUGfjkP4IUKRywCWjMk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770961/dbohn_210820_4722_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jPLB9Z"&gt;Samsung seems to be trying to discourage users from modifying the software on their new Galaxy Z Fold 3s, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-unlock-bootloader-broken-camera/"&gt;giving them a message&lt;/a&gt; that unlocking the phone’s bootloader will render the phone’s cameras unusable (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/24/samsung-cripples-the-galaxy-z-fold3-if-you-unlock-the-bootloader/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/11/20/unlocking-bootloader-sony-phones-no-longer-wrecks-camera-pie/"&gt;isn’t the first time&lt;/a&gt; we’ve seen phone manufacturers pull this sort of trick, but it seems to represent an escalation in Samsung’s fight against its users who want to gain complete control over their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJ7TsX"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unlocking-bootloader-will-disable-the-camera.4321957/"&gt;XDA Forums user confirms&lt;/a&gt; that after unlocking the bootloader, the Z Fold 3’s cameras were completely non-functional: facial recognition, loading the camera app, and trying third-party camera apps all failed for them. The user reports that re-locking the bootloader made the cameras work again. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LvBdSg7b7QZMbhQfWtdtpKa3zOE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803288/20210820_121528.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unlocking-bootloader-will-disable-the-camera.4321957/#post-85506611" target="_blank"&gt;白い熊 on XDA Forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The message shown to users trying to unlock their bootloader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HvNHFu"&gt;According to a photo (seen above) posted by a member of the forums, the message users receive when trying to unlock their Z Fold 3’s bootloader reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ote4a"&gt;Unlock the bootloader to install custom operating system software. Doing so will cause the camera to be disabled and may cause your phone or apps to stop working correctly. To prevent unauthorized access to your personal data, your phone will be factory reset, which will erase all data, including files and downloaded apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Fmd"&gt;Volume up: Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cw29iv"&gt;Unlock bootloader (may void warranty)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seJ0cP"&gt;Volume down: No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpUVLP"&gt;Do not unlock bootloader and restart phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3vtrq1"&gt;(A factory reset is &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/239798/how-to-unlock-your-android-phones-bootloader-the-official-way/"&gt;generally standard&lt;/a&gt; after a bootloader unlock, as is the possibility of a voided warranty.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsQDBi"&gt;While this may be an escalation, Samsung has previously had a somewhat unfriendly stance towards modders. &lt;a href="https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/faqs/faq-115013719548.htm"&gt;Samsung’s Knox documentation says that&lt;/a&gt;, if you root your phone and flash it with an unofficial Android build, anything having to do with its Knox security will &lt;a href="https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/faqs/faq-115013562087.htm"&gt;be permanently disabled&lt;/a&gt;, and will only be restored if you replace the phone’s hardware. This means that, if you root a Samsung phone, features like Samsung Pay and Secure Folder won’t ever work again. To be clear, this doesn’t happen if you just unlock your phone’s bootloader — it only occurs after you make changes to the phone’s OS (though doing so is the main reason to unlock your bootloader, so it’s perhaps a distinction without much difference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xiX36T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving up your cameras seems like an unreasonable ask&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yCF0eD"&gt;While that’s certainly more destructive and permanent, you could also argue that it’s not unreasonable to give up Samsung Pay and Secure Folder if you really want root access to your phone. Giving up your ability to take pictures is a much bigger ask. Plus, unless Samsung’s changed how Knox works, rooting your Fold 3 after unlocking it will also shut down those features, leaving you with a phone that has no cameras, no NFC payment, and no Secure Folder (not that you could take any sensitive pictures anyways). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FElkUr"&gt;There are some ways in which turning off features for rooted users makes sense. In the case of Knox, the phone doesn’t know what code is running on the phone, so it can’t make any promises of security. In the same vein, it wouldn’t be unreasonable if Samsung didn’t let you use the Fold 3’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00062630/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;facial recognition unlock feature&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s hard to see how turning off the cameras entirely is anything but a punishment for users who want to mod their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BDAExV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to see how turning off the cameras entirely is anything but a punishment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RxYodS"&gt;If you’re a US-based Samsung customer, though, you’d have to try a lot harder to even run into these issues — because Samsung reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.thecustomdroid.com/sampwnd-unlock-bootloader-samsung-snapdragon/"&gt;doesn’t officially allow bootloader unlocking&lt;/a&gt; on Snapdragon-based phones sold in the US. There are services you can pay for that claim to unlock your US phone’s bootloader, but it’s not &lt;a href="https://www.hardreset.info/devices/samsung/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2/faq/bootloader-unlock/"&gt;the relatively simple process&lt;/a&gt; found on the global version of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hP20J"&gt;At the moment, it’s unclear whether the Galaxy Z Flip 3 will also have the same limitation, though one of XDA Forums’ members &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unlocking-bootloader-will-disable-the-camera.4321957/page-2#post-85526781"&gt;posted a picture of the unlock bootloader screen on their Flip&lt;/a&gt; and the notice doesn’t mention the cameras. Samsung didn’t immediately answer &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s questions about whether the policy also applied to the Flip, or provide a statement about the policy in general.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 review: nearly normal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;As good as foldables get, but is that good enough?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xQB9CN"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the best possible case Samsung can make for a phone that unfolds into a small tablet. It’s the fourth iteration of the same basic idea, refined and repaired over the course of years following an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;embarrassing false-start failure&lt;/a&gt; on the first attempt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZNUhk"&gt;Because this is a story of refinement, the changes since the last model are minor. But added together, they make this the model that crosses that hard-to-define boundary between experimental and normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNu5wD"&gt;Although the Z Fold 3 feels like a refined, established product, it’s still not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; normal. It’s a marvel of material science that’s by turns wonderful and awkward. And its price is also still far from normal, too — even after a price drop, it starts a $1,799.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RcEeL"&gt;If you like the basic idea of the Z Fold but have been waiting for Samsung to fix its biggest issues, the steady and relentless refinement on display here is worth a look. If you think the whole idea is an extravagant and silly technical flex, none of these changes will change your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mc8Pwg"&gt;Even though those two opinions are almost diametrically opposed, I can’t really argue with either one. The Z Fold 3 is great &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YeDdPp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10715493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RRb1pC"&gt;When closed, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is still an extremely tall, narrow, and thick slab of a device that’s more akin to a remote control than a traditional phone. It’s awkward to fit into a pocket both because of its shape and its weight — although it’s slightly lighter than last year, fundamentally it’s still the size of two phones and it has the weight to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EvLSb"&gt;Samsung’s big addition to the hardware is IPX8 water resistance. I’ve dunked it in a vase and held it under a fountain without issue. I won’t speak to whether the durability improvements Samsung made this year will be enough to keep the phone intact long term, but at least initially it seems solid. I don’t feel like I need to baby this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVp6H0sYuZFLx34hLpwM1Vyynb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801025/dbohn_210820_4722_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There is still a gap between the two sides when closed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_SOyXM4kUAnemSG1_v1jplj080=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801028/dbohn_210820_4722_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is still a gap between the two sides when closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rzq5s"&gt;There’s still a gap at the hinge when it’s closed, but otherwise all the tolerances between the parts are tight. Samsung is still using tiny brushes inside the hinge to keep dust and debris out, but I’d still recommend keeping it away from any serious amount of grit or sand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRRJOd"&gt;The outer screen fills out the entire front of the display, and though it’s 6.2 inches diagonally, it feels much smaller because it’s so narrow. Samsung increased the refresh rate on the exterior display to 120Hz, so everything on it feels smooth; the main compromise when using it is that it’s just really hard to type on. Swipe-typing helps, but Samsung’s built-in keyboard still isn’t as good as Gboard at accuracy, and you’ll want to stick with Samsung’s keyboard since it has better options when in tablet mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtczAF"&gt;Open the phone up and you’re treated to the 7.6-inch display, which is bright, sharp, and has the same 120Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling with less of the “jelly effect” that plagued the earlier versions. It’s a great screen with one glaring problem: the interior selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i0qPO"&gt;Samsung opted for an under-display camera, one of the first to ship in the US. The camera itself is terrible, only 4 megapixels, and even those few are compromised by taking in light through a screen. Camera quality isn’t the problem, though — if I want to take a selfie, there are literally four other cameras I can use that are better. Think of it as a webcam for video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The under display selfie camera is more distracting and annoying than a hole punch." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jpVMUPRs-KkHsfU8l84P89IXTbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801091/dbohn_210820_4722_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The under-display selfie camera is more distracting and annoying than a hole punch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="btt3K1"&gt;Instead, the problem is how the screen looks when the camera is off. When there’s a brighter background over it — or text — it has a screen-door look that is both ugly and distracting. If I shift my head or the phone even a little, there’s a moire effect that instantly draws my eye — even after a week of use it’s still happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ehtMo"&gt;Samsung wants the Z Fold 3 to be a showcase of its technical prowess, but that desire has led it into putting a too-experimental feature on a premium device. The under-display camera literally mars the experience. Samsung needs to put a setting in to turn the screen over the camera off entirely and just revert this thing back to a hole punch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWYJuY"&gt;Surprisingly, that is my only real complaint about the interior screen. Which is saying something since it’s a giant, 7.6-inch display that folds in half. Samsung put a lot of emphasis on how it has made this screen stronger, thanks to how it re-layered the different internal components from the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The crease is still visible at an angle but not bothersome at all when you look straight on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aUwlAY86Tg80SJk418z7sH0zdOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801031/dbohn_210820_4722_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The crease is still visible at an angle but not bothersome at all when you look straight on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S Pen won’t work on the outer screen, but works fine on the main interior screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nVm5rOXMbsDkIDPjcicXaK2GEAc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801032/dbohn_210820_4722_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S Pen won’t work on the outer screen but works fine on the main interior screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T1mpI0"&gt;It still uses Samsung’s so-called “Ultra Thin Glass,” but that glass is still covered with layers of plastic. The top layer is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate"&gt;PET&lt;/a&gt; screen protector which feels much more like any other screen protector you’ve used on a phone. It radically changes the experience of the Z Fold 3 as it’s a lot more resistant to smudges and indentations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sz1Nxq"&gt;There is still a crease between the two halves, and I still am not too bothered by it. It’s mostly visible at an angle and largely goes away when you’re looking at the phone straight on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPPaLU"&gt;The other new layer on this screen is made up of a couple of Wacom digitizers so you can use a new kind of Samsung S Pen stylus with it. The Fold-specific S Pen is sold separately, and there’s no place to store it without a special case, which means you’ll be spending upward of $50 or even $80 more if you want to use stylus input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6Mkc0"&gt;Drawing and sketching with the S Pen on the large screen is nice — there’s not much lag, it seems accurate even across the crease (where algorithms detect position), and it glides cleanly across that new PET layer. Unfortunately, the Fold wobbles when you draw on a table, even with one of Samsung’s own cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcVgl6"&gt;You also can’t use the stylus on the outer display, which means it’s not as good at taking quick notes as the Galaxy Note. Hopefully Samsung won’t discontinue that line for people who really do depend on having quick and easy access to a stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Flex mode on the Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EAbQ9OfiFbggbG3dJGiF8tNPks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801034/dbohn_210820_4722_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flex mode on the Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="A8ga7P"&gt;Samsung has also refined the software that runs the Z Fold 3. Shockingly, One UI 3 has made the Android tablet experience halfway decent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch474o"&gt;That is a strange thing to type as I (and every reviewer I know) have been ragging on Android tablets for nearly a decade. But the subtle improvements Samsung made this year wrangle Android’s biggest tablet problems into flexible, usable little windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SN3N5i"&gt;Too many Android apps don’t re-form themselves to work better on tablet-size screens; they’re just stretched-out phone apps. That’s still the case this year, but some basics like getting multiple columns in Gmail or tabs in a browser work. Others, like Twitter or Slack, still look a little dopey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mbpn3W"&gt;However, Samsung’s multitasking system for windowing and managing apps has become adept at putting those recalcitrant apps in their place. You can drag and drop icons from a sidebar to put things into split screen or into a three-up layout. You can even pin that sidebar to be permanently visible for an even more tablet-like experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="SKr6Zb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Against all reason, Android on a tablet is good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The multitasking software on the Z Fold 3 is much more flexible than before." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S79WEKoUZ0TCUgJpSBFyqUC_56g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801132/Screenshot_20210823_123216_Twitter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The multitasking software on the Z Fold 3 is much more flexible than before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JDRRO3"&gt;Critically, you can more easily adjust the width and height of those various layouts now by simply dragging the dividers around. You can also tap those dividers to easily rearrange the various windows if you don’t want to deal with dragging them around. Saving those custom layouts to the sidebar is simple, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3aQ9C"&gt;Finally, there’s a “labs” feature that lets you strong-arm apps into playing nice with this new system if they haven’t been updated to resize properly on a modern Android device. You can set Instagram to fill the entire screen, for example, or resize TikTok into a little distracting-as-hell side rail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ht1jhh"&gt;Let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though. The iPadOS ecosystem of apps is still light-years ahead of Android when it comes to tablet options. But Samsung and Google have finally managed to push the Android tablet experience to the point where I am comfortable doing more advanced things than I can on a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXBhPn"&gt;But really, the thing about the big screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is that it is a &lt;em&gt;big screen&lt;/em&gt;. Big screens are great. They’re nicer for watching movies, playing games, reading books, and everything else. All the things that people like about outsized slabs like Samsung’s Ultra line or Apple’s Max phones are even better on this big screen. Hell: I can actually read and annotate PDFs on this device without having to tediously pan, pinch, and scroll around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zGMPW"&gt;It helps that the Z Fold 3 is excellent from a performance perspective. The Snapdragon 888 processor and 12GB of RAM keep up with multiple active windows at once. The 4,400mAh battery, however, isn’t quite what I would hope for in terms of longevity. I can get through a full day with four-ish hours of screentime, but getting more than that would require changing my usage in a way I wouldn’t want to. We’re used to tablets lasting forever, but this folding tablet is more akin to your average phone when it comes to battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f5OtsQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10715575"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fPBXJ4"&gt;The cameras are also more akin to what you’ll get on an average phone, not a flagship. The main selfie camera on the outside is 10MP and it’s perfectly serviceable. On the rear, you’ve got three 12-megapixel sensors for wide, ultrawide, and 2X telephoto. The only real change Samsung made since last year was adding optical image stabilization to the telephoto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zvu9kF"&gt;The results are classic Samsung: punchy, bright, sharp, and vivid — too often to a fault. Samsung tunes its camera to look great on Samsung screens, not to be true to what your eye might see in the moment. It’s a choice I don’t love, but at least on a technical level the images are good enough to work with. Similarly, the Z Fold 3 does a passable job with night photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JND4qs"&gt;For $1,800 I’d like something better, but that money is going toward the screen, the waterproofing, and all the rest. If camera quality is your top priority, this isn’t the phone for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 under a waterfall." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JbHY3hS0iqsnM6nfPEqyNoYIOUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801024/dbohn_210819_4722_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 under a waterfall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="21V3bb"&gt;Samsung’s big goal for its folding phones this year is to make them “mainstream.” For the Z Flip 3, Samsung hopes it can become a premium alternative for people who would otherwise buy a “normal” phone. For the Z Fold 3, the goal is to creating an entirely new class of flagship that its competitors can’t match. In both cases, Samsung’s putting all this effort in because its more traditional flagship phones are plummeting in popularity as Xiaomi and others undercut it on price while matching quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JKNd6"&gt;Samsung’s goals aren’t our problem, but they do lead to a benefit: folding phones that we can simply judge on their merits instead of simply gawking at tech demos. They’re still too spendy in my opinion, but I wouldn’t second-guess anybody who decides to spring for one of them. You know how you’ll be using your phone and at some point you have to walk over to your laptop to actually get something done? With the Z Fold 3, it takes me longer to get to that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5K2FRk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As good as it gets, but that might not be good enough&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3pxu3"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is as good as it gets when it comes to a phone that unfolds into a tablet. Until there’s another technological breakthrough that can change the flexibility of glass or the size of batteries, I don’t see anything fundamentally better than this coming along for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4gd00n"&gt;However, it’s still an awkward thing to carry around and use one-handed, and it’s still super expensive. The tradeoffs just don’t seem worth it. Then again, once upon a time we all said the same thing about the tradeoffs for big-screened phones like the Note. For a small sliver of tech-savvy people who know what they’re getting into, I could actually recommend the Z Fold 3. But for most people, as good as it gets is still not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi moves away from its ‘Mi’ product branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-h5HloF3s93W4qA5aaP7l2tgOTE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69767365/DSCF5652.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Mi Home store in Beijing. | Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c1gMiZ"&gt;Xiaomi is phasing out its “Mi” product branding, a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; Products including flagship smartphones like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;this year’s Mi 11&lt;/a&gt; will instead simply carry the Xiaomi name. The news was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-ditches-mi-branding/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XH8Z8C"&gt;“Starting in 2021 Q3, Xiaomi’s product series ‘Mi’ will be renamed to ‘Xiaomi,’” says the spokesperson. “This change will unify our global brand presence and close the perception gap between the brand and its products. This change may take some time to take effect in all regions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35KsqH"&gt;Xiaomi says that it’ll still keep the Redmi brand around, meaning that the higher-end Xiaomi products will form a distinct line alongside Redmi products. Xiaomi products “represent the pinnacle of technology and offer a premium experience,” according to the company, while Redmi products “bring big innovation at a more accessible price point and are aimed at a younger audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pRTAA1pDRtWYVHJNG5B6nOYjEtM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802188/WechatIMG118.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7Bog7E"&gt;This naming convention “will also be applied to our ecosystem and IoT products over time,” says the spokesperson, though the Mi brand logo will continue to be used in Xiaomi’s Mi Home stores for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlkLvs"&gt;This month’s announcement of the latest phone in the Mi Mix series served as a harbinger of the shift, since Xiaomi referred to it as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617979/xiaomi-mi-mix-4-announced-under-display-camera-cup-specs-price"&gt;Xiaomi Mix 4&lt;/a&gt;. The previous phones were called the Mi Mix, the Mi Mix 2, and the Mi Mix 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzmv7b"&gt;The Mi brand was largely used in Western markets, presumably for readability and pronunciation reasons — phones like the Mi 11 are already called the Xiaomi 11 in China, for example. But Xiaomi evidently believes its company name is now recognizable enough and better represents its products.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="0n2u1d"&gt;T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Ft-mobile-apple-tv-on-us&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced a new promotional perk&lt;/a&gt; for its customers: starting on August 25th, both new and existing subscribers to its Magenta and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;Magenta Max&lt;/a&gt; plans can get a year’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscription to Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGx288"&gt;The deal applies to virtually any of T-Mobile’s post-paid customers that it classifies as part of those plans, including its Magenta 55 Plus, Magenta Military, Magenta First Responders, Sprint Unlimited Plus, Sprint Premium, and T-Mobile for Business plans. Better yet, the deal isn’t just for newcomers to T-Mobile; it seems that anyone subscribing to those plans can get the free year of Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tew1Ky"&gt;Customers under T-Mobile’s Magenta, Magenta Max, and T-Mobile for Business can find the offer listed under their rate plan details on T-Mobile’s website or app to get the free year, while customers who are still under Sprint’s umbrella will have to go to T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;promotional site&lt;/a&gt; and apply the code 2021APPLETVP1 to get the offer. (Regular T-Mobile customers can do that, too, should they prefer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nGr6x0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Watch ‘Foundation’ for free&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKhcRS"&gt;T-Mobile also notes that the free 12 months on offer here will seemingly apply even if you’ve had a subscription or trial to Apple TV Plus before, meaning that customers can stack the deal with other free trials, like the three months of service that come with the purchase of a new Apple device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96944Y"&gt;The freebie also comes as T-Mobile is reckoning with its recent massive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt;, which exposed data for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;millions of its customers&lt;/a&gt;, including first and last names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license / ID numbers, phone numbers, and IMEI / IMSI information for 7.8 million postpaid customers. Additionally, T-Mobile says that data on over 40 million “former or prospective customers” was compromised in the breach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6kuAz"&gt;And while it’s certainly a nice bonus for customers, it’s likely that a few months of &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;will not make up for having to deal with the ramifications of having that much personal data leaked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google has already discontinued the Pixel 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZFKZY6bXeGT0HV_l6DYodE_VOts=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755977/akrales_201012_4137_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5 (top) and 4A 5G (bottom) will likely sell out soon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LmNmf8"&gt;Amidst the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627253/google-pixel-5a-specs-price-screen-battery-availability"&gt;news of a new Pixel phone&lt;/a&gt; this week, Google quietly indicated that it’s the end of the road for two other Pixel devices: the Pixel 4A 5G and the Pixel 5. Both are currently listed on Google’s online store as sold out, and remaining stock at other retailers likely won’t last long. A company spokesperson offered the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aijLY1"&gt;With our current forecasts, we expect Google Store in the U.S. to sell out of Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 in the coming weeks following the launch of Pixel 5a (5G). These products will continue to be available through some partners while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vZ4hZ6"&gt;It’s not too surprising that the 4A 5G being discontinued given that the 5A 5G looks to be a fairly direct successor. However, it is a little unusual to see the Pixel 5 discontinued well in advance of the Pixel 6’s arrival this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqgLLT"&gt;Maybe that’s because the Pixel 5 bears more of a similarity to the budget-oriented A-series phones than it will to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Google appears to be pulling out all the stops for the 6-series, positioning them as true flagship competitors to Apple and Samsung’s heavy hitters. While the Pixel 5 offers step-up features like wireless charging and robust IP68 waterproofing not available in the A-series, it wasn’t quite specced out to compete with the iPhone 12 Pros and Galaxy S21s of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dtg2K6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gv7Azf"&gt;Or maybe this is just how Google does things now — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356745/google-pixel-4-xl-discontinued-out-of-stock"&gt;stopped selling the Pixel 4 and 4 XL&lt;/a&gt; less than a year after their introduction. But on the bright side, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;the LTE-only Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt; is still on sale for now, and it’s a steal for its $349 price tag. You’ll just need to like baby blue... er, &lt;em&gt;barely blue&lt;/em&gt;, since the “just black” model is sold out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s massive data breach leaked info for 5.3 million additional customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LJO03I3sABMpXk2L0YOJ51ERKuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69753137/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="srbZRz"&gt;The news about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;T-Mobile’s latest data breach&lt;/a&gt; is only getting worse, as the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fadditional-information-regarding-2021-cyberattack-investigation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F20%2F22633853%2Ftmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced new details&lt;/a&gt; from its investigation. While someone in possession of the leaked data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/15/22626270/t-mobile-investigating-report-customer-data-breach"&gt;said they had obtained information for as many as 100 million customers&lt;/a&gt;, including driver’s license info, IMEI numbers, and more, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;T-Mobile’s first statement&lt;/a&gt; put the figure at 47 million or so and did not mention the IMEI / IMSI data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K81kUx"&gt;Now, T-Mobile has confirmed that for the 7.8 million on-contract, or postpaid, customers it already counted in the breach, data stolen includes the information mentioned Thursday (first and last names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and driver’s license / ID numbers), as well as phone numbers and IMEI / IMSI information. IMEI stands for International Mobile Equipment Identity and is a number that’s assigned to every mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Eib8BJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More than 50 million people have been included in the breach&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7mfsT0"&gt;IMSI stands for International Mobile Subscriber Identity and is the identifier for the SIM card to which your mobile phone number is tied. That kind of data could be used to track mobile devices or assist in SIM swapping attacks where someone hijacks your phone number to intercept two-factor authentication codes or other information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDOsYC"&gt;Additionally, 5.3 million more postpaid customers have also been identified as part of the breach, but without revealing their driver’s license / ID or Social Security numbers. The same goes for an additional 667,000 accounts of former T-Mobile subscribers that are being added to the total. Former Sprint prepaid and Boost Mobile customers are still in the clear, however, 52,000 names tied to Metro by T-Mobile accounts were stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUKXCT"&gt;An unspecified number of files contained “phone numbers, IMEI, and IMSI numbers.” According to T-Mobile that did not include any personally identifiable information, which is a questionable claim since it could be easy to tie someone’s identity to their phone number based on other leaked data or simply browsing publicly available listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3FAsX"&gt;The FCC already announced it’s investigating the incident, and at least one class-action lawsuit has been filed against T-Mobile, calling its response and promised two years of identity protection services “inadequate.” The investigation is still ongoing, but T-Mobile customers (current, former, or just prospective ones who filled out an application) can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fbrand%2Fdata-breach-2021&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F20%2F22633853%2Ftmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme’s bulky magnetic wireless charger is almost as fast as promised</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sCHWRHeVVfHKxufRxvech5n-DSk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69751721/DSCF7747.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The MagDart charger has a hefty cooling fan.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6WaizF"&gt;Earlier this month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607214/realme-magdart-announced-magnetic-wireless-charger-devices"&gt;Realme launched MagDart&lt;/a&gt;, its MagSafe-a-like ecosystem of magnetic wireless charging products. The headline device is a 50W brick that Realme professes to be the fastest magnetic wireless charger in the world — it’s supposed to be able to charge a 4,500mAh battery from 0 to 100 percent in 54 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybi3Mj"&gt;Naturally I was interested in trying this for myself. Realme sent me a 50W MagDart charger, a 65W SuperDart wall charger to plug it into, and a Realme Flash “concept phone” with built-in MagDart compatibility. (The only other Realme phone to work with MagDart is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534618/realme-gt-hands-on-europe-launch-price-specs"&gt;new GT flagship&lt;/a&gt;, and even that requires a specialized case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IY5D6P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aWfnOh"&gt;The Flash isn’t a commercial device, but it’s a very nice phone nonetheless. That’s mostly because it’s very obviously a repurposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, made possible by the fact that the two companies share ownership and suppliers along with Oppo and Vivo. The camera configuration has been reshuffled a little — for little reason, since the onboard software doesn’t even include a camera app — but the hardware is otherwise identical. The Flash’s “About phone” screen even still lists the device name as the OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKvFybczN8yqodinvrfYCJQWedA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794463/DSCF7751.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Realme Flash is clearly a repurposed OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oOK2d9"&gt;The MagDart charger, meanwhile, is a chunky metal box with solid construction and a glossy top panel that makes contact with the phone. The magnetic force is fairly strong; you can attach the Flash and hold it facing the ground, though it’ll fall if you shake it around a little. Despite the charger’s bulky build, it’ll still stay attached if you try to pick the phone up, so you can’t really use it as a stationary wireless charger without securing it to a hard surface. There’s a cooling fan that varies in its noise output. At its loudest, I would say it’s comparable to an Intel-based MacBook Pro with a couple too many Chrome tabs open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIp7gv"&gt;When it came to testing the performance, I found that the charger wasn’t able to wake the phone at 0 percent power. For that reason, I used a USB-C cable to turn the phone on and get it to one percent, then took my measurements from there. I didn’t use the phone while charging other than to wake the screen to check the battery status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2iY7k"&gt;Basically, it turns out that this is indeed a very fast wireless charger, though not quite as fast as Realme claims. After 15 minutes the Flash was already at 35 percent, and reached 60 percent after half an hour. The 45-minute mark took it to 82 percent, but by the promised 54 minutes it was only at 95 percent. The Flash eventually hit 100 percent at a round 60 minutes. For comparison, an iPhone 12’s battery will only be around half full after that long.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oFiFE3Ax-iR29WxSuKDmFW8ytUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794466/DSCF7752.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The charger will stay attached if you pick your phone up from the desk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2TxnVL"&gt;So yeah, MagDart works. I’m not really convinced by the form factor, though — if speed was a priority, plugging in a cable wouldn’t be much less convenient than this, if at all. You can’t practically use the phone with this charger attached, either. (I’ll note here that Realme has also developed a thinner 15W MagDart charger that looks similar to Apple’s MagSafe charging puck).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZUdzu"&gt;Still, magnetic wireless charging is all about versatility, and the MagDart technology seems to work well for what it is. For readers in the US in particular, it’ll be worth keeping an eye on whether it shows up in actual shipping OnePlus devices any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
