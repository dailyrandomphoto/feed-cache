    <title>How to preorder the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ST3RH7o1_mOUSZxfGy4nhE4wo5I=/152x0:1768x1077/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016186/lcimg_e5568f90_70f5_4d74_938b_5d1c34060e11.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can preorder Google’s just-announced Pixels.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p512wU"&gt;Google’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are freshly announced&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re already up for preorder. These Pixels promise new designs, new cameras, a uniquely designed Google Tensor CPU, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57DFat"&gt;This year’s Pixel phones come in two sizes: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;the standard Pixel 6 and the larger, triple-camera equipped Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The base Pixel 6, with 128GB of storage, starts at $599, while the Pixel 6 Pro runs $899 and up if you prefer to go above the base 128GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="samX3I"&gt;WHAT’S NEW&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jTBVbQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 and 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; look mostly nothing like prior iterations, with a metal and glass design highlighted by a rear camera bar that is slightly reminiscent of the classic Nexus 6P. These are big phones. The smaller Pixel 6, which cannot truly be considered small by any stretch of the imagination, has a 6.4-inch 2400x1080 OLED 90Hz display. The larger Pixel 6 Pro stretches its legs with a huge 6.7-inch 3120x1440 LTPO OLED 120Hz screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzGN0n"&gt;On the inside, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;Google’s brand new Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt; powers both, while the Pixel 6 gets 8GB of RAM, and the 6 Pro has 12GB. The new chips have a lot to prove for Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;just as the new camera systems do&lt;/a&gt; — with the Pixel 6 housing a dual-camera setup and the 6 Pro adding a third camera and lens to its rear bar. The phones match each other with 50-megapixel main cameras and a 12-megapixel ultrawide, but only the Pro counterpart gets a 48-megapixel sensor complete with telephoto 4x optical zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpMCfQ"&gt;Time will tell if all this hardware and new camera software brings the Pixels back to the top of the pack, but in the meantime, let’s look at how the Pixel 6 phones are configured and available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x26RG3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the Pixel 6 compares to the Pixel 6 Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22724481/google-pixel-6-pro-specs-comparison-price"},{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="af9xF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10816444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Fl3bAs"&gt;WHERE TO PREORDER THE PIXEL 6 AND PIXEL 6 PRO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3iYB8E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US"&gt;Google has kicked off its preorders on its own store&lt;/a&gt; first, right as the phone became official. The release date for the phones is Thursday, October 28th. Though, like most phone launches these days, delays may be expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO9lWc"&gt;We will update this post as more options become available, but we can immediately see how some models are not available everywhere — if a 512GB Pixel 6 Pro is your jam, your only option is Google at this time. So far, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfO5wFAh05o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-5g-unlocked-128gb%2F-%2FA-84683612%3Fpreselect%3D83607398%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergepixel6preorders" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1665071-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02900_us_pixel_6_dual_sim_128gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; are all taking preorders for both Pixels with at least the base 128GB storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4YOc6"&gt;Deals on new phones are tough to come by, but the best preorder deal going around for an unlocked Pixel 6 or 6 Pro is a free pair of Pixel Buds A wireless earbuds included with your purchase. The Pixel Buds A are Google’s budget-friendly earbuds, but they’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a solid set that is more worthwhile than the more expensive Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt; — and free is free. You can currently get this promo with all of those preorders from Google, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H, and Target. Just note that some retailers like &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-pixel-buds-a-series-wireless-headphones%2F-%2FA-83360244&amp;amp;subid1=vergepixel6preorders" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target may require you to add the Pixel Buds A to your cart manually&lt;/a&gt;, and they might be out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FfBJXi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815891"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZBa1GT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815902"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gHSBMR"&gt;Carrier deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qBhCBk"&gt;If you’re not shopping for an unlocked phone and prefer to utilize promos and payment plans from your carrier, there are some offers from the likes of AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Google’s own Fi service. Bear in mind that carriers give discounts as bill credits over time, attempting to rope you into service for 36 months or more. The Pixel 6 phones offered from &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-128gb-stormy-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; (including Verizon models bought on Google’s store) have radios for mmWave 5G, which cost upward of $100 more and may not give you faster speeds depending on where you live and use the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bskHg6"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fwxgST"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is offering up to $700 off the &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-128gb-cloudy-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a qualifying trade-in for new and existing customers, and 50 percent off of any Google-branded accessories purchased simultaneously. The base &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-128gb-stormy-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; 128GB model costs $15 per month over 36 months without a trade-in, but keep in mind that the mmWave-equipped model AT&amp;amp;T is selling is fully priced at $740 and not the base $599 of unlocked models using only Sub-6 5G. The $15 per month over 36 months will result in a total price of $540, reflecting the $200 AT&amp;amp;T will discount over time via bill credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="X9W7Oc"&gt;Verizon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pPtJqr"&gt;Verizon’s offers are similar promo, with up to $700 off a &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a trade-in— though this is limited to new customers switching over. Existing customers can get up to $350 off when trading in a phone and upgrading a line. If you’re shopping for more than one Pixel device, you can buy one and get a second Pixel 6 or 6 Pro for up to $700 off (given to you in billing credits over time; you’ll pay in full upfront) with eligible unlimited plans. The base Pixel 6 on a payment plan from Verizon will run $23.33 per month for 30 months, totaling $700 and a one-time $35 activation fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74YwEQ"&gt;If you want to buy a Pixel 6 for Verizon’s network &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;direct from Google&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll also receive up to $100 in Google store credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="O5sVYL"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hVohEb"&gt;T-Mobile is advertising the base &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%3Fsku%3D810029932646&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; as free with a trade-in on its Magenta Max plan and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro%3Fsku%3D810029931533&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; up to $900 off under the same terms. Once again, these promotions involve buying the device as a Magenta Max subscriber or purchasing that service, paying the sales tax, trading in a qualifying phone that T-Mobile will offer a value on, and then receiving the allotted money back as monthly bill credits over 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bpnx5n"&gt;Note that T-Mobile’s offerings of Pixel 6 and 6 Pro do not have mmWave radios, only Sub-6 5G, and are thus the respective $599 and $899 base prices as Google advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="66aMs3"&gt;Google Fi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rwhuyq"&gt;Google’s own Fi service combines its &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/promo-terms/?p=2021-october-pixel-6-series" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free Pixel Buds A offer with $200 in bill credits&lt;/a&gt; if you transfer your number from another carrier after purchasing a &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6_pro?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install Fortnite on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SyUYWIVBNsnli_X3nS2jdA2t2Zc=/0x53:750x553/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70021527/fortnite_android.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ITxRxA"&gt;Epic Games launched its battle royale hit &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on Android devices in 2018 with a big catch: it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/9/17666316/samsung-galaxy-note-9-fortnite-android-release-unpacked-event-2018"&gt;exclusive to Samsung-made phones for a few days&lt;/a&gt; as a way to help market the then-new Samsung Galaxy Note 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vn1Oh"&gt;At the time, would-be players had to deal with a waiting list and / or a restrictive list of qualified Android phones. These days, it’s a lot easier — but you still need to download it directly from Epic. (Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said this is basically to &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/f3543b49-0dff-4bb9-8902-a5766a7a7de1"&gt;avoid paying Google’s 30 percent cut on in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;.) Epic is using its own website and a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Installer program to distribute the game more widely on all compatible Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPO6l3"&gt;Here’s a step-by-step breakdown to make sure you’re prepared and understand the best way to start playing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on Android. But before we get to the nitty-gritty, a brief warning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="p6duG2"&gt;Avoid the Play Store&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsXnF"&gt;First and foremost, do not download anything from the Google Play Store or from a third-party web source. Epic has made it clear that it’s only distributing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on Android through its own website and through Samsung’s Galaxy Store. Searching for the game&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on the Play Store will get you a simple “No results” message. (Originally, searches would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/10/17675054/google-play-store-android-fortnite-battle-royale"&gt;return a special warning from Google&lt;/a&gt; reading, “&lt;em&gt;Fortnite Battle Royale&lt;/em&gt; by Epic Games, Inc is not available on Google Play” because of worries about malware-laden fake versions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lhES5E"&gt;Download the installer and then the game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LQUrbV"&gt;Because of the unique distribution model here, you’ll have to download two separate applications. The first will be the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Installer, which is the official APK file that then installs the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxm42u"&gt;In order to do this, you may need to turn off special permissions in your Android settings that allow you to download third-party applications, depending on which version of Android you have and what your existing security settings are. After that, you’ll need to go through a series of download sequences that are a bit more involved than your standard app installation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb0JwD"&gt;Here’s a blow-by-blow of the steps you’ll go through:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1YstLe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10817676"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="8gg9NH"&gt;If you have a Samsung phone, you can go to the the Galaxy Store to &lt;a href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.epicgames.portal?session_id=W_bfae6c311778961724acb2f3fae4bbe4"&gt;download the installer for Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. You can then skip to step 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ch9AfS"&gt;Otherwise, go directly &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/mobile/android/get-started"&gt;to Epic’s site&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll find a page suggesting that you either visit &lt;a href="http://fortnite.com/android"&gt;fortnite.com/android&lt;/a&gt; on your phone or scan a QR code. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NQUFKQ"&gt;Whichever method you choose, you’ll be sent to a page that gives you some instruction on what to expect. You’ll also get a pop-up for the installer; tap “Open.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0H1rfk"&gt;You will probably get a security notice saying that your phone isn’t allowed to install unknown apps from that source. Tap on “Settings.” A page labeled “Install unknown apps” will let you toggle on “Allow from this source.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lA872G"&gt;You will then be asked if you want to install the app. Tap on “Install.”  When you get the “App install” pop-up, tap on “Done.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xj81Rl"&gt;The installer will appear on your homepage and in your phone’s app list as Epic Games. You may also get a download notification for the APK. Tap on the icon or on the APK notification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5d6D51"&gt;You’ll land on a page with  the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; graphic. Tap on that, and then on “Install.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mrpjVk"&gt;You’ll probably get that message again about installing unknown apps. Once again, tap on Settings and toggle on “Allow from this source.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="teKqgP"&gt;The app will then install, load any updates, and open. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="0yaY7C"&gt;Once it’s completed, you should be able to boot up &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, log into your account, and start playing. In the past, Epic has advised users to keep the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Installer program, as it’ll be responsible for updating the game with new patches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aHCMP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 20th, 2021, 11:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on August 13th, 2018; the process of installing the game has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will now let you design your own Galaxy Z Flip 3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WL7XQtHCaY8XIag1QldWSLZCWlg=/105x0:1151x697/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020323/60aaea24_159d_4298_8796_f8918ffa9918.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="leuHcQ"&gt;Samsung released the Galaxy Z Flip 3 in August, but if none of the colorways were exactly what you wanted, the company will let you make your own design with the new Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition. The new phone was announced at the company’s Unpacked Part 2 event on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mkvx8"&gt;You won’t be able to customize the Bespoke Edition with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; color you want, but Samsung is offering a lot of options. You’ll be able to choose a black or silver phone frame and front and back colors (aka the top and bottom, if the phone is open) of blue, yellow, pink, white, or black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wNONt"&gt;If you get tired of your color combination, you’ll be able to make a slight change down the line by swapping out the colors on the back glass panel of the phone for a fee with the Bespoke Upgrade Care service. Samsung says the panel costs vary but start at $79, and that the service will be available starting in November. And no matter what, you’ll have to have some black on the phone because of the cover screen, so you might want to keep that in mind as you’re designing your color combo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5ZiDL"&gt;We asked if Samsung might bring this level of customizability to future phones, and it sounds like that might be on the table, based on a statement from the company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9hTW4t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the past year, Samsung has committed to openness – a dedication to create technologies that help our users eliminate boundaries in their lives. We believe technology should reflect each customers’ individuality and Mobile devices are everyday technologies that users spend the most time with. We wanted customers to use them as self-expression tools in and out too. Starting with the Galaxy Z Flip3 Bespoke Edition, Samsung is expanding this initiative to other devices moving forward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3mZwVt"&gt;If you’re interested in a Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition, you’ll be able to make one on Samsung’s website starting Wednesday. You’ll have to pay a premium for the customizability, though, because the Bespoke Edition costs $1,099, which is $100 more than the base model phone. And you won’t just be able to personalize the Z Flip 3; Samsung is also launching the Galaxy Watch 4 Bespoke Studio so you can tailor a Galaxy Watch 4 to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo reportedly developing own chips for flagship phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FRZORTnZ9nDo2ASDfyNolvOwtAg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018964/DSCF7705.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XUEALA"&gt;Oppo is developing its own high-end chips for flagship mobile phones, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/China-s-Oppo-joins-race-to-develop-own-smartphone-chips"&gt;according to a report in &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Two people who spoke to the newspaper said that the plan was to release custom SoCs in 2023 or 2024 “depending on the speed of development.” Oppo reportedly wants to use TSMC’s advanced 3nm process technology for the chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBVSiO"&gt;If plans come to pass, Oppo would be the latest major smartphone manufacturer to take control of its own SoC design. Yesterday Google launched the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, its first phones with a custom SoC called Tensor. Apple and Samsung also design their own smartphone chips, as did Huawei before US sanctions decimated its mobile business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Z7C5N1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vXhS7y"&gt;Oppo currently uses chips from Qualcomm and MediaTek, like all other Chinese smartphone vendors since the crackdown on Huawei. Xiaomi designed and released a low-end SoC called the Surge S1 for its budget Mi 5C phone in 2017, but since then its chip design efforts have been limited to secondary components like image signal processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYRst8"&gt;As Qualcomm laid bare in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728062/qualcomm-pixel-6-google-tensor-snapdragon-meme"&gt;salty Google subtweet&lt;/a&gt; last week, it would stand to lose out if major companies like Oppo were to take on SoC design themselves. Oppo is the fourth largest smartphone maker in the world by shipments, according to IDC, and given it shares a supply chain and ownership with Vivo, Realme and OnePlus, Oppo-developed chips could quickly find their way into phones from multiple brands.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Google Store is open again, and Pixel 6 delivery dates are all over the place</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TZ71o4Xo9Rmu-WcQclHf8CadVHE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016823/bfarsace_211014_4802_0044.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DqywpW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734748/google-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;Pre-orders for Google’s new line of phones&lt;/a&gt; started at the same time as their launch event, but for most of us, trying to buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; has meant seeing nothing but error screens. Some unsteadiness is to be expected given the sudden demand, but at 1PM ET, the doors opened, and Google’s store seemed to fall flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGyn0z"&gt;As of 5:40PM ET, Google says the store is operational again, and many of us have been able to put orders through. According to a spokesperson, “The Google Store was temporarily down but is now back up. We apologize for the inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zzX7D"&gt;However, as &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/19/pixel-6-shipping-date-flux/#more-461552"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out, being able to submit an order is only part of it. Availability of different devices and projected delivery dates have continued to move around, with little consistency about what’s available and when it might show up at your front door. Some people are reporting delivery dates stretching into 2022 for the Pixel 6 Pro, while others have been able to secure orders scheduled to arrive in early November.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-VTM8N_HuEMKwCMJ5jQfb8z0u5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939534/google_store.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="feOHQ5"&gt;Since then, things have improved, but more than an hour later, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisPirillo/status/1450522739442262018"&gt;most of us&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1450527567593758721"&gt;only seeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1450507803504881666"&gt;one error code after another&lt;/a&gt;. If you can get through, you can select to use the new Pixel Pass or add on a 30W phone charger. The fast wireless charging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22732918/google-pixel-stand-23w-wireless-charging"&gt;Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt;, however, says it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmY7tH"&gt;A quick scan of social media revealed that some people were able to complete purchases for the new Pixel 6 in the first hour or two they were available. For the rest of us, at least we’ve had time to learn patience while searching for a PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch OLED, RTX 3090, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727969/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-price-release-date"&gt;Xbox Series X refrigerator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spec showdown: Google’s new Pixel 6 vs. Samsung, Apple, and more</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gqqDWH"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;its fall event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, Google announced the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, which feature its custom Tensor processor and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;the first big camera upgrade for Google’s phones&lt;/a&gt; since the Pixel 3. Since the Pixel 6s are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734748/google-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;available to preorder now&lt;/a&gt;, let’s take a look at how Google’s new phones compare on paper to their Android and iPhone competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8OO9p"&gt;At this point, how Google’s Tensor custom chip will perform is the biggest question mark — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; it’s comparable to the Snapdragon 888, but that’s not even Qualcomm’s most powerful chip today, and Qualcomm is &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-tech-summit"&gt;holding an event in November&lt;/a&gt;, potentially to show off &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-tech-summit"&gt;even newer chips&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, though, as we’re working on putting the Tensor through its paces to see how it performs in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhC82S"&gt;With that in mind, let’s see how the mid-range Pixel 6 compares to some of its competitors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TW6y6Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10816344"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DtgE2c"&gt;Observant readers may have noticed that Samsung’s due to refresh its mainstream Galaxy S lineup in a few months. While that’s perhaps not a concern for someone looking to buy a phone &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, it’s something worth keeping in mind if you’re willing to wait a bit for an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HXPiol"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung could bring the heat in a few months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S6XKUN"&gt;Today, though, the Pixel 6 is less expensive than its competitors and would physically tower over most of them. It’s actually bumping up against the &lt;em&gt;iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/em&gt; in terms of dimensions, which is great news if you like big phones — and not so great if you prefer more compact ones, like the original Pixel or iPhone Mini. While the Pixel 6’s battery is no slouch capacity-wise, it is a bit curious that Google didn’t choose to make it bigger. Though again — the phone starts at $599, so there’s only so much complaining you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFvWPR"&gt;Let’s move on from the mid-range phones and take a look at the higher-end offerings from Google, Apple, and Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3uzdo8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10816311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aMP0f9"&gt;As with the regular Pixel 6, the Pro’s price does it a lot of favors, especially when many of its competitors are playing in the $1,000-and-up range. We’re also seeing Google join the megapixel race that’s been kicked off among Android phone manufacturers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;finally ditching the 12MP sensor that’s been featured on Pixels for so long&lt;/a&gt; (though we’ll have to test them out to see how the images actually look). The Pixel 6 Pro also has a top-tier amount of RAM for multi-taskers, and its battery is nothing to sneeze at either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Of3Wgw"&gt;Overall, it’s a phone that checks a lot of the boxes for a flagship Android phone — it has mmWave 5G, a 120Hz 1440p display, and promising camera specs. As always, though, stay tuned for the full review to find out if the Pixel 6 Pro is equal to (or, dare I hope, better than) the sum of its parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnAUXB"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Pixel 6 and the Pro or are currently rocking a lower-end Pixel and are wondering if it’s time for an upgrade, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22724481/google-pixel-6-pro-specs-comparison-price"&gt;check out our Pixel comparison article here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat says the Pixel 6 is ‘the fastest phone to make a Snap’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Quick Tap to Snap feature" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pG5ug9t9h16_IfC8jQ_0YMV0Cq4=/0x47:1112x788/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016898/snapchat_quick_tap_snap.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EwgD1Q"&gt;At today’s Pixel event, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;Google &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;dove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt; into the details about the Pixel 6 series devices&lt;/a&gt; and outlined a brand new feature that will make sending Snaps even faster. The new feature, called Quick Tap to Snap, adds a camera-only version of Snapchat directly to the lock screen of the Pixel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vo7NeY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Us   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snapchat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6&lt;/a&gt; is the fastest phone to make a Snap thanks to Quick Tap to Snap!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And check out Pixel lenses and other exclusive features too!&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6Launch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6Launch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/94trIxzHzk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/94trIxzHzk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Made By Google (@madebygoogle) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1450516328763232261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EWTrw3"&gt;To access it, all you have to do is tap the back of your phone twice, and the Snapchat camera will open. From there, you can snap a picture all without unlocking your device — you’ll only have to authenticate your identity when you go to send the Snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Obcgex"&gt;In addition to Quick Tap to Snap, Google is also working on exclusive augmented reality Lenses, as well as incorporating live translation into Snapchat. This means that users will be able to have their conversations translated in real-time while using the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1Y6qN"&gt;Google’s partnership with Snapchat doesn’t come as much of a surprise, considering that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/15/5106950/google-snapchat-4-billion-buyout-rumor"&gt;Google actually attempted to buy Snapchat in the past&lt;/a&gt;. Now that Snapchat is sort of built into the Pixel, Google might see that as a small victory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="AEQ0zz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google finally shows off the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i7vkhn"&gt;After months of leaks, we got the full details on Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro phones — the Pixel 6 will sell for $599 and the Pixel 6 Pro for $899. Both will feature Google’s Tensor processor and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;a 50-megapixel camera&lt;/a&gt; (which bins images down to 12.5-megapixels during processing). The phones also feature an ultra-wide camera, and the Pro adds a telephoto camera and gives the selfie camera an upgrade with a wider lens and higher-resolution sensor. The Pro model is also physically larger, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;it’s not a massive difference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IaquUxERUcc8HTWAYqEYbuZ_yU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939252/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_1.08.09_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H0EQpd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;Google’s new phones are powered by its Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NrRCfR"&gt;Much of Google’s event focused on the Google-designed Tensor processor that powers the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Google showed off how the machine learning prowess of its chip would be able to help with tasks like voice recognition, making photos less blurry (and even automatically erasing unwanted people from the background), and real-time captions and translation. Outside of ML, Google says that it should be competitive with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon processors when it comes to overall CPU and GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WedQNW"&gt;Google also emphasized how the Tensor could help its phones be more personalized to you but didn’t go into much detail on how exactly that would work. Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;we have our hands on the new phones&lt;/a&gt;, so we’ll be able to poke around at them. Speaking of those phones...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IjF24v"&gt;Google showed off the results of its camera inclusivity work with Real Tone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6F6T72"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442515/google-camera-app-inclusive-image-equity-skintones"&gt;At Google I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Google announced it was working on making its cameras and photo processing better for people with darker skin, and today, we got to see some of those results. Google’s Real Tone tech, which will work both in its camera app and third-party ones, will try to accurately depict people’s skin tones instead of doing weird things with exposure and contrast like old phones used to do. Google’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WNarpiGz3Kk?t=2775"&gt;before-and-after presentation&lt;/a&gt; was impressive, but we’ll have to see how it actually performs in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="QwUH07"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22499034"&gt;Snapchat gets a special place on the Pixel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qtFb6N"&gt;You’ll be able to quickly access Snapchat’s camera by tapping the back of the Pixel, even from the lock screen. Of course, you’ll have to log into the phone to actually send the Snap to your friends, but it’s quite possibly the quickest way to send a Snap that we’ve seen yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="na3Wsr"&gt;Google announced a new Pixel phone feature, which aims to make calls to customer service lines less awful by trying to estimate how long you’ll have to wait on hold and giving you a written list of the phone tree options, so you don’t have to go “wait, what number do I press for this again?” Google’s also expanding its feature that lets you have your phone wait on hold for you to more countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="qxpSs0"&gt;Google didn’t announce it during the event itself, but it’s also launched Pixel Pass alongside the new phones. Pixel Pass lets you bundle a phone (and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/7528518?hl=en"&gt;Google’s Preferred Care repair plan&lt;/a&gt;), cloud storage, YouTube Premium, and Google Play Pass, all in one monthly payment. Google’s charging $45 per month for the plan with a Pixel 6 and $55 a month for the Pixel 6 Pro plan. According to the company, you’ll end up paying off your phone over the course of two years, and if you cancel Pixel Pass, you’ll have to pay off the remaining balance on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIfpRT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-pixel-pass/?_ga=2.47950050.454935072.1634662818-63996501.1634662818"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; that subscribers to Google Fi, its cellular plan, will get $5 off their monthly bill for subscribing to Pixel Pass. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the Pixel 6 compares to the Pixel 6 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h-JP5RqG0K2_Zvw2q3b_1-Pbu8Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016830/bfarsace_211014_4802_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sote5c"&gt;There’s a lot that we already knew about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; ahead of their debut at Google’s October 2021 event. Some of the key specs, including the Tensor processor and the camera details, were made publicly available by Google itself. But of course, we know a lot more now than we did before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dv7Xm"&gt;Check out my colleague Dan Seifert’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;big hands-on with both phones right here&lt;/a&gt;. It dives into the design, features, and he talks about how this is a big moment both for Google to prove that its Tensor processor is as good as it claims to be and that it knows how to make flagship phones that people want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j9ykUg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oOL3J0"&gt;If all that you’re curious about is raw specs, we’ve got that below. Given that the design differences between the Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6 are minor, we’re focused instead on what’s inside of them. There are just a couple of differences internally, but you deserve to know what they are. To be exhaustive, we’ve also compared them to other Pixel phones that you can easily buy these days, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xmqcf3"&gt;We’ll add more specs to this table should they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro can make calling customer service less nightmarish </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gs1QKAOmO5TSMA0PEHlfoM2cQWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016597/bfarsace_211014_4802_0052.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CYT4Y2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; is Google’s first phone with a custom-designed SoC, and the appeal of the Tensor chip isn’t in raw power, it’s what the combination of hardware and software can do. Speech and image processing that happens on device are great for Google Assistant or improving photographs, but a feature many owners will appreciate at launch is &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/phone-app-updates/"&gt;an improved Phone app that’s built to manage annoying calls to customer service lines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6gNLDId5wrMsjhGLKvfOZCCUXlk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939435/Dialer_P6_Marketing_Wait_Times.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jdw4RD"&gt;According to Google, the app can tell you the current hold time for a business’s 1-800 number before you even dial, as well as the projected wait times for later in the day or week. These projections are “inferred from call length data that is not linked to user identifier.” Google didn’t get more specific, but it sounds similar to Google Maps monitoring traffic flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuOtOq"&gt;Direct My Call is a feature built for anyone who has ever forgotten the list of choices by the time an automated message is reading off the third one. It presents the options and their associated numbers right on the screen, so that you don’t have to listen to the entire spiel again just because you were distracted for a moment. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0h0y8RKFdaqkQosjY8SA78MsAHQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939410/pixel_call.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yovcCJ"&gt;Meanwhile, the Google Duplex-powered Hold for Me feature is expanding to Pixel owners in Australia, Canada, and Japan soon. Google will also prompt users to share information about businesses that call using numbers not already in its directory, with the intent to eventually share that information to other people who receive calls from those businesses. That could add some information to businesses that simply use multiple numbers... or give you a heads-up that a bill collector is on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeLJO9"&gt;It’s not clear whether these features will always be Pixel-exclusive, or if they’ll be available on older Pixel models.&lt;/p&gt;
