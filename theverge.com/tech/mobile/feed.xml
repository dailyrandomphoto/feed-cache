    <title>T-Mobile launches long-promised 5G home internet service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile first began piloting wireless home internet over LTE in 2019. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZegUuC"&gt;After a long pilot period, T-Mobile is making its 5G home internet service a reality. The company made the announcement on a livestream this morning, teased as its next Uncarrier move. The company says that 30 million homes are now eligible for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIDGQ2"&gt;The 5G home internet service costs $60 per month, or $65 without autopay, which is $10 more per month than when the pilot program was introduced. The service comes with no data caps, hardware rental fees, or annual contracts, and customers self-install their own equipment. T-Mobile says the average customer will experience speeds of 100 Mbps. But there’s an important caveat: home internet customers are subject to data slowdowns during times of network congestion, which could be a serious deterrent for some customers who live in dense areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HB1E69"&gt;T-Mobile’s talk of 5G home internet dates back to 2019, when the company was making its case to the FCC why it should be allowed to acquire Sprint. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254853/tmobile-sprint-merger-5g-home-internet-service-promises"&gt;claimed that gaining access&lt;/a&gt; to Sprint’s network would be a necessary step in offering high-speed in-home wireless internet. According to the company, this would allow T-Mobile to offer an alternative to the dominant ISPs, and bring faster internet to underserved rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="detQu9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2h75wy"&gt;Before the ink was dry on the deal, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;T-Mobile started piloting the service&lt;/a&gt; over its existing LTE network. It started small, as an invitation-only deal for 50,000 households. As of last month, the pilot included 100,000 households, and T-Mobile said it would aim to offer the service to 7 to 8 million households within the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCLeHM"&gt;Testing a pilot program in select cities is one thing; opening up that service to 5G customers across the country is another. T-Mobile is certainly confident that its network can handle it, and with good reason — that spectrum it acquired from Sprint &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297311/tmobile-5g-mid-band-magenta-max-unlimited-data"&gt;has given it a leg up&lt;/a&gt;, especially compared to Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T. Maybe when it’s done fulfilling &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; promise from its Sprint acquisition talks, it can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;work on its promise to help Dish&lt;/a&gt; become that fourth wireless carrier that we’ve been missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfPf4h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung is bringing its lowest-cost 5G phones to the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eNy7tQ3zzU7D1HzCcoipD2oNM0o=/0x1:2000x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088752/Galaxy_A02S_A12_A32_A42_5G_5G_A52_5G_Lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five new A-series models will debut in the US this month, from the entry-level A02s up to the midrange A52 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C4wNQQ"&gt;Until now, we’ve known almost everything about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334392/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-a72-specs-price-camera"&gt;Samsung’s newest Galaxy A-series phones&lt;/a&gt; (which were announced recently at the company’s Unpacked event) except for a couple of key details: which models would be sold in the US and for how much. That’s the announcement Samsung made today, with three low-cost 5G phones leading the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cIkjQ"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G, A42 5G, and A32 5G will all go on sale in the US later this week, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231420/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-europe-cheapest-5g-phone"&gt;sub-$300 A32&lt;/a&gt; clocking in as Samsung’s lowest-cost 5G model to date. They’ll each ship loaded with Android 11 and with charging bricks included in the box. Also arriving Stateside soon: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21628573/samsung-a12-a02s-phones-budget-price-specs-2021"&gt;entry-level Galaxy A12 and A02s&lt;/a&gt;, each costing under $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4QvV6M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10432345"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2LYuk9"&gt;The A52 5G is the highest specced A-series model US customers will see this year; the A72, which was unveiled at the same Unpacked event, is missing from today’s list. The A52 5G follows up on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;last year’s solid A51 model&lt;/a&gt; and includes a 6.5-inch OLED with 120Hz refresh rate, a Snapdragon 750G processor, IP67 water resistance rating, and a 4,500mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pAGFLFoROgD83eL_GtiW2VvuNI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424833/Galaxy_A52_5G_Awesome_Black_Front_Back.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G features a stabilized main camera, IP67 weather resistance, and a 120Hz screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="726Ua2"&gt;Its camera hardware is also a step up from the other models in this bunch, including a 64-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization. The A52 5G supports sub-6GHz 5G only (no mmWave), and like the other two 5G models, it supports C-band frequencies at a hardware level. It will be sold with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for $499 starting on April 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gGqZrgSgCd2Gxqqitc7DCtn1-mI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424847/GalaxyA42_5G_Variants.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A42 5G supports sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wrCzlm"&gt;The A42 5G is the only model of the bunch to support mmWave 5G in addition to sub-6GHz. It also features a 6.6-inch OLED with standard 60Hz refresh rate, and like the A52 5G, it will use a Snapdragon 750G chipset. The A42 5G features a 48-megapixel main camera and doesn’t include an IP rating. It will include 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and is going on sale for $399 starting on April 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6X-DqtsUzJueeQ8sMP0LUxnmmX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424854/Galaxy_A32_5G_Awesome_Black_Front_Back.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A32 5G is Samsung’s least expensive 5G model to date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k6jEFV"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy A32 5G skips out on quite a few features in order to hit its low price point. It includes an LCD rather than OLED — a 6.6-inch panel with 90Hz refresh rate — and uses a MediaTek 720 processor rather than a Snapdragon chipset. It will include 4GB of RAM and a skimpy 64GB of storage, thankfully expandable by microSD. It will sell for $279 starting on April 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m-Vc98jOIvuWYPmFTFnFYQKl_ig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424856/Galaxy_A12_Black_Front_Angled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A12 offers a 6.5-inch LCD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7igkht"&gt;Rounding out the set are the LTE-only, budget-oriented A12 and A02s, each featuring a 6.5-inch LCD with standard refresh rate and a 5,000mAh battery. The A12 gets a 16-megapixel main camera and a 5-megapixel ultrawide and will offer 3GB of RAM. The A02s includes a 13-megapixel main camera without the ultrawide and offers just 2GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlVP9f"&gt;Both phones will ship with Android 10 and (thankfully) offer storage expansion via microSD; with just 32GB of built-in storage each, some extra space will be a necessity. The Galaxy A12  will sell for $179 starting on April 9th; the Galaxy A02s will cost $109.99 and arrive on April 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIuR0V"&gt;All of these A-series devices will be sold unlocked by Samsung, though the company could only confirm that the A52 5G would be available this way on April 9th; all others would be coming at some point later this spring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAsXdC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gazelle brings back its phone trade-in program two months after discontinuing it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12, in blue." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0wTxK49NyoGux2ayro6iaVNjl9U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69086084/vpavic_4243_20201018_0121.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hj8AnD"&gt;Trade-in provider Gazelle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206779/gazelle-smartphone-used-trade-in-program-shut-down"&gt;exited the online trade-in business&lt;/a&gt; back in February, and now the company says it’s changing its mind. Gazelle is back to accepting online trade-ins of iPhones, Samsung phones, Google Pixel devices, and iPads and other tablets on its website, the company confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The program resumed accepting new offers on April 5th, a Gazelle representative clarified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDePCQ"&gt;“Earlier this year, we announced that we will no longer be offering our trade-in option on Gazelle. After careful consideration, including feedback from customers like you, we have decided to keep Gazelle Trade-In going. Today, we are happy to say, ‘We’re back, baby!’” reads an email Gazelle sent to prospective customers and shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Gazelle Trade-In is a pioneer of the electronics trade-in space and we are happy to continue building on our legacy by offering a simple process and immediate payouts for those unwanted devices.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk0Fcj"&gt;Gazelle emerged as one of the leading trade-in providers of the smartphone era. But its business model didn’t fare as well when the US mobile phone business underwent major shifts away from two-year contracts and outright device purchases and toward phone leasing and carrier and device maker trade-in programs like Apple’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8v5QVq"&gt;Gazelle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206779/gazelle-smartphone-used-trade-in-program-shut-down"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; back in December of last year it would end its online phone trade-in program on February 1st, 2021, though the company said at the time it would continue to operate its in-person trade-in kiosks through parent company ecoATM. Gazelle did confirm in the email sent to customers that it will not be bringing back its rewards program. “We will continue to evaluate the market conditions and will inform you if this changes,” the email reads. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this feature on how India’s digital revolution started with missed calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="INDIA-ECONOMY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ygzgFnXJjndxRvgNs35f9_Mc5E=/0x3:8367x5581/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085277/1231334394.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JEWEL SAMAD/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KREkbs"&gt;Leaving a missed call on someone’s phone usually signals that you should call them back — but at one point in India, it was communication in its own right. &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-rise-and-fall-of-missed-calls-in-india/"&gt;A new feature by Atul Bhattarai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; examines the Indian culture that grew up around missed calls — and the startups that took advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeXSb9"&gt;In basic terms, a “missed call” means dialing a person but hanging up before they can answer. Hanging up without talking let users send a basic message (“I called”) without getting charged for minutes or SMS messages — like paging someone without a pager. Bhattarai focuses on ZipDial, a company that turned missed calls into a robust advertising business and a way to experience some of the features of online life without paying for data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6V18Uz"&gt;As Bhattarai writes, using missed calls to communicate came about because of the high cost of cellphone data and limited access to high-speed internet. Calling long enough to connect to someone else’s phone and then hanging up or not picking up on the other end avoided being charged for the call. These missed calls could mean a variety of things, like letting a friend know you’re on your way or a loved one know that you miss them. “The fact that the missed call demanded only basic numeric literacy made them accessible to the third of India’s population that was illiterate,” Bhattarai explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu1ehq"&gt;ZipDial combined the missed call trend and preexisting SMS services into a kind of a one-stop shop for cellphone owners who wanted basic internet functionality. ZipDial would partner with a brand and set up a hotline that people could call for services like sports scores or celebrity tweets. All it took was “signing up” with a missed call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jINvf7"&gt;Bhattarai also highlights a proto-Spotify algorithmic playlist service called Kan Khajura, which delivered new music in 15-minute calls. “Kan Khajura’s central appeal was that it could be accessed anywhere and anytime, unlike the radio and TV,” Bhattarai writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkuUeq"&gt;Those businesses became unsustainable as mobile data became cheaper, and ZipDial ceased operations in 2016. But Bhattarai argues the services helped bridge the offline-online gap in a period before internet service providers and physical infrastructure caught up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWi18q"&gt;You can read the full feature on &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-rise-and-fall-of-missed-calls-in-india/"&gt;ZipDial’s missed call empire&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Rest of World.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal is testing a payments feature that lets you send cryptocurrency to friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7krYp4GTId4FksGKcsb8NJz0nNM=/48x0:2073x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084630/payments_hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Signal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bYv2gU"&gt;Signal &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; it’s now testing a new peer-to-peer payments system in the beta version of its apps. Appropriately called Signal Payments, the new feature right now supports only one protocol: the MobileCoin wallet and its companion cryptocurrency MOB. MobileCoin has a close relationship with Signal co-founder and CEO Moxie Marlinspike, who advised the company prior to its &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/mobilecoin-a-cryptocurrency-involving-signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-just-raised-venture-funding/"&gt;most recent round of funding announced last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uc7YcI"&gt;“The first payments protocol we’ve added support for is a privacy focused payments network called MobileCoin, which has its own currency, MOB,” wrote Jun Harada, Signal’s head of growth and communication, in a &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “As always, our goal is to keep your data in your hands rather than ours; MobileCoin’s design means Signal does not have access to your balance, full transaction history, or funds. You can also transfer your funds at any time if you want to switch to another app or service.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6_fQUckH7quKkzlE6YPQUuKLaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424615/payments_product.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signal&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7rOAFc"&gt;The company says those interested in trying out the feature must live in the UK for now, and those who qualify can sign up for MobileCoin and access the feature through the &lt;a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-"&gt;Signal beta&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a beta feature in a &lt;a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-"&gt;beta build&lt;/a&gt;, but for those in the United Kingdom living life on the edge, please help us test and give feedback,” Harada writes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yelp is making it easier for users to search for Asian-owned businesses</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vUROOt"&gt;Yelp is rolling out a new tool that will allow businesses the option to identify themselves as Asian-owned, chief diversity officer Miriam Warren announced today. The new optional attribute will make it easier for Yelp users to find and support Asian-owned businesses easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvq950"&gt;Business owners will be allowed to edit their existing listing on Yelp and select the attribute that notes they are an Asian-owned business. The feature will be available when a business owner logs in to their Yelp for Business account. Once enabled, users who filter by “Asian owned” restaurants will find a list of businesses near their location that have self-selected that attribute. Yelp previously rolled out similar attributes for businesses to display, such as the option to identify as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21281887/yelp-new-search-tool-black-owned-businesses-app-donation-matching"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;- or &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/michelle-cheng/yelp-search-women-owned-businesses.html"&gt;women-owned&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n5fwG_mN0EXySZAIBv1YUsKK77U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416771/Yelp_for_Business_App_Selecting_Asian_owned_Attribute.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Yelp&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yelp for Business will allow owners to enable the Asian-owned attribute. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vpnyd1"&gt;Yelp also confirmed in its &lt;a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/diverse-business-report"&gt;latest Economic Impact Report on diverse businesses&lt;/a&gt; that searches on Yelp for Asian-owned businesses increased by 130 percent in February. The company also said that, during the months of April and May, the Yelp Foundation will double match any donations a Yelp employee makes to selections that are Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving, such as &lt;a href="https://www.advancingjustice-atlanta.org/"&gt;Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://stopaapihate.org/"&gt;Stop AAPI Hate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixel 5 reportedly gets big GPU performance boost with new update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g6tbQ4"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/105130965?hl=en"&gt;started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; the April Android security update for Pixel phones, and it looks like it’s brought some performance improvements to the most recent devices. Google says the update includes “performance optimizations for certain graphics-intensive apps and games” on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;, and, as &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-5-massive-gpu-performance-gains-april-2021-update/"&gt;noted by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some testers are noticing substantially improved GPU performance on the Pixel 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl9kak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech &lt;/em&gt;previously &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16442/the-google-pixel-5-a-minireview/3"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the Pixel 5 turned in much worse GPU results than other phones using the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip. Now, the site’s reviewer Andrei Frumusanu &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andreif7/status/1379143336943058952"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that performance on his Pixel 5 has been “essentially doubled” from the review’s initial figures and is now “in line or better than other 765G phones.” Benchmarks don’t necessarily translate into real-world results, of course, but combined with Google’s reference to optimizations for graphics-intensive apps, it does sound like GPU performance should be better with the new release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJpZXV"&gt;In addition, Google says that the Pixel 5 and 4A 5G should receive “improvements to camera quality” in some third-party apps. There’s also a fix for a startup freezing bug on Pixel 4 and 5 devices, as well as one for missing home grid settings on the Pixel 3 and 4 generations of phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s latest budget phones ask: is refresh rate more important than resolution?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tuFrMXoqVwLqUN3dC0KTspxBkuU=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69080845/galaxy_f12.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="du4xVp"&gt;If you had to choose: would you choose a sharper screen on your smartphone, or a smoother-scrolling one? This year, budget phone buyers may be asking themselves that question: the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/oneplus-brings-a-90hz-smartphone-to-the-us-for-180/"&gt;OnePlus Nord N100&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;Moto G50,&lt;/a&gt; and the new Samsung &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/samsung-india-launches-fullonfab-galaxy-f12-with-true-48mp-quad-camera-and-90hz-display"&gt;Galaxy F12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/samsung-india-launches-monsterreloaded-galaxy-m12-with-8nm-exynos-processor-and-90hz-display"&gt;M12&lt;/a&gt; all refresh their screens 90 times per second (which is good!) but with a lower-than-optimal screen resolution of 720p. That’s the same resolution as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/17/2568348/galaxy-nexus-review"&gt;Galaxy Nexus from 2011&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Liz9"&gt;Compared to your average iPhone, that’s a paltry number of pixels. Since the iPhone 4 debuted in 2010, every Apple handset has offered at least 326 pixels per inch (PPI), enough so you can’t make out those individual pixels with the naked eye at typical viewing distances. (The marketing term is “retina display.”) Here, the PPI would be more like 270. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i9AjxE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yj1go6OuZ4A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7rxfEv"&gt;And yet Apple has never offered an iPhone with a high-refresh-rate screen, which we’ve often found to be one of the most desirable features on high-end and mid-range smartphones since it makes everything you do (not just games) feel much smoother. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;Apple might make it happen later this year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jk7ygU"&gt;But the Galaxy F12 and M12, the OnePlus and Moto all show that high-refresh doesn’t need to be a high-end feature at all, or even a $300 one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;like we recently saw with the OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;. The Samsung phones in particular cost under $150 each, as long as you’re willing to sacrifice pixels to get there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jlaiw"&gt;In other ways, the 9,999-rupee handsets seem like they might be decent picks too: they’re based on the same basic platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21628573/samsung-a12-a02s-phones-budget-price-specs-2021"&gt;as the Galaxy A12 and its four-camera array&lt;/a&gt;, but with a larger 6,000mAh battery that dwarfs many others on the market. You get a sidemounted fingerprint sensor. Just note while its 8nm Exynos 850 processor might sound shiny and new, it’s not comparable with Qualcomm’s recent 800-series Snapdragon chips. It’s closer to 2019’s Snapdragon 665 in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xibs7b"&gt;It’s not clear whether either of these phones will come to the US quite yet. The OnePlus Nord N100 already has, and the G50 launched in Europe late last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAN6mD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic just made streaming Fortnite easier than ever with a new Houseparty integration</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vIIB_FEzmd3sF8Hxg3-MuBo1FN8=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078880/stream_fortnite_gameplay_to_houseparty_1280x720_224cb65f8d7c.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ev6jux"&gt;Epic is further stitching together its various platforms with a new &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; integration for its social video app Houseparty that &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/stream-your-fortnite-gameplay-to-friends-inside-houseparty?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;lets you stream your gameplay to friends&lt;/a&gt;. The integration builds on an existing one that uses Houseparty’s video chatting capabilities to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572069/fortnite-houseparty-video-chat-pc-ps4-ps5"&gt;bring live video chat into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now this essentially does the reverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZg3qL"&gt;That way, your friends can see you live both through your mobile phone camera and also the feed of your active &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;game. Think of it a bit like Twitch streaming without all the fuss and just for your friends instead of the broader public. Epic says the feature supports streaming from a PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, or PC right now. “We will let everyone know if we’re able to support more platforms in the future,” Epic says in its blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kyjnh5"&gt;Epic owns Houseparty, which streamlines fast and easy group video chat, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662708/epic-games-houseparty-acquisition-fortnite-video-chat"&gt;2019 acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, and the game maker has used the app to boost the social feature sets of its various gaming platforms. A few months following the acquisition, Epic began using Houseparty for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871464/fortnite-voice-chat-party-hub-houseparty"&gt;improved &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;cross-platform audio chat&lt;/a&gt;, and now a full bridge between the game and the app exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOJafX"&gt;For a breakdown of how to enable Houseparty gameplay streaming and video chat, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/stream-your-fortnite-gameplay-to-friends-inside-houseparty?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;check out Epic’s FAQ here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG says some phones will get Android 12 updates, but we’re skeptical</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9JLpHDS59marPNaKaSNPBQA6CU8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078689/cwelch_200218_3910_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG V60 — launched in early 2020 — could be on the list for an Android 12 update.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eYfu7t"&gt;LG says it will continue to offer Android OS updates — including an upgrade to Android 12 — for some of its devices after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;exits the smartphone business&lt;/a&gt;, but the company’s poor track record has us feeling skeptical it’ll follow through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0SUJg"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fpress-release%2Flg-to-close-mobile-phone-business-worldwide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F5%2F22368129%2Flg-phones-android-12-update-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; and on a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fnotice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F5%2F22368129%2Flg-phones-android-12-update-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;, LG says only that it will continue to provide some security and OS updates, but a page on LG’s Korean website &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-android-12-update/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; specifically mentions that an “Android 12 OS upgrade will also be provided for selected models.” This page also notes that this is subject to change based on product performance, and that update availability may vary by region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8c6v05"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LG wasn’t very reliable with updates even prior to its decision to get out of the phone business&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N0YSS5"&gt;LG US didn’t share anything more specific when contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying only that “LG may offer certain OS upgrades for select models,” and that “additional details will be provided in the near future on software updates.” An Android 11 update schedule hasn’t yet been confirmed for the US either, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327144/lg-android-11-software-update-wing-phones-mobile-q4-2021"&gt;details posted on LG’s German website&lt;/a&gt; could give a rough idea of what that might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDoIPb"&gt;Unfortunately, LG wasn’t very reliable with updates even prior to its decision to get out of the phone business; OS upgrades came slowly, even for flagship devices. In 2018, the company attempted to remedy this by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/12/17228306/lg-android-software-upgrade-center-research-development"&gt;setting up a Software Upgrade division&lt;/a&gt;, but when it came time to offer Android 9 Pie updates in early 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/1/18164265/lg-android-pie-update-g7-v40-q1-2019"&gt;not much had actually changed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOA9Cw"&gt;If the company does make good on its Android 12 promise, we expect that it would only come to a few high-profile devices, like the Wing and V60. And with Android 11 only scheduled to come to many of the company’s phones much later this year, even if that 12 update does come it’ll likely be a long ways off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WsG0st"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG had few smartphone hits, but it’ll still be missed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22367903/lg-smartphone-retrospective-hits-misses"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
