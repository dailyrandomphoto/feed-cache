    <title>Visible customers can now get 5G and use eSIMs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRPr7-QCR4o6Q49AO015tkRUWKE=/128x0:1508x920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68792395/1_SmzBzHMl2wygmhoz_KWrGg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;eSIM makes it possible to activate your device with a new carrier without waiting for a physical SIM card. | Image: Visible&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nyx3bQ"&gt;Visible, the Verizon-owned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18195784/verizon-visible-carrier-selling-devices-iphone-galaxy"&gt;MVNO&lt;/a&gt;, is adding some new services that make using it just a bit more like subscribing to one of the big wireless carriers. Starting today, Visible now supports activating service via eSIM. It only works with recent, compatible iPhones, but Visible says it will add support for Android devices soon. The company also is offering 5G service (with limits) and free calling and messaging to Canada and Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgbEQY"&gt;Visible customers’ access to Verizon’s 5G network has some important fine print: both Nationwide and Ultra Wideband are included, but data speeds will be capped at 200Mbps. Direct carrier subscribers (AKA Verizon customers) also have priority on the fastest data speeds during times of congestion. That’s par for the course for MVNOs. While they can offer competitively priced plans, they’re commonly subject to limitations like speed reductions for heavy data users and streaming video at 480p only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5U9XB2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Both Nationwide and Ultra Wideband are included, but data speeds will be capped at 200Mbps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NFKaiv"&gt;eSIM support makes a lot of sense with Visible’s all-digital ethos: customers with compatible phones can switch to Visible without waiting for a physical SIM card to be mailed. By opting for an embedded rather than removable SIM card, eSIM technology makes it easier to switch carriers using an existing device. That’s very appealing to MVNOs trying to compete with the big carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKrSSV"&gt;Many MVNOs don’t support eSIM yet, but more are coming this year. H2o Wireless and Pure Talk &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/2-prepaid-brands-offer-esim-a-sign-mvnos-are-ready-to-tap-technology"&gt;will both offer eSIM support sometime this quarter&lt;/a&gt;. But while it makes initially signing on with a new carrier easier, eSIM presents its own drawbacks, including a more complicated process when switching to a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJvfLi"&gt;Visible’s announcement today also includes news about its Party Pay plans, which allow customers to share plan costs while maintaining separate accounts and billing. Previously capped at four people, these plans can now include an unlimited number of lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iVAw5"&gt;Finally, Visible will no longer charge for calls and texts between the mainland US and Canada, Mexico, US Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. It’s increasingly the norm for US carriers to include calling and SMS from the US to neighboring regions without an extra fee or at low monthly flat rate. All of these features (except for upcoming Android eSIM support) are available starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm announces its next-gen X65 5G modem, promises up to 10Gbps speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0gcGiN_D2rmhbvhXuESDhoerjkM=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791691/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwCuoi"&gt;Qualcomm has announced its latest 5G modem — the Snapdragon X65, a successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142381/qualcomm-x60-modem-5g-phones-faster-power-efficient-5nm-carrier"&gt;last year’s Snapdragon X60&lt;/a&gt; which just started to hit devices as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888 chipset&lt;/a&gt;. Qualcomm promises that the new modem will be much, much faster, with support for up to 10Gbps speeds on both standalone and non-standalone 5G networks (assuming your carrier supports it, that is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJloCB"&gt;It’ll likely be some time before the X65 hits any devices; if history is any indication, it likely won’t show up until next year’s flagship Snapdragon release, which presumably will be announced in December. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sgacAGS2NYapFaHGr_9_eTHgf3E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22291692/Qualcomm_Snapdragon_X65_5G_Modem_RF_System_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j4hT38"&gt;The new 10Gbps maximum download speed — up from 7.5Gbps on last year’s model — is the flashiest spec, even if its a largely meaningless one, as virtually no 5G network can provide that kind of throughput yet. But it means that there’s plenty of headroom in the specification for networks for whenever they can get to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk8c3r"&gt;That flexibility for future improvements is at the heart of one of the other big features of the X65: support for the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.3gpp.org/release-16"&gt;3GPP Release 16 specification&lt;/a&gt; (Qualcomm says that it’s the first modem to do so). That’s the so-called “5G phase 2” rollout that’s &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2020/07/07/propelling-5g-forward-closer-look-3gpp-release-16"&gt;designed to improve things&lt;/a&gt; like massive MIMO connectivity, power consumption, and more. Release 16 is also meant to help 5G networks expand from consumer to more commercial uses, thanks to better support for unlicensed spectrum and non-public networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evu5Yy"&gt;To that end, Qualcomm says that the architecture of the X65 modem system is upgradable, allowing the company to add new features over time, especially as 3GPP Release 16 continues to roll out, allowing devices to stay relevant and up to date for longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDaM9j"&gt;Along with the new modem system, Qualcomm is also announcing the Qualcomm 545 mmWave antenna, its 4th-generation mmWave antenna, which keeps the size the same as the third-generation model, but adds higher transmit power, along with support for the full range of global mmWave frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQTRrHbolAKMfxEw4U2oEDKYITE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22291694/Qualcomm_QTM547_mmWave_antenna_module.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dbm352"&gt;Lastly, Qualcomm is introducing what its calls “AI antenna tuning technology,” which it promises will enable big jumps in performance thanks to AI-powered tuning. For example, Qualcomm says that the new system is 30 percent more accurate at detecting how you’re gripping the phone in your hand, allowing it to offer improved connectivity, faster data speeds, and better battery life by utilizing a more efficient connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXg72T"&gt;The Snapdragon X65 is expected to launch in products in late 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyzhDo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9KqYx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mw6gZY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIKbTX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s CEO wants to talk to President Biden</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Billionaire Huawei Founder Ren Zhenfei Defiant in Face of Existential Threat" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dsTdD_1vM1pdBOjbEt_LxPrcR7k=/0x3:4240x2830/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791163/1146396255.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ywa5HK"&gt;Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei has called for a reset in relations between the US and the Chinese tech giant. Speaking to international media in China for the first time in more than a year, Ren expressed willingness to speak with President Biden and said he hoped for “open policies” from the new administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaSejD"&gt;“I would welcome [a call from Biden]” Ren said in translated comments provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-welcome-phone-call-from-us-president-biden.html"&gt;reported by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/huawei-ceo-hopes-reset-us-053713079.html"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3121109/huaweis-ren-zhengfei-calls-more-open-us-policy-towards-china-under"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I would talk with him about common development. Both the US and China need to develop their economies, as this is good for our society and financial balance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBEW63"&gt;“Allowing US companies to supply goods to Chinese customers is conducive to their own financial performance,” Ren said. “If Huawei’s production capacity expanded, that would mean US companies could sell more. It’s a win-win situation. I believe the new administration will weigh and balance these interests as they consider their policies. We still hope to be able to buy a lot of US components, parts, and machinery so that US companies can also develop with the Chinese economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ELCDGf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Living a Google-free life with a Huawei phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I1WQik"&gt;Huawei is currently unable to do business with US companies because the Trump administration placed it on the Department of Commerce’s trade blacklist, citing national security fears. Among other issues, this means Huawei is unable to license Android from Google, severely hampering its smartphone business outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsVcPY"&gt;This prompted Huawei to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243559/honor-v40-announced-huawei-google-sanctions-specs"&gt;sell off its Honor subsidiary&lt;/a&gt; in order to protect the brand and allow it to keep on producing smartphones, but Ren dismissed rumors that Huawei might do the same for its own smartphone division. “We will never sell our device business,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GakoO"&gt;Ren also called the iPhone 12 “the best in the world” and said that it helped make the case for Huawei’s 5G networks. “Many high-end device users in Europe use iPhones, and the way those phones operate on our networks in Europe actually is a sign we are also doing well,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UAke5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Feb 9th, 7.55AM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated Ren’s quotes to reflect an official transcript of the discussion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s App Store is hosting multimillion-dollar scams, says this iOS developer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRMuVrltnfZKYSvIEWrK-dR5QdU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68788371/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UakKY0"&gt;Mobile app developer Kosta Eleftheriou has a new calling that goes beyond software development: taking on what he sees as a rampant scam problem ruining the integrity of Apple’s App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7m4aTz"&gt;Eleftheriou, who created the successful Apple Watch keyboard app FlickType, has for the last two weeks been publicly criticizing Apple for lax enforcement of its App Store rules that have allowed scam apps, as well as apps that clone popular software from other developers, to run rampant. These apps enjoy top billing in the iPhone marketplace, all thanks to glowing reviews and sterling five-star ratings that are largely fabricated, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bfrJAE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Up to now, I've been in the "Apple *wants* to do the right thing" camp. My viewpoint is starting to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to spot a $5M/year scam on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt;, in 5 minutes flat: &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357938977748078594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zq0wOY"&gt;“It’s surprising more people don’t know about this. The extent to which this has been going on and is currently going on is absolutely mind-blowing,” Eleftheriou tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;of the magnitude of fraud he says is occurring daily on the App Store&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;In particular now with the App Store, which is my main concern, the problem has grown to such an extent that having the rating and review system is making it worse. It gives consumers a false sense of security and a false idea that the app is great as you’re entering it through a glowing App Store page with raving reviews.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otnjzC"&gt;His vocal complaints, which have attracted the attention and support of countless other app developers in the iOS community, underscore the increasing tension between Apple and the software makers upon whom it depends. It comes at a time of unprecedented antitrust scrutiny and legal challenges from competitors related to the company’s stewardship of the App Store, from which it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;estimated to have made more than $64 billion last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpAAa8"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZkhTKG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The extent to which this has been going on and is currently going on is absolutely mind-blowing.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoaFRC"&gt;The issues Eleftheriou is raising are interlocking ones all stemming from what he says are inconsistently enforced App Store rules and lazy moderation. It’s not just apps that try to siphon money away from consumers under false pretenses using exploitative subscription services. It’s also fake reviews and ratings that can be bought and a broken algorithmic ranking system that helps these apps float to the top and take the spot of genuine paid apps developed by small teams or singular developers, Eleftheriou says. Letting it perpetuate, he adds, is a platform that Apple does not actively police unless it’s an issue that gains the attention of the media or involves one of Apple’s current rivals like Facebook or &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEXORD"&gt;Eleftheriou first detailed his personal experience with App Store scams &lt;a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;amp;jsonp=vglnk_161281136039111&amp;amp;key=c1c7d488bb2df8a8b659d5d41634d304&amp;amp;libId=kkwxug0j010023dg000DLc57hpt7i&amp;amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2021%2F02%2F08%2Fapp-store-scam-apps-how-to-spot%2F&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fkeleftheriou%2Fstatus%2F1356011069395755009&amp;amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;amp;title=Developer%20exposes%20multiple%20scam%20apps%20on%20the%20App%20Store%2C%20some%20bringing%20in%20millions%20of%20dollars%20in%20revenue%20-%209to5Mac&amp;amp;txt=thread%20began%20two%20weeks%20ago"&gt;late last month in a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, where he explained how his app FlickType was maliciously copied by numerous developers that built non-functioning versions of the software and charged egregious subscription fees, only getting away with it because of strong App Store reviews and high five-star ratings he claims are fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDyny2"&gt;Eleftheriou says his primary competitor, a scam app called KeyWatch, was charging users $8 per week and amassing more than $2 million a year, according to analytics from Appfigures, despite the app not functioning properly. He says KeyWatch even advertised its software using his promotional video — with his name still attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7onrML"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The App Store has a big problem &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You: an honest developer, working hard to improve your IAP conversions.&lt;br&gt;Your competitor: a $2M/year scam running rampant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/ &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dDNC96"&gt;Eleftheriou has since embarked on an online crusade to bring more attention to the topic, fueled in part by Apple choosing to take down some of the apps he’s been highlighting but letting the developers behind those apps continue publishing to the App Store. Scores of other developers have begun chiming in with their own experiences, too, including notable Apple critics like Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KZ5te"&gt;Some of these critics, including Hansson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;with regard to his company’s Hey email client&lt;/a&gt;, have accused Apple in the past of mistreating and overcharging developers using the App Store’s standard 30 percent cut of app downloads and in-app purchases. These critics see the scam situation as further proof that Apple profits off of these developers and therefore doesn’t take proper steps to moderate the platform and enforce its rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kkilUu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The subscription scam apps that Apple allow in the App Store really are bananas. While they're busy hunting legitimate developers down for their pound of flesh, they're letting these hyaenas strive on the savannah unopposed. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NpsjjWC0CY"&gt;https://t.co/NpsjjWC0CY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1358822574243905538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="S1tG5n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple refuses to take down two scam apps that destroy my honest business via fake ratings and false marketing claims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have hard proof yet Apple ignores my numerous reports.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt;, please do something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is my story.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppStore?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppStore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Appocalypse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Appocalypse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Scams?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Scams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/SCw9FHrN7g"&gt;https://t.co/SCw9FHrN7g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WatchChat (@WatchChatInfo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WatchChatInfo/status/1358825883465904131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AqKXD9"&gt;Apple has yet to respond publicly to Eleftheriou’s claims, though the company has removed KeyWatch and some of the other scam apps he’s brought attention to over the past week. But the issues are systemic, Eleftheriou says, and nothing short of an overhaul to how the App Store ranks software, measures trustworthiness, and roots out bad actors will remedy the issue. Until then, Eleftheriou says he’s going to keep sounding the alarm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DP3h6I"&gt;“I’m not gonna stop. Whenever I see a scam, I’m going to call them out,” he says. “I just can’t wait for some actual proper change from Apple to make me feel like I should concentrate on what I should be concentrating on, which is app development.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="zke3Gs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The more users understand this is a problem, the more pressure there will be on Apple to act.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2FSGs"&gt;He says a competing app store on the iPhone could help solve a lot of these issues. That’s the same line of argument Epic has used in its lawsuit against Apple over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Epic and its chief executive, Tim Sweeney, have called for alternative marketplaces on iOS, as well as the ability for apps distributed through the App Store to use their own payment systems and not give Apple 30 percent of every transaction. After Epic deployed its own in-app payment system within &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;last summer, Apple removed the app for violating its rules. Epic is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;suing both Apple and Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95KyD4"&gt;“In an ideal world, competition does have the tendency to sort a lot of things out, whether it’s pricing or enforcement of rules. Competition is like creativity; you get all these new ideas and hopefully the best get to the top,” Eleftheriou says. “The other way would be for developers to publicly share their stories as far and as wide as possible. The more users understand this is a problem, the more pressure there will be on Apple to act.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOAb8y"&gt;Eleftheriou adds that he’s disappointed in Apple’s silence on the matter, though that’s only energized him further to continue speaking out. “It’s not just acting. I think Apple needs to, at the minimum, say something, acknowledge the issue and that they’re working on it,” he says. “Just staying silent about it is just falsely reinforcing this notion for consumers that App Store reviews and ratings are to be trusted. They are not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYjouv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can save up to $200 on new unlocked Samsung Galaxy S21 phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IRuHbMDkV-ahn_z-KIf9gwhFxpk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68786870/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3A1wHz"&gt;Samsung’s new line of Galaxy S21 smartphones launched less than two weeks ago, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2FRMPN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614284-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_g991uzaaxaa_s21_128gb_5g_smartphone.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731727797377923180" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have already marked down the phones to their lowest prices to date, with up to $200 in savings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDm8oe"&gt;If the Galaxy S21 is the phone you’re looking for, you can grab an unlocked model with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2FRMPN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for only $700&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N38M7NT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $750&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a 6.2-inch 1080p screen with refresh rates of up to 120Hz and is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. My colleague, Dieter Bohn, praised the Galaxy S21 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt; for having a fast processor, nice screen, and good battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9udtJt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326026"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w4jpaN"&gt;The S21 Plus normally starts at $1,000, but you can grab an unlocked model with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N387GNG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for $800&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N3573HX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $850&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a 6.7-inch 1080p screen with adaptive refresh rates of up to 120Hz. The Galaxy S21 Plus also includes a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 64-megapixel telephoto lens on the back, in addition to a 10-megapixel selfie camera on the front. As my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Chaim Gartenberg points out in his hands-on&lt;/a&gt;, the S21 Plus no longer has a depth sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J5i6vc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNmk57"&gt;Lastly, Samsung’s flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S21 Ultra, is on sale starting at $1,000 if you want an unlocked &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2MSSZY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model&lt;/a&gt;, $1,050 if you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P54F6HB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;, and $1,180 if you want the highest storage configuration available for this phone, which is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2FS32C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L28LUW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is the only phone in the S21 line to include support for Samsung’s stylus, the S Pen, a first for the S-line of smartphones. The S21 Ultra also includes a 108-megapixel sensor. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;his review&lt;/a&gt;, Dieter praised the S21 Ultra’s battery life and camera system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="75FQ3F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Twitter reportedly mulls charging for TweetDeck and new advanced features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U88EYw8SYSJpWiiNc7EtryMS25E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68786799/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PPyeyp"&gt;Teams inside Twitter are researching ways for the company to offer paid subscriptions, which could include charging money for access to TweetDeck, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. TweetDeck is a popular alternative to the main Twitter website and mobile app that allows users to more efficiently manage multiple accounts and organize Twitter into a series of easier-to-read vertical feeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UI1uHX"&gt;Alongside charging for TweetDeck, the teams are said to be exploring other ideas, including charging for new features like an “undo send” button or more profile customization options. Another idea involves introducing “tipping” to Twitter, where users could pay accounts for exclusive content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KORx1s"&gt;Twitter is thought to be exploring these plans as a way to reduce its reliance on advertising, which currently provides the majority of its revenue. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that competing ad businesses from Facebook and Snapchat continue to grow faster than Twitter’s, and the company is under pressure to diversify, thanks to the pandemic as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/10/21171477/jack-dorsey-elliott-silver-lake-deal-ceo-twitter-take-private"&gt;high-profile activist investors&lt;/a&gt;. Introducing a series of premium pay models to Twitter would be a bold move given most social media companies prioritize offering their services for free to maximize growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8ifyt8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter said plans are in the “very early exploration” stage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MpOjKc"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Twitter’s head of revenue products, Bruce Falck, confirmed the company’s plans to improve its revenue mix “may include” subscriptions, but he stressed that its plans are in the “very early exploration” stage. “We do not expect any meaningful revenue attributable to these opportunities in 2021,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZBxTO"&gt;Twitter has been exploring some of these ideas for years. Back in 2017, the company considered charging for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/23/15043422/twitter-subscription-service-tweetdeck-survey"&gt;premium TweetDeck features&lt;/a&gt; before later abandoning the plans, and last year a customer survey &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/twitter-survey-reveals-the-subscription-options-its-eyeing-including-an-undo-send-option/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHDiKj3-9DGPXQKPafyuDvucuOSkK9DPen5Mh28KYkVuo2hwOK6fnKfFEiczD7fY5E8JMJ7odY2mYbkIL8oODJtO01B0Id8EmwP6cHwTTW0oHP0E0gTKe4LMMVDLGHn3xjAhKz58VMA0JCobhENrnFO561StKB5AGKZHiHh-lbbA#:~:text=Undo%20Send%3A%20A%2030%2Dsecond,before%20anyone%20can%20see%20it."&gt;revealed an interest&lt;/a&gt; in charging for an “undo send” feature. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that subscriptions have been mentioned on the company’s last two earnings calls, and just this past December, Twitter CFO Ned Segal said the company was exploring charging for features like “higher-quality video” and “analytics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xb0UU"&gt;Twitter is due to report its latest earnings tomorrow, so there’s a chance we might know more about its plans sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELLzVf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0TBLX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s global Mi 11 has a Snapdragon 888 for €749</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FP2bb3mf9m7tLypz32Ao6UV1i1s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68785861/DSCF7497.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AD8JE"&gt;Xiaomi is announcing the international version of its Mi 11 flagship phone today after an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;earlier release in China&lt;/a&gt;. No &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267807/xiaomi-quad-curved-waterfall-display-concept-phone-announced"&gt;wild waterfall displays&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;sci-fi wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; here — this device is very much in keeping with the Mi series’ MO of offering high specs at a competitive price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewFpet"&gt;The Mi 11 has a Snapdragon 888 processor, making it the first phone to launch with Qualcomm’s latest high-end chip (though Samsung’s Galaxy S21 series beat it to market outside China). The 888 has 5G connectivity built in, of course, and the phone has 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui8BMO"&gt;The screen appears to be the same panel — or very similar — to what’s found in the Galaxy S21 Ultra. It’s a slightly curved 6.8-inch 1440p OLED with a refresh rate of 120Hz and peak brightness of 1,500 nits, matching Samsung’s phone spec-for-spec. I don’t have the S21 Ultra to compare side-by-side, but I can tell you that the Mi 11’s screen is extremely good.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/glOdoGDCdddN6sBSrVBINgfLPwk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22288836/DSCF7498.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b9NQ2M"&gt;The Mi 11 has a 108-megapixel primary camera backed by a 13-megapixel ultrawide and a 5-megapixel “telemacro” camera. The selfie camera is 20 megapixels and tucked inside a small holepunch cutout at the top left of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgGWH0"&gt;The battery is 4,600mAh and can be charged at up to 55W with a cable and up to 50W wirelessly. The Mi 11 also features reverse wireless charging at up to 10W. It runs MIUI 12, based on Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3oZIn"&gt;Xiaomi hasn’t provided a full list of regions or launch dates just yet, but says the Mi 11 will be priced at €749 (~$900) for the 8GB/128GB model. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-mi-11-launched-europe/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+xda-developers%2FShsH+%28xda-developers%29#pricingmi11:~:text=The%20Xiaomi%20Mi%2011%20is%20priced%20at%20%E2%82%AC749%20for%20the%208GB%2B128GB%20variant%20and%20%E2%82%AC799%20for%20the%208GB%2B256GB%20variant.%20As"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; the 8GB/256GB model will retail for €799 (~$960). Stay tuned for a full review. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood has stopped limiting GameStop shares</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/09mlU72huS24d5vGOx4JjaV3NVM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68775730/acastro_210129_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s39ore"&gt;Robinhood has finally lifted all the restrictions on WallStreetBets-fueled stocks like GameStop and AMC, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-idUSKBN2A51QV?taid=601d5c573cb4af0001e7e97c&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;report on Friday from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company currently lists no limits on its support document entitled “Changes due to ongoing market volatility,” whereas last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;there were 50-plus companies included on the list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObFw8p"&gt;Robinhood’s decision to restrict buying certain stocks caused a firestorm of controversy, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;harsh condemnations from major public figures and politicians&lt;/a&gt; and the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;being review-bombed&lt;/a&gt; on both Android and iOS. For its part, Robinhood said it wasn’t shutting trades down on a matter of principle or due to any shady deals with hedge funds, &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week"&gt;but because it simply didn’t have enough cash&lt;/a&gt; to meet its regulatory requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7GPwb"&gt;The day the restrictions were put in place, GameStop’s stock closed at $325. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266684/gamestop-stock-gme-down-dip-falling-wallstreetbets-reddit"&gt;Yesterday, it closed at $53.50&lt;/a&gt;, so it could be argued that the rush is now over. So Robinhood lifting the restrictions doesn’t matter as much anymore, as the massive volume of trading happening last week appears to have subsided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8V9au"&gt;With that said, GameStop stock has seen some activity today, at one point shooting up to $95 a share. At the time of writing, GME is back down in the low-$60 range, and there’s no telling what it’ll close at today. But for the moment, it seems like it’s at least looking a little better than it was yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s new concept phone has a waterfall display on all four edges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lgGTlMqtQwPXYx4fLZv56jPtFZo=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68773384/EtcXdw7VoAEVfih.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jK59Er"&gt;Xiaomi has &lt;a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/02/05/xiaomi-debuts-its-first-quad-curved-waterfall-display-concept-smartphone/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its latest phone concept: a “quad-curved waterfall display.” This means that the unnamed phone’s screen not only has deep 88-degree “waterfall” curves on the left and right sides, but on the top and bottom as well, leaving no room for ports or buttons. Xiaomi says this is intended to “extend the limits of the display to infinity” and enable “a true, port-free unibody design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8of3rK"&gt;The obvious question is how that could possibly work at the screen’s corners, and based on the promotional imagery it looks like Xiaomi is simply leaving them blank with small, rounded cutouts. Not quite infinity, then, but still a neat trick — although for people who already don’t like the comparatively modest curved displays on phones like the Galaxy S21 Ultra, this sounds like their nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CbxKUBgz5BU8XR-wBqxC5EDGuI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22283412/mi.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bsJheq"&gt;Announcing a concept device entirely through renders doesn’t quite have the impact of showing it off in person, as was common pre-COVID. A Xiaomi representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this phone does actually exist and that they’ve used it themselves, for what that’s worth. The display is the result of “countless breakthroughs in glass bending and laminating technology,” according to Xiaomi, and “represents the sum of 46 groundbreaking patents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IO23F"&gt;This concept phone follows last week’s announcement of seemingly outlandish Xiaomi tech, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;“Mi Air Charge” truly wireless charging system&lt;/a&gt;. And back in 2019, Xiaomi revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/24/20881378/xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-announced-wrap-around-screen"&gt;the Mi Mix Alpha phone&lt;/a&gt;, which featured a display that wrapped around almost the entire device, though it ultimately never went on sale. This latest concept may well never make it into a commercially available device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o57Ycd"&gt;Xiaomi will announce global availability for its considerably more conventional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;Mi 11 flagship phone&lt;/a&gt; at an event next Monday, February 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niagara is a minimalist Android launcher I wish I’d had on my bus commute</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOd31n"&gt;After a couple years of beta testing, Niagara Launcher is now &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;available for download from the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. It’s designed to replace the default Android app drawer and home screen grid with a layout that’s easier to access with one hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZIrlX"&gt;You pick your favorite apps to pin on the home screen, and the rest are accessible under an alphabetized list on the right side of the screen in easy striking distance of your thumb. It’s quick and very responsive; you can either tap on the part of the alphabet you’re aiming for or swipe up and down to scroll your list of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eS7Yah"&gt;Niagara also allows you to take quick action from the home screen by swiping across any app to bring up a list of options, like setting a new timer in the clock app or starting a session with Strava. Favorited apps will also show a preview of notification content on the home screen, and a swipe will expand this to show the full text without opening the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ukD9Cp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Favorited apps will also show a preview of notification content on the home screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2csS7"&gt;These basic features are available with the free version, but customizing your home screen further with additional widgets and displaying your battery life percentage requires an upgrade to the paid pro version, which costs $6 per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fr5uw5"&gt;Niagara features a clever design, and it would really come in handy on a big phone. I also would have appreciated it on my standing-room-only bus commutes in the Before Time, when I often clung to a rail with one hand for dear life while checking my email with the other. It’s pretty handy on a smaller phone, too, for a more informative look at your notifications without requiring you to open an app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hONDG7"&gt;The free version does not contain ads, which is another plus. Yet while the launcher does offer the basics, it’s a little bit of a letdown that it doesn’t let you add something as simple as a weather widget without paying for the upgrade. Overall, though, Niagara offers a clean look and a unique solution for those of us with one-handed woes.&lt;/p&gt;
