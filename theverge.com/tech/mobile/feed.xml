    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 revealed in new leak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J5sOxxbmLf5fp1AedV2sW4qIxb4=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499738/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4y0Cej"&gt;Samsung’s 2021 foldable phones have been revealed in a new leak that shows off the design of the both the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3, which are rumored to be released sometime over the summer. The picture comes from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1408107239903223808?s=21"&gt;noted phone leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;, who posted the image to Twitter with the additional information that the Z Fold 3 is “definitely S-Pen compatible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6OFitp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not always. &lt;a href="https://t.co/SzBFpRKF5s"&gt;https://t.co/SzBFpRKF5s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/uf6rJAQhli"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uf6rJAQhli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1408107239903223808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aXPRs1"&gt;Blass’ first image doesn’t reveal too much about the design of the larger foldable, given that it shows the interior of the device (which appears similar to last year’s Z Fold 2). A second image posted shows off a slimmed down camera bump and a new “Fold Edition” S Pen stylus that will help the new foldable stand out — and potentially replace Samsung’s Galaxy Note phone in the company’s increasingly crowded smartphone line. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qZULQKv1zeeuJKAzVV0v4dZAQrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679450/E4qkWBHXwAgIQ_W.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1NCfLs"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3, on the other hand, has a more substantial redesign visible, with a larger external display and a two-tone color scheme for the now-vertically stacked cameras that are reminiscent of the Galaxy S21’s revamped design from earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ktbd6u"&gt;The leak also reveals that Samsung appears to be counting the Z Flip and its 5G variant, the Z Flip 5G, as separate iterations of the phone, allowing it to name the latest model of the vertical foldable the Z Flip 3 — nicely matching the Z Fold 3’s numbering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0HfnR"&gt;It’s not entirely clear when Samsung will be officially announcing the Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3, although the company does have an event scheduled for MWC 2021 on June 28th, where it’s promised to showcase the “Galaxy ecosystem” as well as its new watch experience that Samsung is collaborating with Google with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pokfvh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2:00pm EST: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional image of Z Fold 3 and its new S-Pen stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK carrier EE introduces EU roaming charges following Brexit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EE logo is seen at one of their stores on Oxford Street in..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5DKy0Xx0tmUb4Q_KcKgy39DZOo=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498687/1233588230.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Belinda Jiao/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4h0YM0"&gt;UK carrier EE is introducing roaming charges for customers traveling to almost all EU countries from January next year, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57595913"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The change applies to any customers who sign up or upgrade their plans after July 7th. From next year, these customers will be charged a flat fee of £2 (around $2.78) a day while in 47 “European destinations,” to get access to their plan’s existing data, minutes, and text allowances. The BT-owned carrier is also selling a 30-day Roam Abroad Pass, which is included with certain plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aJvPy"&gt;Roaming charges for UK customers visiting mainland Europe used to be commonplace until the European Union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15418776/eu-mobile-roaming-charges-date-june-15"&gt;outlawed the practice in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. However, following the UK’s departure from the EU, which involved a transition period that ended on December 31st 2020, UK carriers no longer have to abide by these rules. The UK’s trade deal with the EU encourages them to have “transparent and reasonable rates” for roaming, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45064268"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the charges aren’t specifically prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wp67b3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fees cover 47 European destinations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="16oFbv"&gt;The 47 European destinations include EU member states, plus other locations like the Canary Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, and Vatican City. Customers will not be charged an extra fee to use their phones in the Republic of Ireland, EE says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3h00Zj"&gt;EE’s decision makes it the first UK carrier to introduce roaming charges post-Brexit. It’s a marked shift from what it told &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45064268"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; in January&lt;/a&gt;, when it said that its customers “enjoy inclusive roaming in Europe and beyond” and that it didn’t “have any plans to change this based on the Brexit outcome.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Eqfl0"&gt;Competitors Three and O2 have also made changes to how much data their customers can use while in Europe, but have stopped short of introducing blanket charges for all usage. &lt;a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2021/06/clarifying-o2-uks-tougher-excess-data-charges-for-eu-roaming.html"&gt;O2 is adding a fair use cap&lt;/a&gt; of 25GB a month for users in the EU, while Three is reducing its existing cap from 20GB to 12GB, &lt;em&gt;BBC News &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5t4lQ"&gt;In a statement, an EE spokesperson said the charges “will support investment into our UK based customer service and leading UK network.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL’s wearable display glasses will go on sale in July starting in Australia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3b46YwLlJplTwcmzi0FDXB8izM=/0x364:2456x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498420/Product_with_Model_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s wearable display plugs directly into your phone or laptop.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ucvKEu"&gt;TCL says its wearable display will go on sale in July starting in Australia for $899 AUD (about $680 US), with more markets to follow. The company has been teasing the concept for a couple of years now and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22221389/tcl-wearable-display-glasses-moveaudio-s600-pet-tracker-ces"&gt;showed it off earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; at virtual CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7SGtt"&gt;TCL calls it NxtWear G and emphasizes that it’s not a VR or AR device in its current configuration. Instead, it acts as an external display for your mobile device or laptop, with two 1080p Micro OLED panels that give the effect of looking at a 140-inch screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sTusS"&gt;The wearable display works with phones, tablets, and laptops that offer USB-C DisplayPort functionality, including recent MacBooks, iPad Pros, and Samsung S21 series phones. The glasses plug directly into your device, displaying content on a 16:9 screen in front of your eyes. The whole thing, cable included, weighs 130g (4.6oz), and stereo speakers are built into the frames, though TCL recommends using wireless earbuds or a headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b2OGnU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10619182"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXcHwq"&gt;Among other global announcements timed for Mobile World Congress, TCL is announcing a new screen-sharing function for its smartphones called Multi-Screen Collaboration. At launch, it will work only with the TCL 20 Pro 5G and will allow owners of the phone to wirelessly share files, photos, clipboard content, and messages with a compatible Windows 10 laptop or PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbHahI"&gt;Photos and videos can also be shared from the phone to a TCL TV. In this mode, the phone acts as a trackpad so you can move a cursor around the TV screen to select images or clips to play. TCL says the feature will come to the 20 Pro 5G via a software update in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oszCEx7wm2XnD9KxDsmDsmS3BQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675178/TCL_movetime.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Movetime Family Watch 2 is designed for school-aged kids who aren’t quite ready for a smartphone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z8sFnG"&gt;TCL is also previewing another new wearable — one for the kids. Movetime Family Watch 2 is a kid-oriented version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419659/tcl-10-tab-max-mid-move-audio-s200-family-watch-announced"&gt;4G-enabled smartwatch designed for seniors&lt;/a&gt;. It features a 1.54-inch screen along with voice and video calling. There’s real-time location tracking and a geofencing feature, an IP65 rated housing, and up to seven days of standby time on its battery. It will be sold in Europe starting mid-August for €149.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Jio collaborate on ‘ultra-affordable’ JioPhone Next </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5FA_zA0gVCFfN2dhM5-qxRqubM=/1x0:835x556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497788/jiophone_next_google.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The JioPhone Next.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Jio Platforms&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kebl8C"&gt;Indian tech giant Jio Platforms has collaborated with Google on a new affordable smartphone called the JioPhone Next, Jio’s parent company Reliance announced today. The Next is aimed at helping the roughly 300 million users in India who are currently on 2G networks upgrade to 4G, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/google-and-jio-platforms-announce-worlds-cheapest-smartphone-jiophone-next/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It will be released in India on September 10th, before coming to other markets at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMwfM7"&gt;Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani said the JioPhone Next would be an “ultra-affordable 4G smartphone,” but didn’t reveal exact pricing or full specs for the device. However, the company did say it will include voice assistant support, translation features, and a camera with support for augmented reality. The phone is running on an optimized version of Android OS designed specifically for the device, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/new-android-smartphone-and-5g-partnership-jio/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/jiophone-next/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; has spotted&lt;/a&gt; that it appears to be using the Go-version of the Google Camera app, which indicates it shares some similarities with Google’s low-powered Android Go operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ML21zZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s running an optimized version of Android&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmOZCA"&gt;Google and Jio first announced they were working together on an affordable smartphone last year, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325343/google-reliance-jio-investment-india-4-5-billion-dollars-7-percent-facebook"&gt;Google invested $4.5 million&lt;/a&gt; in Jio Platforms. Today, Google says its work with the company is also expanding thanks to a new partnership that will see Jio Platforms parent company Reliance make use of Google’s Cloud platform, shifting its core retail business onto Google’s infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuDM5G"&gt;The JioPhone Next is part of Google’s multi-year attempt to bring Android and its services to lower-powered, more affordable devices. It announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/26/5845562/android-one-google-the-next-billion"&gt;Android One initiative in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15649380/google-budget-android-phone-program-announced-io-2017"&gt;followed this up with Android Go&lt;/a&gt; three years later in 2017. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17513036/google-kaios-investment-feature-phones-firefox-os-apps-services-strategy"&gt;invested in KaiOS&lt;/a&gt;, an operating system designed for feature phones, in order to make its services available on even more basic devices. As more and more of the developing world comes online, Google is making a big effort to ensure it’s there to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord CE 5G review: stripped down, stripped back</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Gain a headphone jack, lose some unnecessary cameras  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="EJ3x77"&gt;One year after OnePlus loudly stepped into the midrange and entry-level phone market with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;, it’s back with the OnePlus Nord CE 5G. That “CE” at the end of its name stands for “Core Edition.” OnePlus claims the new phone strips back some of its predecessor’s less necessary features to focus on offering its “core” features at a more affordable price, similar to what Samsung offers with its “FE” (fan edition) devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6Cb6R"&gt;First and foremost that means the Nord CE comes with a more affordable &lt;a href="https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/482924/1086811/12532?sharedid=VergeOnePlusNordCE5gReview062121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fuk%2Foneplus-nord-ce-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;£299&lt;/a&gt; / €329 starting price, down from £379 / €399 for last year’s phone. It keeps the 1080p 90Hz OLED display, and even adds a headphone jack, but it’s got one fewer camera on both the front and the back, and a less premium design with a plastic rear panel instead of glass. Alongside the £299 model, which gets you 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, there’s also a £369 / €399 model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. I’ve been using the 12GB version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLoKhg"&gt;Like the original Nord, the OnePlus Nord CE is only getting a release in Europe and India, while US buyers instead have the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533723/oneplus-n200-5g-price-specs-availability"&gt;Nord N200&lt;/a&gt; coming later this month. The question for all of them is whether OnePlus has stripped back one feature too many or has it found the right balance of price and performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lmEqkb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10616763"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fGclCO"&gt;Look at the Nord CE next to last year’s phone and it’s clear they’re cut from the same design cloth. Both have an edge-to-edge OLED display on the front with minimal bezels, selfie cameras in a hole-punch to the top left of their screens, and a rear camera bump that arranges their sensors into a line. Like the original Nord, there’s no official IP rating for dust and water resistance, and no wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VodIGf"&gt;Peer closer, however, and the differences become more obvious. For starters, there’s now only one selfie camera on the phone: the original Nord’s secondary ultrawide camera is gone, while the main selfie camera’s resolution has been bumped down from 32 megapixels to 16. On the back the main camera’s resolution has increased from 48 to 64 megapixels, and there’s still an 8-megapixel ultrawide, but the 5-megapixel depth and 2-megapixel macro sensors are gone, replaced with a single 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hpT64"&gt;The Nord CE is a slender device to hold. OnePlus claims this is the thinnest phone it’s made since the OnePlus 6T, and at 170g (6oz) it feels relatively light considering its 6.43-inch screen. It’s tempting to claim that heavier devices feel somehow higher quality, but I think there’s something to be said for a device that’s thin and light enough that you can forget about it when it’s sitting in your pocket. Despite its thinness, the Nord CE includes a headphone jack, which was absent on last year’s phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-OHTjlnf_R4R8ZL60fPR5LOuR6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674753/jporter_210621_4640_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus claims this is its thinnest phone since 2018’s 6T.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/btYOSU4eH0zb5wGpMUVPwhme5II=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674752/jporter_210621_4640_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It might have one fewer cameras, but otherwise the Nord CE’s design is very similar to the original Nord. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YHXo6J"&gt;The Nord CE’s battery is also technically bigger than last year’s Nord at 4,300mAh. But in my testing its battery life worked out a little worse in everyday usage. While the original Nord got upward of eight hours of screentime, the Nord CE was closer to six and a half in my experience. That was still enough to get me through a day’s use of Twitter, Slack, and WhatsApp with some battery to spare, and after a weekend of lighter usage, the phone lasted me until the middle of Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6HxI5"&gt;For charging, the OnePlus Nord CE 5G uses the Warp Charge 30T Plus fast-charging standard, so you won’t see the kinds of ultra-fast charging speeds we saw with the 65W-compatible OnePlus 8T and 9. Warp Charge 30T Plus is still fast enough to charge the Nord CE from 0 to 99 percent in an hour. In my testing it hit 32 percent after 15 minutes, 64 percent after 30, and 88 after 45. That should be fast enough for all but the most demanding of users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UntEOG"&gt;Similar to battery life, which came out slightly worse despite ostensibly having better hardware, the overall performance of the Nord CE was a little more sluggish than last year’s phone. The CE is powered by a Snapdragon 750G processor. As you might guess from its name, the new processor technically sits further down Qualcomm’s range than the 765G in last year’s phone. But because it’s a more modern chip, OnePlus claims it’s actually faster, with 20 percent better CPU performance and 10 percent better GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmERc4Aay8stUGcMFS3CeJ1YFZg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674755/jporter_210621_4640_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biometric security is handled with an in-display fingerprint sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mYnHAYx-Mcd_O5MfvwQynpBLii4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674754/jporter_210621_4640_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord CE’s camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xlNYX8"&gt;The switch has addressed one of my quibbles with the original Nord, which was that its display would hitch slightly when quickly scrolling through an app like Twitter, impacting the otherwise silky smoothness of its high refresh rate display. But the Nord CE’s performance just didn’t feel as snappy overall. Hopping between apps would occasionally cause the interface to hitch slightly or stutter as the system keyboard loaded in. That’s not an unusual tradeoff at this price (we observed similar performance with last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;, for example), but it’s worth mentioning in light of OnePlus’ claims about performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Izfsu"&gt;For the most part I think OnePlus has made some smart decisions with how to approach cameras on the Nord CE, even though, unfortunately, OnePlus’ much advertised partnership with Hasselblad with the recent OnePlus 9 hasn’t brought any benefits here. Three rear cameras is a more reasonable amount of cameras compared to the overkill of four on the original Nord. OnePlus has still allowed itself one useless rear camera on the Nord CE — a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor — but it’s easy to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WlsE3"&gt;Personally, I would have loved to see the ultrawide selfie camera return from the first Nord. It might not have been the most useful feature on an everyday basis, but it’s always great to have around when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EzBtfw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10616455"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FKLu4G"&gt;Otherwise, I generally liked the photos I got out of the Nord CE. Daytime shots are bright and vibrant, even if the phone tends to lose some detail in shadows. In particular, colors are handled accurately when it comes to landscapes, with my only complaint being a slightly over-processed look I got when photographing trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDXMdX"&gt;But it’s in the edge cases where the Nord CE’s cameras stumble. Trying to take close-up shots of flowers left the phone struggling to make things look crisp and sharp, and faces had an unnatural smoothness to them. It can also struggle with detail in low light, like in the shot above of an apartment block where many of the individual railings aren’t discernible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ip1c0lYu2ROrdrRmmiLPCb8r0nQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674751/jporter_210621_4640_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, it has a headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eaKYVx8ertnorwQrSk3xZ4tjZps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674750/jporter_210621_4640_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available colors include blue (pictured), black, and silver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kDGQwh"&gt;On paper, there shouldn’t be any competition between the OnePlus Nord CE 5G and the original OnePlus Nord. It’s the less expensive phone that still offers a high-refresh rate OLED display, 5G, plus improvements like a headphone jack, a higher resolution main camera, a bigger battery, and a faster processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1OAZD"&gt;But in practice the Nord CE just doesn’t feel as polished as the original Nord did. Its battery might be bigger, but you don’t get any more usage out of it, and its processor is technically faster but still leaves the phone hitching in heavy usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AB7stW"&gt;Those might be reasonable compromises considering the price difference, but as of this writing the original OnePlus Nord is available at a discounted £299 (about $418) price point &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OnePlus-SIM-Free-Smartphone-Camera-Warranty/dp/B08BPGX4B2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Amazon UK&lt;/a&gt;. At that price, the original Nord feels like the better option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="5X1eHz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10620114"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JESJIAZbpsRlslH85lLB92oWP7Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69496210/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fi4TH7"&gt;One of tech’s biggest problems in the past few months has been due to one of its smallest components: chips. Months into the shortage, the effects have spread far beyond the difficulty of buying an Xbox Series X or PS5. Car companies are being hit the worst, and even &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9a497f21-e3e4-4c74-8737-07cd13209475"&gt;home appliances&lt;/a&gt; might start to see issues with supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oliYeU"&gt;Earlier this year, companies expected to have supply chains sorted and products more consistently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;back on shelves by summer&lt;/a&gt; — but June is nearly over and there’s seemingly no end in sight. And with the upcoming slate of big tech releases and the holiday shopping season coming up, expect things to get worse before they get better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8jotJ"&gt;“We had thought probably six or seven months ago, like everybody else, that it would be relatively short-term.” Jahmy Hindman, chief technology officer at John Deere, commented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors"&gt;on The Verge’s &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “But I think we’re into this for the next 12 to 18 months.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bmSk8R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chips could be in short supply for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSWfIj"&gt;It’s not just tractors and trucks, though. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger voiced similar sentiment, commenting in a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-earnings-first-quarter-2021-11619043954"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; back in April that it could be two years before production is able to ramp up. “This will take a while until people can put more capacity in the ground.” And AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/chip-shortage-causes-amd-to-pivot-away-from-lower-end-pc-processors"&gt;noted at a May investor event&lt;/a&gt; that the company was being forced to prioritize its higher end chips over lower-powered parts due to shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpT1Lt"&gt;There’s two different forces at work here. For some products, there’s too much demand, which impacts the higher-end chips like the GPUs in a PlayStation 5 or an RTX 3080 graphics card. While chip shortages have undoubtedly played a part, there’s also simply more people who want to buy these products than there are enough to go around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4Jm2S"&gt;Take the PS5, for instance, which is the &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-17-ps5-the-fastest-selling-console-in-us-history"&gt;fastest selling console in US history&lt;/a&gt; despite the continued difficulty in purchasing one months after its launch. “Even if we secure a lot more devices and produce many more units of the PlayStation 5 next year, our supply wouldn’t be able to catch up with demand,” Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki said in a private analyst briefing, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/sony-warns-tight-playstation-5-supply-to-extend-into-next-year"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JoP3av"&gt;Or take GPUs, which have &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3138130/bitcoin-crackdown-sends-graphics-cards-prices-plummeting-china-after"&gt;finally started to drop in price&lt;/a&gt; over the past few weeks — not because Nvidia has magically figured out how to churn out more parts, but because demand is finally slowing down following plummeting Bitcoin prices and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aSuly"&gt;It’s in chipmakers’ interests to keep trying to churn out those parts: newer chips are more lucrative. If you’re TSMC or Samsung, it’s in your best interest to focus on making (and expanding) those production efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZ0U0H"&gt;On the flip side, though, are supply issues, particularly for older chip designs. Unlike a new iPhone or Xbox, a Ford truck or a John Deere tractor doesn’t need bleeding-edge chips using TSMC or Samsung’s 5nm process. They use older chips, which are less powerful (and less pricey) than ones using brand new technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LDuK9M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Older chips — like the ones used in cars — are being hit particularly hard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qUeMSE"&gt;The impact here is already being felt. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/chip-shortage-forces-carmakers-to-strip-out-high-tech-features?srnd=premium-europe&amp;amp;amp;sref=ctSjKj2N"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; from last month notes that carmakers are starting to skip out on offering premium features like navigation systems or extra screens in order to stretch their supply of chips further. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/18/22290362/nvidia-will-not-reduce-3060-ti-3070-3080-3090-eth-mining"&gt;Nvidia repurposed old GPUs&lt;/a&gt; into special cryptocurrency mining boards to free up more supply of newer ones for gamers. Even Apple noted that it was running into trouble getting ahold of those older chips, due to the extra competition. “Most of our issue is on licensing those legacy nodes, there are many different people not only in the same industry, but across other industries that are using legacy nodes,” Cook said in Apple’s Q2 earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLy76S"&gt;Revathi Advaithi, CEO of Flex — the world’s third largest electronics manufacturing company — noted a similar issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451309/flex-revathi-advaithi-interview-decoder-manufacturing-covid-19"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “Automotive semiconductors have been pretty outdated,” she explains, noting that automakers either have to invest in upgrading to newer technologies more on par with consumer devices, or foundries need to build out more capacity for those specific legacy chips — parts which aren’t really useful for phones or laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWVuHy"&gt;Exacerbating the issue is that on a broader scale, the semiconductor industry has become increasingly consolidated. Despite the increasing importance of computer chips in virtually every hardware product across multiple industries, the number of companies that make those chips — especially specialized chips at the high end of the market — have grown increasingly fewer in number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsR2Az"&gt;TSMC alone accounts for 92 percent of the supply of cutting-edge chips, with Samsung providing the rest, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-relies-on-one-chip-maker-in-taiwan-leaving-everyone-vulnerable-11624075400?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;according to a&lt;em&gt; Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. The company also reportedly makes about 60 percent of the chips for car manufacturers around the world. Which means that when those companies run out of capacity, there’s not a lot of other places to go to get those processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yyl6s4"&gt;That’s also why chip shortages likely won’t hit some of the biggest devices, like Apple’s next iPhone or whatever Samsung’s fall flagship ends up being, at least not as hard as they hit Ford trucks or GPUs. &lt;a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210621PD212.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digitimes&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that TSMC is already &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/22/tsmc-to-prioritize-apple-and-automaker-silicon-orders-as-global-semiconductor-shortage-continues/"&gt;prioritizing Apple’s orders&lt;/a&gt; (along with those of car manufacturers) heading into the fall. Because of the size and scale of Apple’s orders — think of how many iPhones it sells every year, all using cutting-edge chips from TSMC — it has the pull to stay at the front of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04dBvl"&gt;The bad news is that the crunch will probably get worse before it gets better. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung are all heavily investing in expanding and building new fabs. The Biden administration is also trying to help, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22457293/semiconductor-chip-shortage-funding-frontier-china-competition-act"&gt;pushing to pump billions into US semiconductor manufacturing&lt;/a&gt;. But as Intel’s CEO noted, it’ll take months, if not a few years, for those investments to mature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JkcgD"&gt;And with the holiday season fast approaching and a new wave of products from across market segments all fighting for chips, there’s almost certainly bound to be more product delays, cut corners, price jumps, and part shortages to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpfiyO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCUXRt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We regret to inform you that T-Mobile is selling a 5G-branded gin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCOhGBVo2e8RQPnT2cd8PGEkZNk=/0x160:3833x2715/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69494965/5gin_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s 5G-branded gin and ginger beer go on sale tomorrow.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FCFBBq"&gt;Whatever the reason, 5G-themed gin is now something that exists in the world, courtesy of T-Mobile. Ostensibly, “Ultra Capacity 5Gin” exists to celebrate a T-Mobile milestone: covering 300 million people with its low-band extended range 5G network and 150 million covered by its better midrange ultra capacity 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJtDl0"&gt;But maybe it just came down to the company seeing Ryan Reynolds having a good time, selling gin*, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/25/20982199/ryan-reynolds-mint-mnvo-t-mobile-ownership-deadpool-detective-pikachu"&gt;enjoying ownership of a wireless company&lt;/a&gt; and it thinking, “Let’s get in on that.” Or perhaps as the Mariners were &lt;a href="https://www.lookoutlanding.com/2021/5/18/22443250/tigers-make-justin-dunn-look-good-mariners-make-spencer-turnbull-historic"&gt;on the receiving end of yet another no-hitter&lt;/a&gt;, some marketing execs out for a night at ol’ T-Mobile Park drowned their sorrows in one too many $20 G&amp;amp;Ts and got to thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Yo9VQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With notes of pine, citrus, and unfulfilled Sprint acquisition promises&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Giq2mj"&gt;The corporate-branded gin nobody asked for is &lt;a href="https://heritagedistilling.com/"&gt;produced by Heritage Distilling&lt;/a&gt;, the Northwest’s preferred purveyor of flavored vodkas and Seahawks-themed whiskey. There’s a non-alcoholic option, too: Extended Range 5Ginger Beer, made by Jones Soda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPyy9h"&gt;If this sounds appealing and your home bar would benefit from a gin with “approachable piney notes” and a label with loud magenta branding, then you can &lt;a href="https://t-mobile5gin.com/"&gt;order a bottle for $30 starting tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;. The ginger beer also goes on sale tomorrow at $10 for a six-pack. Just do us a favor if you order some: maybe pour one out for that fourth wireless carrier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;T-Mobile was supposed to help set up&lt;/a&gt; after the Sprint merger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfunIO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Technically, Ryan Reynolds &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.diageo.com/en/news-and-media/features/diageo-to-acquire-aviation-gin-and-davos-brands/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;sold his gin company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for $610 million last August. Spiritually, he’s still kicking around as part-owner, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA continues to spend big on mobile games with $1.4 billion Playdemic acquisition </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Irn2xXyAD4JZUlFd1SuiM4zWFPI=/0x0:1520x1013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69494935/970613582.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MJtKBV"&gt;EA is adding to its roster of mobile game developers &lt;a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Electronic-Arts-Acquires-Playdemic-Makers-of-the-Highly-Successful-Golf-Clash-Mobile-Game-From-Warner-Bros.-Games-and-ATT/default.aspx"&gt;by purchasing Playdemic&lt;/a&gt;, known for &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt;, from WarnerMedia for $1.4 billion. The company says it plans on using Playdemic’s experience to help make future mobile games and that it’s interested in using &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt;’s mechanics with other franchises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJ25s3"&gt;It’s possible that EA could be purchasing Playdemic not only to gain ownership of a successful mobile game (&lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt; has over 10 million installs &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdemic.golf.android&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;on the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;), but because there’s opportunity for EA to incorporate some of its other series — &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22440408/ea-sports-pga-tour-release-date-course-list-majors"&gt;it makes the PGA golf games&lt;/a&gt; after all, which could tie in well with a mobile golf game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGbdXX"&gt;EA seems to be focusing on mobile gaming recently — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273187/ea-glu-mobile-acquisition-kim-kardashian-hollywood"&gt;also purchased mobile developer Glu&lt;/a&gt; in February for $2.1 billion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Tz28y"&gt;WarnerMedia, Playdemic’s former owner, is currently going through a transition, as it’s being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444031/warnermedia-discovery-merger-hbo-max-streaming-giant"&gt;spun out from under AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; to join with Discovery. &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/electronic_arts.html"&gt;The company says&lt;/a&gt; that it’s divesting from Playdemic as “part of [its] overall strategy to build games based on Warner Bros. storied franchises.” Indeed, if you go to &lt;a href="https://www.warnerbrosgames.com/games"&gt;Warner Bros. Games’ website&lt;/a&gt;, it’s dominated by franchises like Lego, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat (with &lt;em&gt;Scribblenauts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt; being the only real exceptions). It also has upcoming games like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340247/gotham-knights-delay-release-date-2022"&gt;DC universe-based &lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. WarnerMedia says the rest of its games will become part of the combined Warner-Discovery company after the deal is settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nHEWk"&gt;Mobile gaming has become a big focus for companies as the market has exploded. EA competitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9662214/actvision-blizzard-buys-candy-crush-king-5-9-billion"&gt;Activision purchased &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;-maker King&lt;/a&gt; for $5.9 billion in 2015, and its &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/static-files/af35383a-0db9-44de-b0b2-180eac785930"&gt;recent earnings&lt;/a&gt; show that the division is now bringing in more money than Blizzard. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22458279/valorant-mobile-spinoff-riot-games"&gt;Many popular PC and console games&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and EA’s own &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; have also gotten mobile ports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Entire London Underground to receive mobile coverage by end of 2024</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oi7tmLPQ_VhIi2tPFTYTTD-p4AA=/0x0:3508x2339/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69485133/32177.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TfL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STMn8o"&gt;By the end of 2024, passengers on the London Underground will have mobile reception across the entire network of stations and tunnels, London’s mayor Sadiq Khan &lt;a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2021/june/mayor-fulfils-commitment-and-confirms-high-speed-mobile-coverage-across-tube-network"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Popular stations, including Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Bank, Euston, and Camden Town will be hooked up by the end of 2022, with coverage expanding in phases over the ensuing months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCWmIi"&gt;The announcement comes just over a year after 4G coverage was introduced on the eastern half of the Jubilee line, between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700451/london-underground-4g-tunnels-cellular-reception-mobile-phones"&gt;Westminster and Canning Town, in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Transport for London (TfL), the city’s transport authority, says the upcoming infrastructure will support 5G networks as well as 4G, but that it will be up to mobile operators themselves to offer support for the next-generation mobile network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f3HhcE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Full internet access will be available across the tube”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mKJkb8"&gt;“I promised Londoners that if they re-elected me for a second term as mayor I would deliver 4G throughout the tube network,” London’s mayor Sadiq Khan said in a statement. “It’s already up and running on the eastern half of the Jubilee line and I’m delighted to announce today that I am fulfilling that commitment and full internet access will be available across the tube, with key central London stations such as Oxford Circus and Euston set to benefit before the end of next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhHeKw"&gt;TfL is working with BAI Communications to offer coverage across the network. The work will involve laying over 2,000km (1242 miles) of cabling within tunnels and stations. As well as offering mobile coverage to tube passengers, the project should also have benefits for mobile coverage in the city more generally. The fibre cabling installed in the London Underground’s tunnels will also connect to buildings and other infrastructure like street lighting and bus stops, allowing small mobile transmitters to be installed and increase coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYSYnP"&gt;The announcement comes as ridership on the London Underground has plummeted as a result of the pandemic, with huge financial implications for the transport authority. In June, the UK government &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-57315385"&gt;agreed to give TfL a third bailout&lt;/a&gt; to keep services running, bringing the total to over £4 billion (around $5.6 billion). TfL says providing mobile reception across the network will bring in more revenue over the 20-year contract term with BAI. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked memo confirms OnePlus will become an Oppo sub-brand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eazb8F1EOXEhg_jl4VVlp5HArkE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69480030/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0073_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xzw8gJ"&gt;Last week OnePlus CEO Pete Lau said in a forum post that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;the company will “further integrate” with Oppo&lt;/a&gt;, but didn’t elaborate on how that’d work in practise. Now, leaker Evan Blass has obtained a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1405914905363034118"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; that serves as a talking points memo for use by OnePlus PR, and it explains the integration in plainer terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78T6vb"&gt;“With the integration, OnePlus becomes a brand within Oppo, however will continue to function as an independent entity,” reads the most pertinent answer. The memo also says that Lau’s role as chief product officer at Oppo will make him responsible for the product strategies of both Oppo and OnePlus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldYpRL"&gt;This isn’t particularly surprising. Here’s what I wrote last week following Lau’s post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vNtQy6"&gt;Reading between the lines, it sounds like OnePlus will essentially be treated like a label of Oppo’s, maintaining a separate consumer-facing operation but with business activities merging in areas beyond product development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xmfGUq"&gt;The memo confirms that this is essentially what’s going to happen, removing any need to read between the lines. “With the merging of both the firms, we will have more resources at hand to create even better products,” it says. “It will also allow us to be more efficient in our operations.” OnePlus and Oppo had already merged their R&amp;amp;D departments around the turn of the year, so the further integration is more to do with streamlining day-to-day business operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLYfgZ"&gt;OnePlus customers shouldn’t necessarily expect too much to change — the shared ownership and supply chain meant that there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/15/17467348/oneplus-6-vs-oppo-r15-pro-vivo-bbk"&gt;similarities&lt;/a&gt; between Oppo and OnePlus phones for as long as OnePlus has existed. But now that OnePlus is acknowledging the relationship out loud instead of acting like it’s a scrappy startup, all eyes will be on the company’s next round of flagship phones.&lt;/p&gt;
