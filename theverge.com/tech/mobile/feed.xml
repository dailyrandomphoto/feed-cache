    <title>Imposters steal restaurants’ names in delivery app deception</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0PU7a0"&gt;Ordering delivery through an app like DoorDash or GrubHub saves the trouble of cooking and lets you be a little picky — you can order from your favorite restaurant. But imagine receiving your food, sitting down to eat, and it tasting... &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. And then, following your gut, you learn that you’ve been duped by a fake, an imposter restaurant that stole its name. For many people ordering from two Japanese restaurants in San Francisco, that exact thing may have happened, &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/On-Doordash-these-S-F-sushi-spots-look-like-16078920.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irTysa"&gt;One restaurant, now styled as an izakaya called Chome, originally opened for delivery and takeout in the former location of Blowfish Sushi. Except it didn’t bother to change the name, awning, or logo at the start. Chome, operating as if it were Blowfish Sushi, served sushi to people ordering through apps like GrubHub, Postmates, DoorDash, and Uber Eats using the identity of a restaurant that closed in December 2020. Before it closed, Blowfish Sushi had been serving its neighborhood for two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GE5mv"&gt;Blowfish’s former owner, Jason Teplitsky, was not exactly thrilled. “How does someone decide to do something like this? Did they think we all got COVID and died?” Teplitsky tells the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-MTes26QnTrdE7PnbcyWWMjTak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430912/Screen_Shot_2021_04_08_at_3.28.42_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Wagyumafia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, the real Wagyumafia is famous for its use of wagyu beef &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WyYK82"&gt;Another fake restaurant, SF Wagyumafia, shares the name of &lt;a href="https://www.wagyumafia.com/"&gt;a famous sandwich shop&lt;/a&gt; known for its $180 wagyu sandwich and locations in Tokyo and Hong Kong. This San Francisco restaurant has no connection with the actual chain, according to the real Wagyumafia, but it was advertising the $180 sandwich. The fake was convincing enough to initially fool one food writer, the&lt;em&gt; Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; writes. When you’re ordering through an app without any real way to gauge what you’re getting into, what can you do but take a restaurant at its word?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dPCu7"&gt;At first glance, both these restaurants might seems like &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/21540765/ghost-kitchens-virtual-restaurants-covid-19-industry-impact"&gt;ghost kitchen schemes&lt;/a&gt; gone awry. They’re seemingly focused on delivery, readily accessible through the most popular apps, and of an unknown origin. But blatantly copying other well-known restaurants to the point that people mistake one for the other, or think a classic has suddenly reopened, seems more like straightforward fraud. The new “Blowfish Sushi” even registered as Blowfish with the city of San Francisco, which makes it seem like the owner knew what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvmEC3"&gt;Teplitsky and the original Wagyumafia are considering legal action, according to the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCALkR"&gt;In response to the concerns over both restaurants’ legitimacy, DoorDash and GrubHub have removed Wagyumafia and Blowfish Sushi from their listings,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/DoorDash-and-Grubhub-removed-imposter-S-F-sushi-16081842.php"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn’t able to find a listing for either restaurant on Postmates or Uber Eats, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyBNPb"&gt;DoorDash, Postmates, GrubHub, and Uber Eats either didn’t respond to our questions about how they verify restaurant listings in the first place, or weren’t able to tell us whether they have any specific protections to keep one restaurant from stealing another restaurant’s name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9Xiig"&gt;GrubHub did reply with a generic description of its practices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KsmjA0"&gt;We have no tolerance for misconduct or misuse of the Grubhub platform. We have a number of safeguards in place to prevent potentially fraudulent listings on our marketplace and we are constantly improving our processes and testing new features to prevent these situations. In the case of any listings that might be fraudulent, we immediately investigate and remove them from the marketplace if they’re in fact fraudulent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DW1LML"&gt;And DoorDash provided something similar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="31h5RR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;At DoorDash, we work to ensure that we are always offering the highest quality of service to merchants, Dashers and customers. We take these types of allegations seriously and we’ve suspended the Merchants from the platform as we investigate the matter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0JO8Gg"&gt;In GrubHub’s case, it says fraud like this isn’t widespread, but says it’s unable to explain exactly how it prevents fraudulent listing because doing so would potentially make its methods no longer useful. Typically these companies check banking and tax information to setup payments, so there are some required details that could potentially corroborate a restaurant’s identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nh67RE"&gt;Fake restaurants aren’t the only surprises potentially awaiting you in food delivery apps: some legitimate brands have also tried to entice diners by changing their name for delivery. Remember, that pizza you purchase from Pasqually’s &lt;a href="https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/chuck-e-cheese-pasquallys-pizza-wings-new-menu"&gt;actually comes from Chuck E. Cheese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WG33Q2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 8th, 11:39PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from DoorDash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtmKaR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is recalling 2.5 million hotspots that could overheat and cause burn or fire damage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kZ_LROeVAyQBrGge_IgPZQzhTlg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097923/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9uhdqQ"&gt;Verizon said Thursday it is working with the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Verizon-Recalls-2-5-Million-Ellipsis-Jetpack-Mobile-Hotspots-Imported-by-Franklin-Wireless-Due-to-Fire-and-Burn-Hazards"&gt;recall 2.5 million hotspot devices&lt;/a&gt; after an investigation found the devices’ lithium-ion batteries could overheat and pose fire and burn hazards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLDBPL"&gt;The Ellipsis Jetpack mobile hotspot models MHS900L, MHS900LS, and MHS900LPP were imported by Franklin Wireless Corp. and sold between April 2017 and March of this year, according to the CPSC. The model numbers are all for the same device but vary depending on how the customer purchased the device — through a consumer prepaid or postpaid plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5FsfJ"&gt;“The safety of our customers is our highest priority,” Verizon &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/statement-regarding-us-consumer-product-safety-commission-recall" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We are taking the situation very seriously, and we are working diligently to determine the cause of the issues with the supplier and to provide replacement devices for all of our customers, free of charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbhcha"&gt;The CPSC bulletin indicated Verizon had received 15 reports of the devices overheating; six of the reports involved fire damage to bedding or flooring. Two incidents included minor burn injuries, the CPSC said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mtJ2YuUjaPbrd8nAr3jkVr3hwrM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430592/hotspot.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Verizon-Recalls-2-5-Million-Ellipsis-Jetpack-Mobile-Hotspots-Imported-by-Franklin-Wireless-Due-to-Fire-and-Burn-Hazards" target="_blank"&gt;CPSC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recalled Ellipsis hotspot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="251h8v"&gt;A Verizon spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that about 1.3 million of the hotspot devices are currently in use by customers. The recall is focused on the entire device, not just the batteries, and customers should not try to remove the batteries themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fVmIa"&gt;Demand for hotspots &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/hotspots-wifi-students-coronavirus-1a08db65-236b-43e8-a5e0-17429a07942a.html"&gt;increased over the past year&lt;/a&gt; during the coronavirus pandemic, with schools and libraries seeking the devices for students who didn’t have internet access at home so they could complete their schoolwork remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtbQCf"&gt;Verizon has sent a software update to the affected hotspots that are powered on that should help reduce the risk of the devices overheating, as it prevents the hotspot from charging up while it’s on. The company also recommends turning off the hotspots while they’re not in use and keeping them on flat surfaces without anything covering them. It’s also not a good idea to expose the hotspot devices to extreme temperatures for long periods, Verizon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaur3T"&gt;To request a replacement hotspot or get more information, customers can go to ellipsisjetpackrecall.expertinquiry.com or call 855-205-2627.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQRx1M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eneqrw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQ9csU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfQqrO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Lenovo’s new gaming phone break spectacularly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jYbUyj2JSZaG9nRAMU6Tjzpi6QQ=/1x0:1975x1316/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097225/jerryrigeverythinglenovophoneduel2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz_vxrm8rjM" target="_blank"&gt;JerryRigEverything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kdq8qN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372613/lenovo-legion-phone-duel-2-release-date-price-specs-fans"&gt;Lenovo’s new Legion Phone Duel 2&lt;/a&gt; is a gaming phone that has two USB-C ports, a pop-up camera, and even built-in fans. There’s so much tech inside that Lenovo decided it’d be best to shove its most crucial, hard-working components into the middle of the phone, making it easier for the fans to keep it all cool during gameplay. As a result, it’s thicker in the middle, flanked by two batteries. That didn’t seem like a huge red flag at first. If anything, it seemed clever — that is, until &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Jz_vxrm8rjM"&gt;YouTuber JerryRigEverything&lt;/a&gt; got ahold of the phone (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/08/lenovos-new-gaming-phone-snaps-in-half-like-a-graham-cracker/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rj8Tmw"&gt;As part of the channel’s signature rigorous testing of durability, each device is eventually bent to see how much flex it can withstand before breaking. Most devices can hold up but usually not without some bent metal or snapped glass along the way. The Legion Phone Duel 2 didn’t take well &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; to being flexed, not even a little bit. At around the 8:40 mark in the video, shortly after the host said “I’m not even remotely concerned about it breaking,” it satisfyingly snapped at the antenna line that meets the raised middle section, compromising the phone’s ability to power on. With little force, the host also broke the other side to illustrate the lack of structural integrity in the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oLENnd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Two speakers, two fans, two batteries, two pieces”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1hXUCX"&gt;Lenovo’s device isn’t necessarily an outlier compared to other recent gaming phones the channel has tested. The Asus ROG Phone 5 (similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Ultimate model that I recently reviewed&lt;/a&gt;) also &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Dqi9QGyRWGk?t=456"&gt;broke during the test&lt;/a&gt;, despite having a more cohesive design. That said, it did appear to require more force to break than Lenovo’s new phone. I’m no engineer, but it seems like splitting the battery in two might be part of what’s to blame for the fragility, as this is how Asus’ latest phone is arranged internally, too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYwqcm"&gt;As different as the Legion Phone Duel 2 looks compared to some other gaming-centric phones, it comes at a high $950 price. And its somewhat fragile design might eventually cost you even more down the road if you need to find a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme 8 Pro review: a peek at what’s next in midrange smartphone imaging</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The 8 Pro uses a new 108-megapixel image sensor that could bring better photo capabilities to the midrange class&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OubfId"&gt;The Realme 8 Pro is a good, inexpensive Android phone that you probably shouldn’t buy right now — at least if you’re in the US. But it’s also a preview of positive things to come to the midrange class, especially in terms of camera hardware. I have seen the future of smartphone imaging around the $400 price point, and it is good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcAQ4u"&gt;If you’re not familiar, Realme is a Chinese company that started off as a sub-brand of Oppo; like OnePlus, it was founded by a former Oppo vice president. Its phones are sold in China, India, and Europe. Although, you can technically &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F1005002356767813.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22372644%2Frealme-8-pro-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a global version of the phone&lt;/a&gt; and use it in the US, but we wouldn’t recommend it. It’s not compatible with many of the 4G bands we use in the states, so coverage won’t be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rlknuc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10434729"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OpH1Ga"&gt;The 8 Pro uses a relatively new 108-megapixel Samsung sensor. It’s the same pixel count as the main camera in the Galaxy S21 Ultra, but a different, smaller chip designed for budget-friendlier phones. As in the S21 Ultra, the point of this technology isn’t to take 108-megapixel images (though you can do that if you want). It’s to combine information from groups of pixels to create a better optimized 12-megapixel final image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9rJ6T"&gt;There are other reasons to like the Realme 8 Pro. Considering its £279 (about $380) price, performance is very good, owing to a strong combination in its Snapdragon 720G processor and 6GB of RAM. Battery life is healthy and the phone supports 50W fast wired charging. Depending on how you feel about inspirational corporate branding, I guess the “DARE TO LEAP” printed on the back of the phone could be a plus (not my thing, personally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZOVxs"&gt;But the camera impressed me the most, and it’s a component that will likely make its way into many more midrange phones sold around the globe. Let’s take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Realme 8 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zYL68vwQZ04q6a7Q9V0H5pE8grQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422677/ajohnson_20210330_4501_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8 Pro offers standard wide and ultrawide cameras, plus macro and depth-sensing modules.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9Deyjj"&gt;Realme 8 Pro camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KseLY8"&gt;In case you need a reminder at any point of how many pixels the main camera offers, you can simply look at the back of the phone where you’ll find “108 MP QUAD CAMERA”  etched on the camera bump. Specifically, it’s Samsung’s 1/1.52-inch Isocell HM2 sensor coupled with an f/1.9 lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpIrz3"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no optical image stabilization here, but maybe owing to the image processing tricks this high-res sensor can pull off, I didn’t notice a significant number of blurry shots that OIS might have corrected. Other rear cameras include an 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth-sensing camera. There’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera on the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PqSNY9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In low light, the camera uses binning to combine pixels into groups of nine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2WslDc"&gt;The main camera is able to do a couple of interesting things. In bright daylight, it can use all 108 million pixels individually, using different pixels to capture your scene at multiple exposure levels at once, and combining the information into a 12-megapixel final image. In low light, the camera switches things up and uses binning to combine pixels into groups of nine, effectively turning relatively small individual pixels — 0.7μm to be precise — into much larger 2.1μm sized pixels, which helps produce less noisy images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm4ceZ"&gt;Photos in bright light look good as expected. There’s an impressive amount of detail captured, though some overzealous sharpening is evident if you zoom in to 100 percent. Colors are a bit too saturated for my liking; there’s no amount of lawn fertilizer in the world that would make my yard look as green as the 8 Pro thinks it is. It seems more prone to this oversaturation with landscapes and is thankfully less aggressive with portrait mode photos. Portrait mode photos look good, and I appreciate that the camera doesn’t crop in when switching to this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rs3ppK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10434785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="chzFwG"&gt;Dim indoor lighting and low light are where phone cameras typically struggle, but the 8 Pro turns in an impressive performance in these conditions. In moderate lighting, images are surprisingly detailed and show little noise. The camera’s night mode will bring out even more detail, though it does apply a distracting amount of sharpening and contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="smeJnG"&gt;I had, frankly, low expectations for the 8 Pro’s digital 3x zoom, but I’m pleased to report that it’s much better than I feared. In good light and even moderate indoor lighting, images show a lot of detail and I’m hard-pressed to find the unpleasant artifacts that usually appear in digitally zoomed images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nOR1WW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10434810"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3JoPTF"&gt;The camera isn’t just cropping in on a 108-megapixel image, either. Comparing them side by side at 100 percent, a photo taken with 3x digital zoom shows more detail and looks less noisy than a crop of a 108-megapixel image. The Samsung HM2’s pixel binning powers are being put to work here, too, and the result is digital zoom that is actually worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNLxwM"&gt;There’s not as much exciting news to report about the 8 Pro’s other cameras; they do just fine. The ultrawide is prone to some subtle but unpleasant color shifts: white balance can skew too warm and blue skies sometimes look a little gray. The macro camera is a low-resolution sensor that is little more than a gimmick, and the selfie camera thankfully avoids over-smoothing faces at its default setting. All fair for a phone at this price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8 Pro’s processor and RAM combination are more than sufficient for everyday tasks and scrolling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QIXP6V"&gt;Realme 8 Pro performance and screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KwndvP"&gt;Outside of cameras, the Realme 8 Pro is a thoroughly capable midrange phone. Battery life is sufficient to get through a day of moderate to heavy use and the aforementioned processor / RAM combo handles day-to-day app scrolling and tasks with ease. The 6.4-inch 1080p OLED with standard 60Hz refresh rate is fine but nothing special, and I had to fight with auto brightness insisting on making the screen too dim on a couple of occasions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RkSqzm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;this processor / RAM combo handles day-to-day app scrolling and tasks with ease&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wg2ih4"&gt;There’s the flashy branding on the rear of the device, which is either your kind of thing or not. The Realme 8 Pro doesn’t support 5G at all, which is something to consider if you’re in the UK and thinking of buying the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYsb1B"&gt;My biggest gripe, though, is with the optical in-display fingerprint sensor. I’d say at least a third of the time when I unlocked the phone it required more than one try to read my finger. A couple of times — both outside in bright daylight — it gave up and had me enter my PIN instead. If this was going to be my forever phone, I’d probably skip the fingerprint sensor and just stick with a PIN, personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YChxijF9TJL3frDe23zO-C6xCgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422679/ajohnson_20210330_4501_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Te32ls"&gt;The Realme 8 Pro is the kind of midrange phone that we don’t see very often in the US: great performance and decent all-around specs combined with an excellent camera, all for what would equate to a sub-$400 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zm37iP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the 8 Pro is (hopefully) a sign of good camera hardware coming our way soon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o4Z3xk"&gt;Phones that meet this description are surprisingly scarce stateside; in fact, its closest equivalent is probably the Pixel 4A, which we’ve recommended as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;best low-cost Android phone&lt;/a&gt; essentially since it became available last summer. The 8 Pro goes a step beyond the 4A in some respects by offering an ultrawide rear camera and fast charging. If it came down to it, though, we’d probably still favor the Pixel for its very good device support and excellent lone rear camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3ZY0XQ"&gt;If you live in the UK and you don’t care much about class-leading display specs and the lack of 5G doesn’t bother you, the 8 Pro has a camera and a processor that will keep up for many years to come. For the rest of us, the 8 Pro is (hopefully) a sign of good camera hardware coming our way soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HMD’s Nokia X20 is designed to actually last you three years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L8TIyLZPb0k1gEDAcsdC0s1pg-c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69095135/jporter_20210407_4514_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HMD’s Nokia X20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tnVjBV"&gt;HMD is announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22135978"&gt;six new midrange devices&lt;/a&gt; today led by the Nokia X20, a midrange handset priced starting at €349 / £299.99 (around $415). It will release in “select markets globally” such as the UK starting next month, but we’re still waiting on HMD to confirm exact US pricing and availability. I’ve been using the phone running near-final software over the past week, which has been enough to get some rough first impressions about the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpF5tO"&gt;To be frank, the Nokia X20 isn’t the most exciting device. But HMD’s promises about ongoing software and hardware support for the phone make it compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5dVoD"&gt;The Nokia X20 is specced like a device at this price point is expected to be. It’s powered by a modest Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 processor paired with either 6 or 8GB of RAM (my device has 6GB), 128GB of expandable storage, and a 4,470mAh battery. It’s got a 6.67-inch, 1080p 60Hz display with a small hole-punch notch and four rear cameras including an ultrawide, macro, and depth sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WO-rk1GA-8LMPrS7IfPH5DchXFs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427482/jporter_20210407_4514_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a side-mounted fingerprint sensor on the right of the device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUXX35"&gt;The company says it’ll provide three years of monthly security updates for the X20 after launch, three years of OS updates, and to ensure the hardware doesn’t give up the ghost before software support ends, it’s also extending its normal manufacturer’s warranty by an extra year. “In the majority of places,” a company spokesperson says, “that extends it to three years.” If all goes to plan, the Nokia X20 should still be under warranty when it receives its Android 14 update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdIGRz"&gt;In the past, HMD has generally been good at updating its phones over time, though &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3606708/android-11-upgrade-report-card.html?page=2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ComputerWorld&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Android 11 upgrade tracker&lt;/a&gt; reports that it’s been more sluggish lately. Recently, HMD updated its &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/hmd-global-rolls-out-android-11-nokia-8-1-nokia-2-3/"&gt;Nokia 8.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/24/android-11-is-now-rolling-out-to-the-nokia-3-2/"&gt;Nokia 3.2&lt;/a&gt;, which released in 2018 and 2019, to Android 11 as part of an upgrade roadmap that includes &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-android-11-update-roadmap-hmd-global-1162501/"&gt;over a dozen of its devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZFzgb4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It should eventually be updated to Android 14&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="amXhOz"&gt;Three years of security updates is a little less than the four years Samsung recently said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;would offer for its Galaxy devices&lt;/a&gt;, but Samsung’s warranty varies between one and two years depending on whether you’re in the &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/warranty/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/warranty/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. Apple recently updated its 2015 iPhone 6S to iOS 14 (five years after its release), but its standard limited warranty also typically only covers new phones for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Flegal%2Fwarranty%2Fstatutoryrights.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F8%2F22372444%2Fhmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;between one and two years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHU6nh"&gt;Along with aiming for three years of use, HMD has also made a couple of other decisions with the Nokia X20 in the name of being eco-friendly. First, in the EU it’s joining Apple and others by not including a power brick in the box, just a USB-C cable. What you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get in the box is a 100 percent compostable phone case. It’s a neat idea producing a case that won’t end up in a landfill, but the accessory itself is frustrating to use. The portion of the case that covers the phone’s volume rocker just isn’t flexible enough, making it hard to press the side of the button that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aPWMwnSFG9cUNm5sXY4mkVFu444=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427481/jporter_20210407_4514_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four cameras can be found on the rear of the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2jiC5QQ2yPQebKxAj8Ouwryx7sw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429447/jporter_20210407_4514_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X20’s compostable case can get in the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ocu1RH"&gt;The speed and performance of the phone was generally fine, but I saw the occasional hitch while switching quickly between apps, which made me question how this phone will perform after three years of OS updates. Otherwise, I didn’t have any problems with performance in everyday usage. The X20 supports Sub-6GHz 5G, which won’t matter much to you now but could in three years’ time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEqPvf"&gt;You can find a selection of photo samples below, but in my time with the phone I was underwhelmed by the Nokia X20’s camera performance. The phone has a total of four rear cameras: a 64-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth sensor, and a 2-megapixel macro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iNN54U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10434509"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KPiu28"&gt;Performance in daylight is broadly fine, but when things are more dimly lit you quickly start to lose detail and definition. Neither the ultrawide camera nor the macro camera have the resolution to take decent photographs, and the 2-megapixel macro camera in particular is a pointless and puzzling inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1BPaJ"&gt;HMD’s Nokia X20 can’t make any big claims about being a flagship hit, but its modest price tag and HMD’s promises about continued support could make it a safe, dependable smartphone if that’s what you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HMD revamps its midrange Nokia lineup with six phones under €350</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TfUuWYki-4j9QODKpaIA2ZsTins=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69095144/Group_shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, HMD’s Nokia G10, X20, C10, X10, G20, and C20.&lt;/em&gt; | Image; HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="03e2Sm"&gt;HMD is announcing six new midrange Nokia phones today, ranging in price from €75 (around $90) up to €349 (around $415). At the top, there’s the X-series, consisting of the X10 and X20, followed by the G-series G10 and G20, and then finally, there’s the entry-level C10 and C20 from the C-series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7T55e"&gt;HMD’s pitch for these phones is the length of time it’s offering support, with even the cheapest C-series phones due to receive two years of quarterly security updates. Meanwhile, G-series phones will receive two years of Android OS updates and three years of monthly security updates. Finally, the X-series gets three years of OS updates, three years of monthly security updates, and an extended warranty that HMD says should mean it’s covered for three years in many of its release markets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4QG5b2wdm-BpCt6Bk-ICtsEKAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429117/Nokia_X20___Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia X20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="921Yx8"&gt;At the top of the six-phone lineup is the X20, which HMD says will be priced at the equivalent of €349 (£299.99, around $415) around the world. It’s got a 6.67-inch 1080p display, with a hole-punch cutout in the top-center for its 32-megapixel selfie camera, while on the back, you’ll find a circular camera bump containing four cameras: a 64-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth camera, and a 2-megapixel macro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xI8iFq"&gt;Internally, the X20 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 and 4,470mAh battery, with either 6 or 8GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage. It runs Android 11 out of the box and includes three years of OS updates that HMD says will take it through to Android 14. Security is handled by a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and there’s also a dedicated Google Assistant button on the left. I’ve been using the Nokia X20 for the past week, and you can read my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22136485"&gt;first-hand impressions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZN_FrgzIUmyI-ULFs3gjo_Vwnn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429118/Nokia_X10_Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia X10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="25RTi5"&gt;A step down from the X20 is the Nokia X10 at €309 (£249.99, around $367). It shares a lot of the DNA of its older sibling. It’s also running on a Snapdragon 480, with a 4,470mAh battery and has a 6.67-inch 1080p display. But it’s available with slightly lower specs: a minimum of 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, and its main camera and selfie camera at  lower resolutions of 48-megapixels and 8-megapixels, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mg0pVe"&gt;Next is the G-series, which is led by the Nokia G20 at €159 (£129.99, around $189). Its screen is a little smaller at 6.5 inches and has a lower resolution of 720p. Internally, it’s using a MediaTek G35 processor with a 5,050mAh battery, upwards of 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of expandable storage. You still get four rear cameras, though: a 48-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Around front, there’s a notch containing an 8-megapixel camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UlZShG1gTCbSJiedbuM23DHBuk8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429123/Nokia_G10_Emotional.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia G10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/57_ftm-V7sKRfvQKo668yjNFGhs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429124/Nokia_G20_Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia G20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gUeNod"&gt;The G20 is joined by the Nokia G10 at €139 (£109.99, around $165). Its display and battery have the same specs as the G20, but it’s got a less powerful MediaTek G25 processor, with 3 or 4GB of RAM and 32 or 64GB of expandable storage. Around back, you only get three cameras: a 13-megapixel main camera, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. The Nokia G10 has an 8-megapixel selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKf1qp"&gt;Right at the bottom of the newly revamped lineup is the C-series, which HMD says is designed for people who would previously have bought non-smart feature phones. Both the Nokia C20 at €89 (£79, around $105) and the Nokia C10 at €75 (around $90) have 6.5-inch 720p displays, a single rear 5-megapixel camera, a 5-megapixel selfie camera, and are running Google’s lightweight Go edition of Android 11. The C20 has a Unisoc SC9863a processor, while the C10 has a Unisoc SC7331e processor. Both are available with 1 or 2GB of RAM, 16 or 32GB of expandable storage, and removable 3,000mAh batteries that charge over Micro USB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsZROFnknRgHXwkY76IZ9qseG0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429129/Nokia_C10_Emotional.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia C10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia C20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OT0jah"&gt;The naming schemes may be different than previous Nokia lines, but with its six new devices, HMD is focusing on its traditional strengths: affordable phones with lengthy support periods. We’re still waiting for HMD to confirm exact US pricing and availability for the handsets, but the G10 and C20 will be available in “select markets” starting later this month, the X20 and G20 will launch in May, and the X10 and C10 will launch in June.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s Legion Phone Duel 2 has not one but two cooling fans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eCgiDQdx5Py5IpGiidokgQvcGn4=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69094270/lenovo_legion_phone_duel_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ji6bWJ"&gt;Lenovo’s next gaming phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/6/22370308/lenovo-phone-2-pro-release-date-price-design-leaked"&gt;leaked earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, but now the company is officially sharing details about the new device, called the Legion Phone Duel 2. It’s a beast in every way — with a 6.92-inch screen, this is a gigantic phone that houses &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; batteries, &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; USB-C ports, and &lt;em&gt;two &lt;/em&gt;actual spinning fans, as well as a camera bump that makes us slightly regret we already used the “that’s no moon; it’s a space station” joke on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356660/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-camera-bump"&gt;Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv3TPm"&gt;Some of its features are carryovers from Lenovo’s original Android gaming phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333138/lenovo-legion-duel-pro-gaming-phone-pop-up-selfie-cam-side-landscape"&gt;the Legion Phone Duel&lt;/a&gt;, including the twin USB-C ports and a pop-up selfie camera designed for streamers. Like the original Duel, Lenovo also maintains the unusual choice of centering the phone’s other two cameras around back, but now that raised camera bump houses a prominent intake fan and a hidden exhaust fan, each with their own vents. Lenovo says the split design keeps the heat away from your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WgpII"&gt;Those fans, alongside a vapor chamber, help the Duel 2 funnel cool air to and from the new Snapdragon 888 processor, up to 18GB of LPDDR5 RAM, and up to 512GB of UFS3.1 storage. It runs on Lenovo’s ZUI 12.5, which the company says is based on Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJvi2bKdV6QRnRR1CLYAVt1Txs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22428366/Lenovo_Legion_Phone_Duel_2_Ultimate_Black_04.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legion Phone Duel 2’s new fan-centered design in black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UI9mkV2q_wqcROlQ7911jjpS7p8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22428540/Lenovo_Legion_Phone_Duel_2_Titanium_White_11.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera / fan bump is definitely noticeable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J7Qp13"&gt;The Duel 2 comes in either “Titanium White” or “Ultimate Black”, but really it’s the camera bump, Legion logo, and fan hole that make the Duel 2 look like nothing else on the market — except, perhaps, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; with its unusual rear screen and optional fan attachment snapped on. Lenovo doesn’t mention in its announcement whether the Duel 2’s colorful back design is lit with a customizable light, but even without the glow, it seems ready to take up space on someone’s desk alongside a RGB-lit gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VKcNn"&gt;On the front, the Duel 2 features a 2,460 x 1,080 144Hz high-refresh rate OLED display with 800 nits of brightness (1300 nits at maximum), which should be more than bright enough for outdoor play. It’s also physically larger than its predecessor at 6.92 inches, up from a 6.65-inch display. Viewing the screen in landscape, the Duel 2’s pop-up 44-megapixel selfie camera (up from 20 megapixels) can be used for live streaming or video chats, just like the original Duel, with background removal. There’s still a 64-megapixel main camera around back, as well as a 16-megapixel ultrawide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxSmWv"&gt;The Duel’s two USB-C ports — one on the long side of the phone and one on the bottom — can be used for 90W fast charging if you buy an optional adapter, and Lenovo claims using them simultaneously can fill the phone’s two separate 2,750 mAh batteries in 30 minutes. Using two cables to charge a phone at once is sort of a funny image, but those kinds of considerations go out the window when you buy a Legion Phone Duel 2. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p8mVHurFsOwb9oxEHviPPR9-wIA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22428330/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_4.17.46_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing unusual about this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qbWG9I"&gt;Lenovo says a full charge should give you “up to 8 hours” of “intermittent gameplay.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tLKXd"&gt;The Duel 2 comes with 5G connectivity, in this case with support for both sub-6GHz and mmWave spectrum, theoretically in service of faster video and game streaming, and supports dual-SIM for two connections at once. To recreate some of the experience of using a controller while you play, the Duel 2 also features four “shoulder” buttons enabled through haptic feedback and ultrasonic sensors on the sides of the phone, two capacitive touch points on the back, and two force touch points in the display. (Haptics are provided by a pair of linear motors, another place where Lenovo decided one was insufficient.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzmjfS"&gt;There are even more specs to pour over, so if you’d like the full picture we’d recommend digging into Lenovo’s spec sheet:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_4abnxdixEJrrhbZwU-PSaSPJhg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22428495/image.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oefLLR"&gt;As a whole package, the Duel 2 shares more than a few similarities with its competitors. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;The Asus ROG 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; also has multiple USB-C ports, a unique method for simulating extra button inputs, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor, and an optional clip-on cooling fan. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346594/black-shark-4-pro-gaming-phone-shoulder-buttons-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Xiaomi Black Shark 4 Pro&lt;/a&gt; has even fancier magnetically lifting physical buttons and an optional fan accessory as well. And some gaming phones have had built-in fans in the past: look no further than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18522625/nubia-red-magic-3-gaming-phone-release-date-cooling-price-specs-features"&gt;the Nubia Red Magic 3&lt;/a&gt; for a device with extra cooling from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34wGao"&gt;As with many gaming phones, the important question may be availability. Currently, Lenovo plans to release the Lenovo Legion Phone Duel 2 in China this month, and it should come to Europe later in May. The European model will retail for €999 (around $1,186) with 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and a bundled charging dock, or €799 (around $948) as a standalone phone with 12GB and 256GB respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oh4ifp"&gt;Lenovo hasn’t yet announced if the Duel 2 will come to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpThIE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Km6ebQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG promises three years of Android updates despite exiting phone business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xg_9SXZAeVD1MDVg6yYwvs584nY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69093401/cwelch_200218_3910_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wWVwYo"&gt;LG has &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/04/lg-announces-three-year-pledge-for-os-updates/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a pledge to issue future Android OS updates to many of its smartphones despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;confirming&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that it’ll be leaving the phone business altogether. The Velvet, Wing, and G- and V- series phones from 2019 or later should be getting three Android updates from their year of release, and “certain 2020 models such as LG Stylo and K series” will get two updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="smp96y"&gt;For example, the Velvet came out last year with Android 10, and its Android 11 rollout is currently in progress. That means that it should also be getting Android 12 and 13 at some point, assuming Google continues its yearly cadence. LG variously describes this announcement as a “three-year pledge” and a “three-OS-update guarantee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="V57Clk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG had few smartphone hits, but it’ll still be missed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22367903/lg-smartphone-retrospective-hits-misses"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ivrwNz"&gt;The announcement is a little surprising because LG phones generally wouldn’t have been expected to get that many updates even while LG was actually in the phone business. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/12/17228306/lg-android-software-upgrade-center-research-development"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a dedicated “Software Upgrade Center” in 2018, but little to nothing changed about its Android update situation. Most of its latest premium phones aren’t scheduled to receive Android 11 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327144/lg-android-11-software-update-wing-phones-mobile-q4-2021"&gt;until the end of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7CexS"&gt;Earlier this week, LG’s Korean website &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368129/lg-phones-android-12-update-security"&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; that some selected models would also get an Android 12 update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Text messages sent to Google Fi users with Hangouts went missing last week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jRW9YUGdVb_9LAGEBKxFyGe8gqg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69092218/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pwlPyW"&gt;A Google Fi user in Hawaii received a couple text messages Monday night wishing him a happy Easter. The problem is, those messages had been sent on Easter Sunday, but only made it through more than a day later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSQ6XV"&gt;Google is now informing Fi users who receive text messages through Hangouts that messages sent to them may have gone missing between March 31st and April 5th. The company said there was a service “interruption” that impacted “a small number of people.” Google says it has now resolved the issue and is sending through the delayed messages. Missing messages should appear in Hangouts by the end of today, April 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hdcy2S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has now disabled texting from Hangouts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="20M2IH"&gt;Fi users have for years been able to send and receive calls and messages through Hangouts, but Google announced plans years ago to strip those features out as it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18193303/google-hangouts-end-transition-october-gsuite-chat-meet"&gt;transitioned Hangouts&lt;/a&gt; into yet another Google communications app. The features appear to have been disabled within the last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrVcU1"&gt;But the interruption occurred before the service was fully shut down, and so Google is still working to patch the delayed messages through to Hangouts. A Google spokesperson confirmed the service interruption to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and said affected users are being contacted. SMS messages will be delivered to Messages by Google or another default messaging app &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/fi/answer/9984024?hl=en#zippy=%2Cstep-transfer-or-sync-your-text-messages%2Cif-you-used-hangouts-for-your-text-messages"&gt;going forward&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcLjzZ"&gt;Delayed messages can cause real problems for senders and receivers. In November 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20955771/delayed-text-messages-valentines-day-syniverse-total-number-growth-carriers"&gt;more than 168,000 messages&lt;/a&gt; were delivered that had originally been sent on Valentine’s Day 2019, nine months earlier. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953422/text-messages-delayed-received-overnight-valentines-day-delay"&gt;People received confusing, context-free messages&lt;/a&gt; — in some cases, messages came through from people who had died in the months between. The issue was caused by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974692/valentines-day-text-message-delay-explanation-sms-syniverse-carriers"&gt;a server failure at Syniverse&lt;/a&gt;, a firm that routes text messages between carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEpXKN"&gt;Google has been in the process of shutting down Hangouts for years, so it’s possible there weren’t many users left using the service in conjunction with Fi. Even the Fi user in Hawaii — who, full disclosure, is a friend of mine — said they knew they should have switched a while ago and decided not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QRDP0"&gt;“I intentionally put myself in this spot,” Jason Bennett, who received the delayed Easter messages, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;I wanted to see what happened when it went offline.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Lil Nas X’s ‘Twerk Hero’ is a real game where you shake a virtual butt to Montero</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Q8wSKzrjUr0jT_wQ09vL-Aa09E=/0x2:1445x965/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69092064/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_3.13.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5yBtLm"&gt;Rapper Lil Nas X has just released a free rhythm game that has you twerking to his new song “Montero (Call Me By Your Name).” Yes, the main mechanic is twerking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWeuza"&gt;It’s a free browser game, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.monterocallmebyyour.name"&gt;play it right now at this link&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to get an idea of how the game works, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1379913998695419905"&gt;check out this video he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. Or just use your imagination. It’s exactly what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MoSnst"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;PLAY HERE: &lt;a href="https://t.co/pUlUJYhY3O"&gt;https://t.co/pUlUJYhY3O&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/I660hJr9du"&gt;pic.twitter.com/I660hJr9du&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nope   (@LilNasX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1379914189125218305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj5Fv4"&gt;I tried it briefly before writing this post, and I have to admit that I had a hard time lining up my twerks with the on-screen arrows. (What a sentence. Also hi Dad, who gets email notifications whenever I publish a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; story.) But the game says I somehow got 43 of the 50 arrows, and a rating of two and a half stars out of three. I’ll take it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QqZSD"&gt;The new game is Lil Nas X’s latest internet-savvy stunt to help promote the new song. He also collaborated with internet collective MSCHF to release the “Satan Shoes,” which were custom Nikes that supposedly have a drop of blood in them. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357225/nike-sues-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-mschf"&gt;Nike sued MSCHF&lt;/a&gt; over the shoes, seeking a temporary restraining order, but MSCHF said it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361961/mschf-nike-unauthorized-satan-shoe-lawsuit-response-restraining-order"&gt;no intention&lt;/a&gt; of shipping the 666th pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="aLA8Ha"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"MSCHF will not ship its 666th pair of Satan Shoes after Nike lawsuit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361961/mschf-nike-unauthorized-satan-shoe-lawsuit-response-restraining-order"},{"title":"Nike sues over Lil Nas X’s ‘unauthorized Satan Shoes’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357225/nike-sues-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-mschf"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
