    <title>Motorola is updating its first-gen foldable Razr — with Android 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vnq9LHmbpjTnN2EJ0oi1YzPVkog=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723914/awhite_200210_3893_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PYMq5g"&gt;You could be forgiven for forgetting about Motorola’s folding phones in light of new shiny ones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22613790/samsung-galaxy-fold-flip-3-event-watch-announcements"&gt;announced by the likes of Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, but someone at the company must care about them — &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/motorola-razr-update/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new OS update has been released for the 2019 Razr&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it from Android 10, to Android 11 (&lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/08/13/motorola-razr-android-11-update/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Droid-Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Yes, that’s correct — the OS that &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-11-update-tracker-1155652/"&gt;started hitting Pixels in September of 2020&lt;/a&gt; is the one that became available for the Razr today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsn1DE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The original Razr reboot and the Razr 5G both became available in 2020. However, the first one was announced in 2019, so I’ll refer to it as the 2019 Razr to help avoid confusion between it and the Razr 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vZq3an"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Getting the update only a few months after its much better successor isn’t too shabby&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sBk7g7"&gt;While it may seem like the update for the 2019 Razr is woefully late, consider this: according to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/27/the-moto-razr-5g-is-finally-getting-android-11-catching-up-to-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold2/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://motorola-mobility-en-in.custhelp.com/app/software-upgrade/g_id/2014"&gt;Motorola’s updates page&lt;/a&gt;, Android 11 started rolling out to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;much better 2020 Razr 5G&lt;/a&gt; sometime between April and July. For how first-gen the 2019 Razr is, getting the update only a few months after its successor isn’t too shabby (despite the fact that getting it almost a year after it started rolling out is pretty rough, on an absolute timescale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLBHVM"&gt;Motorola’s update issues aren’t limited to its foldables, however. Many of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;recent phones&lt;/a&gt; only come with the promise of two years of security updates, with some higher-end ones getting one major OS update. Given that the Razr &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21255018/motorola-razr-foldable-external-display-android-10-update-new-features"&gt;already got an upgrade to Android 10&lt;/a&gt; (in May of 2020), today’s update puts it at two feature updates, which is better than what Motorola promises for some of its non-folding phones. And it should be, given that the phones Motorola promises two years of security updates for cost between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$160&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538663/motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-review-specs-screen-price"&gt;$400&lt;/a&gt; — the 2019 Razr was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;$1,500 at launch&lt;/a&gt;. (Though that isn’t to say that a $400 phone should only get two years of updates.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqCKBv"&gt;Still, if you’re still rockin’ an original Razr reboot, it’s an update you didn’t have before. You can read our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426066/android-11-review-features-bubbles-priority-notifications-updates-pixel-oneplus"&gt;full rundown of what Android 11 adds here&lt;/a&gt;, but the summary is that it brings chat app bubbles, more granular privacy permissions, and a more feature-packed power menu. Just do yourself a favor and don’t look too much at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;the features&lt;/a&gt; that are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619546/android-12-beta-4-released-platform-stable-af"&gt;getting ready to drop with Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, because it’s hard to imagine that it’ll come to the older Razr anytime soon, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy A42 5G review: stuck in the middle</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A midrange phone with a big screen, huge battery, and all kinds of 5G connectivity&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Wk9ckH"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A42 5G is a thoroughly decent midrange phone that doesn’t really need to exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYZIbn"&gt;Taking it at face value, it’s fairly priced at $400 with a big 6.6-inch OLED screen, generous 5,000mAh battery, and a healthy support policy that will see it receiving security updates through the next few years. That’s a pretty good deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G08byP"&gt;In the context of Samsung’s Galaxy A lineup, it’s situated between the Galaxy A52 5G and the A32 5G, two very good options in their own price brackets. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;$499 A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; offers a few more high-end bells and whistles than the A42 5G, like a fast refresh screen and an IP67 waterproof rating. At $279, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;the more basic A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; includes an LCD rather than OLED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ZGoAx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10695334"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x0BQxc"&gt;But if you’re shopping for a new device with Verizon, you won’t see either the A52 5G or the A32 5G on the retailer’s shelves (digital or otherwise). Instead, you’ll only find the A42 5G, thanks to one feature it has and the others don’t: mmWave 5G support. Until recently, this was a feature reserved for premium phones, and the A42 5G is one of the least expensive devices that can connect with the network. Verizon in particular has been pushing this super-fast flavor of 5G hard over the past couple of years. Despite its efforts, mmWave is still scarce and highly range-limited, but the carrier is still heavily biasing its stock toward devices that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRDgF6"&gt;That’s why the A42 5G exists, at least in the US, but I’m not convinced that’s a good enough reason for anyone besides Verizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L9JiJoZsAjtaPj1oGPEMZAPbtnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766364/ajohnson_210804_4696_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A42 5G’s glossy, plastic back features a gradient pattern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uClYAU"&gt;Samsung A42 5G screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MvQd48"&gt;The Galaxy A42 5G offers a big 6.6-inch 720p OLED screen. That’s not a lot of resolution stretched across a fairly big panel, and it shows — if you look closely at images you’ll see some pixelation. The screen gets bright enough for indoor use, but I had a hard time seeing it outside even with brightness maxed out. The OLED panel shows nice contrast compared to an LCD (i.e., what you’ll get in a less expensive model like the A32 5G), but otherwise the display is a little underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5h1TCr"&gt;The A42 5G offers an in-display fingerprint sensor for biometric unlocking and it’s one of the better ones I’ve come across in this budget-to-midrange class — it’s responsive and only occasionally fussy. Budget phones often have sensors that are less precise and require additional scans more frequently, and that is a real pain considering how many times we unlock our devices every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z8BnPi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The screen gets bright enough for indoor use, but I had a hard time seeing it outside&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xacy1I"&gt;Battery life is excellent thanks to a large 5,000mAh cell — most days I only drained it to 70 percent by bedtime, but even a day with heavy use that included a Zoom call on cellular data only brought it down around 50 percent. A power user would definitely get a full day and a little extra from it, and with moderate use it can easily be stretched to two days on a charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcXOlT"&gt;Overall performance from the A42 5G’s Snapdragon 750 processor and 4GB of RAM (there’s a healthy 128GB of storage, too, and it’s expandable via MicroSD) is good for day-to-day tasks. The only slowness I noticed was a little bit of lag starting the camera app, and slight delays using more processing-intensive camera features like portrait mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1VuWye"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung has guaranteed two additional OS upgrades and four years of security support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfJI3i"&gt;The US version of the A42 5G ships with Android 11. Beyond that, Samsung has guaranteed two additional OS upgrades and four years of security support. In terms of device longevity, that puts it ahead of a lot of the midrange Android competition, which often only sees a couple of years of security support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCUOuO"&gt;Samsung’s current implementation of Android is a little more cluttered than we prefer, and activating it on Verizon’s network means you’ll end up with even more pre-downloaded apps on top of that. It’s a lot. There’s some sort of game featuring a cartoon bear on the phone I’ve been using for the past few weeks, and I do not care for it but I haven’t been able to summon the energy to uninstall it either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d2zXRM1cK2ypkrBKxhXMfqgCU94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766365/ajohnson_210804_4696_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A42 5G’s rear camera array is headlined by a 48-megapixel f/1.8 standard wide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XiXEPl"&gt;Samsung A42 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="t8CC3A"&gt;The A42 5G includes a 48-megapixel f/1.8 main rear camera, accompanied by an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, and 2-megapixel depth sensor, which is all par for the midrange class. There’s also a 13-megapixel selfie camera around front. A version of the phone sold in the UK and Europe included a 5-megapixel macro and a slightly higher-res 5-megapixel depth sensor, but we’re not missing out on anything important by not having those cameras on the US version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZWgmyz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10696319"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0oTt15"&gt;In good light outdoors, the Galaxy A42 5G takes vibrant, detailed photos. Like other Samsung devices before it, the A42 produces colors that lean toward oversaturated, which can be distracting if a more natural look is your thing. Portrait mode photos are convincing enough, and the camera can sometimes struggle deciding on white balance and exposure in mixed lighting situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dft8Ej"&gt;Photos in very low light show a lot of smeared detail thanks to noise reduction, but outside of the Pixel phones in this price bracket, that’s not something we’d expect a midrange device to excel at. All told, the A42 5G’s photo capabilities are on par with its class. Spending a bit more on the A52 5G will get you a stabilized main camera that will get more sharp shots in dim lighting and slightly better low-light performance in general, but in the $400 range the A42 measures up well against most of its peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dy92tpG9UhCaE0Hl3mo_tRvIlgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766363/ajohnson_210804_4696_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A42 5G’s unique selling point — mmWave 5G support — is of limited value for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yE4FDO"&gt;The Galaxy A42 5G is a fine phone for $400, and if you’re committed to buying from Verizon, it’s one of the better options at that price. But if you’re able to buy an unlocked phone or you aren’t on Verizon, then there are other options, including in Samsung’s own midrange lineup, that are well worth your consideration. Unless you live in an area with good mmWave coverage and spend a lot of your time outside where the signal can actually be reached, the A42 5G’s unique feature is of limited value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjDO3T"&gt;If you’d like to save a little money, the A32 5G is a viable alternative for $280. You’ll get the same security support longevity as the A42 5G along with similar photo capabilities, a huge battery, and 5G support that’s ready for upcoming improvements to Verizon’s and AT&amp;amp;T’s networks. Its processor is a little less robust and the LCD isn’t as nice to look at as the A42 5G’s OLED, but if these things aren’t priorities then you might as well save a little and go for the less expensive device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="cgUeJD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;don’t get too excited about mmWave&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yezL84"&gt;If you think you’ll want a little more than the A42 5G has to offer, then the $500 A52 5G is a good step-up option with a bit of a better camera, a great high refresh rate screen, and the added peace of mind of IP-rated waterproofing. If you can find a Pixel 4A 5G in stock anywhere, that would be another good alternative at $500 with a better camera, faster processor, and cleaner software. It offers a smaller 6.2-inch screen, though, and again, you’ll have a hard time finding one new at this point since its successor, the Pixel 5A, will likely be arriving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569798/google-pixel-5a-fcc-listing-leak-features-specs"&gt;in the near future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="P6mHSC"&gt;If none of the above suits you, then the A42 5G really isn’t a bad choice. Its healthy support policy, decent overall performance, and robust battery life make it one of the best options from Verizon for around $400. Just don’t get too excited about mmWave.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon vows to protect Tracfone’s low-income users in new merger promise </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZGmqIeg1HoJ4jOg442u2zdC-P4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69716127/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aafQny"&gt;On Thursday, Verizon announced a range of new public commitments to protect low-income consumers in connection with its proposed acquisition of Tracfone. The commitments are part of a deal with public-interest groups and communications workers unions, who have agreed to support the acquisition on the basis of today’s announcement.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpSM5T"&gt;For its part of the deal, Verizon pledges to continue to provide Tracfone’s Lifeline subsidy programs for at least three years after the merger closes. Verizon is also promising to offer a subsidized 5G program for low-income Tracfone users. According to the Communication Workers of America (CWA), over 1.7 million Tracfone customers depend on the Lifeline program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HD7hL"&gt;The CWA, Public Knowledge, and the Benton Institute for Broadband and Society had initially criticized Verizon’s proposed purchase of Tracfone, suggesting that the deal could harm Tracfone’s low-income customer base. But the groups announced Thursday that they would be withdrawing their opposition in response to the new concessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oYHWTd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These commitments ensure TracFone customers will continue to have access to Lifeline”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZU9RBa"&gt;“These commitments ensure TracFone customers will continue to have access to Lifeline, an essential program for millions of families,” senior CWA researcher Brian Thorn said in a statement Thursday. “Today’s success would not have been possible without the support of our allies and an FCC interested in protecting the interests of customers over corporations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NmZ4e"&gt;Last September, Verizon announced its plan to purchase Tracfone in a deal valued at more than $6 million. The acquisition would give Verizon over 20 million new subscribers and a tighter grasp on the low-income wireless and value phone market. Verizon plans to close the deal before the end of the year, although the current status of the Federal Communications Commission’s review of the merger is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVSn87"&gt;Earlier this year, several Senate Democrats called on the FCC to add similar conditions to Verizon’s proposed merger to protect low-income subscribers. On Thursday, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Ed Markey (D-MA), among others, applauded the new conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBZs6N"&gt;“These commitments should now be a floor and a starting place for the FCC’s review of the acquisition and negotiations with Verizon,” the senators wrote. “As important as the terms of these commitments are, the conditions must be made legally binding, vigilantly monitored, and vigorously enforced to ensure the company makes good on these promises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlmipB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTQf5I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor’s Magic 3 is its first post-Huawei flagship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EtkKQORn-43zg0BXgxFue7BGK40=/60x0:2940x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714885/HONOR_Magic3_Pro_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic 3 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cRDra4"&gt;Honor has announced its first flagship smartphones since being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;sold off by former parent company Huawei&lt;/a&gt;: the Magic 3 series. The lineup consists of three phones, the Magic 3, Magic 3 Pro, and Magic 3 Pro Plus. They’re coming first to mainland China, but Honor says they’re getting a global release at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgGMug"&gt;When they launch globally, the phones will come with Google’s apps and services, which Honor wasn’t previously able to include while a subsidiary of Huawei due to US sanctions. It should make the Magic 3 series much more competitive outside of China compared to Honor’s recent Huawei-era phones, which had to rely on Huawei’s own services and AppGallery to download software. This setup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;came with significant drawbacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic 3 (left) and the Honor Magic 3 Pro Plus (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NoTYks"&gt;The Magic 3 Pro and Pro Plus are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 Plus processor, while the standard Magic 3 has a Snapdragon 888 processor. Around front they have a 6.76-inch 1344p OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and an aggressive curve around the sides of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJsGfu"&gt;Rear cameras vary significantly between the three phones. On the standard Magic 3, there are three cameras: a 50-megapixel 1/1.56-inch main camera, a 13-megapixel 1/1.31-inch ultrawide, and a 64-megapixel monochrome camera. The Magic 3 Pro adds a 64-megapixel telephoto camera with a 1/2-inch sensor, 3.5x optical zoom, and OIS. Finally, the Pro Plus increases the size of the main 50-megapixel sensor to 1/1.28-inches, and the resolution of the ultrawide sensor to 64 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EqMgk"&gt;The Magic 3 Series has a battery capacity of 4,600mAh and supports wired fast-charging up to 66W. On the Pro and Pro Plus, there’s wireless charging up to 50W with support for reverse wireless charging, as well as an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance (the regular Magic 3 has an IP54 rating). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCnl29"&gt;The announcement of the Honor Magic 3 series follows the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243559/honor-v40-announced-huawei-google-sanctions-specs"&gt;V40 in January&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536512/honor-50-series-pro-release-date-news-features-google-mobile-services-apps-play-store"&gt;Honor 50 in June&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite confirming that the Honor 50 will eventually receive a global release, complete with Google’s apps and services, an exact release date is yet to be confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxYSiU"&gt;The Honor Magic 3 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage will sell for €899 (about $1,055), while the Magic 3 Pro with the same configuration of RAM and storage will cost €1,099 (about $1,290). The Honor Magic 3 Pro Plus, which comes with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, will cost €1,499 (about $1,760). The exact date of the phones’ global release is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TradUA"&gt;Like in previous years, Samsung used its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617405/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-biggest-announcements-z-flip-z-fold-3-watch-buds-note"&gt;latest Galaxy Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt; to announce a slew of new devices, including the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3. The two smartphones are already available for preorder starting at $1,799.99 and $999.99, respectively, and will launch alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; and a handful of other devices on Friday, August 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wROhpD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Samsung beefed up its folding phones: metal, tape, and a dab of goo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="3pJzAG"&gt;How to preorder the Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Hs307"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is Samsung’s latest foldable, yet it seems to take a cue directly from the Note, adopting S Pen support as well as an optional flip case designed to hold the stylus when not in use. The forthcoming device appears to be more rugged, too, with IPX8 water resistance, tougher aluminum in the hinge, and a protective film that is supposedly 80 percent stronger than that of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pmbYg4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 announced with S Pen support and water resistance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rE4vJe"&gt;Specs-wise, the foldable features Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor and comes in both 256GB and 512GB storage configurations, each of which features a brighter front display that runs at an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate. The Z Fold 3 also sports three 12-megapixel rear cameras — specifically a wide, ultrawide, and telephoto lens — along with a 10-megapixel camera on the cover screen and a 4-megapixel sensor beneath the pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aejTfu"&gt;Both the 256GB and 512GB configurations of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748811910154262197#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder at Samsung&lt;/a&gt; starting today in one of three colors (silver, green, or black). Whereas the 256GB model will set you back $1,799.99, the 512GB model comes in slightly higher at $1,899.99. If you preorder either configuration between now and August 26th, however, Samsung will issue you a $200 credit that can be used toward another purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ECfqC"&gt;Financing options are available, too, and you can save up to $800 on your Galaxy Z Fold 3 when you trade in an eligible smartphone, smartwatch, or tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEKb1B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697006"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vrv8Kx"&gt;If you decide you’d rather preorder through your carrier, T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T offer similar pricing to Samsung, regardless of the color. You can buy the 256GB model outright for $1,799.99 (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670342&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g-256gb-phantom-black.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;) or the 512GB configuration for $1,899 (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670359&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g-512gb-phantom-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;), and both carriers offer financing options starting at $50 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywZSMg"&gt;The two carriers differ when it comes to promotions, though. Both are currently offering up to $1,000 off the Galaxy Z Fold 3 if you trade in an eligible device, however, AT&amp;amp;T also requires you to sign up for an unlimited plan while T-Mobile requires customers to have at least one existing line with a Magenta Max, Magenta Plus, or T-Mobile One Plus plan. Like Samsung, AT&amp;amp;T is also offering a $200 credit toward select Samsung devices and accessories when you preorder either storage configuration by August 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V27ozw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697052"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="IKCucs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697054"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Si3AmL"&gt;Verizon customers can also save in a variety of ways or preorder the Galaxy Z Fold 3 for the full retail price ahead of launch. Both the 256GB and 512GB models &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are available&lt;/a&gt; for $1,799.99 and $1,899.99, respectively, or with financing plans starting at $59.99. You can also save up to $1,000 on either configuration when you trade in an eligible phone and opt for an unlimited plan, as well as an extra $500 if you’re a new customer switching to Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mn9Tsr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697089"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EFUkk1"&gt;How to preorder the Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="C3plMR"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is nowhere near as expensive as the Galaxy Z Fold 3, however, it still comes at a premium. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594727/samsung-z-flip-3-fold-water-resistant-ipx8-pen-case" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous leaks have indicated&lt;/a&gt;, the successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip&lt;/a&gt; showcases the same IPX8 water resistance and Snapdragon 888 processor found on the Z Fold 3 and other Samsung flagships, along with a 10-megapixel selfie camera and a pair of 12-megapixel shooters on the back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="S13DT7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 announced with much bigger, useful cover display","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22617226/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-features-price-foldable-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8upDK7"&gt;Upon its release, it will be available in seven colors — gold, purple, green, black, white, pink, and gray — and features a cover display that’s four times bigger than the cover screen on its predecessor, allowing for more notifications and making it easier to capture selfies with the main camera. The 6.7-inch interior display also now sports an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate, as opposed to the 60Hz refresh rate of the original Z Flip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcbTDl"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 will be available in two configurations at launch: a 128GB model and a 256GB variant. Preorders are available starting today at Samsung ahead of the phone’s August 27th release, and pricing for the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748816475529586235#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model&lt;/a&gt; starts at $999.99. You can also preorder the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748816552261866427#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model&lt;/a&gt; for $1,049.99, however, unlike its smaller counterpart, it’s only available in black, gray, white, or pink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIlqWO"&gt;If you preorder either device at Samsung, you’ll also receive a $200 credit toward other Samsung devices, and if you go the trade-in route, you can save up to $650.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bbaUYi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697134"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rIKeFI"&gt;Both T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T offer similar pricing for the Galaxy Z Flip 3 as Samsung. The 128GB variant is available for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g-128gb-cream.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder at AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; for $999.99, or in monthly installments of $27.78. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670298&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; offers both the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670298&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670304&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configurations&lt;/a&gt; for $999.99 and $1,049.99, respectively, with installment plans starting at $41.67. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0qMEm"&gt;For those looking to save some money on their preorder, both carriers are currently running multiple promotions on the Galaxy Z Flip 3. AT&amp;amp;T is offering a discount of up to $1,000 to those who trade in an eligible phone and sign up for an unlimited plan, as is T-Mobile, though, you’ll need to opt for a Magenta Max, Magenta Plus, or T-Mobile One Plus plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EqMwB6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697215"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6Jo25C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="im4J7U"&gt;Prices aren’t that different at Verizon, either. You can preorder the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB version&lt;/a&gt; of the Galaxy Z Flip 3 in one of four colors for $999.99, or as part of a monthly installment plan for $33.33. In terms of promotions, Verizon is offering $1,000 off the foldable when you trade in your old device and sign up for an unlimited plan; new customers can also save an additional $500 to cover the cost of switching carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tZaKn0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697219"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KZOTTi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8E8cB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPysvZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Forget the Note — Samsung’s foldables are coming for the Galaxy S as well</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsgNylYjeSgwY6EWREDuce7U710=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69712308/cwelch_210809_4701_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fIwhvQ"&gt;It’s been easy to dismiss folding phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek"&gt;as the stuff of science fiction&lt;/a&gt;, even after they became a reality two years ago. They were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355018/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-foldable-phones-normal-mainstream"&gt;too expensive&lt;/a&gt;, too large, too compromised to make sense for most. Some flips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;instantly flopped&lt;/a&gt;. But in 2021, a folding phone appears to have just killed off Samsung’s long-running Galaxy Note — and I’m starting to wonder if they’ll destroy the flagship Galaxy S as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4AI8Z"&gt;That’s because last month, Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22599306/samsung-q2-2021-earnings-component-shortage-foldables"&gt;promised to make foldables mainstream&lt;/a&gt;. And at $999, with fewer compromises than ever, Samsung’s new Z Flip 3 sounds dangerously close to a complete replacement for Samsung’s $999 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;. For the same price, they’ve both got 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED screens, the latest Snapdragon 888 processors, the same memory and storage options, the same water resistance, and roughly the same dimensions, just with a slightly lighter frame and smaller battery, and one fewer camera around back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zraer9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Has the Flip reached parity with flat flagships?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2JBVF"&gt;Except &lt;em&gt;one &lt;/em&gt;of these phones awesomely folds down to half its size, and the other one doesn’t. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;Assuming Samsung’s new durability improvements&lt;/a&gt; aren’t just talk and the plastic-covered screen doesn’t feel weird, I know which one I’d pick! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKtNe5"&gt;Would Samsung really axe its flatscreen Galaxy S in favor of foldables, though? It’s not as far-fetched as you might think — because after two years selling a ridiculous number of “flagship” phones, the Galaxy S handsets are getting hemmed in on all sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTeblN"&gt;In 2019, the company tried to sell as many as 10 different flagship phones around the world, including four different Galaxy S10s and four different Galaxy Notes with largely identical core specs. 2020 brought &lt;em&gt;11 &lt;/em&gt;different flagships, if you count the Galaxy S10 Lite and Note 10 Lite. Five flagship phones may still be too many in 2021, if three of them aren’t selling particularly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fsQ3B8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10697029"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YjXyaS"&gt;It’s not like Samsung would be killing off its bestselling handsets by ditching the Galaxy S, by the way. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;The company’s midrange A-series phones&lt;/a&gt; are actually its sales champs, after Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/3/17815746/samsung-flagship-features-midrange-phones-strategy-shift"&gt;declared it would prioritize those handsets&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. Meanwhile, sales of Samsung’s Galaxy S phones &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/report_sales_of_samsung_galaxy_s21_series_are_lower_than_s20_s10_sales-news-50385.php"&gt;have reportedly plummeted 47 percent over the past two generations&lt;/a&gt;, with the Galaxy S21 on track to be even more of a disappointment than the Galaxy S20 was the year before.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="keg1W6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fold replaces Note, Flip replaces S?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8enFPZ"&gt;Does Samsung need the Galaxy S any more than it needs the Galaxy Note? For smartphone enthusiasts who want the best of everything — now including the ability to fold out into a tablet — the Z Fold is already taking the place of the Note. Next year, with some camera upgrades, it could theoretically dethrone Samsung’s “Ultra” phones, too. That could leave room for the Flip to become Samsung’s new default flagship, with folding as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/1/5571738/samsung-our-next-big-thing-ads-drove-apples-marketing-chief-crazy"&gt;the “Next Big Thing” that Apple doesn’t offer its customers&lt;/a&gt; (at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307677/folding-iphone-rumors-screen-size-kuo"&gt;not yet&lt;/a&gt;). For everyone else, there’s Samsung’s increasingly powerful Galaxy A series, which will likely get even more aggressive  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607248/xiaomi-overtakes-samsung-europe-smartphone-sales-apple"&gt;now that Xiaomi has overtaken Samsung in Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbXk4i"&gt;If it happens, I’d expect a transition period: the flagship phone category still starts around $700, not the $1,000 that Samsung is asking for the Flip 3, so the company would probably keep around a Galaxy S22 FE at a minimum. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE is still pending&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esAWSL"&gt;And even if Samsung does decide to deemphasize flatscreen flagships, that doesn’t mean the Galaxy S name will necessarily go away. It might just become what Samsung calls its folding phones someday. Galaxy S is the brand that brought Samsung into the spotlight over the past decade, so there’s value and precedent to transfer the name to a new design: when Samsung first began experimenting with curved glass screens, it started as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/27/7077139/galaxy-note-edge-review"&gt;the Galaxy Note&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/20/9181917/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-review"&gt; Edge&lt;/a&gt;, then Edge versions of Galaxy S phones, and those curves became the norm with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus"&gt;Galaxy S8&lt;/a&gt;. If Samsung makes foldables the new normal, we might see the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ipVvD"&gt;All I know for sure: Samsung’s bloated lineup of flagships was getting pretty ridiculous — remember &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20852040/samsung-peak-flagship-blockchain-branded-galaxy-note-10-cryptocurrency-kakao-klay-klaytnphone"&gt;the Note 10 specifically for blockchain&lt;/a&gt;? — and it doesn’t need to be that way. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A national alert test buzzed US TVs, radios,  and any phones that opted-in at 2:20PM ET</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Yk4FXbgUUFLoSQtjOtQg22plKU=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711293/E8H1PYXWYAEjY84.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Test Wireless Emergency Alert message | Image: FEMA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qs7pJM"&gt;At approximately 2:20PM ET, FEMA &lt;a href="https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/frequently-asked-questions-2021-ipaws-national-test"&gt;conducted a test of both the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA)&lt;/a&gt; covering radio, TV broadcasts, and mobile devices in the US, but you might not see it on your phone. That’s because this time around, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17931750/fema-presidential-alert-test-reminder-trump-public-alert-warning-system"&gt;Presidential Alert test in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, it only reached phones with a setting to receive test messages and by default, most phones are set to opt-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMSwdj"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/weatest_opt-in_instructions.pdf"&gt;this document&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) from the FCC, on Android phones, there should be a Wireless Emergency Alerts section in your settings menu with an option for “State/Local Test alerts” that you can turn on or off. The process described for iOS is more complicated, but &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202743"&gt;Apple’s support page&lt;/a&gt; explains how you can opt-in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="t9IOZS"&gt;Open the Phone app and tap Keypad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Pw6aU"&gt;To turn it on: Enter *5005*25371# and tap the green phone icon. You’ll get an alert that says “Test alerts enabled.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc6luY"&gt;To turn it off: Enter *5005*25370# and tap the green phone icon. You’ll get an alert that says “Test alerts disabled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="yxKvUJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This year's Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) test messages will only be displayed on wireless handsets where subscribers have “opted-in” to receive them. This will allow for a nationwide test without disturbing the public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read more about opting in here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/kvGqLyBCqy"&gt;https://t.co/kvGqLyBCqy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LW3UptMxK7"&gt;https://t.co/LW3UptMxK7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— National Weather Service (@NWS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWS/status/1424758994816667650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LHMQ1J"&gt;If you missed it, or if you weren’t thirsty enough to opt-in, this is the message for mobile devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjFwlC"&gt;“THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Flip 3: all the rumors, news, and announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PtEX7rPSFxh9WkCFM1DP2vQNPls=/0x0:838x559/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710599/E4qkWBHXwAgIQ_W.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here’s everything Samsung might unpack (and unfold) on August 11th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="D7CPc0"&gt;It’s been a little over half a year since Samsung introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229537/samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s21-event-buds-pro-announcements"&gt;the Galaxy S 21&lt;/a&gt;, which means it’s time for something new. Luckily, Samsung’s Unpacked event planned for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;August 11th at 10AM ET&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s widely expected to introduce new versions of its folding phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsHGW1"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 will likely be the stars of the show, with familiar designs featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594685/samsung-z-fold-3-stylus-support-note-durability"&gt;stylus support&lt;/a&gt;, 120Hz displays, and improved durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWrpzF"&gt;Samsung and Google are also collaborating closely &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;on Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung is expected to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;new Galaxy Watch smartwatches&lt;/a&gt; to show off with its folding phones, and a look at the future of wearables for Android phones. Don’t be too surprised if there’s a fresh pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; to show off as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byqRSB"&gt;There’s not long to wait now, but if in the meantime you want to catch up on all the details of what Samsung seems to have prepared, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22608535/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-z-fold-flip-earbuds-watches"&gt;check out our roundup&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>The 5 biggest announcements from Samsung’s August Unpacked event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XImms-ITzAuGvOW-BneXfLqm2Z8=/0x0:2109x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710306/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_7.47.07_AM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aZhAvZ"&gt;Samsung has finished up its Galaxy Unpacked event, where it announced the next generation of its foldables (it called them the new mainstream of smartphones), wearables, and earbuds. Here are the biggest pieces of news from the event.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wd1CpDaEs3aX-vfgmyHAQ9R2XtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775972/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_7.37.18_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Samsung is proud of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;its improved durability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TradUA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22381247"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 has dual 120Hz displays and a stylus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QC2DWS"&gt;Samsung’s flagship foldable has some new tricks up its sleeve, including support for the S Pen, IPX8 water resistance, and an under-display selfie camera for the main screen. It is powered by a Snapdragon 888 processor, and its cover screen (the screen on the front of the device) now runs at an adaptive 120Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbRECk"&gt;The Z Fold 3 is also getting an experimental setting that will allow any app to be used in the phone’s multi-window mode, even if the developers haven’t designed the app for it. It’ll cost $1,799 and be available on August 27th, with preorders starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lfO5xiKKT1HW-8mbNBXhySE3wQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775987/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_7.44.49_AM.png"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsLP5SLsUY0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;butter yellow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; color.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SnBf0s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22381267"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is coming in at under $1,000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzl3Pg"&gt;Samsung also showed off the Z Flip 3, which has the same processor and water resistance as the Z Fold, but comes in at a much lower price, starting at just $1,000. Samsung made the outer screen bigger and more useful than the one on the Z Flip 3’s predecessor and upgraded the main screen to 120Hz instead of 60Hz. Plus, it comes in seven fun colors! The Z Flip 3 will be available in stores on August 27th and can be preordered today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F23SpAv-mGAn3ImVubYeAk_ddts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775904/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_7.16.29_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s presentation focused heavily on the Watch’s health tracking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="34UJIH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22382573"&gt;Samsung and Google team up on the Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MQgpg9"&gt;Samsung announced two smartwatches today, the Galaxy Watch 4 (which starts at $249) and the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic (starting at $349). Both watches have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617873/samsung-exynos-w920-chip-announced-galaxy-watch-4"&gt;new Exynos processor&lt;/a&gt;, but more importantly, they’re running a long-promised new OS — the product of Google and Samsung &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/wear-os/galaxy-watch4/"&gt;combining Wear OS and Tizen&lt;/a&gt;. The watches also feature a bevy of health-related features, including sleep tracking. And if you were worried that a new OS and redesign would mean losing out on genuinely cool features from previous Galaxy watches, worry not. The Classic features the physical rotating bezel that’s been a staple for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Mw07V9"&gt;Samsung has announced the latest in its lineup of true wireless earbuds, and they’re coming in some fun colors. The company also says that the Galaxy Buds 2 are the lightest in its lineup and that they’ll include active noise cancellation. The Buds 2 will be available for preorder today for $149.99. You can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;read our review here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="WNzAqt"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22383705"&gt;You can transfer your WhatsApp history from iOS to Android&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nW775f"&gt;Historically, it’s &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-changing-phones/?lang=en"&gt;been difficult to transfer&lt;/a&gt; your old WhatsApp conversations when switching devices. During its segment on One UI 3, Samsung announced that now, you’ll be able to take your chat history with you if you’re coming from an iPhone. Details are still a bit sparse, but it seems like the functionality will be coming to phones beyond just the Z Flip and Z Fold 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ivRN6s"&gt;Note-ably absent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T1pVoH"&gt;Though new Galaxy Notes are usually announced around this time, we had a good idea that Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;wouldn’t be making a new one&lt;/a&gt; this year. Instead, we saw the Note’s S Pen make its way to the Galaxy Fold. The Note hasn’t stood out as it did in years past with Samsung making phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;like the S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; that support the S Pen and rock a screen nearly as large. But it’s still considered Samsung’s most premium phone — at least until now. It sure seems like the Z Fold 3 is the Note’s true successor. But Samsung will have to prove that a foldable, not a Note, deserves its place as the flagship-among-flagships this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Samsung beefed up its new folding phones: metal, tape, and a dab of goo</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Are the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 strong enough for everybody?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="biWujD"&gt;I was not expecting Samsung’s third generation of folding phones to be water-resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tz0Uv6"&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617226/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-features-price-foldable-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; have just as many moving parts as previous generations. Phones have been resistant to spills and short dunks for some time, but folding phones add an entirely new level of complication to waterproofing. There are many more ways for water to get in, and some of those ingress points move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzlpM2"&gt;Samsung’s solutions for sealing up those ports are clever, but they’re above and beyond what Samsung’s folding phones really needed: stronger screens. Samsung says that’s happening, too. In fact, in a call with some of Samsung’s lead engineers, I learned why the company believes these phones are sturdy enough to become mainstream devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8mqKzp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 preview: there’s just something about this phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22381267"},{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 announced with S Pen support and water resistance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22381247"},{"title":"The Galaxy Watch 4 injects Samsung’s capable hardware with Google software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22382573"},{"title":"How to preorder the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22381610"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JNQqlK"&gt;Samsung has had its share of very public embarrassments. That first Galaxy Fold was canceled before launch because review units broke — sometimes spontaneously, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;as mine did&lt;/a&gt;. And of course, there was the fall of 2016 when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/11/13202608/samsung-galaxy-note-7-discontinued"&gt;Galaxy Note 7 batteries caught fire around the world&lt;/a&gt;, seriously threatening people’s safety and leading to a recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnM6tY"&gt;But the Fold was eventually released after some changes, and more changes still have been applied to this new generation. And the Galaxy Note — and big batteries in Galaxy phones more generally — also eventually made a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bn4gkR"&gt;Samsung keeps trying. And it’s going to keep trying with foldables, where it has a significant lead on the competition and intends to keep it. This year, if you put the stronger screen, a more rigid frame, and that water resistance together, you get a story of a third generation of phones that Samsung hopes will finally put the disaster of the original, canceled Galaxy Fold to rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A deconstructed Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Va9QW0fvFXrR5thoBg73qj7YMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774800/4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A deconstructed Galaxy Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8Di51k"&gt;There’s no magic secret to making a phone water-resistant. Simply find all the places where water can get in and then seal them — either with glue or rubber gaskets. For a lot of the ingress points on folding phones, you just treat a folding phone as two separate phones. Sealing simple things like speaker holes, USB-C ports, and SIM card slots work exactly the same. Done and done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWJ5d9"&gt;But beyond those ingress points, there are complications and the solutions aren’t as straightforward when you’re working with a folding phone. The problem is movement. Specifically, there’s that pesky hinge, an even peskier flexible screen, and the peskiest of all: wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sealing a normal phone against water is usually a matter of simple rubber gaskets, as with this SIM card drawer on the Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_blSrPKsjfOCkXTdB2tbBs2zfWM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774936/8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sealing a normal phone against water is usually a matter of simple rubber gaskets, as with this SIM card drawer on the Galaxy Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Galaxy Z Fold 3 hinge" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RnxwoVhilAXBpvzSKuTMCnU393o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774812/16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s no way to stop water from getting into the Z Fold 3 hinge, so Samsung lubricated the gears inside for protection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nylon sweeper brushes on a Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J0TwMhHFhzlM9pMXw7ODUrKdNOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774939/21.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nylon sweeper brushes on a Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="URQZ86"&gt;There’s simply no way to fully seal the hinge; there are too many moving parts that need to be placed in close proximity. Samsung’s solution for keeping dust out of the mechanism is tiny sets of nylon brushes cut to fit into caps that are less than a millimeter wide. (The company tried both carbon fiber and PET before landing on just using nylon.) It’s not a perfect fix for dust, but it has made a big difference in durability on the second generation of folding phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fc5igM"&gt;But brushes don’t stop liquid. So Samsung just accepted that and instead “developed a special type of lubricant that can really adhere well to all of the small components in the device,” says Hee-cheul Moon, principal engineer on Samsung’s mechanical team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Double-sided tape for water sealing on a Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9AGYoehVpp7-xvAGIFz5NGV9T-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774945/12.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double-sided tape for water sealing on a Galaxy Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Double-sided tape on a Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L-wysVQhvNm1-AOCqjHqdiJu4OE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774948/22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double-sided tape on a Galaxy Z Fold 3 surrounds every hole underneath the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvYefM"&gt;All lubricant can wear off, but Samsung believes that its lubricant should be good for 200,000 folds. Samsung even doused it with Coke. To be fair, Samsung makes no claims that either phone will stand up to soda immersion. The Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 each are rated for IPX8 water resistance, which means they should be able to survive in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. You might be used to seeing IP68 resistance on devices like the iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21, but the “6” is code for a guarantee of dust resistance, which Samsung’s folding phones lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDY9Lb"&gt;As for the screen itself, it’s composed of multiple layers and Samsung simply sealed it up, using what it calls a pressure-sensitive adhesive. So if water gets in, it will literally flow between the screen and the two bodies of the phone, and also get into the hinge. All of that shouldn’t be a problem, Samsung says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDhGsZ"&gt;Sealing the two sides of the phone required new materials. On folding phones, the screen needs to float a bit above the body. It has to move just a bit when the body folds and unfolds. (You can see this most clearly on the Moto Razr, which has a screen that visibly slides around.) There are holes in the body of the phone that need to be sealed, and for that Samsung developed a thick, double-sided tape. It’s thick enough to allow the screen to slide just a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83hiEd"&gt;That leaves one more problem to solve: the two sides of the phone need to be connected with wires. There is no way a simple rubber gasket around a flexible circuit board would work. Those ribbons need to move quite a bit in all three dimensions. Samsung’s fix is super smart: “cured in place gaskets.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A cured-in-place gasket for water sealing on a Galaxy Z Flip 3.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bJ1ghw"&gt;“When it’s dispensed, it’s in the liquid or fluid format,” says Moon. “Once it’s exposed to air, it becomes solid.” Think of it as a kind of flexible epoxy that sticks to the phone and the ribbon to make a watertight seal but still allows for more movement than a rubber gasket could. It’s goo when it’s first applied in the factory, and cured before assembly is finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqZLA0"&gt;Is all of this a repairability nightmare? Absolutely. Adhesives are the bane of fixing up phones, and with the Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3, Samsung has introduced no fewer than three new kinds of sticky materials. Samsung itself offers extended warranty services, and unfortunately, it seems like they might be a very important part of buying these phones — third-party repair shops are going to have a hard time dealing with all that double-sided tape and custom glue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screen assembly on a Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5zw7EyqabQhp4gulAmX6vM9IgBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774818/20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen assembly on a Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dspjB3"&gt;Samsung’s big innovation with the Z Flip in 2020 was using Ultra Thin Glass in its folding displays. But it was an innovation that was hidden under literal layers of plastic. It might have helped with the screen’s durability and making it feel firmer, but the thing your thumb actually touched on both the Flip and Fold phones was still a piece of mushy plastic. (Plus, some phones began cracking at the hinge after some use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYCCHQ"&gt;This year, Samsung needed to solve those problems, add waterproofing, and tackle one more challenge: make sure that the Z Fold 3 would be able to endure having an S Pen stylus tapping and scritching away at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYEsfL"&gt;I have no idea if Samsung can really achieve all of those goals — but making the main screen stronger is the most important thing Samsung could do. It’s the part of the phone that’s most fragile and simultaneously the thing you interact with the most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfVjIS"&gt;Samsung says it has rearranged the layers of the screen to improve durability. So now the order is the Wacom digitizer layer for stylus input (on the Z Fold 3 only), then the OLED display itself, then the Ultra Thin Glass, then a protective polymer layer, and finally the topmost layer, a new “Stretchable PET” (Polyethylene terephthalate) screen protector on top.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Galaxy Z Flip 3 hinge" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hv7j4fl1rTrX3xGl01NsTH-KdTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774810/14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung says its new PET screen protector is more durable and feels more like normal screen protectors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mn7nZZ"&gt;As with previous folding devices from Samsung, you are absolutely not supposed to remove that topmost layer. Unlike previous folding devices, this new stretchable PET should have fewer “marks of fingerprints and it’s less vulnerable to scratches or dents,” according to Byeng-seok Choi, a senior professional at the Flagship Product Planning Group at Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Wacom digitizer on the Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S8i3twSZ5a94hGiWFUlbVe3348Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775301/Screen_Shot_2021_08_10_at_8.09.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The digitizer for stylus input has been split in two, and an algorithm determines location when the S Pen is between them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Z Fold 3-compatible S-Pen has a softer, rounded nib compared to other S-Pens." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ETeWv52N6n-kBy17aZDn5tpfV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775299/Screen_Shot_2021_08_10_at_8.08.34_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Fold 3-compatible S Pen has a softer, rounded nib compared to other S Pens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gUKRKW"&gt;Choi says that for the Z Fold 3, Samsung has achieved “a panel durability which is 80 percent or more higher than our previous iterations.” (Samsung claims the same improvement for the Z Flip 3.) He also claims that it should feel much more like the plastic screen protectors that are already commonly used on regular phones, “So, I believe that the users won’t notice much difference anyway, because they’ve already experienced this material.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV4LGO"&gt;My colleagues Becca Farsace and Chris Welch had a chance to see the phones in person and did notice that they seemed to be less likely to pick up fingerprints than earlier folding phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaAYHx"&gt;As for the Wacom digitizer, Samsung didn’t attempt to make that fold. Instead, there are two separate digitizers on each side of the phone. To the OS, it looks like a single panel — and the gap between them is handled by “a new algorithm” to calculate the stylus tip’s position using data from either side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnyJ7Z"&gt;That all sounds good, but the story is undercut somewhat by Samsung’s solution for using an S Pen with the Z Fold 3. Instead of simply allowing customers to use existing S Pens, Samsung is selling a special version with a retractable tip. The tip of the S Pen now has a “rounded, rubber nib” that’s softer than previous versions. When too much pressure is applied, the tip will retract rather than let a user press too firmly on the screen. It’s a complicated solution that makes it clear there’s still a problem in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Armor Aluminum and parts from Samsung folding phones" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZwJ_trXXw7ykztUKyzZv22F_698=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774825/27.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Armor Aluminum and parts from Samsung folding phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="d537fQ"&gt;Lastly, Samsung is using a new aluminum alloy it developed, patented, and branded with a new name: Armor Aluminum. Samsung wouldn’t share what exact metals and processes it used to create it, but Sung-ho Cho, principal engineer at Samsung’s Advanced Lab, says the company was “able to reinforce the strength by 10 percent or more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOBrXB"&gt;Samsung showed a brief demo where it knocked a block of its Armor Aluminum up against another block of 7000 series aluminum, which is what’s commonly used on smartphones now. (When a tech company touts “aerospace grade” in its aluminum, it’s usually referring to 7000 series.) The dent on Samsung’s alloy was, as you’d expect, much smaller than the damage to the 7000 series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92kzq9"&gt;Samsung is using this new aluminum for the frames and hinges on the Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3, but it also plans on using it on more phones going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWif1j"&gt;Cho says that Samsung stuck with aluminum because of its weight but that this more rigid version of it should help with preventing screen cracks on the outside glass. “It provides such a strong and durable skeleton so that it minimizes the impact on other material,” he says. “It kind of acts as a shock buffer between the different materials.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A deconstructed Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLjmsYgZ0TFDQRTvD_jgyBBKmQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774817/19.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A deconstructed Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="r85Hb3"&gt;Samsung isn’t shy about its stated goal for foldables this year: make them mainstream. For the Z Flip 3, it’s finally brought the price under that conceptually important $1,000 price point. For the Z Fold 3, the price is still very high, but with stylus support and an under-screen selfie camera, it can legitimately replace the Note as Samsung’s spec-forward flagship phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPXMaa"&gt;But price is just one part of what Samsung needs to achieve here. With these durability claims, it’s hoping to remove one more barrier to making these phones feel like normal alternatives to regular glass slabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUlRMe"&gt;The thing about Samsung is that it’s easy to see when it gets things wrong. The screen fritzes out, the battery starts bulging, or the software gets littered with ads. Samsung gets things wrong all the time — too often, really. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbqKsm"&gt;But the other thing about Samsung is that it rarely walks away from an idea it believes in. And year by year, Samsung corrects its mistakes with small iterations that don’t draw much attention but do make the experience better. Until one year, quietly, Samsung gets it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70vuUb"&gt;The only question left is whether this is the year. And if it’s not, can Samsung figure it out before another company finds a way to create a truly great folding phone? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wvhq49"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QzDFIx"&gt;Related:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iMu5oj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: This article previously stated that the Z Flip 3’s screen was 30 percent stronger. Samsung’s claim is 80 percent, the same as the Z Fold 3. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
