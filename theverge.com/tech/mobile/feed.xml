    <title>OnePlus teases ‘moonshot’ announcement for March 8th</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4AxgVb"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau is teasing a “moonshot” announcement on March 8th, when the company expected to reveal details about its next flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 9. “Something new is on the horizon” a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fuk%2Fmoonshot&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F1%2F22306934%2Foneplus-9-launch-event-date-moonshot-pete-lau" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;teaser site reads&lt;/a&gt;, alongside a photograph that looks an awful lot like the famous “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise"&gt;Earthrise&lt;/a&gt;” photograph from the Apollo 8 mission. That photo was taken with a Hasselblad camera, the 180-year-old Swedish company rumored to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272052/oneplus-9-pro-hasselbland-quad-rear-cameras-ultrawide-telephoto-zoom-specs"&gt;partnering with OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; on its upcoming phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rdIV9"&gt;In the past, manufacturers have also used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/20/18232998/huawei-p30-pro-quad-camera-leica-specs-features"&gt;photographs of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; to advertise the capabilities of their phones’ zoom cameras for astrophotography, indicating that this could be a key feature of the OnePlus 9 lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DR7Onq"&gt;The tease comes days after tipster Ishan Agarwal &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-9-pro-9r-watch-march-launch-exclusive/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company would be announcing three new smartphones — the OnePlus 9, 9 Pro, and 9R — and a smartwatch in mid-March. According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxJmb/status/1366308703562059785"&gt;tipster Max Jambor&lt;/a&gt;, the company will announce the launch date of the OnePlus 9 series on March 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OuSSii"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Stay tuned for March 8.&lt;a href="https://t.co/mprr4v8UbS"&gt;https://t.co/mprr4v8UbS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/CQSop6Fg85"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CQSop6Fg85&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Lau (@PeteLau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1366357664213528576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fTtPun"&gt;Other rumors about the upcoming OnePlus 9 Pro include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;wireless fast charging at 45W&lt;/a&gt;. The step-down OnePlus 9 is expected to have a flat 6.55-inch 120Hz 1080p display, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-9-specs-1195130/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while the 9 Pro will reportedly have a 6.78-inch 120Hz 1440p display. Both phones are expected to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor. A third phone, rumored to be called either the OnePlus 9R or OnePlus 9 Lite, could also be announced with an older Snapdragon 865 processor, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-lite-snapdragon-865-will-launch-alongside-oneplus-9-9-pro"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon support says you should turn off 5G to save your phone’s battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Verizon Communications logo seen displayed on a smartphone with the 5G inscription background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYLHsvbhArPFRlGPayxGnme_6xc=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68887873/1227822210.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwJAmv"&gt;Despite its relentless promotion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22194419/5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide"&gt;5G phones&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that it spent more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;$45 billion bidding&lt;/a&gt; on a new faster spectrum, Verizon support now is advising people on Twitter to turn off their phones’ 5G access to preserve battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1vDDR"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1366055566347546635?s=20"&gt;Sunday morning tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon support helpfully suggested that “one way to help conserve battery life is to turn on LTE” if users found their batteries were “draining faster than normal.” That step would, of course, turn off 5G in a phone that has it available. It’s also worth pointing out that you don’t actually “turn on LTE” when doing this step — LTE is always enabled as a fallback for the 5G network. But Verizon is obviously being cautious so as not to actually tell its customers to “turn off 5G”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fAfQh69dqwsWSeWwmy_E0WegA_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22334862/verizon_says_turn_off_5g.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GIze4C"&gt;Twitter users naturally pointed out that switching to LTE-only would mean turning off 5G (which is available in some newer phones), but the helpful support person said it was important to troubleshoot “steps to find the root cause of any issues with speed,” adding that Verizon is “quickly launching more 5G areas, and making updates constantly to improve speeds.” Verizon’s nationwide 5G network uses a technology called DSS, which in many instances is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;actually slower than the LTE network&lt;/a&gt; it’s trying to replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXMAO1"&gt;Verizon announced its big 5G plans for 2021 last month, after formally launching its next-gen network in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509364/verizon-5g-network-ultra-wideband-nationwide-apple-event"&gt;October 2020&lt;/a&gt;.  One of its top priorities is expanding coverage of its ultra-fast mmWave coverage, which is currently restricted to parts of some cities in the US. It’s also heavily dependent on how close you are to a Verizon 5G site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jauZ6Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oxXD2Q"&gt;Both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T spent big bucks in the FCC’s Auction 107, bidding on the C-band spectrum. Verizon spent $45.4 billion— twice as much as AT&amp;amp;T’s $23.4 billion. AT&amp;amp;T’s current nationwide 5G network also relies on DSS with speeds close to or lower than 4G LTE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ottI2"&gt;The new frequencies won’t become available until the end of the 2021 at the earliest, and will be available in limited locations first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMmHq3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram update adds auto-delete option to all messages, expiring invites, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4wPLt53eGo3fE1HuGhq53pQ4DZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68877478/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8fbrHy"&gt;Telegram is updating its messaging app with options for auto-deleting messages, expiring invite links, and new unlimited groups, the company &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/autodelete-inv2"&gt;shared in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Much like Signal, Telegram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;received a burst of new users&lt;/a&gt; in the confusion over WhatsApp’s privacy policy and now the company is adopting features that were already part of its competitors’ apps, features which offer more security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7yZYj"&gt;Auto-deleting messages were already possible in Telegram’s encrypted Secret Chats, but this new update for iOS and Android adds the option to make messages disappear in any kind of chat. Auto-delete can be enabled inside of chats, and set to delete either 24 hours or seven days after messages are sent. Auto-delete won’t remove every message though; if a message was sent before the feature was turned on, it’ll stick around. Telegram’s competitors have had similar features: WhatsApp introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550634/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-feature"&gt;a feature in 2020&lt;/a&gt; and Signal has had disappearing messages &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/disappearing-messages/"&gt;since at least 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mAUhhCNzCkl3DyjKNSkMkB69h4g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328934/telegram_auto_delete_1.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Messages can auto-delete after 24 hours or seven days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bYzqM1"&gt;Telegram’s also making changes to groups that might allow for the kind of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261435/elon-musk-clubhouse-podcasts-robinhood"&gt;immediate, informative audio experiences&lt;/a&gt; that have become popular on Clubhouse. New “Broadcast Groups” allow for an unlimited number of members, but limit creating posts to group admins so they can, well, broadcast. Voice chats on the other hand are open to everyone in a broadcast group, and Telegram thinks the feature should be “ideal for large communities, where people can follow along and catch exclusive interviews, news, or just casual talks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIbBnv"&gt;To help keep these groups exclusive (or grow them fast) Telegram is adding in expiring invite links that can be set to expire after a certain number of uses, a certain amount of time, or both. With the new invites, group admins should be able to better moderate who joins and keep private subject matter a little more private.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eyzJbIQJuQi50OtVWI-JZhwtGjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328939/telegram_invite_links_1.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invite links can be set to expire after a certain number of uses or a set duration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4uHoi2"&gt;Many users left WhatsApp for Telegram out of concern that Facebook would read their messages. Expanding privacy features like auto-delete seems like a good way for Telegram to address those concerns. But even with new privacy options, Telegram still doesn’t universally offer a feature many users expect — end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpLWdT"&gt;All messages on Telegram are technically encrypted, but Secret Chats are the only ones that are exclusively viewable on the devices of the people participating. It’s a difference that Telegram says &lt;a href="https://telegra.ph/Why-Isnt-Telegram-End-to-End-Encrypted-by-Default-08-14"&gt;enables features like the new broadcast groups&lt;/a&gt;, but even with auto-delete it might be a dealbreaker for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWLDw2"&gt;You can see &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/autodelete-inv2"&gt;the full list of new features&lt;/a&gt; on Telegram’s blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TNbOj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68OjOc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis compiles the entire FFVII timeline into one mobile game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4czh9798E_aU-w_L-bb-XPRWbg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876956/FFVIIEC05_en.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="obmwZW"&gt;Square Enix announced two mobile games set in the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII &lt;/em&gt;universe today. One is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301945/final-fantasy-7-soldier-prequel-battle-royale-android-iphone"&gt;battle royale game aiming for a 2021 release&lt;/a&gt;, and the other is &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis&lt;/em&gt;, a compilation of all the games and stories set in the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII &lt;/em&gt;universe (&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Advent Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Before Crisis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crisis Core&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dirge of Cerberus&lt;/em&gt;). The latter is slated to launch sometime in 2022 on Android and iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZEohX"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-ANNOUNCED-FOR-PLAYSTATION5-CONSOLE"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis&lt;/em&gt; is a chapter-structured single-player experience that covers the entire timeline in one of the most popular installments in Square Enix’s RPG franchise. The compilation will feature all the events from each game, in addition to new story elements focusing on the “origins of SOLDIER.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDRBeR"&gt;In an interview &lt;a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202102/26215104.html"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;Weekly Famitsu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; director Tetsuya Nomura strongly hints you’ll meet a younger Sephiroth: “it goes without saying that you will get to see the early days of a certain legendary hero when he was younger.” He also says the game will be released in monthly installments, and will have a materia combat system more like the original game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXr1Kq"&gt;Watching the announcement trailer, &lt;em&gt;Ever Crisis&lt;/em&gt; reminds me of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/18/16979602/final-fantasy-xv-pocket-edition-ios-android"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a 2018 title that served as an abridged version of the fifteenth main installment in the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXtJxJ"&gt;The description for the trailer on YouTube notes it is “another possibility for a remake,” and the visuals look greatly improved from the original version of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; on the PlayStation, as pointed out by Twitter user Nibellion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s43iHR"&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T spins out DirecTV as a $16B company, a quarter of what it paid in 2015</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qcUNkMMrtzKhjg0-UgELFsKl6xo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876637/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="keg3YK"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T today announced plans to spin out its various video businesses — DirecTV, AT&amp;amp;T TV, and U-Verse — into a new company that it will jointly control with TPG Capital. The deal sees AT&amp;amp;T holding on to a 70 percent stake in the company, with TPG getting the other 30. “The transaction to separate AT&amp;amp;T’s US video business into New DirecTV implies an enterprise value for the new company of $16.25 billion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1gjto"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T paid a total of $67 billion to buy DirecTV: it landed the satellite provider &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/18/5727276/att-acquires-directv"&gt;for $48.5 billion in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest was debt that AT&amp;amp;T took on. With this “premium new video entity” valued at less than a quarter of that, you can see how just how badly the original mega-acquisition has fared. “We certainly didn’t expect this outcome when we closed the DirecTV acquisition in 2015,” AT&amp;amp;T John Stankey said on a call with analysts and investors after the news was made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPdvuQ"&gt;The deal for this new company, which will be led by AT&amp;amp;T US video boss Bill Morrow, is expected to close in the second half of 2021. AT&amp;amp;T will net $7.8 billion as part of the pact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AHRlOq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AT&amp;amp;amp;T tried to buy out the streaming wars — and customers are paying for it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21115181/att-direct-tv-time-warner-acquisition-debt-streaming-wars"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GbwZay"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says that all content deals — including NFL Sunday Ticket — will move along to the “new” DirecTV. The company is also insisting that its WarnerMedia channels like CNN, TBS, and TNT will remain a core part of the video properties. “Customers aren’t going to see a change” in bundles or programming in the near term, Stankey said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24mN8c"&gt;Activist investors have long urged AT&amp;amp;T to deal with its DirecTV problem; Elliott Management has said the transaction produced “damaging results.” DirecTV’s business has continued to suffer declining subscribers as consumers have shifted en masse to streaming entertainment. But AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20747190/directv-now-rebrand-att-tv-streaming-app"&gt;deeply confusing branding choices&lt;/a&gt; for its video services haven’t helped matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3RBdH"&gt;“Today’s announcement lines up with the evolution of our business,” Stankey said on the call. “We’re coming off a year where we saw strong wireless subscriber growth,” Stankey said, and he also called HBO Max “an important part of our future.” AT&amp;amp;T has said it’s focused on the mobile business — it just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;spent $23.4 billion in the FCC’s C-band spectrum auction&lt;/a&gt; — and content efforts like HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mHsFe"&gt;Stankey added that AT&amp;amp;T examined “every possibility under the sun” for what to do with its video assets before deciding on the deal with TPG.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter planning a feature to let you auto-block and mute abusive accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yMhBh6q_mT1LeR1BX2CSpVlLSMc=/0x83:1898x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875042/twitter_auto_block.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter safety mode mockup. | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dgZp9v"&gt;Twitter plans to introduce a way for you to automatically block and mute abusive accounts, the company announced at its Analyst Day presentation on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6TFyA"&gt;It appears the feature will be a toggle you can turn on in a new “safety mode,” according to a slide in the &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_presentations/Analyst_Day_2021/3_AnalystDay2021_Kayvon-Dantley.pdf"&gt;Analyst Day slide deck&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s Twitter’s description of how the toggle will work if you flip it on: “Automatically block accounts that appear to break the Twitter Rules, and mute accounts that might be using insults, name-calling, strong language, or hateful remarks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bi2JPu"&gt;With the new safety mode, Twitter will automatically detect accounts that “might be acting abusive or spammy” and limit how those accounts can engage with your content for seven days, according to the slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsNNmW"&gt;We’ve asked Twitter for more information about the new features and will update this article with anything we hear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3xAsg"&gt;Twitter has historically struggled with abuse on its platform and has released a number of features over the years to help reduce offensive content, such as letting people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20874847/twitter-feature-launch-us-japan-rollout-hide-replies"&gt;hide replies&lt;/a&gt; and letting users control &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362514/twitter-reply-limiting-features-all-users-harassment-rollout-available-now"&gt;who can reply to an individual tweet&lt;/a&gt;. The company also has some automated tools in place to remove abusive tweets, and it said in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20929290/twitter-abusive-tweets-automated-removal-earnings-q3-2019"&gt;that it removes&lt;/a&gt; more than 50 percent of abusive tweets before users report them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG: New State is a futuristic new battle royale game for Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FG35rvlSegFMS6_TcQniVYhW-0w=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68871803/PUBG_NEW_STATE_Key_Art_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t2yXxQ"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; universe is expanding with a new mobile title for iOS and Android called &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State, &lt;/em&gt;which catapults the battle royale ahead in time for a more futuristic take on the massive multiplayer genre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRcioC"&gt;Set in 2051, &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt; takes place years after the current &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; games (which are set in approximately modern times) on a new map called Troi and promises to bring with it a slew of near-future weapons and vehicles, like drones and deployable combat shields. Based on the early images, it’s a similar vibe to fellow shooter &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s semi-futuristic military tech from games like &lt;em&gt;Black Ops 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJD19c"&gt;The new game is also set to dive deeper into the &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/"&gt;lore of the overall &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; universe&lt;/a&gt;, which is apparently a thing that surprisingly exists for a game whose most notable cultural signifier is the use of a cast-iron skillet as a weapon. What the time jump will mean for beloved &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; characters like &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/en/character/lunchmeat"&gt;Lunchmeat&lt;/a&gt;, though, will have to wait for the game’s release. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVi79IthSp1c0u7cD0MoZHZZuoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326840/PUBG_NEW_STATE_Screenshot_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kSJ0pM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; also promises to shake up the formula for &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; games, with in-game weapon customization options that will allow players to modify their weapons within a match in a way that sounds similar to &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;’ weapon attachments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCeBU6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; marks the third battle royale game under the &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; umbrella — although, unlike its mobile cousin &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt; will be developed by PUBG Studio, the company behind &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, the PC and console version of the original game. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21399585/pubg-mobile-update-esports-tournament-2-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; is actually a separate title&lt;/a&gt; developed by Chinese tech giant Tencent.) And despite the mobile nature of the title, PUBG Studio is making big promises of “ultra-realistic graphics that push the limits of mobile gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccKBKW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State &lt;/em&gt;will be available on Android and iOS later in 2021, with alpha tests also set for later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6FdkD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niantic permabanned a million cheaters since the start of 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IAIHap2RcPU4L-zQ6OvV48cmIcA=/0x44:841x605/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870246/Qto1N_hg.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rPYazP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;creator&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Niantic &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/cheatingupdate-022321"&gt;has published a blog post&lt;/a&gt; detailing some of its anti-cheat efforts, and it seems the company has been busy. Since the start of 2020, Niantic has issued over 5 million “punishments” to players caught cheating, with over 20 percent of those being permabans. Doing the math, that’s over a million people who have gotten the boot in just over a year. This includes bans from &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6pOfy"&gt;The post did contain some encouraging news about the player base: apparently over 90 percent of people stopped cheating after they received their first warning. That’s a wonderful thing to hear, because it’s relatable; I also like to live just on the edge until someone tells me to knock it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ci9eY5"&gt;While it looks like 2020 was a bad year for people trying to cheat at &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, it was also rough for Niantic, as it tried to figure out how to adapt its games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22189424/pokemon-go-covid-2020-safety"&gt;which are all based on going outside and walking around&lt;/a&gt;, to a locked-down world. The developer had to make adjustments, not just to its anti-cheat software, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178230/pokemon-go-coronavirus-niantic-updates-temporary-discounts-inside"&gt;to the mechanics of the games as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and AT&amp;T just spent almost $70 billion on spectrum to improve their 5G networks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Bs9FQcNFugaRY6eJ7o9M0O050g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870113/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oxXD2Q"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-announces-winning-bidders-c-band-auction"&gt;much-anticipated results&lt;/a&gt; of the FCC’s Auction 107 are in, with Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T spending big as anticipated on the coveted C-band spectrum. Verizon in particular spent nearly twice as much as AT&amp;amp;T, with a total spend of $45.4 billion. AT&amp;amp;T’s total bid adds up to $23.4 billion. T-Mobile is in a distant third at $9.3 billion, which was also expected thanks to the strong midband spectrum holdings that the company already had following its acquisition of Sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGtcsG"&gt;There’s nothing outright surprising here: we’ve known for a while that the total bidding added up to &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/c-band-clock-phase-auction-tops-charts-80-9b"&gt;over $80 billion&lt;/a&gt;, and that Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T in particular would be the top bidders. Those two carriers’ nationwide 5G networks currently rely on narrower low-band frequencies that offer speeds not much greater than 4G LTE — and extremely fast millimeter wave frequencies that face significant coverage challenges. If there’s any surprise here, it’s just how much more Verizon spent than AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ottI2"&gt;What remains to be seen is if the new spectrum will help either carrier catch up to T-Mobile. &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/verizon-wont-catch-t-mobile-with-c-band---analysts/d/d-id/767264"&gt;Some analysts&lt;/a&gt; don’t think it will. In any case, the new frequencies won’t become available until the end of the year at the earliest, and even then, they will be available in limited locations first.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will match Google’s $1 billion news investment after Australia showdown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHo09DKZBQZKKO5MM6xiH9I43-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868185/mdoying_180411_2400_0130still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eAjQQQ"&gt;Facebook said it plans to invest an additional $1 billion in the news industry over the next three years as a sign of commitment to journalism, following the company’s unprecedented showdown with the government of Australia that involved briefly disabling the ability to read and share news for Australian Facebook users and publishers. The announcement was made as part of a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/the-real-story-of-what-happened-with-news-on-facebook-in-australia/"&gt;blog post from global policy chief Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt; published on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wa0Ym4"&gt;“Facebook is more than willing to partner with news publishers. We absolutely recognize quality journalism is at the heart of how open societies function — informing and empowering citizens and holding the powerful to account,” Clegg writes. “That’s why we’ve invested $600 million since 2018 to support the news industry, and plan at least $1 billion more over the next three years.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yibvQ"&gt;The commitment matches the one Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase/"&gt;made in October of last year&lt;/a&gt;, when the search giant announced it would start paying publishers to create specialized versions of stories and other forms of news content for its Google News Showcase platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sGD8b0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We absolutely recognize quality journalism is at the heart of how open societies function.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ES15xZ"&gt;Notable in this scenario, however, is the way both Facebook and Google reacted to the impending Australian media bargaining legislation that prompted such visceral reactions from the Silicon Valley titans. The law would have forced both companies to the negotiating table with news publishers to hammer out deals for paying for news content to be shared on both the main Facebook app and Google search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUNcaV"&gt;While Google initially threatened to shut off its services in the country, it eventually blinked in the negotiating stage and began &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/google-and-news-corp-strike-deal-as-australia-pushes-platforms-to-pay-for-news.html"&gt;cutting deals with media partners like Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook, on the other hand, did in fact shut off a portion of its service in Australia, in the form of disabling the sharing and reading of news links from both users and publishers for a brief few days starting last week. Facebook then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296778/facebook-ends-australian-news-ban-bargaining-code-google"&gt;reached an agreement&lt;/a&gt; with the Australian government earlier this week and restored the country’s access to news on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcnwoO"&gt;According to Clegg, the company feels the proposed media bargaining law as it was designed prior to the recent compromise was unfair, mainly because it would put too much power in the hands of media conglomerates like Murdoch’s to extract ever-higher payments through a forced negotiation process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3S97G"&gt;“At the heart of it, in Facebook’s view, is a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between Facebook and news publishers. It’s the publishers themselves who choose to share their stories on social media, or make them available to be shared by others, because they get value from doing so,” Clegg argues. “Facebook would have been forced to pay potentially unlimited amounts of money to multi-national media conglomerates under an arbitration system that deliberately misdescribes the relationship between publishers and Facebook — without even so much as a guarantee that it is used to pay for journalism, let alone support smaller publishers.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PGxlu"&gt;Facebook is now free to negotiate deals with news publishers for its Facebook News platform without the fear of forced arbitration, and Clegg says it plans to do that in Australia as it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248814/facebook-news-uk-launch-articles-tab-curated"&gt;currently doing in the UK, the US, and other markets&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook also retains the right to restrict news content for Australian publishers and users as it did last week, but the company has signaled it has no intent to do so if future negotiations remain in good faith. &lt;/p&gt;
