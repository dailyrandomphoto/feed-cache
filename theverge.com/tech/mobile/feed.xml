    <title>Facebook strikes News Corp deal to license news from Australian media outlets</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RCbuNr"&gt;Facebook last month shut off the ability for Australian users and media organizations to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;share news links in the country&lt;/a&gt;, and now it seems the company’s extraordinary measure has resulted in a compromise for the most interested parties as media giant News Corp has &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/03/15/news-corp-and-facebook-reach-agreement-in-australia/"&gt;struck a licensing deal with the social network&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jgd8HD"&gt;Financial terms were not disclosed, but the deal is a multi-year one that gives Facebook’s news platform access to major News Corp Australia properties, including news.com.au, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;. Google similarly struck a deal with News Corp last month, as the threat of a new Australia law regulating tech company payments to news organizations loomed overhead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEl2Rb"&gt;Facebook’s news shutdown in Australia wasn’t designed specifically to increase pressure on News Corp. Instead, Facebook wanted concessions from the Australian government about the then-forthcoming media bargaining law, which stipulated that major tech platforms like Facebook and Google would need to pay news publishers to access their content. Google also threatened to shut down its search engine in Australia, but it ended up &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/02/17/news-corp-and-google-agree-to-global-partnership-on-news/"&gt;striking its own deals instead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="U1Mt8t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook pushed back against Australian’s media bargaining law, and it won&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1cTyAd"&gt;In a predictable turn of events, Facebook received its desired concessions, the largest of which involved negating the forced arbitration portion of the bill that Silicon Valley reviled if prior commercial agreements were struck, and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296778/facebook-ends-australian-news-ban-bargaining-code-google"&gt;restored the ability to share news&lt;/a&gt;. Australia then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22283777/australia-new-media-bargaining-code-facebook-google-paying-news"&gt;passed the law&lt;/a&gt; and everyone more or less came out unscathed. Yet part of Facebook’s initial opposition to the law was that it gave the most powerful publishers too much negotiating power, and News Corp is &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/how-much-influence-does-the-murdoch-media-have-in-australia-20201015-p565dk.html#:~:text=A%202016%20study%20by%20academics,print%20newspaper%20readership%20across%20Australia."&gt;far and away the largest and most pervasive media conglomerate&lt;/a&gt; in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9nMYX"&gt;“Facebook would have been forced to pay potentially unlimited amounts of money to multi-national media conglomerates under an arbitration system that deliberately misdescribes the relationship between publishers and Facebook — without even so much as a guarantee that it is used to pay for journalism, let alone support smaller publishers,” Nick Clegg, Facebook’s global policy chief, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299229/facebook-one-billion-investment-news-industry-australia-google-regulation"&gt;argued at the time&lt;/a&gt; in a public blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0K52d"&gt;Following the Australia showdown, Facebook said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299229/facebook-one-billion-investment-news-industry-australia-google-regulation"&gt;commit $1 billion to news industry deals over the next three years&lt;/a&gt; to foster partnerships with media organizations, with the unspoken stipulation that it not have to face another media bargaining law like Australia’s. (Facebook said it reserves the right to shut down news in Australia again if it so chooses.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lb8fc"&gt;It appears Facebook and News Corp have made up, and this new deal will make News Corp-owned publishers accessible on the Facebook News platform in Australia. In addition to news.com.au and &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;, the latter of which has a separate deal as a broadcast organization, News Corp says it’s also licensing content from major newspapers like &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt; in Victoria, and &lt;em&gt;The Courier-Mail&lt;/em&gt;, as well as numerous regional publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVvao9"&gt;“The agreement with Facebook is a landmark in transforming the terms of trade for journalism, and will have a material and meaningful impact on our Australian news businesses,” said News Corp CEO Robert Thomson in a statement. “Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch led a global debate while others in our industry were silent or supine as digital dysfunctionality threatened to turn journalism into a mendicant order.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZvNLI"&gt;“We’re glad to have this deal in place and look forward to bringing Facebook News to Australia,” wrote Faceboo’s global news partnerships chief Campbell Brown. Andrew Hunter, Facebook’s head of news partnerships for Australia and New Zeland, said in a statement that “the agreements with News Corp Australia and Sky News Australia mean that people on Facebook will gain access to premium news articles and breaking news video from News Corp’s network of national, metropolitan, rural and suburban newsrooms.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Companies can silently reroute your texts to hackers, sometimes for just $16</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ItHDnY_V1jYkVxkKkyUSYNDOJdY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970810/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tm63Om"&gt;There’s a newly discovered attack on SMS messaging that’s almost invisible to victims, and seemingly sanctioned by the telecom industry, uncovered in &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The attack uses text-messaging management services that are aimed at businesses to silently redirect text messages from a victim to hackers, giving them access to any two-factor codes or login links that are sent via text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZYiLU"&gt;Sometimes, the companies providing the service don’t send any sort of message to the number that’s being redirected, either to ask permission or even to notify the owner that their texts are now going to someone else. Using these services, attackers are not only able to intercept incoming text messages, but they can reply as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egjkJP"&gt;Joseph Cox, the &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reporter, had someone successfully carry out the attack on his number, and it only cost the attacker $16. When he contacted other companies providing SMS redirection services, some of them reported that they had seen this sort of attack before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGr2de"&gt;The specific company that &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;used has reportedly fixed the exploit, but there are many others like it — and there doesn’t seem to be anyone holding the companies to account. When asked why this type of attack is even possible, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon simply directed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to contact CTIA, the trade organization for the wireless industry. CTIA wasn’t immediately available for comment, but it told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;it had “no indication of any malicious activity involving the potential threat or that any customers were impacted.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xxie2"&gt;Hackers have found many ways to exploit the SMS and the cellular systems to get at other people’s texts — methods like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/15/17695132/att-sued-over-lost-cryptocurrency-sim-swap-theft"&gt;SIM swapping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/18/16328172/sms-two-factor-authentication-hack-password-bitcoin"&gt;SS7 attacks&lt;/a&gt; have been seen in the wild for a few years now and have sometimes even been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping"&gt;used against high-profile targets&lt;/a&gt;. But with SIM swapping, it’s pretty easy to tell that you’re being attacked: your phone will completely disconnect from the cellular network. But with SMS redirection, it could be quite a while before you notice that someone else is getting your messages — more than enough time for attackers to compromise your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcFGQV"&gt;The main concern with SMS attacks are the implications they could have for the security of your other accounts. If an attacker is able to get a password reset link or code sent to your phone number, they would then have access to it and be able to get into your account. Text messages are also sometimes used to send login links, as &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; found with Postmates, WhatsApp, and Bumble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTlhuP"&gt;This also serves as a reminder that SMS should be avoided for anything security related, if possible — for two-factor authentication, it’s better to use an app like Google Authenticator or Authy. Some password managers even have support for 2FA built in, like 1Password or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22285499/password-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho"&gt;many of the other free managers we recommend&lt;/a&gt;. That said, there are still services and companies that only use text messages as a second factor — the banking industry is infamous for it. For those services, you’ll want to make sure that your password is secure and unique, and then push both for them to move away from SMS and for the cellular industry to work on making itself more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will soon let you use a security key as your only 2FA method</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bfXYWmJAZML_gypRtluWOgh9y4M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970117/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c8wiVA"&gt;Twitter is planning a future update that will allow accounts enabled with two-factor authentication to use security keys as the only authentication method, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1371510300973875201?s=20"&gt;the company said on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. At present, you can use a security key to sign in to your Twitter account, but you need to have another 2FA method — like an authenticator app or SMS codes — enabled as backup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJMioX"&gt;While authentication apps like Google Authenticator or Authy are more secure than using SMS codes for 2FA, security keys — physical keys that connect to your computer using USB or Bluetooth — are the most secure way to protect an account online. Users don’t have to type in a code that could be intercepted by a malicious third party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8KgI3"&gt;You connect the key, your browser issues a challenge, then the key cryptographically signs the challenge and verifies your identity. Another benefit of using a security key: users don’t have to give Twitter any additional personal information, such as a telephone number, to be able to log in to their accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TaymK2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Secure your account (and that alt) with multiple security keys. Now you can enroll and log in with more than one physical key on both mobile and web.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And coming soon: the option to add and use security keys as your only authentication method, without any other methods turned on.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1371510300973875201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EmEKbK"&gt;Twitter also said Monday it will allow multiple security keys on a single account; until today, it only allowed one key per account, in addition to the other 2FA methods. In December, Twitter announced it was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334229117978497024"&gt;adding support&lt;/a&gt; for security keys for 2FA-enabled accounts when users log in to its mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpAI2k"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson said Monday there wasn’t a timeline for when security key-only 2FA would take effect. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pocket’s sort by time to read feature seems designed for the return of commutes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPYtvq3Yi4YITDbBlyq2Vl6nNrg=/70x70:1036x714/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68957097/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_10.19.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Pocket&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2AtnIX"&gt;Pocket, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/27/14752590/mozilla-acquires-pocket-read-it-later"&gt;an app for saving articles to read later&lt;/a&gt;, is rolling out a sorting option to Android users over the next few weeks that could solve my paralysis when choosing something to read. The new sort by time-to-read feature, spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1370081315719110658/photo/1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s Dan Seifert&lt;/a&gt;, means articles can be organized where they fit best, whether it’s the five minutes it takes to microwave lunch, or a 20-minute wait for the late bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkGs37"&gt;The feature appears in both the search section of the app, and as a sorting feature in your main list. A reader can sort their saved article search by length, choosing from Quick (less than five minutes), Medium (six to ten minutes), Long (eleven to twelve minutes), and Very Long (over twenty-one minutes). Your list of saved articles can also be organized by newest saved, oldest saved, longest to read, and shortest read, according to Pocket’s VP and General Manager Matt Koidin. If the feature proves popular, after Pocket “modernizes its iOS codebase,” Koidin says the company will bring these sorting options to iOS and the web as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kphJhj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I have wanted this feature in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pocket?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Pocket&lt;/a&gt; for YEARS, thrilled it's finally a thing &lt;a href="https://t.co/Xpaxkz4awm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Xpaxkz4awm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— dan seifert (@dcseifert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1370081315719110658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kSDPor"&gt;In my pre-pandemic life, when I used to ride the bus to work almost every day, I’d constantly misjudge what I was getting myself into when deciding what to read. Pocket’s pre-existing time-to-read stamps for articles help, but when you have a dragon’s hoard of writing you wanted to read at some point, things get complicated. Finding an article that can fit into a typical commute time might help people actually finish reading what they care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEhl81"&gt;I assumed reading time was personalized, but Koidin says that Pocket actually bases its estimates on an average 220 words-per-minute reading speed. Now the hair on the back of my neck goes up when I think about great writing as a reading length first, rather than a holistic work of creative effort, but I think it’s easy to see how useful this could be (if I wasn’t shackled to an iPhone currently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15NbXJ"&gt;Commutes might not be in the equation for everyone just yet, but for those who still travel to work regularly, the feature might help. It at least has me missing my reading time on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Almost all of LG’s Android 11 updates aren’t coming until the end of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3xU6sLQGi-VF0k51MRC4uxwX3c4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68955865/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jB1tF0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lg.com/de/android-updates"&gt;LG’s German&lt;/a&gt; website has revealed its Android 11 update roadmap — at least for Europe — and the news isn’t too encouraging. With the exception of the LG Velvet 5G, most of the company’s phones won’t get Android 11 until the back half of 2021, with the vast majority of devices not seeing the update until at least Q4 2021 (long after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;Android &lt;em&gt;12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; should be available, if Google’s release schedule is similar this year). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98aXQk"&gt;It’s worth noting that the released schedule is only from LG’s German site. It’s possible that time frames will be different in other regions, that LG could add more devices over time, or that the updates will simply take less time to develop than the company expects. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BCIctszh8vH1l1bOUfYP14fxeUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365453/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_10.43.55_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gv2P4A"&gt;The slow update speed isn’t entirely surprisingly, though. LG’s phone business has been struggling for years, prompting reports that the company is considering exiting the smartphone space entirely this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240282/lg-smartphone-business-exit-2021-internal-memo"&gt;although the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in January that nothing has been finalized yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4ZVjV"&gt;LG has also denied rumors that its next major smartphone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296298/lg-rollable-denial-not-on-hold-or-cancelled"&gt;the LG Rollable&lt;/a&gt;, has been canceled, although there’s still no firm release date for that device either outside of a vague 2021 window. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile hopes to expand the service to 7 to 8 million customers in the next five years | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d8ZTO1"&gt;At an analyst event on Thursday, T-Mobile revealed that its long-awaited 5G home broadband service will launch later this month, which it confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; A 4G version of the service is currently in pilot testing with 100,000 households. By the end of the year, T-Mobile says it hopes to extend the service to 7–8 million customers within five years. There’s no confirmed launch date for the service yet, but we’ll know more later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCrFgl"&gt;The company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254853/tmobile-sprint-merger-5g-home-internet-service-promises"&gt;promising 5G-based wireless broadband&lt;/a&gt; since before its acquisition of Sprint, saying that the merger would make it possible to offer service that would challenge the dominant cable companies. Before the deal was approved, T-Mobile went ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;started testing out the service&lt;/a&gt; with a limited group of customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0z9D8s"&gt;The self-styled Uncarrier isn’t the only one testing the waters of fixed wireless internet. Verizon &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fc-band-verizon-expands-5g-home-internet&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325833%2Ft-mobile-5g-home-broadband-internet-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just expanded&lt;/a&gt; its 5G home internet service to ten more cities, though in testing last year &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/for-now-verizons-5g-home-internet-service-offers-very-little-coverage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; that actual availability in the cities Verizon serves is scarce. If nothing else, both companies seem plenty motivated to get 5G home internet up and running. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pakistan is again banning TikTok, this time for ‘peddling vulgarity’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufLIkvf3ZyakkULTvro5-1pWqgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951763/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hGrOzk"&gt;Pakistan has banned TikTok yet again, citing objectionable content on the shortform video app. This is the second time the ByteDance platform has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509817/tiktok-pakistan-ban-immoral-indecent-content"&gt;banned in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, following a brief 10-day shutdown in October of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONMcK"&gt;Last fall, TikTok was banned for hosting “immoral” and “indecent” videos, but the company was able to assure the Pakistani government that videos would be moderated “in accordance with societal norms and the laws of Pakistan,” and the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523094/pakistan-tiktok-ban-lifted-after-10-days"&gt;resumed operations&lt;/a&gt; a week and a half later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kgMTQd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In respectful compliance to the orders of the Peshawar High Court, PTA has issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok App. During the hearing of a case today, the PHC has ordered for the blocking of App.&lt;/p&gt;— PTA (@PTAofficialpk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PTAofficialpk/status/1370044117678444544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s4pyxu"&gt;The company has tens of millions of users in Pakistan, and yet a high court in the city of Peshawar ordered the government’s telecom regulatory body, the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority, to ban the app in order to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOV0rz"&gt;“In respectful compliance to the orders of the Peshawar High Court, PTA has issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok App,” reads the announcement. “During the hearing of a case today, the PHC has ordered for the blocking of App.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnTr1J"&gt;It’s not entirely clear why TikTok’s legality in Pakistan is again in question and whether any one video or trend on the app is the culprit. Yet, &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/11/pakistani-court-orders-tik-tok-banned-over-obscene"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that complaints were made from Peshawar High Court Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan, who accused TikTok of hosting content “unacceptable for Pakistani society.” &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/90df50e4-7fd9-4def-86e3-db256882140d"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Khan said the platform engaged in “peddling vulgarity” and ordered the ban take effect immediately during a hearing on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n1gtY3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the second ban for TikTok in Pakistani in the last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9vyZs6"&gt;“TikTok is built upon the foundation of creative expression, with strong safeguards in place to keep inappropriate content off the platform,” TikTok said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In Pakistan we have grown our local-language moderation team, and have mechanisms to report and remove content in violation of our community guidelines. We look forward to continuing to serve the millions of TikTok users and creators in Pakistan who have found a home for creativity and fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wCZ8I"&gt;TikTok has endured a number of contentious government bans and other restrictions around the world — most notably, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262940/tiktok-leaves-india-ban-app-china-government-security-privacy"&gt;countrywide ban in India since last summer&lt;/a&gt; and the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;hamfisted attempt&lt;/a&gt; to force the company to partner with a US tech firm to assuage fears of Chinese government influence over the platform. (That deal, with cloud giant Oracle, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276090/tiktok-oracle-deal-biden-trump-ban-china-bytedance-white-house"&gt;apparently on life support&lt;/a&gt; under President Joe Biden.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OJcgI"&gt;The app has faced its most serious opposition in and around Southeast Asia, where governments have extended existing control over the media to the video-centric social network using laws and regulations around what constitutes obscene or immoral content. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile plans to turn up 5G speed this year, cover 90 percent of Americans with fast 5G by 2024</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d1ALIQN-zGC7S5F5hxvsqxiV0yk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951303/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile is keen to stay ahead of the 5G competition | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5066wz"&gt;During its &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/T-Mobile-Virtual-Analyst-Day/default.aspx"&gt;virtual analyst event&lt;/a&gt; today, T-Mobile outlined &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eliblumenthal/status/1370098384816779265?s=20"&gt;some bold plans&lt;/a&gt; for expanding its 5G coverage and speeding up its current offerings. The company says that by the end of 2023, it will cover 90 percent of Americans (about 300 million) with what it calls Ultra Capacity 5G (its faster mid-band and mmWave service). It also plans to cover 97 percent of Americans (approximately 320 million) by the end of 2022 with its slower low-band 5G, which it calls Extended Range. Currently, 125 million are covered by Ultra Capacity, with Extended Range covering 287 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHYsUO"&gt;Additionally, those currently covered by Ultra Capacity 5G will see an increase in average speeds from 300Mbps up to 400Mbps, thanks to additional megahertz devoted to 5G, and T-Mobile says that more speed increases are on the way. This portion of T-Mobile’s 5G service is largely based on spectrum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202726/tmobile-sprint-acquisition-ceo-finished-john-legere-steps-down"&gt;acquired from its Sprint merger&lt;/a&gt;, with mid-band frequencies well-suited to faster speeds and broad coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sfFCloG7qNYmJkL-vz7n6C2PeQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363649/slack_imgs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s C-band acquisition figures into expansion plans starting in 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S1S5xW"&gt;Already having access to those mid-band frequencies allowed T-Mobile to take a less aggressive approach to the recent FCC C-band auction, a fact it celebrated throughout its investor call today. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Ft-mobile-further-solidifies-5g-leadership-position-with-successful-c-band-auction&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325857%2Ft-mobile-5g-coverage-ultra-capacity-extended-range" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile says its comparatively low bid&lt;/a&gt; of $9.3 billion (Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T bid $45.4 and $23.4 billion, respectively) went toward spectrum that would strategically supplement its current 2.5GHz holdings. Those frequencies will become available in 2023 and likely figure into the latter part of the company’s aggressive expansion plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoyhdH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction March 11th, 4:32PM PT: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T bid $45.4 and $23.4 billion respectively in the recent FCC auction. A previous version of this article said that the companies bid $45.4 and $23.4 million, which would have been quite a steal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo announces Find X3 Pro flagship with microscope camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OP9PQ9ME_gfB9dweKHvjtlEq0RE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947568/DSCF7577.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="26hpQt"&gt;After a drawn-out series of leaks and teases, Oppo has announced its 2021 flagship in full. The Find X3 Pro is a sleek, powerful phone with an unusual design and some unique features to match. It’s also an important device for Oppo, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318941/china-smartphone-market-share-oppo-huawei-vivo-apple-xiaomi-january-2021"&gt;recently overtook Huawei&lt;/a&gt; in the Chinese smartphone market and will be looking to capitalize on its rival’s troubles this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNJdHd"&gt;The Find X3 Pro’s most arresting visual element is its camera bump, which almost looks organic in the way it seamlessly rises from the same piece of glass as the rest of the phone’s back panel. Combined with the finish, which on my unit is aggressively shiny and glossy, the phone looks sort of like it was forged out of &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2-&lt;/em&gt;style liquid metal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/li_PZuoMOeFQdhkYRQU8RIWZ1lY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362260/DSCF7572.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Sbic"&gt;The camera system itself is no less unusual. There’s a primary camera and an ultrawide that both use 50-megapixel 1/1.56-inch Sony IMX766 sensors, meaning the image quality should be comparable across both, though we’ll have to see how that bears out in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqWHj8"&gt;There’s also a 3-megapixel microlens, which shouldn’t be mistaken for the useless macro cameras found in some phones today. Oppo claims up to 60x magnification, and it’s more like a microscope than a macro lens — you can take pictures of things like subpixel layouts on screens, and there’s even a ring light to illuminate the subject. I’m not sure if this will be a selling point for many people, but in my early testing I can confirm that it’s pretty cool. Here’s a quick shot of my computer monitor:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BZdLCMaTM4xe51OWFwIKTXjA2t4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362255/IMG20210311143520_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ibrXP2"&gt;You’ll notice that the whole shot isn’t quite in focus, and that’s because depth of field is extremely shallow when shooting this close — you have to get within millimeters. I probably need more practice using the microlens, but my first impression is that it might be more useful for looking at things in real time than capturing them for sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQIVVq"&gt;One notable omission is a periscope zoom lens, even though Oppo did more than anyone to popularize the technology. There is a telephoto lens here, but it’s just a 13-megapixel sensor with 2x optical zoom over the primary camera. That’s not necessarily a downgrade, since it could improve image quality at mid-range shooting distances, but it does mean the Find X3 Pro won’t have anywhere near as much zoom reach as its 5x-telephoto-equipped predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2ZGfAfwu3JOBgQC-Q2ad5yxCmM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362261/DSCF7578.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tWxaBM"&gt;The Find X3 Pro’s display is another key feature; it’s a 3216 x 1440 LTPO OLED panel with a peak brightness of 1,300 nits and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Oppo is making a big deal out of the fact that it’s a 10-bit panel and that it’s integrated full-path color management into ColorOS; this means photos and videos captured with the cameras can be displayed with more than a billion colors, as opposed to the 16.7 million colors on conventional smartphone screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKe3mQ"&gt;The Find X3 Pro has typically flagship-tier internals: a Snapdragon 888 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The 4,500mAh battery can be fast-charged at up to 65W, and Oppo has finally embraced wireless charging on a flagship with a 30W system that can fully charge the phone in 80 minutes. The lack of wireless charging was my biggest knock against the Find X2 Pro, so Oppo’s off to a good start here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbpxC7"&gt;We don’t have pricing or release details for the Find X3 Pro just yet; Oppo plans to announce that next week. Stay tuned for more information and a full review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon decrees only ‘premium’ customers can escape its slowest 5G speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wfNicsIBDiN9I_ObyseevKZKQ64=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68945901/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Verizon wants to funnel more customers into its more expensive unlimited plans. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7u1DyK"&gt;If you’re on a basic Verizon plan, you’re going to be stuck with the company’s poor performing “nationwide” 5G network — even after critical C-band spectrum comes online. The company revealed in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0JNCwmCmCg"&gt;presentation to investors&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that C-band frequencies, and their faster speeds, will only be available to customers on “premium” unlimited plans. Those on metered or the basic Start Unlimited plan will be relegated to slower, low-band 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CiFr0q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Verizon confirms that to access C-Band you will need a premium unlimited plan like its Play More, Do More and Get More. If you have an older plan you'll only have access to its DSS "nationwide" 5G, not this newer and faster flavor.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/JH1uTixZaI"&gt;https://t.co/JH1uTixZaI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eli Blumenthal (@eliblumenthal) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eliblumenthal/status/1369798985016373251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="919wxO"&gt;This is essentially how the company already treats its ultra-fast mmWave 5G: customers on the base-level unlimited plan don’t have access to this network, while Play More, Do More, and Get More Unlimited subscribers do. Customers on metered plans don’t have mmWave access either, and likewise won’t have C-band, though they can add access to both for an additional fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1HI3Uz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company is extremely keen to funnel customers into “step up” plans and is using that C-band spectrum as incentive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vA0agR"&gt;That’s bad news for Verizon customers hoping that C-band would improve the poor performance they’re seeing on the company’s nationwide 5G. The network currently uses narrow low-band channels not well suited for 5G, and relies on a technology called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing to accommodate 4G and 5G traffic on the same frequencies. As a result, Verizon’s 5G speeds are closer to 4G — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196060/verizon-5g-slower-than-lte-speed-test"&gt;and at times even slower&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gG3daF"&gt;Verizon has been limited by the spectrum it has access to, and so it spent big in the recent FCC auction of mid-band frequencies known as C-band. This chunk of spectrum is ideal for 5G, offering faster speeds than LTE with coverage that’s broader than range-limited mmWave. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;The company bid $45.4 billion on C-band licenses&lt;/a&gt; — more than double what AT&amp;amp;T spent. When these blocks of frequencies start becoming available at the end of the year, it should significantly boost the network’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gmzDf5VcpUEMbWWLSRqpjNa1ac0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361438/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_5.41.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon predicts premium unlimited plans will make up 50% of its postpaid account mix by the end of 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XITILH"&gt;And that $45 billion is just the start. Verizon revealed on its investor presentation that it plans to spend an additional $10 billion over the next three years on C-band deployment, above and beyond its expected capital expenditure. That’s likely why the company is extremely keen to funnel customers into “step up” plans, and is using that C-band spectrum as incentive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49XVIf"&gt;Verizon also says that going forward, all new phones that it sells will be C-band compatible. That’s already the case for flagships like the Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12 series, but not all budget or midrange phone are C-band compatible in the US. That’s one less thing for phone shoppers to have to think about when buying a phone with Verizon, but it also makes Verizon’s job of talking you into a more expensive plan easier, too. And if you’re on one of their basic plans, you might be hearing that sales pitch sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;
