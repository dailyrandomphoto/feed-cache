    <title>Qualcomm is the latest major company to skip MWC’s in-person show this year</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zwVjAq"&gt;Qualcomm has announced that it will skip Mobile World Congress’ in-person show in Barcelona this year, making it the latest major company to announce that it will miss the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;potential COVID-19 superspreader event&lt;/a&gt; in June in favor of an online presence at the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ac822a"&gt;“While we appreciate the health and safety measures being put into place by the GSMA for MWC Barcelona, we have decided that it is in the best interest of our employees and customers for Qualcomm’s participation to be virtual this year,” the company said in a statement &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/qualcomm-wont-be-exhibiting-in-person-at-mwc/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAVkG2fo1pR2bTqIZSfKZd5kxZ9e2u3fNw5XNOikLFfzwDpFDDSR5ulJ9J4Dw_6DQwlpcS1II1EBJ-bdsmKcC-S6dgBjCDb6g3nQtVFinKW_ZUziSHkrdXCMbDpqsVpvX0D9bgpJkZHBWFqEvLCwXS_0NaOjmzdQxv_Tnxpe0wIP"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6K9zHH"&gt;Qualcomm is by no means the only major company opting for a digital appearance at MWC this year: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360692/google-mwc-mobile-world-congress-phone-2021-nokia-ericsson"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, Nokia, Ericsson, Sony, and Oracle have all pulled out of this year’s show entirely, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;Samsung and Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; have announced that they will also attend digitally instead of their traditional in-person appearances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ECaHxk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"MWC insists on holding potential COVID-19 superspreader event in Barcelona","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aChfGB"&gt;MWC 2020 was one of the first major conferences to shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123846/mobile-world-congress-gsma-coronavirus-lg"&gt;despite the GSMA’s attempts&lt;/a&gt; to try to put on the show, even with rapidly increasing case numbers around the world and new travel restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2JevQ"&gt;The GSMA is still insisting on holding this year’s event with only minimal COVID-19 mitigation policies, including asking attendees to have had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of their arrival and plans for “controlling crowd density” — neither of which is expected to be enough to prevent the spread of the coronavirus at an event this large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlRm5e"&gt;In 2020, MWC was only canceled after numerous major companies (like LG, ZTE, Sony, and Amazon) pulled out of the event. And while the GSMA has given no indication that it’ll be looking to adjust its plans for this year’s show yet, it’s possible the increasing number of  exhibitors that won’t be attending could change that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE’s S21 competitor arrives in June for $749</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKZwv8yTx3fMFytg5qxO3WiG2YI=/164x0:1373x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69279578/Axon_30_Colors_1536x806.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra features a large 6.67-inch screen with 144Hz refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="anuhJR"&gt;ZTE announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22384596/zte-axon-30-ultra-5g-specs-launch-us"&gt;Axon 30 Ultra alongside two other devices&lt;/a&gt; last month, and today reveals that the Ultra will go on sale June 4th starting at $749 / €749. Preorders begin &lt;a href="https://ztedevices.com/"&gt;directly through ZTE’s website&lt;/a&gt; on May 27th and include a free pair of ZTE’s Livebuds TWS earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSwaoC"&gt;While ZTE has tried some more adventurous things in its other devices that have missed the mark — an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16667508/zte-axon-m-dual-screen-smartphone-review"&gt;early attempt at a dual-screen phone&lt;/a&gt; and the world’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;under-display selfie camera&lt;/a&gt; for starters — the company is playing it straight with the Axon 30 Ultra. The phone is outfitted with cameras aplenty and high-end features, including a top-shelf Snapdragon 888 processor and a large 144Hz fast refresh rate display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAKyR5"&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra’s sub-$800 price tag positions it to undercut the $800 Samsung S21 and $1000 S21 Plus by a little or a lot, depending on which model you’re looking at and how deeply it’s discounted. Buyers in the US should be aware, though — the Axon 30 Ultra will only work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile, not Verizon, and its 5G connectivity is limited to one band (B41) on T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ZenFone 8 review: an Android iPhone mini</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The ZenFone 8 delivers flagship-level build quality and performance in a small package&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4C38dH"&gt;After a couple of generations making phones with flip-out cameras and increasingly large displays, Asus has taken the ZenFone 8 in a totally different direction: small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSrT9H"&gt;The flipping camera concept lives on in the also-new ZenFone 8 Flip, but it’s no longer a standard feature across this year’s ZenFone lineup. Instead, priced at €599 (about $730), the ZenFone 8 lands in the upper-midrange class with a conventional rear camera bump and a much smaller 5.9-inch display. As a side note, final US pricing is TBD — Asus says somewhere between $599 and $799 — but it will be coming to North America, unlike last year’s model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwwRdC"&gt;Rather than an attention-grabbing camera feature, the focus of this design has been to create a smaller phone that’s comfortable to use in one hand, which Asus has done without skimping on processing power or higher-end features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1hmwn"&gt;It’s an Android iPhone mini, and it’s fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u3cT9V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10494874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Go0J86tAcMmzjPPXSpyPncCJlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499353/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus designed the ZenFone 8 with one-handed operation in mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FW7hIJ"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 screen and design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IhH9SM"&gt;The ZenFone 8 may be small, but that hasn’t kept it from offering the latest flagship processor: a Snapdragon 888 chipset, coupled with 6, 8, or 16GB of RAM (my review unit has 16GB). I can’t find fault with this phone’s performance. It feels responsive, animations and interactions are smooth, and it keeps up with demanding use and rapid app switching. This is performance fitting of a flagship device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cElERS"&gt;The display is a 5.9-inch 1080p OLED panel with a fast 120Hz refresh rate that makes routine interactions with the phone — swiping, scrolling, animations — look much more smooth and polished than a standard 60Hz screen or even a 90Hz panel. By default, the phone will automatically switch between 120 / 90 / 60Hz depending on the application to save battery life, but you can manually select any of those three refresh rates if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EFkcZ"&gt;The display’s 20:9 aspect ratio was carefully considered by Asus. The company says it settled on this slightly narrower format so the phone would fit more easily into a pocket, and it does. I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits. More importantly, it fits well inside a jacket pocket and doesn’t feel like it’s going to flop out if I sit down on the floor to tie my shoes. The ZenFone 8 is rated IP68 for dust protection and some water submersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2grdcK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o69ULu"&gt;The front panel is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus and houses an in-display fingerprint sensor, while the back uses Gorilla Glass 3 with a frosted finish that’s on the matte side of the matte / glossy spectrum. The front panel is flat, but the rear features a slight curve on the long edges for an easier fit in the hand. At 169 grams (5.9 ounces), it’s heavy for its size, and it feels surprisingly dense when you first pick it up. The phone’s frame is aluminum, giving the whole package a high-end look and feel. There’s even a headphone jack on the top edge as a treat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8XM4b"&gt;The power button (an exciting shade of blue!) is well-positioned so my right thumb falls on it naturally with the phone in my hand. Same for the in-screen fingerprint sensor: the target appears to be positioned higher on the screen than usual, but that actually puts it within a comfortable reach of my thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w8VC5"&gt;I’ll admit up front that I have a personal bias toward smaller phones, but the ZenFone 8 just feels great in my hand. I’ve spent a lot of time using big devices over the last six months, and I’ve gotten used to it. But the ZenFone 8 is the first device that feels like it was adapted to &lt;em&gt;me,&lt;/em&gt; not something I’ve had to adapt to using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UuUZnwxRe3j921AYa4ifsE1k5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499355/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A smaller phone means a smaller battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kpaymP"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 battery and software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8mbHH8"&gt;The phone’s small size makes a smaller battery a necessity — 4,000mAh in this case, much smaller than the ZenFone 6 and 7’s 5,000mAh. I felt the difference in using this phone versus a battery-for-days budget or midrange phone, but I had no problem getting through a full day of moderate use. I even left Strava running for 20 hours by accident, and the battery still had some life in it the next morning. The ZenFone 8 supports 30W wired charging with the included power adapter, which takes an empty battery to 100 percent in a bit more than an hour. Wireless charging isn’t supported, which makes the ZenFone 8 a bit of an outlier in the flagship class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPNxId"&gt;Asus offers a ton of options to help stretch day-to-day battery life as well as the overall lifespan of your battery. There are no fewer than five battery modes to optimize phone performance or battery longevity on a daily basis, and different charging modes let you set a custom charging limit or stagger charging overnight so it reaches 100 percent around the time of your alarm for better battery health. You won’t find class-leading battery capacity here, but rest assured if you need to stretch the ZenFone 8’s battery, there are plenty of options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kj8abO"&gt;The ZenFone 8 ships with Android 11, and Asus says it will provide “at least” two major OS with security updates for the same timeframe. That’s on the low side of what we’d expect for a flagship phone, especially compared to Apple’s typical four- or five-year support schedule. An important note for US shoppers is that the ZenFone 8 will only work with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s LTE and Sub-6GHz 5G networks; you can’t use this phone on Verizon, and there’s no support for the fast, but extremely limited, millimeter-wave 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctgUaWF69tS9vSVEdPG5w8MwvQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507533/DSC00661_rear.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 offers standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8l2mPu"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MbIlch"&gt;There are just two cameras on the ZenFone 8’s rear camera bump, and they are both worth your time. Rather than cram in a depth sensor, macro, or some monochrome nonsense, Asus just went with a 64-megapixel main camera with OIS and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. They’re borrowed from last year’s model, minus a telephoto camera and the flipping mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5utE4G"&gt;As in the ZenFone 7 Pro, the 8’s main camera produces 16-megapixel images with vibrant color and plenty of detail in good light. Images can lean a little too far into unnatural-looking territory, and some high-contrast scenes look a little too HDR-y for my liking. But overall, this camera does fine: it handles moderately low-light conditions like a dim store interior well, and Night Mode does an okay job in very low light, provided you can hold the phone still for a few seconds and your subject isn’t moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bFBXWG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10494947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xx4klZ"&gt;A skin-smoothing beauty mode is on by default when you use portrait mode, and it is not good. Skin looks over-smoothed, unnaturally flat, and brightened, like your subject is wearing a couple of layers of stage makeup. Turning this off improves things significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBkFNw"&gt;The ultrawide camera also turns in good performance. Asus calls it a “flagship” grade sensor, and while that might have been true in 2018, it’s at least a step up from the smaller, cheaper sensors often found in ultrawide cameras. Likewise, the front-facing 12-megapixel camera does fine. Beauty mode is turned off by default when you switch to the selfie camera, and thank goodness for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maIBzp"&gt;There’s no telephoto camera here, just digital zoom. On the camera shooting screen, there’s an icon to jump to a 2x 16-megapixel “lossless” digital zoom to crop in quickly, which works okay, but it isn’t much reach, and it just makes the limitations of the small sensor and lens more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wAwwx"&gt;On the whole, the camera system is good but not great. The lack of true optical zoom or a telephoto camera is a disappointment, but you can’t have everything on such a small device, and I’d personally take an ultrawide before a telephoto any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2yyJwz2m9mIkB8t4cUpzDgDLbuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499354/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 doesn’t sacrifice a flagship experience to achieve its small form factor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZDiMQY"&gt;The ZenFone 8 fills a void in the Android market for a full-specced, small-sized device. The Google Pixel 4A is around the same size, but it’s decidedly a budget device with a step-down processor, plastic chassis, and fewer niceties like an IP rating or a fast-refresh screen. Aside from battery life, which is manageable, you give up very little in the way of flagship features to get the ZenFone 8’s small form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzbIbh"&gt;You have to look to iOS for this phone’s most direct competition: the iPhone 12 mini, which it matches almost spec-for-spec from the IP rating down to the camera configuration. The 12 mini is actually a little smaller than the ZenFone 8, and when you factor in storage capacity, it’s likely to be the more expensive choice at $829 for 256GB. However, when you consider that the 12 mini will probably get a couple more years of OS and security support, it may be the better buy in the long run, if you’re flexible in your choice of operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jc0CEI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEL2JQ"&gt;I like the ZenFone 8 a lot, but I’m not sure it’ll find a big audience, at least in the US. Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;having trouble selling the iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, and if there’s one thing Apple is good at, it’s selling phones to US customers. As much as I hate to entertain the idea, maybe we’ve gotten used to giant phones. I love how the ZenFone 8 feels in my hand and in my pocket, but I do notice how much smaller the screen and everything on it seems compared to the bigger phones I’ve used recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Etfrj"&gt;There are also a few important considerations, like the lack of compatibility with Verizon and the comparatively short support lifespan of the phone. If you need the absolute best in battery life the ZenFone 8 can’t offer that, and if you want a class-leading camera, you’ll need to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OIO7v3"&gt;All that said, the ZenFone 8 will be the right fit for a specific type of person, and I can heartily recommend it to my fellow small phone fans. You’ll get flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The T-Mobile / Sprint merger hasn’t created jobs — it’s ended them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0jsesPQ0YdAAwvd6TmSd7bniQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69271585/acasatro_180430_1777_sprint_Tmobile_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="84BbK6"&gt;T-Mobile promised its $26 billion merger with Sprint would add new jobs to the economy literally every single day, but a report from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobiles-hiring-pledge-is-off-to-a-slow-start-11620639002"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;confirms the newly combined company actually employs fewer people now than it did before the merger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkS7F9"&gt;Here’s how specific &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fnew-t-mobile-creating-jobs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F11%2F22429587%2Ft-mobile-sprint-merge-jobs-promise-pandemic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile’s promise was&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NkdxSM"&gt;So, let me be really clear on this increasingly important topic. &lt;strong&gt;This merger is all about creating new, high-quality, high-paying jobs, and the New T-Mobile will be jobs-positive from Day One and every day thereafter.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s not just a promise. That’s not just a commitment. It’s a fact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ny04YG"&gt;“Jobs-positive” would not be how I’d describe T-Mobile’s employment practices. The company employed 5,000 fewer people by the end of 2020 than it did before the merger, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; writes. And before you blame the COVID-19 pandemic, you should know that  wireless executives who spoke to &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; said that shrinking the number of jobs was always part of the plan — the pandemic just sped up planned &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/coronavirus-retail-workforce-faces-permanent-decline.html"&gt;job loss on the retail side&lt;/a&gt; of T-Mobile’s business. In fact, T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293293/tmobile-sprint-merger-layoffs-hundreds-biso-jobs-cut"&gt;laid off hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of Sprint’s inside sales team just a few months after its merger was completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqaabC"&gt;In addition to the “jobs-positive from day one and every day thereafter” claim, which now appears to have been a blatant lie, T-Mobile also specifically promised it would add 11,000 jobs by 2024. Instead, it appears to be moving in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYQ9p5"&gt;We were warned this would happen. &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-sprint-t-mobile-merger-jobs-20171010-story.html"&gt;Wall Street analysts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/sprint-t-mobile-merger-could-lead-thousands-job-losses-despite-n1134956"&gt;labor unions&lt;/a&gt; both predicted anywhere between 24,000 to 30,000 jobs could be lost if T-Mobile and Sprint got what they wanted. Telecom industry watcher Karl Bode wrote multiple articles for &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;highlighting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634195/t-mobile-sprint-merger-conditions-access-coverage"&gt;how meaningless&lt;/a&gt; the merger promises looked, comparing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962739/t-mobile-sprint-nextel-merger-prices-rural-coverage-promises"&gt;Sprint’s own history&lt;/a&gt; of post-merger layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v096vD"&gt;For some context, when Sprint was given the go-ahead to merge with Nextel in 2005, it made its own claims about how great its merger would be for the economy. Bode writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Lg96K1"&gt;Government filings had promised the FCC that the deal would “generate economic growth and jobs in the United States.” Then-Sprint CEO Gary Forsee told media outlets in 2005 that employees “shouldn’t expect to see a headline that there’s thousands of jobs that are going to be cut on the first of November or any time along the way.” By the end, more than 8,000 employees would lose their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OTOPMm"&gt;Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xre29K"&gt;T-Mobile’s other merger obligations, like helping Dish become a viable fourth carrier option, also seem like they might just be talk. Dish CEO Charlie Ergen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;recently told the FCC&lt;/a&gt; that if T-Mobile moves forward with its plans to shut down its older 3G CDMA network, Dish’s Boost Mobile customers (who rely on Sprint’s network for service) would be greatly harmed. Ergen stresses that for customers who need the less expensive phone plans Boost provides, upgrading to a 4G or 5G-capable phone isn’t a small expense — it could force some people to go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AeidX3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dish chairman calls T-Mobile the ‘Grinch’ for going back on merger promises","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5zarQA"&gt;As far as jobs are concerned, current T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert does tell the J&lt;em&gt;ournal&lt;/em&gt; that the company plans to fill 6,000 open positions as the world recovers from the pandemic. That might possibly bring T-Mobile/Sprint back up to its pre-merger numbers, but it’s now even harder to believe the company will add an additional 11,000 jobs by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo Find X3 Pro review: the Chinese phone to beat</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A legit flagship from one of China’s biggest brands&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hCylNm"&gt;You might know of Oppo as a company opaquely related to OnePlus, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318941/china-smartphone-market-share-oppo-huawei-vivo-apple-xiaomi-january-2021"&gt;recently became&lt;/a&gt; the leading smartphone maker in China — the beneficiary of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634046/huawei-donald-trump-us-trade-war-china-android-google-ban-5g-future"&gt;Huawei’s sanctions-induced&lt;/a&gt; slide in sales even in its home market. As such, the new Find X3 Pro flagship is an important handset for the company, presenting an opportunity to solidify its place as a major player in premium smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe1vfL"&gt;And this time around, Oppo isn’t keeping the Find X3 Pro in China. The company still doesn’t sell phones in the US, but there are international models with Google services available in countries like the UK, where it starts at £1,099 (about $1,500). If you have the option and you’re shopping for a high-end phone, it’s worth checking out, because this is one of the sleekest Android devices you’ll see this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vbGf9R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10474436"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SqUTec"&gt;From the front, the Find X3 Pro looks almost identical to the OnePlus 9 Pro. Both phones have a 6.7-inch 1440p 120Hz curved OLED screen with a hole-punch selfie camera in the top left; since Oppo and OnePlus share a supply chain, it’s almost certainly the same Samsung panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwM1hp"&gt;Turn the Find X3 Pro around, though, and it looks nothing like the OnePlus — or any other phone, really. The camera bump is somewhat reminiscent of the iPhone 12 Pro in its arrangement of three lenses within a rounded square, but the bump is part of a single piece of glass that smoothly rises up to accommodate the cameras. Coupled with the mirrored finish, it makes the phone look like something out of &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2&lt;/em&gt; — at least until you get your fingerprints all over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tBaLV"&gt;The Find X3 Pro feels relatively light and thin for a 2021 flagship phone, at 193g and 8.3mm thick, and the total lack of sharp edges anywhere on the device makes it very comfortable to hold. I’ve also been using it with an included Kevlar-style case that preserves almost all of the device’s thinness, which is a relief because this is one phone I would not want to risk dropping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkuPUXSiVmuGJfavu3V4-IpOqRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480715/DSCF7701.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Find X3 Pro has a microscope camera with a built-in ring light.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Z2Gh2Q"&gt;Like the OnePlus 9 Pro, the Find X3 Pro has a very good screen. However, Oppo is aiming to differentiate it with what it describes as the first full-path 10-bit color management system for Android, allowing you to capture and view more than a billion colors as opposed to the 16.7 million on other devices. The Find X3 Pro software even includes eye tests to help the display compensate for various forms of color blindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCcIZw"&gt;I haven’t been able to see a huge difference between this and other displays in general use, but we don’t yet live in a 10-bit world. In all likelihood, you’ll only ever make use of this capability by creating your own content with the Find X3 Pro’s cameras, and even then the advantage is going to seem niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrn53l"&gt;As for the cameras themselves, the Find X3 Pro has a respectable array of hardware. The heart of the system is two identical 50-megapixel Sony IMX 766 sensors for the main camera and the ultrawide; it’s not the biggest sensor out there, but it more than holds its own against flagship competitors. Oppo’s color tuning and HDR grading is relatively restrained, and it’s both unusual and refreshing to have an ultrawide that performs just as well in terms of resolution and dynamic range as the primary camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sample photo from the Find X3 Pro’s main camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5aI06HOVYn0d5jeHOo-9aJQ0TgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480719/IMG20210318202038_20210430172632.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sample photo from the Find X3 Pro’s main camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YNZb5B5TzKbuQ9qxqjMeFurwGG4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480720/IMG20210327170502_20210430172525.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sample photo from the Find X3 Pro’s ultrawide camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pU_Y7-9HrZ2N760iQBcaUAH4lyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480722/IMG20210319175637_20210430172609.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sample photo from the Find X3 Pro’s main camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHM8YDwiNbTn088S1Ugo13J2Xco=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480731/IMG20210306175021_20210430180033.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RuAbNM"&gt;There’s also a 13-megapixel 2x telephoto camera, which doesn’t match the other cameras’ performance. This is a little disappointing from Oppo, which did more than any other company to popularize periscope telephoto cameras. Granted, zoom lenses are never the best-quality optics on a smartphone, but this feels like a step back from the 5x unit on last year’s Find X2 Pro. You could make the case that a 2x zoom is more versatile because it improves the quality of shots between 2x to 4.9x, but why not include both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxcT13"&gt;I can ask the “why not both” question with a reasonable degree of fairness because Oppo chose to allocate a large section of the camera bump to a bizarre microscope tool. The three-megapixel sensor has a lens in front of it that Oppo says is capable of up to 60x magnification, and there’s even a ring light around the glass to illuminate subjects that would otherwise be obscured by the phone’s shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3c3eH"&gt;Is this cool? Admittedly, yes. It’s quite difficult to get subjects in full focus because of the extremely shallow depth of field, but you can absolutely capture ethereal images unlike anything you’ve ever seen from a smartphone by holding the Find X3 Pro up to threads, food, or OLED screens. But is it useful? Perhaps this is a failure of imagination on my part, but I think I’d take the periscope zoom. If you can think of a ton of reasons you might want a microscope-class camera on a phone, by all means enjoy this one.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A desk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lJRwTJ"&gt;The Find X3 Pro’s overall performance is as good as you’d expect from any other Snapdragon 888-equipped flagship. Oppo’s ColorOS skin is far snappier than it used to be, to the point that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344054/oneplus-9-oppo-coloros-in-china-hydrogenos"&gt;OnePlus itself is using it for phones in China now&lt;/a&gt;. The 4,500mAh battery doesn’t quite make this a two-day phone, but I never had any problem getting through a single day of heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUwrvF"&gt;Battery life is helped by the fact that Oppo has finally put wireless charging on a flagship phone. This was by far my biggest complaint about its predecessor — it might not be a big deal for everyone, but if you’re used to wireless charging, the lack of it is absolutely a dealbreaker. Oppo’s 30W wireless system can supposedly charge the Find X3 Pro to 100 percent in 80 minutes, though I don’t have the necessary proprietary charger to test that. The wired charger, meanwhile, is 65W and gets you a 40-percent charge in ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p7RQsYsmJliIP3hSNQ3WVIpnCP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480716/DSCF7705.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Find X3 Pro looks very similar to the OnePlus 9 Pro from the front.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7BcYva"&gt;It sounds minor, but the addition of wireless charging is really all I needed to be happy with the Find X3 Pro as an everyday phone. I’ve been using it daily for about six weeks now, and I have very few complaints. I could’ve done without the microscope camera, sure, but Oppo is now as capable as any other Android manufacturer at turning in legitimately premium, performant phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItR0Wa"&gt;Don’t think you’ll get it at the sort of brand discount that OnePlus made its name with, though. The Find X3 Pro’s starting price in the UK is just £50 less than Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra. I think the Find X3 Pro is a reasonable competitor to that device, but I can’t see too many people picking it over the larger and more trusted brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sqFIOO"&gt;Still, the Find X3 Pro is an excellent device on merit, and further cements Oppo as a company worth paying attention to. This shouldn’t be surprising, of course, but the best phone from one of China’s biggest players is one of the best phones you’ll find anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple invests another $45 million in Gorilla Glass maker Corning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j4n_Ay95t5IS-URje6SNzqrAFuA=/11x0:1949x1292/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69261932/Apple_awards_Corning_an_additional_45_million_dollars_team_member_051021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corning manufactures glass for Apple and many Android device makers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PU0nfd"&gt;Apple is awarding Corning another $45 million investment from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund, in addition to the $450 million it’s already given to the US-based company over the past four years. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-awards-corning-45-million-from-its-advanced-manufacturing-fund%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428372%2Fapple-corning-45-million-investment-gorilla-glass-ceramic-shield-foldable-bendable-glass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the investment will “expand Corning’s manufacturing capacity in the US and drive research and development into innovative new technologies that support durability and long-lasting product life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFS5I0"&gt;Corning provides glass for a variety of Apple products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. The two companies have a history &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687299/plastic-iphone-gorilla-glass-origin-story-steve-jobs"&gt;dating back to the original iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, they collaborated on the iPhone 12 lineup’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509008/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-mini-displays-ceramic-hardened"&gt;Ceramic Shield technology&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple claims is “tougher than any smartphone glass” and makes its latest flagships four times more resistant to damage from drops. As well as Apple, Corning’s Gorilla Glass is used in phones from &lt;a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/products-with-gorilla-glass/smartphones.html"&gt;countless Android manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; including Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uh0Yrf1t9rpNe1vgj3Ofrwsth9I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19729421/corning_4k_bendable_glass.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corning’s ultra-thin glass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VmUHFo"&gt;Apple doesn’t say exactly how Corning will use the $45 million investment, but its timing coincides with &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/02/kuo-8-inch-foldable-iphone-2023/"&gt;recent reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple could launch a foldable iPhone in 2023. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251328/apple-corning-foldable-display-gorilla-glass-bendable-smartphone"&gt;Back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; we heard Corning was developing a bendable version of its glass, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;last February&lt;/a&gt; the company said it expects devices using the technology to reach the market in 12 to 18 months. If it works, the glass could allow for durable foldable smartphones that don’t require a layer of plastic protection used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/16/21139897/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-ultra-thin-glass-durability-scratch-test-jerryrigeverything"&gt;Samsung’s latest foldables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvSteK"&gt;“Today, when you buy a phone with Gorilla Glass, you’re touching glass … that’s what we’re working towards,” Corning said of its ambitions for bendable glass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g9t7Zt"&gt;Vivo’s upcoming X-series flagship phones will receive three years of Android OS upgrades and security updates, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vivo-commits-to-three-years-of-android-upgrades-for-future-premium-x-series-devices-301286977.html"&gt;the company announ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vivo-commits-to-three-years-of-android-upgrades-for-future-premium-x-series-devices-301286977.html#:~:text=SHENZHEN%2C%20China%2C%20May%209%2C,models%20launching%20after%20July%202021"&gt;ced today&lt;/a&gt;. The policy will come into force for phones launched after July 2021 in Europe, Australia, and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDdCFX"&gt;“We are making a promise to our customers that they will be able to enjoy a premium smartphone experience for an extended period and continue to benefit from the latest software features,” Vivo’s CTO and senior vice president Yujian Shi said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGBMwn"&gt;With today’s announcement, Vivo is joining a small but growing group of Android manufacturers promising three years of OS updates for their flagship smartphones. Google has long had a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en-GB#:~:text=pixel%20phones%20get%20android%20version%20updates%20for%20at%20least%203%20years%20from%20when%20the%20device%20first%20became%20available%20on%20the%20google%20store"&gt;similar policy for its Pixel phones&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;Samsung announced&lt;/a&gt; a “three generation” OS policy covering some Galaxy devices, joined by HMD in April with a promise of two years of Android OS updates and three years of security updates on its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22371937/hmd-nokia-x20-x10-g20-g10-c20-c10-android-phones-release-date-news-features"&gt;X-series phones&lt;/a&gt;. Even LG said it would offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22373088/lg-android-update-three-year-pledge-after-leaving-mobile-business"&gt;three years of Android OS updates&lt;/a&gt; the same week it announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22373088/lg-android-update-three-year-pledge-after-leaving-mobile-business"&gt;exiting the smartphone business&lt;/a&gt;. This year, Samsung added that select devices would also get an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;additional year of security updates&lt;/a&gt;, for a total of four years of support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xogXxg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A premium smartphone experience for an extended period”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bXcng6"&gt;Three years of OS updates is a big improvement over the two years that’s previously been the standard for most Android manufacturers, but in the future this could extend to as much as four years. Last December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22178833/google-qualcomm-snapdragon-888-faster-android-updates-four-years"&gt;Google and chip manufacturer Qualcomm announced&lt;/a&gt; they were working to make it easier for manufacturers to offer as much as four generations of Android OS and security updates, starting with devices equipped with Qualcomm’s latest flagship processor, the Snapdragon 888.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSsGwB"&gt;Vivo’s new policy puts it ahead of fellow BBK Electronics smartphone brands OnePlus and Oppo. &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-software-maintenance-schedule.862347/"&gt;As of 2018&lt;/a&gt;, OnePlus’s official policy has been to offer two years of Android version upgrades and three years of security updates. Meanwhile, the most recent statement we could find from Oppo (&lt;a href="https://ausdroid.net/2021/03/22/oppo-find-x3-series-buyers-promised-at-least-2-years-security-updates-and-2-new-android-versions/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;AusDroid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says the company offers two years of security updates, and that it’s general policy is to offer two generations of Android OS updates. Today’s announcement will undoubtedly create pressure on Oppo and OnePlus to follow Vivo’s example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmyzZg"&gt;These figures pale in comparison to Apple’s update history. Last year it released the latest version of iOS, version 14, on devices as old as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fuk%2Fios%2Fios-14%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DPlus-%2Ciphone%25206s%2C-iPhone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428342%2Fvivo-android-updates-three-years-x-series-phones-july-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2015’s iPhone 6S&lt;/a&gt;, the fifth major update to have come to the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnJYJm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE Blade 11 Prime review: wireless charging for under $200</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re already invested in a wireless charging lifestyle, the Blade 11 Prime is a budget phone to match it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FhlERh"&gt;The ZTE Blade 11 Prime offers one standout feature in a field of largely similar sub-$200 phones: wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCrkxr"&gt;In the smartphone trickle-down economy, wireless charging is basically guaranteed on any flagship-level phone, but it’s still hit-and-miss among midrange phones and all but absent from the budget class. You’re much more likely to find a really big battery on a sub-$200 phone than wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvbdFz"&gt;Outside of that feature, the $192 Blade 11 Prime’s specs are much the same as competing models like the Galaxy A12 and Moto G Play. Like those models, it offers a 6.5-inch 720p LCD, though it includes a little more RAM (4GB compared to 3GB) and a little less battery capacity (4,000mAh compared to 5,000mAh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4iWF3f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10488560"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tNoWZ2"&gt;Choosing a phone that’s priced under $500 means you need to pick your priorities carefully, and that’s even more true of a $200 phone. If wireless charging is your chosen priority, then I have good news: the ZTE Blade 11 Prime is the budget-priced phone for you. If it’s not a major priority and more of a nice-to-have item, then I’d suggest looking elsewhere. You won’t do a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; better on any individual feature, like a better screen or camera, but you can do a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H7aGzfYqtO3jDkBBbJVlrwVscPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499384/DSC00618.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blade 11 Prime supports the Qi wireless charging standard at 5W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZXqSGm"&gt;ZTE Blade 11 Prime screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0RE5qQ"&gt;The Blade 11 Prime is on the bigger side with a 6.5-inch display. Its 720p resolution is stretched a little thin here, and you’ll notice certain images looking a little pixelated if you look closely. The screen gets nice and bright, but its auto-brightness setting kept bringing the level down a little too dim for my liking. I also noticed faint repeating vertical lines on dark parts of the screen indicative of a low-quality panel — not a huge distraction but visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCGzys"&gt;It doesn’t have the biggest battery in its class, but the Blade 11’s battery performance is generally good anyway. I got about two days of light, mostly Wi-Fi use on a single charge. Spending a full day out and about on LTE would drain the battery faster, but most people could expect to get through at least a full day of heavy use before needing to charge up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lA0FtC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Blade 11 Prime’s marquee feature, wireless charging, works well if a little slowly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="84Tx3H"&gt;The Blade 11 Prime’s marquee feature, wireless charging, works well if a little slowly; the phone supports Qi charging at 5W. Taking it from 50 percent to a full charge took almost exactly two hours, during which the phone got warm but not worryingly so. As long as you don’t expect incredible speeds, wireless charging is a convenient option on the Blade 11 Prime, particularly if you’re the type of person who charges your phone overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFG6iS"&gt;We don’t expect dazzling processing speed from a $200 phone, but the ZTE Blade 11 Prime falls a little short even considering its price. It uses a MediaTek MT6762 Helio P22 chipset with a relatively healthy 4GB of RAM, but this combination struggles with even light tasks like scrolling through Instagram or Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XvFtlB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There was significant stuttering and hesitation just browsing my usual social media timelines&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SSJlfT"&gt;Apps open quickly enough, but there was significant stuttering and hesitation just browsing my usual social media timelines or scrolling through the home screen app drawer. Some slowness is expected in this price bracket, but I didn’t see as much consistent stuttering using the Motorola Moto G Play recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyYQzw"&gt;The ZTE Blade 11 Prime ships with Android 11, which is nice — some of its slightly less recent competitors are still on 10 waiting for an update. ZTE says there’s no plan to offer any additional Android OS upgrades, only that it will offer security patches as needed. That’s not too surprising given the phone’s price point; the Blade 11 Prime just isn’t built for longevity past a couple of years of use. There’s also 64GB of built-in storage, which isn’t a lot. If you don’t download too many apps or store too many photos on your device, you’ll be able to get by, otherwise adding a microSD card for additional storage to your purchase is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZCrwittUPuG9PycMvyuvK3xxNJ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499278/ajohnson_20210503_4571_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Camera hardware is modest: on the rear panel, you’ll find a 16-megapixel main and 8-megapixel ultrawide camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LNR8HQ"&gt;ZTE Blade 11 Prime camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3ytKxp"&gt;The rear camera system on the Blade 11 Prime includes a 16-megapixel main camera and an 8-megapixel ultrawide, plus a 2-megapixel depth sensor. It’s a basic setup, and it does fine in good lighting conditions. It’s a little more prone to clipping very bright spots in photos than other systems I’ve used recently, but it does a nice job overall with exposures of high-contrast scenes. In moderate indoor lighting, some detail-smoothing noise reduction is visible, and low-light photos look smeary even at the reduced image sizes used for social sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hslgFB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10488604"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QZ7zW0"&gt;As for the other cameras, they’re just fine. The ultrawide doesn’t handle high-contrast scenes as well as the main camera, with some noticeable noise appearing in shadows. There’s also a short delay after pressing the shutter button before you can take another photo that isn’t present when using the main camera. The selfie camera thankfully avoids over-smoothing faces, and photos look good as long as there’s plenty of available light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wIM3M88y4fLAFcJpaUPhyJED2Gc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499279/ajohnson_20210503_4571_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you aren’t already a wireless charging devotee, it would be best to look elsewhere in the budget phone class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="GHIFo6"&gt;If your budget is strict and wireless charging is a must-have, then the ZTE Blade 11 Prime is the right phone for you. But if you can make do without wireless charging, I’d strongly encourage you to look elsewhere. Iffy performance with basic tasks will be more of an inconvenience in the long run than having to plug in your phone every night to charge it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BrrNaH"&gt;This year’s Motorola Moto G Power would be a worthwhile alternative if you can spend a little more; you’ll get a faster processor and better battery life, though you should definitely plan on buying a microSD card to supplement its meager 32GB of storage. The G Play is a good alternative, too, even with a processor that’s a bit slower than the G Power’s.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and T-Mobile want your business more than ever right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tTzrv5sYQQxZijH2KvfJrbK-GNg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69253302/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;US telecom companies are braced for expensive changes in the coming years — and by extension, so are the rest of us.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Expect generous promotions and shiny new plans as the expensive 5G buildout continues&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PCj6nX"&gt;It’s a good year for old, crappy phones. The dusty old phone in your desk drawer running Android frozen-dessert-something-or-other — the one that might have a cracked screen — saw its stock go up recently with two generous trade-in promotions. T-Mobile and Verizon are both offering to take your old, damaged phone off your hands and replace it with a shiny new 5G model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUwvCI"&gt;There are a couple of reasons for this generosity. Verizon, in particular, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;written some big checks&lt;/a&gt; to pay for new C-band frequencies — highly desirable spectrum for 5G that offers good range and speed. The company has reassured its shareholders that the hefty expenditure will help grow its customer base and increase the amount of money it makes on existing accounts. It told investors at its March analyst event that “with C-band included, we think step-ups to premium [plans] will only accelerate.” So it’s unsurprising that the cracked phone deal requires a commitment to a “select unlimited plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="U0WiyG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That free 5G phone is just the start of what the carrier hopes will be a long, lucrative relationship&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ByLkC"&gt;Meanwhile, T-Mobile wants to make the most of a relatively strong hand right now. It has taken every opportunity possible to declare itself the “leader in 5G” and is likewise focused on reaching new customers, getting a 5G device in their hands, and getting them hooked on its 5G network. T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert talked up the success of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;new Magenta Max plan&lt;/a&gt; — an unlimited plan that doesn’t impose slowdowns after you reach a certain monthly data threshold — on the company’s first quarter earnings call as a kind of “if you build it, they will come” moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhtIFy"&gt;Customers on the plan use 70 percent more data than a typical LTE customer, and Sievert says they’re using their 5G data connection in situations when they might otherwise have looked for a public Wi-Fi network to join. “When you give somebody a true unlimited plan on a 5G phone that’s screaming fast on the biggest and best 5G network in this country, they use it.” That free 5G phone is just the start of what the carrier hopes will be a long and, ultimately, lucrative relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WzcTYa"&gt;Outside of those two companies, US wireless carriers across the board are braced for big changes this year — the impact of which will be felt by the rest of us in one way or another. The beginning of the year saw telecom companies on the upswing compared to last year’s tumultuous first quarter, with most adding more customers than they did in this quarter last year. T-Mobile gained a net of 773,000 postpaid phone customers, and AT&amp;amp;T added 595,000, its highest number in 10 years. Across the industry, companies felt the positive impacts of retail stores reopening to welcome customers with stimulus checks ready to spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OPuCJp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies felt the positive impacts of retail stores reopening to customers with stimulus checks to spend&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VHnP2f"&gt;While they’re in a better spot than they were when the country started shutting down this time a year ago, there are major hurdles to overcome in the near future. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, in particular, have a major project ahead of them in getting ready to deploy that newly won C-band — a costly venture on top of what they owe the federal government for the licenses. C-band is particularly important to those two companies, which are gambling on it to breathe life into their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;struggling nationwide 5G networks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYBUA3"&gt;Verizon is wasting no time; having pledged to spend $10 billion over the next three years on C-band deployment, it’s on track to spend between $2 and 3 billion by the end of the year and says it’s already ordered half of the equipment it will need. AT&amp;amp;T, meanwhile, is proceeding with a more cautious outlook, citing uncertainties around stressed global supply chains, and that other auctions this year could help fill out the company’s spectrum portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PTDKZZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon has pledged to spend $10 billion over the next three years on C-band deployment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kuENHA"&gt;Meanwhile, this is all the more motivation for T-Mobile to push aggressively for more subscribers now while the other players catch up to its relatively strong position in spectrum holdings. The company &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2021/T-Mobile-Raises-2021-Guidance-as-Network-Leadership-Fuels-Industry-Leading-Growth-with-Strong-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;raised its investor guidance&lt;/a&gt; and now expects to add a net of between 4.4 and 4.9 million postpaid customers this year, up from 4.0 to 4.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVc1pi"&gt;There’s another storm on the horizon, too, one that could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of wireless customers: T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;impending shutdown of its old CDMA network&lt;/a&gt;, which a large number of Boost Mobile (owned now by Dish) customers rely on. Dish says that T-Mobile is moving ahead with the shutdown much earlier than it said it would as an anti-competitive tactic, and Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen’s cries of foul play have gotten more dire in recent weeks, more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;calling Sievert a “Magenta Grinch.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J6oc8R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen’s cries of foul play have gotten more dire in recent weeks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x1rBXS"&gt;The company has also asked the California Public Utilities Commission to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-california-regulators-t-mobile-inquiry-reopen-9d87c61c-8349-440c-97eb-8cde807ba9bf.html"&gt;reopen the Sprint / T-Mobile merger case&lt;/a&gt;, and it has appealed to Capitol Hill lawmakers to review the situation. If the shutdown goes ahead as currently planned, lots of Boost Mobile customers will be shopping for a new phone soon — and potentially even a new wireless provider, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0ectx"&gt;So what’s next? For one, we can expect the aggressive play for new customers to continue, along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"&gt;dull roar of the 5G Hype Machine&lt;/a&gt; we’re all tired of hearing by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6ScUNY"&gt;In addition to the device offers, your carrier might try to upsell you to one of those premium unlimited plans if you do upgrade to a 5G device. Verizon is committed to those customer “step-ups,” and Sievert hinted that more Magenta Max-type offerings may be on the way, saying the plan is “only the beginning.” So if you do decide to dust off that old phone and turn it in for a new device this year, more power to you — might as well put an old piece of tech to work for you. Just be sure to take a good look at the fine print on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="oe9ohF"&gt;TikTok &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/share-sounds-and-login-with-tiktok-through-all-new-developer-kits"&gt;announced two new integrations&lt;/a&gt; for its app on Thursday: sharing audio back into TikTok using the new Sound Kit, and using your TikTok account to log in to other apps with Login Kit. Developers can apply to use the new SDKs to insert the short-form video app’s content in even more places, but they may open the company and its users to new privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00nlu6"&gt;The basic features of Login Kit will sound familiar. Facebook, Twitter, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17407334/snapchat-snapkit-ar-camera-developer-kit-login-platform"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; already offer similar integrations to speed up the logging in process. Like those other versions, TikTok says that using Login Kit will allow users to securely log in to other apps, but also let developers offer TikTok content inside those apps, like adding videos to a dating profile. Using Login with TikTok also requires you to allow whatever app you’re using to view your public profile and videos in order to work but doesn’t currently extend to the other information TikTok may know about you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6NmS6t"&gt;Logging in with another social media account is convenient, but it comes with some baggage. Facebook in particular has been criticized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17148726/facebook-developer-data-crackdown-cambridge-analytica"&gt;for the data that gets collected with Facebook Login&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of the sources of information at the center of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal"&gt;the Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok has also been scrutinized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322612/tiktok-security-china-bytedance-spying-app-privacy"&gt;for its surveillance potential&lt;/a&gt; and a previous version of the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304228/tiktok-security-ios-clipboard-access-ios14-beta-feature"&gt;that accessed users’ clipboards&lt;/a&gt;. In regards to Login Kit, TikTok says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="DygHs5"&gt;Similar to other platforms’ SDKs, the only data TikTok can collect through Login Kit is the app’s name and associated events on our platform (i.e. event tracking for logins and authorizations). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPKDn8QP2PUwWgn955ye0MWrKww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496321/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_9.15.19_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sharing audio from outside apps to TikTok using Sound Kit and Login Kit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TnbfNe"&gt;One of the things that makes TikTok so compelling is all of the music it licenses for use in videos. With Sound Kit, that library of music could theoretically become even bigger, without TikTok having to strike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21546323/tiktok-sony-music-licensing-deal-labels-app"&gt;new deals with the big music labels&lt;/a&gt;. Sound Kit allows developers to share audio between their apps and TikTok, so if you make a particularly great mix in one app, you can start using it in your videos. To enable audio sharing, developers will have to integrate Login Kit and the accompanying permissions into their apps as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O52i0L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok’s audio library could grow even larger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ocNuEr"&gt;Developers have to apply to use TikTok’s tools and SDKs and abide by the company’s guidelines, but it’s easy to imagine some potentially sketchy use cases for Sound Kit, like sharing audio without a creator’s permission or pirating music. TikTok says the sounds shared through Sound Kit are treated like any other kind of audio on the platform. Audio clips can either be private or publicly shareable, and TikTok says&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CUlOI6"&gt;When a sound is shared to TikTok, we scan it for attribution to ensure it is original audio - if it’s identified as professionally generated content we label it as such in the music detail page &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9XFJf5"&gt;TikTok’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tiktok"&gt;already incredibly popular&lt;/a&gt; just by being a social media app with great video tools, but SDKs like Login Kit and Sound Kit show the app is maturing. With the new SDKs, there’s an even greater possibility TikTok’s features could become as ubiquitous as embedding a Tweet or sharing your Facebook friends list. &lt;/p&gt;
