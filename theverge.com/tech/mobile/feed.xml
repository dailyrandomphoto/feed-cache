    <title>Bond film delays are reportedly causing product placement havoc for brands</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qvjb3ZQpmF0-RPwdzmuf2X3Js8Q=/0x0:893x595/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68726980/gsmarena_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image featuring Daniel Craig using an HMD device.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD Global&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0IsE2s"&gt;The latest James Bond movie’s pandemic-related delays are reportedly causing problems for its marketing deals, with advertisers concerned that the film may end up featuring outdated product placements, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/13847637/james-bond-re-shoots-product-placement-deals/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The 25th Bond film, &lt;em&gt;No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt;, is currently due to release in cinemas on October 8th, over a year after it was originally meant to release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAJpek"&gt;“Some of those things were the very latest models back when they started filming” a source told &lt;em&gt;The Sun, &lt;/em&gt;“but by the time the movie comes out now it will look like Daniel Craig and all of the other cast members are carrying something that has been out for ages. That isn’t really the point of these deals.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2JULk"&gt;Although the film will reportedly feature Omega watches, Bollinger champagne, and Adidas footwear, it seems likely that HMD Global’s Nokia phones are at risk of dating most quickly. HMD Global announced last year that the film &lt;a href="https://www.hmdglobal.com/press-releases/one-epic-shoot"&gt;would include its Nokia 8.3 5G&lt;/a&gt; from last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/no-time-to-dies-lashana-lynch-discusses-her-key-role-in-the-new-bond-movie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the film is also set to include the Nokia 7.2, which was first released in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TxVBgJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMQ7JEk-Ydw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uQsdlE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; reports that the movie could face reshoots to hide its outdated products, and quotes a source as saying that some scenes may be “carefully edited.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNPAB1"&gt;“The big tech firms want the stars to have all the new up-and-coming products to help promote them and sell them to fans,” the source tells &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;. “It means some of the scenes are going to have to be very carefully edited and looked at to bring things up to date.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uz1wHN"&gt;We may have already seen an example of this kind of editing at work. Although one of the film’s stars, Lashana Lynch, appears to be using a Nokia 8.3 5G in the ad above (note the camera flash to the left of the array), a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM3kPYj_Grw"&gt;previous version released in March 2020&lt;/a&gt; seems to feature a Nokia 5.3, complete with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and headphone jack on the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An ad released in March 2020 appears to show a Nokia 5.3 with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O862jl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt; was originally due to release in April 2020 but was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164789/james-bond-no-time-to-die-movie-delayed-coronavirus"&gt;delayed to November&lt;/a&gt; last year after the pandemic forced cinemas around the world to close. The film was subsequently delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499362/james-bond-no-time-to-die-delay-april-2021"&gt;to April 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243496/bond-uncharted-ghostbusters-movie-delays"&gt;then to October 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Provided no more delays happen, the movie is currently slated to release around a year and a half after its original planned debut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q3GDv"&gt;Thankfully for HMD, there’s at least one phone in the film that’s unlikely to date too much. &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/no-time-to-dies-lashana-lynch-discusses-her-key-role-in-the-new-bond-movie"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt; will also feature a classic Nokia 3310, a phone that originally released way back in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVCS6p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra is first with new power efficient OLED display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X05E1VQO6Wexse-pPTai86o76kU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68726594/vpavic_210118_4377_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jQ5yMC"&gt;Samsung’s latest flagship, the Galaxy S21 Ultra, is its first phone to feature Samsung Display’s &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005831/en/Samsung-Display-Unveils-New-Low-power-OLED-Display-for-Smartphones/"&gt;new power-efficient OLED panels&lt;/a&gt;. In a press release, Samsung says the new display consumes 16 percent less power thanks to a “just-developed organic material” that means “electrons flow faster and more easily across the display’s organic layer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz8udY"&gt;“In other words,” Samsung explains, the technology means its “OLED panels can create brighter light while consuming less power, which improves the battery lifetime.” A smartphone’s display is typically one of its most power-hungry components, so efficiency gains here can have a big impact on the overall battery life of the device. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we remarked that the S21 Ultra has excellent battery life that lasts “beyond a full day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3OYpiH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Electrons flow faster and more easily across the display’s organic layer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="58fMXQ"&gt;Samsung confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the S21 Ultra uses an LTPO (aka a &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/666267/what-an-ltpo-display/"&gt;Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide&lt;/a&gt;) display, but it’s not the first of Samsung’s phones to do so. Last year, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=1334"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra also used LTPO display panels, which Samsung brands as HOP (Hybrid Oxide and Polycrystalline silicon). However, this week’s announcement says the S21 Ultra is the “first” to use the more efficient panels, suggesting Samsung Display has further refined the technology compared to the Note 20 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyJDW9"&gt;Prior to appearing in smartphones, LTPO displays have been used in smart watches. &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; notes that the Apple Watch Series 4 featured an LTPO display produced by LG, while Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active 2 used an LTPO display produced by Samsung Display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONy3Zk"&gt;If reports are accurate, Apple’s next flagship iPhones could soon benefit from Samsung Display’s power-efficient panel technology. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2128"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the South Korean company is in line to supply LTPO panels for Apple’s 2021 iPhones. According to the report, Apple will use 120Hz LTPO OLED displays in two of its four iPhones in the second half of the year, while the other two will have more traditional OLED panels. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new iPhone update fixes security bugs, so it’s best to install it ASAP</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jmkq7k"&gt;Apple just released iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4, and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146"&gt;the update notes&lt;/a&gt; contain some worrying language (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Under kernel updates, Apple notes that “a malicious application may be able to elevate privileges,” and under WebKit updates, it says “a remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code execution.” After both statements, the update notes say, “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCPp57"&gt;What this means, broadly, is that you should update your iOS devices as soon as possible. To put the language into plain terms: Apple found a security hole in its operating systems, and it also has evidence that someone may have exploited it. The update notes don’t have any further details, so for now, we don’t know who may have used the security breach or what they may have been using it for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X02zGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not time for cyber-lockdown, but it is time to update&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWXa7u"&gt;However it was used, the security breaches aren’t minor ones. An application being able to elevate privileges means that it could do things it’s not supposed to be able to do. Again, there aren’t any details, but broadly speaking, it means a malicious app could’ve bypassed some of Apple’s security protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RlwXb"&gt;The WebKit exploit isn’t better. A remote attacker being able to cause arbitrary code execution means an attacker could do things on your phone just from you visiting a website they control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nFOBQ"&gt;This isn’t to say it’s time to go into total cyber-lockdown mode, but it does mean that 14.4 isn’t an update you want to put off for a while. In the meantime, Apple says it’ll provide additional details soon, so we’ll keep an eye out for more information about the exploits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon plans to almost double its mmWave 5G coverage this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4S_z-943QoZMKipjS9DfyurWuSs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724737/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JXMAO1"&gt;Verizon has big 5G plans for 2021 after formally launching its next-gen network in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509364/verizon-5g-network-ultra-wideband-nationwide-apple-event"&gt;October of last year&lt;/a&gt;, and close to the top of its list of priorities is expanding coverage of its ultra-fast mmWave coverage. That flavor of 5G is currently restricted to select areas within select cities in the US, and it’s highly dependent on your proximity to a Verizon 5G site due to the inherent technology that powers it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAXx2l"&gt;Marketed under the name 5G Ultra Wideband (5G UW), this variety of 5G is the type with high speeds but poor coverage, meaning Verizon has its work cut out for it expanding network coverage in 2021. But in its earnings report on Tuesday, the company says it plans to nearly double its 5G UW network this year by adding more than 14,000 new “sites.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dTwSLpH9BVUiqBPrnScnMu687I8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261470/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_4.27.53_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Verizon&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="baqSU8"&gt;Now, it’s kind of ambiguous what a “site” means. Adding a 5G UW site sounds, in theory, like a way to expand the coverage area of the service, or at the very least to improve the connection strength in an existing area of coverage, considering mmWave tech relies on rigging up networks of antennas, power supplies, and other equipment to help boost range and blanket areas that are, right now, only served by slower and farther-reaching standard LTE and low-band 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjuCUF"&gt;Some of that equipment is apparently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249058/5g-cellular-equipment-houston"&gt;already showing up unannounced on the lawns of Houston residents&lt;/a&gt; who don’t really have a say in whether their slice of county-owned yard has to play host to these “ground fixtures” the size of chest cooler. Yet, it’s not clear if Verizon plans to add test sites primarily to improve the range and consistency of the network in existing markets, to bring coverage to new ones entirely, or a mix of both. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZAxTn"&gt;That said, Verizon is, in effect, claiming it will double its coverage area to 30,000 sites by the end of the year. The company also says it plans to add 20 cities to its 5G UW coverage list, as well as 20-plus cities for its in-home 5G internet service. Presumably, that will be done through the site expansion to some degree. As of &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/verizon-hits-60-city-goal-with-4-new-super-fast-5g-cities#:~:text=Verizon%20today%20hit%20the%2060,%22%20millimeter%2Dwave%205G%20network."&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon surpassed its 60-city milestone for its 5G UW network, and earlier this week, it announced that prepaid customers can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248705/verizon-prepaid-5g-uw"&gt;begin accessing its 5G UW network&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon says Fios internet should be returning to normal in the Northeast after disruptive outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/STHJWLoKzC7slsq44ZHqbze82kQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68722836/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SK6kEZ"&gt;Verizon says that it has resolved issues with Fios, its fiber-optic network, that affected many locations in the Northeastern US for hours on Tuesday. The company says things should be returning to normal, but a fiber cut in Brooklyn may mean that some might still be without service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiIa1L"&gt;Users began reporting problems with Verizon &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt; shortly after 11AM ET, and the volume of reports peaked at more than 22,000 on Tuesday. Hotspots for problems on &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;Downdetector’s outage map for Verizon&lt;/a&gt; included Boston, New York City, Washington, DC, and more. A few &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers experienced outages as well, though one in Brooklyn still doesn’t have service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2fRI9"&gt;“An internet issue impacting the quality of our Fios service throughout the Northeast has been resolved,” Verizon said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354171858720075776"&gt;via its support account on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to many users on the platform. “Network performance and service levels are returning to normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iWIVLB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good afternoon and happy new year Darren, Thanks so much for reaching out to us. An internet issue impacting the quality of our Fios service throughout the Northeast has been resolved. Network performance and service levels are returning to normal. Please DM us if not back.  ^RME&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Support (@VerizonSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354171858720075776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zsiMLJ"&gt;The account also said at 11:52AM ET that there was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354109889572982786"&gt;a fiber cut in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, and as of 4:04PM ET on Tuesday, the company said the cut is still affecting customers in the area. However, technicians are working to fix things, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354173506884415488"&gt;Verizon said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1A4Z1g"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our goal is to ensure you have working services! Currently, we are aware of a fiber cut in the Brooklyn NY area. This is impacting a some customers in that area.

&lt;p id="90C7DJ"&gt;People also reported issues with Google, Zoom, Gmail, and more &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt;, but the reports appear to have come from the same places that were experiencing problems with Fios. &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=status"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://status.zoom.us/"&gt;Zoom’s&lt;/a&gt; status pages aren’t showing any outages, so it’s possible problems with those services in the Northeastern US were tied to the Fios outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANgNyb"&gt;We’ve asked Verizon to comment, and the company says it’s looking into it now. Acting Federal Communications Commission chairwoman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1354132790044815360"&gt;Jessica Rosenworcel also said&lt;/a&gt; that the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau is looking into the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is opening up its full tweet archive to academic researchers for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DwzWEac3lDv9Fls_5_cZS3CPVKw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68723365/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V3gBCP"&gt;Twitter on Tuesday announced a significant shift in the type of data it makes available for free to third-party academic researchers interested in studying user behaviors and trends related to online discourse. Now, Twitter says it will no longer require researchers pay for premium or enterprise developer access and will instead make the “full history of public conversation” — what the company refers to as its full-archive search endpoint — available to any researcher or developer who applies as part of the launch of a new academic research track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83HTrd"&gt;The change is part of the company’s ongoing efforts to improve the Twitter API, the set of tools it makes available for those outside the company to build something on top of Twitter or use its mountains of data for research studies. Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364644/twitter-api-v2-new-access-tiers-developer-portal-support-developers"&gt;launched its new and improved API last summer&lt;/a&gt; as a way to make amends with the developer and research communities, both of which have often found themselves at odds with the platform’s continuous and sometimes adversarial product development over the years. This contentious relationship began most notably in 2012, when Twitter decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/23/3263481/twitter-api-third-party-developers"&gt;cut off key developer access to the platform&lt;/a&gt; to maintain stricter control over what data it let potential competitors use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SDe1qs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our developer platform hasn’t always made it easy for researchers to access the data they need.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5MjvWQ"&gt;Twitter acknowledges the less-than-ideal relationship it’s had with the developer and research communities. “Our developer platform hasn’t always made it easy for researchers to access the data they need, and many have had to rely on their own resourcefulness to find the right information. Despite this, for over a decade, academic researchers have used Twitter data for discoveries and innovations that help make the world a better place,” write product managers Adam Tornes and Leanne Trujillo in a &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2021/enabling-the-future-of-academic-research-with-the-twitter-api.html"&gt;blog post published today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBMDCn"&gt;Tornes and Trujillo point to steps Twitter has taken in the past year to improve its tools, including the release of a COVID-19 endpoint for free and a beta of the new academic research track to gather proper feedback ahead of today’s public launch. And the company is making a concerted effort to convince researchers it wants to help them, especially now that social media discourse has become more crucial in understanding online misinformation, election interference, hate speech, and other topics that took center stage during and after the 2020 US election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07L7Em"&gt;In addition to opening up its public archive, Twitter says it’s also giving approved applicants a higher monthly tweet volume cap of 10 million tweets, which is 20 times higher than what was available on the standard free track before. It’s also allowing more precise filtering to help researchers pinpoint tweets and other data relevant to what they’re studying and “new technical and methodological guides” for helping researchers find what they’re looking for and better make use of it in studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InpZt0"&gt;Twitter says interested academics and developers can apply to the new academic research  track on the company’s &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/use-case"&gt;developer website&lt;/a&gt;. The track will, however, come with some limitations. For now, the company is now opening up access to independent researchers or journalists. You’ll have to be a student or part of an academic institution. Twitter also says it will be not be providing access to data from accounts that have been suspended or banned, which could complicate efforts to study hate speech, misinformation, and other types of conversations that violate Twitter rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWeL1x"&gt;This also means that the account @realDonaldTrump is also not accessible through Twitter’s archive following US social media sites’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218805/donald-trump-platforms-bans-facebook-twitter-youtube"&gt;widespread deplatforming of Trump following the deadly US Capitol attack&lt;/a&gt;. Still, Trump’s tweets are archived online through his &lt;a href="https://www.trumplibrary.gov/"&gt;official presidential library&lt;/a&gt;, while independent websites and database tools like &lt;a href="https://www.thetrumparchive.com/"&gt;The Trump Twitter Archive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/realDonaldTrump"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;’s Politwoops&lt;/a&gt; have also been preserving the former president’s tweets, included the deleted ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eT2XhI"&gt;“We’ve heard a lot of interest from the academic research community in studying @realDonaldTrump,” Trujillo said during a call with reporters on Monday. “We’re having conversations internally about how we might give thoughtful consideration to the study of this topic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRUe7X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 26th, 3:47PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added more information around access to suspended or banned accounts and former President Donald Trump’s tweets. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s creator-focused Xperia Pro arrives in the US priced at $2,499</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BGsiYZS-3P06Gr77R_wAkXnmuIE=/0x0:9504x6336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721906/Xperia_PRO___DC___HDMI_Monitoring_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia Pro can be used as an external monitor for a camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PADRfM"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/professional-smartphones/xperia-pro"&gt;Xperia Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Sony’s first smartphone with 5G in the US, is launching today for $2,499.99. Sony is targeting the device at professional users, who it hopes will use its HDMI input to turn the phone into an external camera monitor and its 5G connectivity to quickly upload or live-stream footage. Sony says it currently has no plans to release the Xperia Pro in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZjkgE"&gt;Outside of its HDMI input and US 5G support, the Xperia Pro’s hardware is very similar to last year’s Xperia 1 II (which shipped with 5G support in Europe but was limited to 4G LTE in the US). That means it’s powered by a Snapdragon 865 processor with a 4,000mAh battery, and around the back, there are the same 12-megapixel wide, telephoto, and ultrawide cameras. The Xperia Pro also includes a tall 6.5-inch 21:9 aspect ratio OLED display, which Sony is once again describing as 4K but actually has a sub-4K resolution of &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/professional-smartphones/xperia-pro/specifications#specifications:~:text=4K%20HDR%20OLED%20(3840x1644)"&gt;3840 x 1644&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tph7hhTkcejHf5YX-8fs2ufGytQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260192/01_Xperia_Pro_group_black_withclock_Large.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although it’s got the form-factor of a smartphone, the Xperia Pro is aimed at professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aEsgyn2odI1RSQUFDlj5JYHy0Bo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260194/Xperia_Pro_40R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its HDMI input sits next to its USB-C port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OwgCb2"&gt;At $1,200, the Xperia 1 II was already an expensive smartphone, and the Xperia Pro is over double its price. But Sony argues its 5G support and HDMI input could be incredibly useful to professional users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3TPgn"&gt;Let’s start with the HDMI input, which is located on the bottom of the phone where the Xperia 1 II’s USB-C port. (The Xperia Pro’s USB-C port is still on the bottom of the device, but it’s shifted to the left.) Sony says it’s capable of taking up to a 4K 60fps HDR video stream and should work with any cameras that have an HDMI output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sONXBY"&gt;In practice, what this means is that you can connect the Xperia Pro to a camera’s HDMI output, for example, and use its bigger screen to get a clearer view of whatever’s being filmed or photographed. You can pinch to zoom into the image displayed on the screen or overlay gridlines to help with framing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Or04Ek"&gt;Where this functionality gets especially interesting is with the Xperia Pro’s 5G connectivity, which enables it to act as a live-streaming link for your camera in addition to being an external monitor. The Xperia Pro can stream footage from its HDMI input to YouTube directly, and it supports StreamLabs and StreamYard for streaming to other platforms like Twitch and Facebook Live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKYRzS"&gt;The phone supports both Sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G, and Sony claims that it has a unique four-way mmWave antenna array to maximize reception. There’s also a built-in network visualizer app that can be assigned to its shortcut key to help you find the best position to get a signal. Hopefully Sony’s software and hardware are enough to mitigate mmWave’s problems with limited coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7k6EnE"&gt;Ever since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147066/sony-xperia-phone-1-ii-specs-price-features-5g-triple-camera-headphone-jack-wireless-changing"&gt;started teasing the Xperia Pro&lt;/a&gt; early last year, Sony has emphasized that it’s a device for professional users, and its $2,499.99 price tag makes this more obvious than ever. When I asked Sony why it hasn’t released a 5G device aimed at consumers in the US, it told me it’s waiting for the technology to be more broadly implemented by carriers. Until then, Sony says it’s focusing on professional users who it thinks can get more use out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAiBCZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rejoice! Amazon’s new app icon isn’t just a logo in a white box</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XehTHhcOFBSDbMFdiuHA3SueY4U=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68720166/download.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/amazon/id335187483" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DUsEYd"&gt;It looks like Amazon is rolling a new app icon on iOS, and unlike countless other recent app redesigns, it isn’t just a logo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/2/26/18242369/slack-icon-android-ios-white-purple"&gt;dropped inside a white background&lt;/a&gt;! Rejoice! The new icon cleverly takes cues from perhaps Amazon’s most recognizable “product” — its shipping boxes and their bright blue tape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlkVmh"&gt;Here it is — in &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/amazon/id335187483"&gt;the app’s listing on Apple’s UK App Store&lt;/a&gt;. (There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xerusdesign/status/1353864407785369601"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/northead/status/1353861529930772481"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DenisMarciniak/status/1353838774950703105"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thatjamesboy/status/1353807214264385537"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of others seeing the icon on their devices as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bGR1ED2uNa6jdsD2sxJU8fC6swA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259694/Screen_Shot_2021_01_25_at_5.32.35_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VxL0R5"&gt;Whoever worked on this new app design, which will be instantly recognizable on your home screen, deserves a raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkSntW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; We’ve updated the headline to clarify that the new design is an icon, not a logo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>5G boxes are coming to people’s homes, whether they want them or not</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkVO6SfuvjlgEbC6yOjb84JnHg4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719277/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nDFbTN"&gt;When most people look out their windows in the morning, they likely aren’t expecting to be surprised by a chest freezer-sized box that’s feeding a 5G antenna, but that’s the exact experience some Houston residents have been having. Verizon has been installing the boxes as part of its 5G network rollout since at least 2019, and from the &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Streamlined-5G-buildout-puts-ground-15889021.php#photo-20522171"&gt;reporting done by the &lt;em&gt;Houston Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it seems as if it’s been anything but smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzhQWp"&gt;The boxes are known as “ground fixtures,” and they supply power and data to 5G antennas that are placed on utility poles nearby. The ones gracing people’s front window views are being set up to build out Verizon’s 5G home internet service. It’s well-known at this point that, while millimeter-wave tech is blazing-fast, it also has terrible range. The solution to that is to blanket an area with antennas, and the equipment for that has to go somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZsLc77"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Streamlined 5G buildout puts ‘ground furniture’ in Houston’s front yards &lt;a href="https://t.co/je47v706lk"&gt;https://t.co/je47v706lk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Houston Chronicle (@HoustonChron) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HoustonChron/status/1352590511404675072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TAx3ol"&gt;The first speed bump is that Verizon is under no obligation to get permission from homeowners before installing the boxes. In fact, it’s not even required to notify them that it’s going to happen. This is because, technically, the boxes (and the utility poles that go along with them) are installed on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_verge#Terminology"&gt;right-of-way&lt;/a&gt;, which is land owned by the county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3Qbk4"&gt;The permits to place the equipment are dirt cheap to telecoms, only costing $300. They used to be $2,700 before a law was passed by the state of Texas in 2017. But it’s not just Houston that’s having to deal with the surprise boxes, and it’s not just Verizon putting them down. This drama &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/03/18/want-5-g-wireless-box-front-your-house-editorials-debates/410824002/"&gt;has been playing out for years&lt;/a&gt; as telecoms are trying to expand their networks and prepare for the 5G transition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgCPlf"&gt;While it may be startling, there are other complaints homeowners have. A common one is that the cellular equipment &lt;a href="https://www.inquirer.com/business/5g-wireless-verizon-fios-bucks-county-doylestown-pole-20190904.html"&gt;brings their property values down&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to some extreme emotional reactions. And then, perhaps worst of all, there’s the mistakes that can come with installing new equipment: the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;’s article tells of contractors digging into pipes and bursting them, flooding a street not with 5G signal, but with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S65NJh"&gt;While the strife is currently limited to certain areas, it’s perhaps a sign of things to come. As 5G continues its rollout, we can probably expect to see many more stories like this, where the desires of homeowners push up against the desires of telecoms and the community at large. If discussions aren’t starting about how to deal with it now, the surprises are going to keep showing up — if not on our doorsteps, then at least somewhere in the vicinity. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eyl0jj"&gt;Verizon is extending access to its fast mmWave 5G network to its prepaid customers for the first time. A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fprepaid%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22248705%2Fverizon-prepaid-5g-uw#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new unlimited plan&lt;/a&gt; starts at $75 a month — $10 more than the standard unlimited prepaid plan — and includes access to Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband network. Previously, 5G UW access was limited to postpaid customers on certain unlimited plans. All prepaid and postpaid plans continue to include access to Verizon’s slower Nationwide 5G network, which is currently only a bit faster than LTE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ1kp0"&gt;The 5G UW network does offer impressive speeds, but it’s limited by very short signal range. Currently, Verizon offers the service in parts of 64 cities, so if you’re thinking about upgrading to a plan that includes UW, you’ll definitely want to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fcoverage-map%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22248705%2Fverizon-prepaid-5g-uw#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;consult the coverage map&lt;/a&gt;. Bear in mind also that the signal doesn’t penetrate walls, so don’t expect to pick it up in your living room.&lt;/p&gt;

Compatible phones sold by Verizon are often indicated by a UW in the model name, but if you plan to bring your own device, that’s something worth checking. 5G phones that don’t support UW will still work with the company’s Sub-6GHz Nationwide 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
