    <title>Asus’ new ROG Phone 5 Ultimate has 18GB of RAM and a rear-facing OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xU7BKq-g8xVhFCvkMdSg7K2Fa6Q=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940445/cfaulkner_210228_4452_00010.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7O1TxR"&gt;Asus is going big with its latest gaming phones. The ROG Phone 5 lineup will start shipping this month across the globe, costing 799 euros (around $950) for the base configuration with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of fast UFS 3.1 storage. Every configuration has a 6.78-inch FHD+ OLED screen with a 144Hz refresh rate and a 300Hz touch sampling rate. Also, the headphone jack has made a comeback after being absent from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21332716/asus-rog-phone-3-gaming-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-airtriggers-oled-ram"&gt;ROG Phone 3&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a quad DAC in tow for hi-res audio. (In case you’re wondering where the ROG Phone 4 went, Asus skipped over the number four, like OnePlus did, due to its similarities with the word “death” in some Asian languages.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hemsoR"&gt;The most notable changes from the last generation are exclusive to some even more expensive configurations, the ROG Phone 5 Pro and Ultimate (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22085537"&gt;which I published a review of&lt;/a&gt;) that release in April for 1,199 euros (approximately $1,420) and in May for 1,299 euros (about $1,583), respectively. Both of these models have double the storage and more RAM (starting at 16GB in the Pro and going all the way up to 18GB in the Ultimate); come in limited edition colors; and have two additional ultrasonic touch sensors than the standard model, located near where your ring fingers might rest while holding the phone in landscape mode. You’ll also get a case and a clip-on AeroActive Cooler 5 fan attachment with purchase with either the Pro or Ultimate phone (which adds two more buttons attached to the fan.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/702SiKs875OMZ6GWr4U0CZDa5Us=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357713/aeroactivecooler.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IG0kJe"&gt;The new Asus gaming phones aren’t huge departures from their predecessors, though the hardware and software are more refined. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22085537"&gt;I reviewed the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, and while it delivers on its promises to be a spec and feature juggernaut in some clever ways, paying $1,580 for it seems steep. Even the $950 base configuration isn’t what I’d consider affordable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMz3EQ"&gt;The Ultimate and Pro include “ROG Vision,” a feature that pushes premade or custom text or graphics to its rear-facing OLED screen. It’s a spin on Asus’ “Anime Matrix” effect used in the Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop, allowing you to personalize your phone if you want. The standard ROG Phone 5 simply has a backlit ROG logo, which some might find to be just enough pizazz.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pIhpxO"&gt;I go into all of the features in the review. But if you’re just passing by and want to know all about the specs, I’ve attached a handy table just for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate review: overkill</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a mystifying phone with a steep price tag&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FWmeum"&gt;It’s reductive to refer to the Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate as &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;a phone, even if it is one. Sure, it runs Android 11, and it can take calls, snap pictures, and do all of the other stuff every other phone can do. But if its edgy looks and tiny monochromatic OLED screen mounted on its back didn’t already give it away, this phone is &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lm7OXX"&gt;This is Asus’ latest attempt (technically its fourth, but it’s skipping that number in the name for superstitious reasons) at building a console-like experience into a phone for a niche but thriving global crowd of mobile gamers. It offers more power and customization than other large-screened phones, both in terms of hardware and software. It’s a real spec sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5c0Dw"&gt;For example, it has multiple USB-C ports to let you charge it in either landscape or portrait mode. This model also includes a snap-on fan cooler (its sole job is to keep the phone from overheating when you overclock it), and the fan packs USB-C passthrough charging, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and two remappable trigger buttons. In addition to that, there are some ultrasonic sensors around the phone that can replace some touch controls to make games feel more like you’re using a controller. And for this year’s model, its Armoury Crate app can boost its processor and graphics speed, increase the screen’s refresh rate, and more on a per-game basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BL7tXd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10382537"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XsosXV"&gt;The Ultimate is Asus’ highest-end ROG Phone 5 coming in May for 1,299 euros (which is around $1,583). But other less expensive options will ship before then, starting in March for around $950. How does Asus justify the $600 price delta? This is the only configuration that has a matte white colorway with a few blue details sprinkled around the phone. And it’s the only one in the lineup — and perhaps the only phone other than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314911/redmagic-6-tencent-edition-specs-price-launch-date-announced"&gt;RedMagic’s new 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; — that has 18GB of RAM. It’s an impressive spec to find in a phone, but I’m still searching for a use case that requires having this much RAM. The cheaper versions of the ROG Phone 5 ship with 16GB and 12GB of RAM, respectively, which I’m betting doesn’t make a huge difference in performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l1DHHm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10382540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rG56aG"&gt;The Ultimate, in particular, seems to be made for only the most diehard of ROG fans. The phone comes with a laptop-sized box filled with a ROG-themed ball cap, towel, face covering, stickers, and more goodies. Aside from the aforementioned specs, the ever-so-slightly less expensive (but still around $1,420) ROG Phone 5 Pro, coming in April 2021, is very similar to the Ultimate. Both phones include two additional ultrasonic sensors on their backs near where your ring fingers might rest while holding them in landscape mode, as well as the rear-facing OLED screen I mentioned earlier called “ROG Vision.” It’s a thumb drive-sized display that’s a spin on Asus’ “Anime Matrix” effect used in the Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop, possibly attracting even more eyeballs at this bizarre-looking phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f8BuFXAogjiciePCr5tO1d9IoN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357615/mask_up.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I couldn’t really think of what else to do with ROG Vision, so I made a PSA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxl0z"&gt;Asus provides preloaded messages and graphics to use for the display that are situational depending on whether you’re gaming, charging the phone, or getting a call on your phone, to name a few, but you can crop your own images to fit within the display, as I did. Anything from a scrolling message with emoji to an image will work, and you can customize it further with an animation, like a static fade or fireworks. It’s like a souped-up version of the LEDs that companies put on the outside of flip phones, or even on Samsung’s Z Flip. The standard ROG Phone 5 has an RGB-backlit ROG logo instead. Some might actually prefer that to having the extra screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jUs82o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10382527"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i9KsE5"&gt;The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is a better gaming phone than its predecessors, as well as the competing devices I’ve tried so far from Xiaomi’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/15/18678066/black-shark-2-xiaomi-gaming-phone-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;Black Shark&lt;/a&gt;. For one, it’s the most powerful option out there with the Snapdragon 888 processor and its 18GB of RAM. Every device in the lineup starts with 512GB of fast UFS 3.1 storage, so it flies with opening apps, switching between them, and for other tasks that access storage. Its 6.78-inch FHD+ (2448 x 1080) OLED screen is one of the best I’ve ever used, even if it’s far too large to be my ideal size. Asus kept the 144Hz refresh rate (which automatically adjusts per app for efficiency by default) from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21332716/asus-rog-phone-3-gaming-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-airtriggers-oled-ram"&gt;ROG Phone 3&lt;/a&gt;, but its touch latency is down to 24 milliseconds here with a 300Hz touch sampling rate, meaning it checks 300 times per second to see where you’ve touched it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063061/oneplus-8-120-hz-high-refresh-rate-screen-pete-lau"&gt;The OnePlus 8 Pro has a 240Hz sampling rate&lt;/a&gt;, for context. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314911/redmagic-6-tencent-edition-specs-price-launch-date-announced"&gt;The new RedMagic 6&lt;/a&gt; that’s expected to be far more affordable than the base ROG Phone 5 configuration uses similar display tech, but with a faster 165Hz refresh rate and a faster 500Hz touch sampling rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veyvt9"&gt;The specs and display used in each ROG Phone 5 make playing games look sharp and run smoothly, and some other features elevate the experience further, whether you’re gaming or watching movies. I particularly love the dual front-facing speakers. They offer the best stereo separation I’ve heard from a phone — to the point where, in most situations, I’m just as pleased to listen to audio aloud at home as I am through headphones. Speaking of, this year’s device sees the return of a 3.5mm audio jack that was missing from the 2020 ROG Phone 3. Asus brought it back with a vengeance, too, equipped with an ESS ES9280AC Pro quad DAC for hi-res audio. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/joa1UySTEX9Ia-WFeaS_O8GGpDs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357064/gamegenie.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Game Genie overlay offers instant access to system info and settings with a swipe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2TSpkT"&gt;Asus has spent the year refining its Armoury Crate game launcher-meets-dedicated console UI. Its looks haven’t changed dramatically since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20896952/asus-rog-phone-ii-review-android-gaming-phone-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Phone II&lt;/a&gt;, but in case you’re hearing about this for the first time, it’s filled with so many useful features for gamers. It lets you make a “scenario profile’’ for each game, where you can tweak settings to get more out of each game and, in turn, squeeze more performance from the ROG Phone 5. A profile consists of things like what refresh rate you want the screen to run at, and how much you want to amp up the power of the processor, graphics chip, and RAM. It even lets you turn off network switching, as well as background data and app syncing on a per-game basis. If you’re familiar with gaming on PC, the closest parallel is Nvidia’s GeForce Experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sD1CH1"&gt;A big part of this software — and one of the more compelling features of the phone itself — is configuring AirTriggers. These ultrasonic sensors embedded within the phone can be mapped to emulate buttons so you don’t need to use the touch screen as often. All of the ROG Phone 5 models have sensors along the right edge, so they feel like triggers when you’re holding them in landscape mode. The Ultimate and Pro models add two additional touch sensors near where my ring fingers rest on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZLYieS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10382549"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C9a4qX"&gt;As a way to avoid using clumsy touch controls, AirTriggers are still as handy and clever as ever. Being able to map the jump and attack commands in games like &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt; actually makes those mobile ports fun to play for me. What’s great is that games don’t need to support controllers for the feature to work. While a game is running, you can move an AirTrigger cursor onto whichever command you’d like to create a “button” for on the phone. In the settings, you can choose whether you want to tap or swipe to issue the command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVb21X"&gt;I’ve barely scratched the surface in terms of the settings you can tweak. In addition to AirTriggers, you can map motion controls to execute commands. And by clamping the included AeroActive Cooler 5 fan onto the phone, it affords two extra trigger buttons that can be mapped to your liking, plus a kickstand. There’s just &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; customization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/702SiKs875OMZ6GWr4U0CZDa5Us=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357713/aeroactivecooler.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AeroActive Cooler 5 snapped on. I have my middle fingers resting on the mappable triggers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QZpaJR"&gt;Outside of gaming on a PC, I’m in the “controller or bust” camp, and thus, I don’t usually want to suffer through touch controls to play the latest Android games. AirTriggers makes the experience better, no doubt, but it’s still not enough to convert me. Thankfully, for people like me, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate (and the other new models) supports some modern controllers, like Microsoft’s Xbox One controller, Sony’s DualShock 4, or Google’s Stadia controller. Impressively, the software lets you remap the controls for any mobile game onto those controllers. It detected my Xbox controller immediately when I connected it with an OTG adapter, and mapping the buttons was simpler than I expected. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bauGjkOzCSny8HLoDmof6GV1c-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357258/genshinmapping.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s easy to map on-screen controls to a controller through the Game Genie function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lmyjhj"&gt;As for the actual phone stuff, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is a high-end phone through and through. It has responsive haptic feedback at every turn, whether you’re getting text messages, tapping your way through Asus’ ROG UI interface (its game-themed twist on Zen UI, which is refined as ever), or using the AirTriggers in a game. Asus told me that it tuned its haptics in-house, and compared to some other Android phones I’ve used, it doesn’t buzz loudly or rattle the phone. It’s what I hope more phone haptics feel like once &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297285/qualcomm-lofelt-haptics-vibration-snapdragon-888-api-software"&gt;Qualcomm and Lofelt roll out their haptics framework for other devices running the Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt;. But as Asus proved with this phone, a company can make good haptics if it wants to. This device has a 6,000mAh battery inside that’s split into two 3,000mAh cells, which Asus says helps with lower charge and discharge temperatures. Additionally, it allows the phone to recharge at 65W speeds, but it lacks wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UU6FkO_saz2s9MbxGYWLIRMyE6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357242/P_20210308_233615.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The selfie cam is fine, but there’s some lens flare above Becca’s head, and the details are a little soft. Some people may like that, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ri3Fy1J78DFStaUnhPxWOh7lfVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357250/rogphone5ultimateportrait.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portrait mode is totally serviceable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xu9pgX"&gt;Asus has committed to launching the ROG Phone 5 lineup globally, but it hasn’t shared a specific launch date in the US or official pricing, which is why I’ve been going off a euro conversion. However, the company told me that all of these phones will work on T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T, and to that end, they support these carriers’ sub-6GHz 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="PB9gZC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10382481"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="evccUQ"&gt;It’s amazing to see what a manufacturer can do when it isn’t worried about making the thinnest design with the best cameras, or stuck on meeting an ultra-competitive price point as the likes of Samsung, Apple, and Google are. Asus wasn’t afraid to get weird here, and that weirdness comes through in several ways that make it a good fit for gamers chasing after the most powerful phone in existence at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vK1VPu"&gt;Though, the value here falls apart completely if you think about it too much. For the $1,580 that this phone costs, you could build a very good PC or get a PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch together with change left over. Outside of paying for a phone data plan, this would add about $65 to that if you finance it with monthly payments over a two-year period. While this phone definitely has a leg up on the competition when it comes to power and software features, it’s not worth paying this much to get them. And if you just want to stream games via the cloud with Microsoft’s xCloud service or with Google Stadia, you only need to spend a fraction of this cost to get a phone that can do game streaming well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdgHOlLWcRVY9Rb32zyALR7BehM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354177/cfaulkner_210228_4452_00010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stock wallpapers are actually great this time around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qYdOzO"&gt;Like every gaming phone I’ve checked out yet, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is stuck in this weird place of being a very capable device that somehow delivers on its many promises, yet it still doesn’t feel worth the money. For average people who play the occasional game, either directly from their phones or through game streaming services, buying a cheap clip to fasten a controller to your phone will probably be a good enough solution. There are also some comfortable controller setups for iPhone and Android (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbones-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone’s Go&lt;/a&gt; and Razer’s Kishi for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431952/razer-kishi-controller-iphone-ios-review"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) that can turn most phones into more of a Nintendo Switch-like experience that requires less fuss and far less of an investment than Asus’ ROG Phone 5 Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will host another Unpacked event on March 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NVocjJD4ydVmghhKgbpxTkhpBBI=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68938959/Galaxy_Awesome_Unpacked_Invitation.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gcY3B9"&gt;Samsung has just announced an Unpacked event coming up on March 17th, 2021, its second for the year so far. The invitation calls the event “Galaxy Awesome Unpacked.” Between recent A-series leaks and the chaotic, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLTrNq2MnBM"&gt;“awesome”-themed promotional video&lt;/a&gt; for last year’s models, it seems safe to assume that we’ll see the Galaxy A52 and A72 devices debut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TVi4IB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0654Hm8Z6I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g8RuIw"&gt;An entire event dedicated to unveiling midrange devices is a little unusual, but the leaked information we’ve seen thus far has pointed to Samsung taking these phones very seriously.  The A52 5G looks like it will receive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309330/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-security-updates-leak"&gt;monthly security updates&lt;/a&gt; — something Samsung has tended to reserve for higher-end phones — and spec leaks have indicated we can expect &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;high-refresh rate screens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DINTpF"&gt;If nothing else, we can hope that Samsung will bring the energy from last year’s unusual video to keep the event entertaining. You can watch by tuning in to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung"&gt;Samsung’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; on March 17th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT. And please accept our apologies for embedding last year’s ad for the A51 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rovc4Z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLTrNq2MnBM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Twitter is working on a ‘big overhaul’ of TweetDeck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j_SC6qAIdw1nHUcZqMVu1BVqYA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68938270/acastro_170726_1777_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3LjFHd"&gt;Twitter is actively working on a “big overhaul” of its TweetDeck platform, which lets you arrange lists and feeds into easy-to-read vertical rows, and it plans to share more about the project publicly later this year, product chief Kayvon Beykpour said in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cJjf3"&gt;TweetDeck, as one of the oldest and originally third-party account management apps for the platform, hasn’t seen much in the way of design or major feature changes in years. The app launched 12 years ago and was acquired by Twitter in 2011, and it’s more or less still the same vertical grid viewer for your various Twitter feeds it started as. Mostly, Twitter has ported over new functions added to its main website and mobile apps while keeping the core TweetDeck design relatively static. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkCO0Z"&gt;That appears to be changing. Beykpour and the product team recognize they haven’t “given TweetDeck a lot of love recently,” and they’re actively working on a new TweetDeck they plan to show off later this year. It’s part of a broader push to improve Twitter’s developer tools and repair its relationship with app makers, with the latter being a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364644/twitter-api-v2-new-access-tiers-developer-portal-support-developers"&gt;longtime contention between Twitter and the broader software development community&lt;/a&gt;. (Beykpour’s answer doesn’t specify whether the new TweetDeck will be released this year or simply previewed for the public.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2tiyR"&gt;Here’s Beykpour’s full response regarding TweetDeck: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bk3Ek1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nilay Patel: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s newsroom runs on TweetDeck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8tIZC"&gt;Beykpour: Totally. And we haven’t given TweetDeck a lot of love recently. That’s about to change; we’ve been working on a pretty big overhaul from the ground up of TweetDeck, and it’s something that we’re excited to share publicly sometime this year. And so that’s just an example of a Twitter-owned and operated service that we will continue investing in. We also, over the last five years, I think, haven’t given a lot of love to our developer ecosystem. A bunch of reasons for that, some missteps that we’d taken in the past, then also sort of prioritization. We are also changing that; in the last year and a half we’ve really stepped up both our commitment and follow-through on just innovating around the API again, getting the API back to parity from our own internal APIs that we use to build functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02daWV"&gt;I think we’ve got a lot of trust to earn back with developers, since we’ve made a lot of mistakes in the past, but it’s something that we’re actively investing in. We hope we’ll allow developers to build really awesome stuff around the Twitter ecosystem. One of the reasons why Twitter is where it is today is because of developers doing cool shit that we would’ve never thought to do. And so that’s something that we’re trying to do more of, not step away from. More to come on that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="O8H238"&gt;It’s not clear whether this new TweetDeck would feature a refreshed visual design, all-new features, or both. It’s also up for debate whether Twitter plans to eventually charge money for TweetDeck; a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;report last month&lt;/a&gt; said the company was mulling over a premium version of TweetDeck it could attach a subscription fee for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUagC9"&gt;Whatever form the new app takes, it will be a breath of fresh air for TweetDeck’s longtime users (myself included) who would like, at the very least, a fresh coat of paint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fd0cP7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: T-Mobile will start sharing customer info with advertisers unless you opt out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kI5Iqa2CQKwkctUCqH1NRDzHl3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68937654/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile will soon start sharing certain customer data with marketers to provide more relevant ads. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sZ741t"&gt;T-Mobile will soon put a new privacy policy into effect that will allow it to share certain kinds of customer information with third-party advertisers. Starting on April 26th, 2021, all customers will be automatically opted in to the new program, as &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-to-step-up-ad-targeting-of-cellphone-customers-11615285803?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Customers who don’t want to participate will need to manually opt out using their accounts’ &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fprivacy-center%2Ftake-control-of-your-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0R5BD"&gt;T-Mobile’s new policy is no different than &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/csr/home/privacy/overview.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fprivacy%2Ffull-privacy-policy%23acc-item-32&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s&lt;/a&gt;. This is an about-face for former Sprint customers, however. T-Mobile acknowledges in its announcement of the policy change that Sprint offered a similar opt-&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; service rather than an opt-out one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pYDROX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The companies say the data they share doesn’t reveal individual customers’ identities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mHh4aS"&gt;The new policy includes the same kind of provisions as AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon for sharing user data with third-party marketers in the name of providing more relevant advertising. The companies say that data they share doesn’t reveal individual customers’ identities and that they don’t share information that’s associated with a child’s device or service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppHqnT"&gt;As harmless as the carriers make this practice sound, it’s something people are growing increasingly wary of. As a response, companies like Google are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;working to make their data-gathering and sharing practices less intrusive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncN7JZ"&gt;If you’re not wild about your carrier sharing data about you with advertisers, it’s easy enough to opt out of these services. AT&amp;amp;T customers can opt out of third-party data sharing by accessing their account’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fcmpchoice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy controls&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, Verizon customers can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fverizonwireless.com%2Fmyprivacy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;log in to My Verizon to opt out&lt;/a&gt; of what it calls “Relevant Mobile Advertising.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is once again giving you a reason to turn 5G off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nPDe0f5zbweXZMYx-wlpanHHjnM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68932592/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Despite years of promotion, Verizon’s 5G network still lags behind 4G. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m9ufjc"&gt;Verizon 4G appears to be getting even better than its nationwide 5G network, according to &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/tested-verizons-new-4g-beats-5g-big-time"&gt;new tests conducted by &lt;em&gt;PCMag’s&lt;/em&gt; Sascha Segan&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22305899/verizon-support-turn-off-5g-save-phone-battery"&gt;last week’s tweet&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that users turn off their phone’s 5G to conserve battery life, there seems to be a multitude of reasons for Verizon customers to stick with 4G right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ihm2K"&gt;Additional spectrum is making the difference for Verizon 4G right now, and not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;C-band spectrum&lt;/a&gt; that’s been in the news recently. This is CBRS, a set of frequencies that sits near C-band. Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/verizon-dish-cable-top-list-cbrs-auction-winners"&gt;bid $1.89 billion on CBRS&lt;/a&gt; licenses last year and has been putting the newly acquired spectrum to work for its 4G service in certain locations (there are likely technical reasons, which Segan explains in his post, why Verizon isn’t using this spectrum for 5G just yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bAjyeB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DbCy0Z"&gt;Segan found a couple of these spots and tested CBRS-assisted 4G speeds versus 5G. With the exception of range-limited, super-fast Ultra Wideband 5G, 4G won by a landslide. In one location, 4G download speeds reached 815 Mbps, while 5G based on Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (that’s the widespread but slower variety known as DSS) only hit 358 Mbps. This was a test of just a couple of locations of course, but Segan points out that it bodes well for the kinds of improvements we can expect when C-band becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7g2IS4"&gt;So is there any reason for someone on Verizon to keep 5G active rather than switching to 4G? Maybe, Segan tells us. “If you’re in a spot with Verizon’s ‘UWB’ millimeter-wave 5G, it’s absolutely terrific. UWB is the fastest form of 5G available today. But the DSS ‘nationwide’ 5G just isn’t providing any advantage right now. I’d say, turn it off if you can and check back in a few months to see if they’ve improved the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yyj77b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’ll be the C-band spectrum that will likely make the difference for Verizon 5G&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LrUdv7"&gt;The silver lining, of course, is that Verizon 4G is actually good — and getting even better for some. In the long term, it’ll be the C-band spectrum that will likely make the difference for Verizon 5G. “If you’re buying a Verizon phone soon and you’re interested in future performance, make sure it has C-band,” Segan says. In the meantime, unless you live next door to an Ultra Wideband cell site, you can probably turn off 5G and rest assured that you’re getting the best network performance possible for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQYJq6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spice up your daily pandemic walk with these apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7JTL09TXMNTLmfl06h24EoUsf-k=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68931867/final.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Keep the routine fresh&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="vfp7Lm"&gt;As you may have heard one or two times, we’re now roughly a year into COVID and pandemic lockdown life. To fill the void in our lives that was once occupied by social gatherings, visiting family, and breathing indoor air freely, many of us have turned to new hobbies and habits. Some of them are even healthy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEv0XJ"&gt;Taking a daily or, if I’m being honest, &lt;em&gt;semi&lt;/em&gt;-daily walk is a lockdown habit that has seen me through These Unprecedented Times. I’m &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roobeekeane/status/1347644813320073220?s=20"&gt;not alone, either&lt;/a&gt; — without gyms or really anywhere else to go at all, lots of us have embraced (or at times, endured) a daily walk around the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5qr1L"&gt;To be sure, it’s not always easy. I got tired of walking by the same houses and the same pieces of fossilized trash about six months in. It rains a lot where I live and that can turn an otherwise pleasant walk into a real bummer. Other days, the motivation just isn’t there and the mailbox is as far as I get. But a few tricks along the way have helped me and fellow &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers stay committed to the walk ritual. Here are some techniques to keep your pandemic walk routine fresh and the apps that can help you put them into practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BIctUh"&gt;Find a new route&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vw0WdGgH1BgVp5TrwbEgDrqQfgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354699/footpath.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footpath helps you map out new routes and gives you key information like elevation change along the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bEBgeP"&gt;This year I’ve embraced the life-changing magic of hauling myself out of my own neighborhood and going on a walk somewhere else. It feels counterproductive driving somewhere to take a walk, but it really does help shake things up when I’m burned out on my usual route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zvSG2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alltrails.com/"&gt;AllTrails&lt;/a&gt; is an app popular with hikers, but it’s also great for finding nearby parks and trails you may not know about, whether you’re in an urban spot or farther from the city. There’s also an active community who leave helpful tips, like whether the restrooms are a horror show or if the parking lot is a hotspot for break-ins. All of its basic features are available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZygxB3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://footpathapp.com/"&gt;Footpath&lt;/a&gt; is another good tool to help identify a new route, whether it’s close to home or somewhere unfamiliar. Use the app’s detailed street map to draw roughly where you’d like to go; the app will snap your route to the nearest streets and pathways. Footpath gives you important details about the route like mileage, elevation gain / loss along the way, and even a time estimate that factors in hills so you know what you’re getting into. You can trace out the full route or draw a path to a destination you’d like to reach and the app can create a loop route back to your starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEtefm"&gt;The free version will help you brainstorm some new walks, but more advanced features like turn-by-turn navigation — iPhone only for now but coming to Android soon — require an Elite subscription ($23.49 annually). Alternatively, you can add Elite features to individual saved routes for a one-time fee of $1.99 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Rmyp3f"&gt;Make it mindful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="khOWzU"&gt;Any therapist or Silicon Valley CEO will tell you about the benefits of meditation. My brain is too noisy for a traditional sitting-and-breathing meditation, but I find walking meditations a lot easier to get into. &lt;a href="https://app.www.calm.com/program/wAzjO76/mindful-walking"&gt;Calm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.headspace.com/meditation/walking-meditation"&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; (each is $69 for an annual subscription) offer walking meditations of various lengths; the ones offered by Headspace are tailored to more specific circumstances, like walking in a city or just back and forth at home. There are also plenty of free options if you search YouTube or your streaming music service of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aES93I"&gt;Find something to tune into&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/05OGacEC6uRchhIWbp9WT1AFXww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354708/apple_time_to_walk_apple_watch_airpods_01252021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time to Walk is an Apple Fitness Plus feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vhm8rP"&gt;Finding a bite-sized podcast to listen to during walk time is a nice bonus incentive to take a break and head out the door. &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2rTT1klKUoQNuaW2Ah19Pa?si=b5snZO3iT66QKGQPD24Yqw"&gt;NPR’s &lt;em&gt;Short Wave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a quick ten-ish minutes with episodes every weekday. One of my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues uses her walk to catch up on &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/06iGnWl5EnkJktsKhSNeAQ?si=brnULdIcRHi2RbOUrfm4lQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gamertag Radio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Or check out an audio book from your local library with the &lt;a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/"&gt;Libby app&lt;/a&gt; to make walk time double up as your reading time. And for something a little more freeform, use the time to listen in on a conversation on &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; or Twitter Spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONIgIv"&gt;If you’re an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-fitness-plus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22320002%2Fwalking-apps-pandemic-strava-footpath-alltrails-seek" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; subscriber, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248678/apple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes"&gt;Time to Walk&lt;/a&gt; is a great option. Featured celebrities like Dolly Parton share stories, recorded as they walk in places that are meaningful to them. It’s a nice, reflective experience with a diverse range of hosts. You will need a subscription to Apple’s $79 / year fitness service and an Apple Watch, so it’s more likely to be an option if you’re already invested in those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LOz6NS"&gt;Gamify it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f12e8YMF5OIjGprB0TbULvPTCmw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354714/seek.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seek helps you identify local animals and plant life, rewarding you with badges as you observe more species.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WFthGB"&gt;It works on kids and it works on adults: when all else fails, turn it into a game. Tracking walks on &lt;a href="https://www.mapmyrun.com/app"&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/mobile"&gt;Strava&lt;/a&gt; can give you that extra sense of accountability and accomplishment when you get back home and tap the “finish” button. It’s a neat little trick that works on my lizard brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJypyF"&gt;Or, do as another of my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues does and take note of local critters and plant life with the &lt;a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app"&gt;Seek app&lt;/a&gt;. It uses your phone’s camera to identify plants, birds, and other kinds of fauna. Best of all, it will keep track of species you’ve indentified and award badges as you identify more. Badges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="asxYQT"&gt;Of course, that’s just the real-life version of the classic catch ‘em all game. Another &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer uses that oldie but goodie &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/en/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to keep her neighborhood walks interesting. If you missed its rise in popularity the first time around, here’s the gist: several years ago, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; tricked a bunch of us into going outside to look for AR characters in real-life locations. Once you find them, you can capture them by flinging virtual pokéballs at them on your phone screen. Keep it casual and just see how many different pokémon you encounter and capture on your walk route, or seek out rarer pokémon more aggressively. It’s your world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish will acquire Republic Wireless to boost adoption of its 5G network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dish CES 2013 stock 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vT4b1z_8LQ21vhIofV1Y4UMdnHw=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68930225/20130110-625A1517VERGE.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nathan Ingraham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XzUfOf"&gt;Satellite television provider Dish Network has announced its plan to acquire cell carrier Republic Wireless, &lt;a href="https://about.dish.com/2021-03-08-DISH-to-acquire-Republic-Wireless"&gt;Dish said on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The acquisition, when it closes, will give Dish roughly 200,000 wireless customers to help boost its 5G network, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;Dish plans to launch later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Dish says Republic Wireless customers won’t see any immediate changes to their plans and won’t have to take any action on their accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADtNcx"&gt;Dish became a major player in the telecom business last year when it finalized its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;purchase of Sprint’s Boost Mobile business&lt;/a&gt; for $1.4 billion, as part of a sale Sprint was required to make to merge with T-Mobile. Dish has since signaled its intentions to launch a 5G network in the US by buying up costly spectrum and acquiring small cell carriers, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352496/dish-ting-mobile-acquisition-tucows-network-tech"&gt;Ting Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, to acquire the necessary technology and the customer base to turn its investments into viable future businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="woeYRT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dish is building out a nationwide 5G network it plans to launch later this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FVeCGv"&gt;Republic Wireless is an MVNO, or a mobile virtual network operator, that leases network infrastructure from T-Mobile. Like the Ting acquisition, which gave Dish access to Ting parent company Tucows’ backend mobile services, the Republic Wireless acquisition will turn the carrier’s existing Relay division into a vital tool for Dish’s telecom push. Dish says Relay will continue to be a standalone business, but it will also become a customer of the network’s 5G division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noMj40"&gt;“Relay provides communication and productivity solutions for frontline teams in hospitality, facilities management, manufacturing, healthcare and education,” the press release says, “and it will become a wholesale customer on Dish’s 5G network.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRXeKX"&gt;“Republic has created a loyal following and established a brand known for innovation, customer service and value. We plan to build upon that strong foundation,” Dish COO John Swieringa said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbtoVG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 8th, 3:42PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that Republic Wireless’ Relay division will continue to operate as a standalone business. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo overtakes Huawei to lead Chinese smartphone market for first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KE_veaLpsdmmpG5MQIUdKpc8ApY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68927938/DSCF7293.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M3PqSc"&gt;Oppo has become the best-selling smartphone brand in China for the first time ever, &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/oppo-becomes-number-1-smartphone-brand-china-first-time-ever/"&gt;according to figures from Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt;. Counterpoint’s report says that Oppo managed to capture 21 percent of the world’s biggest smartphone market in January, ahead of Vivo and Huawei, which both achieved 20 percent. Apple and Xiaomi rounded out the top five with 16 percent apiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwWkpF"&gt;Oppo’s sales were up 26 percent year on year and increased 33 percent from the previous month. Counterpoint says that the new Reno 5 series had a successful launch due to offering better specs at a lower price point than the earlier Reno 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EktVGt"&gt;But for Oppo to gain market share, someone has to lose it, and the report shows that Huawei’s smartphone troubles are taking hold in China too. Counterpoint says Huawei has increased its focus on the premium market because of component shortages caused by US sanctions, so Chinese distributors have been focusing on other brands for volume. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;Huawei’s sale of Honor&lt;/a&gt;, which was also sparked by sanctions, will cut its market share down further, with Honor now considered a competitor as opposed to an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v720FG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Introducing the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOFindX3Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOFindX3Pro&lt;/a&gt;, our latest high-end flagship series. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AwakenColour?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AwakenColour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/GxerLioEq3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GxerLioEq3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1368748571101597698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U8NFzq"&gt;These figures are just for one month, but Counterpoint expects Huawei’s share of the market to continue its decline throughout 2021. Oppo will look to capitalize on the opportunity with the launch of its latest flagship phone, the Find X3 Pro, which is being announced in full on Thursday. If you want an early look, the company just tweeted a teaser that doesn’t leave a whole lot to the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The SEC is dragging AT&amp;T to court for illegally duping analysts into lowering expectations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/get-fnU1xDnsBORtAThkdh0L7Qc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68920429/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mABC7X"&gt;The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing AT&amp;amp;T for providing nonpublic information to 20 different analyst firms so they would lower revenue estimates ahead of earnings, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-43?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. That let AT&amp;amp;T “beat” expectations for the quarter when the information-sharing took place, turning what could have been some nasty headlines in the financial press into a win instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7kq7R"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20500640-sec-complaint-against-att"&gt;SEC’s complaint (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T learned in March 2016 that its quarterly results would fall short of estimates due in part to “a steeper-than-expected decline in smartphone sales.” As you might recall, we used to live in a world where carriers like AT&amp;amp;T subsidized part of the cost of your smartphone, but by then AT&amp;amp;T had passed that cost along to the customer — which meant far fewer customers were upgrading them every year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NHVe1"&gt;This quarter was going to be AT&amp;amp;T’s worst-ever for smartphone upgrades: a record low of just 5 percent, according to the complaint. As a result, AT&amp;amp;T expected that its consolidated gross revenue “was expected to fall more than $1 billion below the consensus estimate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLmm7w"&gt;Here is what happened next, from the complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eCN37P"&gt;Fearful of a revenue miss at the end of the quarter, AT&amp;amp;T’s Chief Financial Officer instructed AT&amp;amp;T’s IR Department to “work the analysts who still have equipment revenue too high.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VBQK5"&gt;In turn, the Director of Investor Relations (“IR Director”) instructed Womack, Evans, and Black to speak to analysts privately on a one-by-one basis about their estimates in order to “walk the analysts down”—i.e., induce analysts to reduce their individual estimates. The goal was to induce enough analysts to lower their estimates so that the consensus revenue estimate would fall to the level that AT&amp;amp;T expected to report to the public—i.e., AT&amp;amp;T would not have a revenue miss, which would have been the company’s third consecutive quarterly miss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TQtoRe"&gt;In their calls, the three IR executives “intentionally disclosed material nonpublic information regarding AT&amp;amp;T’s results to date,” the SEC alleges. Of the 20 analyst firms listed in the complaint, all of them lowered their revenue estimates — and many took AT&amp;amp;T’s 5 percent number directly. The SEC suggests that AT&amp;amp;T’s executives hid the fact that these numbers weren’t the kind that are supposed to be shared, so analysts may not have known that they shouldn’t have had access to that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1t1w8"&gt;Executives emailed amongst themselves the day before its Q1 2016 earnings in relief, the complaint shows. The company’s CFO even &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveCBenoit/status/1367955623321735179"&gt;apparently told&lt;/a&gt; the CEO that two analyst updates “may do it for us,” with the CEO replying, “Good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kG4VX5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is AT&amp;amp;T anxiously pushing analysts to lower estimates so that a single quarter of earnings doesn't create bad headlines, even though the results stink. And it goes all the way to the top, per the SEC. &lt;br&gt;Just another reminder of what CEOs actually care about in private. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qxbMNvVsYQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qxbMNvVsYQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dave Benoit (@DaveCBenoit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveCBenoit/status/1367955623321735179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPHf9Z"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T ended up reporting $40.535 billion in revenue for Q1 2016, barely beating the revised consensus analyst estimates by less than $100 million, according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLASME"&gt;The company disputed the SEC’s allegations &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/att-disputes-sec-allegations-301241737.html"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that “there was no disclosure of material nonpublic information”.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMB2Sf"&gt;“The information discussed during these March and April 2016 conversations concerned the widely reported, industry-wide phase-out of subsidy programs for new smartphone purchases and the impact of this trend on smartphone upgrade rates and equipment revenue,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtEuMa"&gt;“Not only did AT&amp;amp;T publicly disclose this trend on multiple occasions before the analyst calls in question, but AT&amp;amp;T also made clear that the declining phone sales had no material impact on its earnings,” it continued. “Analysts and the news media frequently wrote about this trend and investors understood that AT&amp;amp;T’s core business was selling connectivity (i.e., wireless service plans), not devices, and that smartphone sales were immaterial to the company’s earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;
