    <title>Google’s first folding Pixel is apparently still on track for a 2021 reveal</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6nxU1r"&gt;Google may have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22448165/google-samsung-wearable-partnership-wear-os-tizen-merge-smartwatch"&gt;shied away from a Pixel Watch&lt;/a&gt;, but a Pixel Fold still very much seems to be on the way — following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356760/foldable-google-pixel-q4-2021-leaked-internal-document-5-5a-4a-5g"&gt;a leak last August&lt;/a&gt; that revealed the company was planning to release its first folding Pixel phone in late 2021, Korean industry site &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; is now reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung will begin production of folding OLED panels this October for Google, Vivo and Xiaomi’s upcoming folding phones, all of which will reportedly be revealed late this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAfTpk"&gt;Google hasn’t exactly kept its folding phone ambitions a secret; in 2019, it published patent applications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266257/google-folding-bending-screen-display-patent"&gt;for its own folding screens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535863/google-pixel-foldable-phone-prototype-samsung-galaxy-fold-io-2019"&gt;admitted it had been prototyping them for quite some time&lt;/a&gt;, telling &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; that it didn’t have “a clear use case yet.” But now, it appears Google has a foldable, codename “Passport,” that could be nearly ready to announce. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/18/android-12-beta-model-numbers-pixel-6-family-passport-foldable/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; even spotted a new reference&lt;/a&gt; to it last month in Android 12’s code, alongside other codenames believed to be the upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 5a 5G. &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; says it’ll have a single 7.6-inch panel that folds inward, while Vivo’s upcoming phone will have a 8-inch main screen and a 6.5-inch outer display. It didn’t mention the size of the new Xiaomi phone’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uSRFA"&gt;It’s not clear whether a Pixel Fold would actually come with a display designed by Google itself, though it’s possible; Samsung acts as a contract manufacturer for many other companies, producing some of Apple’s homegrown processors as one example. Either way, one portion of the screen’s sandwich may still largely belong to Samsung itself: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ETNews &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung will supply its proprietary ultra-thin cover glass (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;which is technically made by German manufacturer Schott&lt;/a&gt;) to other smartphone manufacturers, and Google is expected to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DNbiiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Folding glass: how, why, and the truth of Samsung’s Z Flip","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2vekEL"&gt;Xiaomi already announced a folding phone earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;the Mi Mix Fold&lt;/a&gt;, but it sounds like it’ll have a second one. &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; also reports Oppo will be delaying a new foldable phone to 2022, with a 7.1-inch main screen and a smaller outer one between 1.5 and 2 inches diagonally.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple previews iOS 15 at WWDC 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJXKRU687lH-RGE7OuYMUCbW5qA=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418050/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1XcSmT"&gt;As expected, Apple offered a preview of iOS 15 at today’s WWDC 2021 keynote, highlighting some changes coming to FaceTime and notifications, as well as more privacy controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a31hjb"&gt;FaceTime gets some major updates, with spatial audio that reflects the speaker’s location on-screen, and voice isolation to help reduce distracting background noise. Portrait mode’s blurred backgrounds can also be used in FaceTime, and users can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;share music and videos during calls&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also possible now to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;include Android users on FaceTime&lt;/a&gt; with a shareable link that opens the call in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jmbj3hvnqDaBOFCsr2YZVLTMT-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643191/662_2021_06_07_662_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shareable links make it easier to schedule FaceTime calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="miGlYM"&gt;Notifications get a new look, with contact photos on text notifications and bigger app icons, and they will get new filter modes in iOS 15, called Focus. This allows you to customize which notifications appear during different activities, like while you’re working, and sync across all devices. You can set a custom home screen page with widgets and apps appropriate for your chosen Focus mode. There’s also an option to batch certain notifications and receive them as a digest at certain times of day as a summary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYkEgh_ery2zYr_RWSMglWUmKIA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643232/697_2021_06_07_697_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 15 offers more custom controls over notifications, like batch summaries and Focus modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vE5xTo"&gt;Messages gets a few updates, too. iOS 15 makes it possible for others to see when you’ve enabled Do Not Disturb mode by way of an automatic status update in Messages. It’s also possible to override Do Not Disturb for urgent messages. Photos shared in messages are automatically grouped into collages or stacks and will appear in other places like your photo gallery and memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgK87d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22502877/apple-app-privacy-report-ip-hiding-safari-mail-wwdc"&gt;Updated privacy controls&lt;/a&gt; in iOS 15 include a move to bring all Siri request processing on-device by default. Users will also get an App Privacy Report with a seven-day summary of how often apps accessed location information and your phone’s microphone or camera. Mail will also block tracking pixels commonly used in marketing emails to determine whether an email was opened and read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rrCgq"&gt;Other updates include the ability to search text in photos courtesy of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;new feature called LiveText&lt;/a&gt;, including the ability to search photos in Spotlight, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522951/apple-airpods-find-my-hearing-accesibility-notification-wwdc"&gt;AirPods audio updates&lt;/a&gt;, and the ability to locate AirPods Pro and AirPods Max using Find My. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/75mXKebWo8740_AmXOEjvnnFztk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643263/image__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Wallet can store ID info for TSA in iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Asxadc"&gt;Apple Wallet will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;support a wider range of items&lt;/a&gt;, like hotel room keys and relevant identification information for TSA. Memories get more customization options with different music track and transition options to change the feel of your video clips, and the weather app will display more information with new full-screen maps and a wider range of animated backgrounds. Maps gets some attention too, with “significantly enhanced details in cities” and a three-dimensional city driving view when using navigation on the phone or on CarPlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTYltu"&gt;Changes are coming to Safari are coming across the Apple ecosystem, including on iOS. It will offer a simpler tab bar design as well as support for grouped tabs that sync across all devices. Safari on iOS will also support browser extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qV47mQ"&gt;Apple says iOS 15 will arrive to the public this fall for iPhone 6s and newer, with a developer beta arriving today and a public beta next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTSZgB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus confirms N200 5G details including 90Hz screen and sub-$250 price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/78z7U629aqkVsQHKY52wqcj411I=/0x46:1085x769/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417779/nord.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus has confirmed the N200 5G for North America, and has revealed a few key specs like a 90Hz screen to PCMag.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JIRX4k"&gt;OnePlus &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/more-accessible-5g-with-new-nord-devices.1444639/"&gt;recently confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that it would launch an affordable 5G device, the N200 5G, in North America, and has revealed a few more &lt;a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/mobile-phones/133795/exclusive-oneplus-ceo-reveals-n200-phone-details-official-photo"&gt;details — and a photo of the phone — to &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Most notably, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau says that the N200 5G will cost less than $250 and will include a 90Hz screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6BtwU"&gt;Lau says the N200 is “fully upgraded from OnePlus Nord N100,” a big-battery, budget 4G phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;launched in the US earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. He says that the N200 will get a 6.49-inch 1080p display, which will be a resolution boost from the N100’s 6.52-inch 720p screen. Its 90Hz refresh rate will make motion and animations on-screen appear a bit smoother than the standard 60Hz rate. It’s a feature not often seen in the budget class, outside of OnePlus’ own Nord N10 5G, also launched earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuwWt5"&gt;The N200 also appears to offer a camera array similar to the N100’s, with three rear cameras accompanied by a flash. OnePlus hasn’t confirmed an official launch date for the device yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6fkU25"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"OnePlus Nord N10 5G review: tall phone, small price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dYrpiN"&gt;For now, OnePlus appears to be focusing on bringing its high-end flagships like the OnePlus 9 Pro and low-end budget offerings like the N100 and N200 5G to North America, while reserving midrange phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; and upcoming Nord CE 5G for European and Indian markets. That’s a sensible approach, especially considering the gap in the affordable and prepaid device market that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375938/lg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola"&gt;LG is leaving in the wake of its departure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WWDC 2021: the latest news from Apple’s annual developer conference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TCrUKoPtLEfxKk5f50QlBAqtVzg=/184x0:807x415/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417646/hero_large.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What’s new in the Apple ecosystem?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="K28Qfi"&gt;Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, or WWDC, will run from June 7th through the 11th this year, with the main keynote set for June 7th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. Like last year, &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22085002"&gt;the event will be virtual&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s probably safe to expect another immaculately produced keynote video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFthrB"&gt;Apple is likely to announce updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It’ll be interesting to see what Apple does with the iPad and Mac especially; the iPad Pro is now powered by the same M1 chips as Apple’s best laptops, but its OS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396449/apple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021"&gt;arguably holds it back&lt;/a&gt;.  We’re also still waiting on the pro-focused MacBooks and iMacs. While the current versions are fast, they lack the ports and RAM capacity that professionals are looking for, so we’ll be on the lookout for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;rumored MacBook Pro refresh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QO3Ahi"&gt;We’ll be covering everything that happens on the day, and any news that comes out after, which you can catch up on here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First official images of Honor 50 look weirdly like Huawei’s P50</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/plOQ3XD0AxSEPiHDZ5RvXNmfK1A=/1x0:1231x820/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415268/E3RP8UBVgAAehBM.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1TvJra"&gt;Honor has released a couple of official images for its upcoming 50 series smartphone via its &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3206603957/Kj2gp1BMw?type=comment#_rnd1623057835464"&gt;Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1401833284183621637"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The images focus on the rear of the phone, showing an eye-catching pair of circular camera bumps. The Honor 50 series is currently due to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1399599535077220356"&gt;announced on June 16th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7ODi7"&gt;Amidst a sea of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/12/18663281/google-pixel-4-apple-iphone-11-ugly-square-phone-cameras-modules"&gt;square and rectangular camera bumps&lt;/a&gt;, the dual circle design is an interesting look for Honor’s next flagship. It’s also a style that Honor’s former parent company Huawei is planning to use for &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; next flagship, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464776/huawei-p50-phone-camera-periscope-telephoto-leica-harmonyos"&gt;the similarly-named P50&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible that the two companies finalized their designs before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;Huawei sold off Honor late last year&lt;/a&gt;, but it’ll be strange to see such similar looking devices released from two distinct manufacturers within such close proximity to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4ZZGU2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Honor50series?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Honor50series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;100W Super Fast Charge&lt;br&gt;Hypercurved screen.                                                  Launching in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shanghai?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;, June 16th! &lt;a href="https://t.co/9MAzE0RsDb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9MAzE0RsDb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bhavya (Haya) (@bhavis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1401833284183621637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NTJNMl"&gt;From the images it appears as though Honor’s next handset will have four rear cameras in total. The upper camera circle has one large lens, and it’s joined by three more on the lower bump. In contrast, Huawei’s P50 appears to have three lenses on the upper circle, and a single camera paired with a flash on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFDdLE"&gt;Beyond its design, Honor’s next flagship will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G processor, will feature 100W fast charging, and will also come with a “hypercurved screen.” It may also mark the return of Google’s apps and services to Honor’s devices (including the Google Play Store) if a &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-50-google-apps/"&gt;now-deleted tweet from the company’s German Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. Honor was prevented from including Google’s software because of sanctions placed on its former parent company Huawei, but these are believed to not apply since it became independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y406pk"&gt;A spokesperson from Honor previously declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; as to whether or not Google’s software would be available on the upcoming 50 series. But with an official launch just round the corner, we won’t have long to wait to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile employee files suit after HR asked invasive questions about her OnlyFans account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-saP0D0IsKjlMdLfQxIO6gMz4U8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69407426/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hvfLAr"&gt;A sales rep at a T-Mobile store in Fort Worth, Texas has filed a gender discrimination suit against the company after a member of the HR team inappropriately questioned her about having an OnlyFans account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GycML4"&gt;Caitlyn Stevens had been working at T-Mobile for nearly seven years when a male colleague became angry with her about how she was handling a customer interaction, the complaint says. He approached her “in a physically aggressive manager,” forcing a coworker to step in and stop the man from hitting her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcr5mF"&gt;Stevens reported the incident to the store manager. Rather than disciplining the male colleague who’d allegedly tried to hurt her, the manager relocated Stevens to a different location, according to the complaint. The location got less foot traffic, resulting in fewer sales for employees, Stevens says. “I did not feel like it was fair that I went to a slower location based on what had just happened,” she explains in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kq6rWZ"&gt;When Stevens submitted a complaint to HR, a man on the team called her and began asking questions about her personal life, including “whether she had a ‘sugar daddy’ and whether she had an OnlyFans account.” Stevens was shocked. “I immediately started crying,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I told him I did not feel comfortable and he still continued to ask the questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VLOzl"&gt;According to Stevens, the male HR rep said “we’ve heard that you have an OnlyFans account, is that true?” Then he added, “We’ve heard that people have seen nude pictures of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oRYan"&gt;Stevens says the questions felt violating. “I felt sexually harassed, I felt uncomfortable,” she says. “The nature of the questions, when I’m literally reporting a physical assault, is not okay.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvPhAN"&gt;Stevens’ attorney, Vincent White, a partner at White, Hilferty and Albanese, says the incident shows T-Mobile sided with Stevens’ male colleague over her. “T-Mobile chose to stand with a man who had a history of violence in the workplace over a woman who was a high performer at the company for seven years,” he said in a statement. “Caitlyn Stevens’ personal life had nothing to do with store operations, while threatening coworkers with violence hinders the productivity and well-being of the entire workplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3DF1D"&gt;This isn’t the first time that a woman has been shamed or retaliated against for having an OnlyFans account. In April 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/mechanic-fired-onlyfans-account-indiana"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that a mechanic in Indiana was fired from her job after her bosses found out she was making amateur porn on OnlyFans outside of work. In December 2020, the &lt;em&gt;New York Post &lt;/em&gt;tried to “out” an EMT who was making ends meet through OnlyFans (whatever the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; was trying to do here backfired — the publication was widely criticized for “doxxing someone simply for trying to earn a living” &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/onlyfans-medic-lauren-kwei-new-york-post-interview-1104943/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The incidents point to how far some companies will try to go to control the lives of their workers, while also refusing to pay people enough to allow them to maintain a single stream of income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5IINI"&gt;Stevens turned down a settlement in order to speak out about what happened. “I think she chose a much harder path here, but she realizes that this is indicative of a broader trend that many women are facing and feels strongly about changing the culture by telling her story,” says Ariella Steinhorn, founder of Lioness Strategies, a communications firm assisting in Stevens’ case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fErus"&gt;Stevens has taken a medical leave of absence due to the stress of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvZkmd"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a T-Mobile spokesperson said: “We take matters like this seriously and worked with the employee to investigate her claims. We found they had no merit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uN5gnS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 7th, 2:30PM EST: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was updated with a statement from T-Mobile. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei teases its upcoming P50 flagship phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Huawei P50" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wwJ9hdrUkEV_R4Nm77RuwLEJxBs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377115/huaweip50.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behold, the P50’s mammoth-sized camera array&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lXhnzs"&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22227756"&gt;Huawei’s HarmonyOS&lt;/a&gt; livestream, the company provided a first look at its upcoming P50 series phone. Few specs were given, and it didn’t talk pricing or tease a release date, but the sizzle reel did reveal a close-up look at its interesting camera array. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPYJGs"&gt;Four camera lenses are visible, along with two flashes. It’s tough to say exactly what we’ll be getting with this phone in terms of megapixel count and sensor size; the photo below confirms that Huawei is working alongside Leica with its optics. We’ll have to wait to see if Huawei improved on its periscope telephoto lenses that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21444946/huawei-p40-pro-plus-vs-iphone-pixel-10x-zoom-camera"&gt;my colleague Sam Byford saw great results with on the P40 Pro Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Huawei P50" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z2YxM8rkri-ytMpf8ftE2x6ax28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554597/huaweip50lens.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The teaser hinted at Huawei’s continued camera partnership with Leica.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eDsTGF"&gt;The company claims it will “lift mobile photography to a new level.” Given that the size of the camera bump seems to have increased compared to the P40 Pro Plus (which we deemed “the smartphone zoom king”) it seems reasonable that Huawei might have crammed some even larger sensors and lenses in the P50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmz3VF"&gt;You can see the tease time-stamped in the YouTube video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="04bL1K"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y2101ics8jc?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=7039&amp;amp;start=7039" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9UadeN"&gt;As for the rest of the phone, all we have to go on so far is what Huawei executive Richard Yu said during the livestream: that it will have a “lightweight design” and an “iconic” design language. The P50 will likely ship with Huawei’s new HarmonyOS operating system built in, but it didn’t confirm it in video (or even show the display powered on, for that matter). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvZbXc"&gt;As for when it might release, the company said that it is “trying to figure out how to make this great product available to you.” That reads to me as Huawei — like all tech companies right now — dealing with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363232/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-pandemic-consoles-cpus-graphics-cards-cars"&gt;impacts of a global semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;US sanctions placed on the company have slowed its production of in-house parts&lt;/a&gt;, which might also be causing supply strains around its Kirin processors. To that end, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463666/huawei-matepad-pro-harmonyos-tablet-features-specs"&gt;the MatePad Pro tablet&lt;/a&gt; it announced today has a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor instead of one of Huawei’s own processors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei announces HarmonyOS update for its smartphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bpl6v5xN7q1wNLOHD-XmJNtn_gM=/90x0:1038x632/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377091/u970l2SYwX.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="96iVZo"&gt;Huawei has announced that its HarmonyOS operating system is coming to its smartphones via a forthcoming update. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/y2101ics8jc?t=6792"&gt;Huawei’s consumer business CEO Richard Yu says&lt;/a&gt; the company is updating around 100 of its devices globally to the new operating system, which also includes tablets like the MatePad Pro. In theory, it’s a big change from its previous phones, which have run the open-source version of Android with Huawei’s own services replacing the Google software it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension"&gt;been unable to include&lt;/a&gt; on new devices as a result of US sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YFibo"&gt;HarmonyOS will initially come to recent flagships like the Mate 40, P40, and Mate 30 series, before releasing on more devices later in the year. Older phones like the Mate 9, Mate 10, P20, and P10 will receive the update in the first half of next year, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZLvmRm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The update is coming to recent flagships as well as older models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7h0hNo"&gt;The company advertises that HarmonyOS allows its phones to offer more seamless connectivity across different devices, including easier pairing with compatible headphones and speakers via a drag-and-drop interface. There’s also improved support for homescreen widgets, Huawei says, which have a similar look to what we saw with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;iOS 14 last year&lt;/a&gt;. The operating system is also said to be better at returning to previously opened apps without losing your place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXFO41"&gt;The Chinese tech giant first announced HarmonyOS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798251/huawei-harmonyos-hongmengos-smartphones-internet-of-things-operating-system-android"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and the first device announced with the operating system was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/10/20798260/huawei-honor-smart-tv-vision-pro-harmonyos-china"&gt;Vision TV&lt;/a&gt; from its then-sub brand Honor (it later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;sold off the brand&lt;/a&gt; due to the pressures created by ongoing US sanctions). However, at last year’s Huawei developer conference, its consumer business CEO Richard Yu hinted that the operating system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430275/huawei-harmonyos-smartphones-release-date"&gt;could appear on smartphones in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlzd7a"&gt;Despite being marketed as a brand-new operating system, reports have suggested that HarmonyOS shares a lot of code with the open-source version of Android that it’s replacing. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;did a deep dive into HarmonyOS&lt;/a&gt;, and reported that it “is essentially an Android fork.” Huawei did not respond to our requests for comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4LaOS1"&gt;As well as phones, Huawei has also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22227707"&gt;new MatePad tablets running HarmonyOS&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the new HarmonyOS-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22227570"&gt;Huawei Watch 3 smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discovery announces new name of WarnerMedia merger: Warner Bros. Discovery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X7df69AASTjmp7Z2UiRDS4adu2w=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69372600/Discovery.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new logo and slogan for Warner Bros. Discovery | Image: Discovery&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QVGFEg"&gt;Discovery is merging with WarnerMedia, and it’s &lt;a href="https://ir.corporate.discovery.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2021/Discovery-Inc.-Announces-Warner-Bros.-Discovery-As-New-Name-For-Proposed-Leading-Global-Entertainment-Company/default.aspx"&gt;now announced&lt;/a&gt; a new name for the combined company: Warner Bros. Discovery. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/warner-bros-discovery-will-be-name-of-media-colossus-formed-in-merger-11622567102"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the name was first revealed during a staff meeting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPlaCJ"&gt;The merger was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;announced last month&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;amp;T said it would spin off WarnerMedia — the entertainment giant containing Warner Bros., HBO, DC Comics, and CNN, among many others — and that Discovery would take over the new company. But they didn’t have a new name prepared on the day the deal was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VT6VKq"&gt;Discovery CEO David Zaslav will be in charge of the merged group. WarnerMedia is by far the bigger company, though, with around three times the 2020 revenue and a roster of iconic characters and properties. Discovery brings to the table a huge archive of reality TV shows and a growing news and sports business in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9w3TS"&gt;“We believe it will be the best and most exciting place in the world to tell big, important and impactful stories across any genre – and across any platform: film, television and streaming,” Zaslav said in a statement today. The combined company is borrowing a line from the Warner Bros. classic &lt;em&gt;The Maltese Falcon &lt;/em&gt;for its slogan, “The stuff that dreams are made of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8Nb5e"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery expect the merger to wrap up in mid-2022, assuming it clears regulatory hurdles. AT&amp;amp;T shareholders will own 71 percent of the new company, so it’s really more like WarnerMedia is being freed from AT&amp;amp;T and picking up Discovery along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dliZyY"&gt;The hope is that the combined entertainment giant can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444031/warnermedia-discovery-merger-hbo-max-streaming-giant"&gt;become an even bigger player in streaming&lt;/a&gt; than the two are independently today. WarnerMedia runs HBO Max, which has been fairly successful so far, though it remains smaller than Netflix and Disney Plus. Discovery only recently launched Discovery Plus. Zaslav has said the combined company will put $20 billion per year toward new content, a number rivaling Netflix and exceeding Disney Plus, and that he hopes to eventually reach 400 million homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKDvCp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction June 1st, 3:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The deal is expected to close in mid-2022, not in mid-2020 as this article initially misstated, which would require a time machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s latest 11th Gen processor brings 5.0GHz speeds to thin and light laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1yJS7TmWuo1Cc0MXZtu2OI9JTE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69364881/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7WOe68"&gt;Intel made a splash earlier in May with the launch of its first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;11th Gen Tiger Lake H-series&lt;/a&gt; processors for more powerful laptops, but at Computex 2021, the company is also announcing a pair of new U-series chips — one of which marks the first 5.0GHz clock speed for the company’s U-series lineup of lower voltage chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0df8VH"&gt;Specifically, Intel is announcing the Core i7-1195G7 — its new top of the line chip in the U-series range — and the Core i5-1155G7, which takes the crown of Intel’s most powerful Core i5-level chip, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WnkU6O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel announces its new 11th Gen Tiger Lake CPUs, available on laptops this fall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5pSqBq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"&gt;Like the original 11th Gen U-series chips&lt;/a&gt;, the new chips operate in the 12W to 28W range. Both new chips are four core / eight thread configurations, and feature Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics (the Core i7-1195G7 comes with 96 EUs, while the Core i5-1155G7 has 80 EUs.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmgxVm"&gt;The Core i7-1195G7 features a base clock speed of 2.9GHz, but cranks up to a 5.0GHz maximum single core speed using Intel’s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology. The Core i5-1155G7, on the other hand, has a base clock speed of 2.5GHz and a boosted speed of 4.5GHz. Getting to 5GHz out of the box is a fairly recent development for laptop CPUs, period: Intel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512501/intel-9th-gen-laptop-desktop-processors-5ghz-update-specs-speed-features"&gt;first laptop processor to cross the 5GHz mark&lt;/a&gt; arrived in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykakbu"&gt;Along with the new processors, Intel has also announced its latest 5G modem solution for laptops — a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18250061/intel-qualcomm-m-2-5g-modules-computer-pc-laptop"&gt;M.2 card&lt;/a&gt; that device makers will be able to incorporate into their designs, called the Intel 5G Solution 5000. (While Intel famously sold off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition"&gt;smartphone 5G division to Apple&lt;/a&gt;, Intel has continued its efforts in other areas of the next-generation connectivity standard.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2NmZP"&gt;The new modem is a collaboration between Intel, Mediatek (which is handling the modem firmware) and Fibocom (which is actually manufacturing the modules), and will offer sub-6GHz 5G support and integrated eSIM technology. Intel says that Acer, Asus, and HP will all be offering laptops combing Intel’s Tiger Lake chips and new 5G Solution 5000 cards later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
