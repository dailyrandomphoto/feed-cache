    <title>Apple’s next iOS 14 beta will begin forcing developers to ask for permission to track you</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aaqfdv"&gt;Apple’s new privacy feature requiring developers ask  for permission to track iOS users for ad targeting is at last going live in the next iOS 14 beta with a planned full release some time this spring for non-beta users, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87OaT5"&gt;The announcement coincides with Data Privacy Day, as well as a speech on privacy from Apple CEO Tim Cook later today at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in Brussels. Apple initially planned for the feature to go live with the launch of iOS 14 last fall, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delayed its implementation to 2021&lt;/a&gt; in September of last year to give developers more time to comply. Today’s announcement narrows the launch window to this spring, but Apple is not commenting further on when exactly we might see it go live for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nd7oq5"&gt;Called App Tracking Transparency, the new opt-in requirement will mark a significant shift in how mobile app developers are able to collect data on iPhone owners and share that data with other firms to aid in advertising. Prior to the change, Apple let iPhone owners dig into their settings to disable this type of tracking. Now, instead of forcing users to be proactive about disabling it, Apple will demand developers ask for permission or risk suspension or removal from the App Store if they don’t comply or try to skirt the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QVqaP8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;App Tracking Transparency will force developers to ask for permission to track iPhone users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUxx5P"&gt;The primary way advertisers are able to, say, know when you are shopping for a new hat on one app before serving you ads for that same hat on another app is that a unique identifying code, the so-called Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), is linked to your device, collected by the first app, and shared with the second. That allows those apps to serve targeted ads and to measure whether the ad actually worked, for instance if you ended up purchasing that hat you saw in an Instagram ad by clicking an ad for the company’s online store in Google Chrome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwxSJD"&gt;Apple’s new opt-in requirement will make it so developers must have express consent from iOS device owners to allow their IDFA to be collected and shared across apps. App makers can still use other information you give them for the purpose of targeting advertising even if you opt not to let the app track you, but that information cannot be shared with another company for the purpose of ad tracking under Apple’s new policy. The sharing with other third-party companies is effectively what Apple refers to when it uses the word “tracking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHsXc9"&gt;Apple intends to strictly police any attempt to get around the opt-in requirement. For instance, it says app developers will not be allowed to disable app functionality of any kind if users say no to the opt-in, and that developers will also be barred from charging money or incentivizing users with in-app perks or giveaways to sway their decision one way or the other. Any app that tries to replace the IDFA with another identifying piece of information, like an email address, will be in violation of the opt-in requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBsYIk"&gt;Apple says the rules will also apply to its own apps, and the company already lets users disable personalized advertising the company serves within the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks app using data it collects from your device. (It’s worth noting that ad personalization is not the same as ad tracking, and mobile app companies can still personalize ads so long as they can disclose that with an App Store privacy label.) Apple has no history of sharing the information it collects with other companies, either, and it makes that clear in its ad personalization toggle in the iOS settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgmZqk"&gt;This is expected to affect both the companies that run ad networks, like Facebook, and the companies paying for the ads, like the aforementioned unnamed hat seller. That’s precisely why Facebook has come out as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures, which include not only this new opt-in requirement but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;app privacy labels it launched on the App Store last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yKojm"&gt;Facebook has positioned itself as a champion of small businesses that risk getting hurt by this privacy change, and small businesses do rely on Facebook’s ad network and its powerful targeting tools to reach customers. Past privacy changes to Apple’s mobile Safari browser did also have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;legitimate negative consequences for ad-supported businesses&lt;/a&gt; like news websites. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is an ad-supported news website.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6AgPuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook has emerged as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jA9whl"&gt;But in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; and statements to the press, Facebook has gone a step further and cast Apple as a hypocrite trying to exempt itself from the rules it forces on other developers and as greedy for encouraging app business models that rely less on advertising and more on subscriptions, of which Apple would theoretically get a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nw5Hub"&gt;“Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on an &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-ceo-zuckerberg-says-it.html"&gt;earnings call on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “This impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world, including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes.” Zuckerberg added that, “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people but the moves clearly track their competitor interests.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYOygv"&gt;Apple has consistently defended its choice as a way to give users more freedom over their privacy and refuted Facebook’s claims it intends to hold its first-party software to different standards. The showdown has emerged as one of the largest and most visible tech company feuds in recent memory, though it’s clear now Facebook has little to no leverage in the situation despite its defensiveness and public posturing. The changes are imminent, and Facebook will be forced to comply as it was with the privacy labels last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBm6te"&gt;To further hammer home its privacy philosophy, Apple has created a new online guide it’s calling “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fprivacy%2Fdocs%2FA_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F28%2F22253366%2Fapple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A Day in the Life of Your Data”&lt;/a&gt; that breaks down common ad tracking and targeting practices in the mobile app and web industries and presents statistics on the prevalence of these practices. Apple says the average mobile app contains six trackers that share your data with other apps, and that a “large and opaque industry has been amassing increasing amounts of personal data.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6M300o"&gt;“A complex ecosystem of websites, apps, social media companies, data brokers, and ad tech firms track users online and offline, harvesting their personal data. This data is pieced together, shared, aggregated, and monetized, fueling a $227 billion-a-year industry,” the guide reads. “This occurs every day, as people go about their daily lives, often without their knowledge or permission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTlXLA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook usage has soared during the pandemic, but the company warns of ‘significant uncertainty’ ahead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HStDhMW9rpARToE36CjcNxmKvUA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730404/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0581_1stills.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aPpRYl"&gt;Facebook finished 2020 much stronger financially than at the beginning of the year, proving its business could weather the coronavirus pandemic and even thrive thanks to skyrocketing screen time these past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UikNnA"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx"&gt;reported fourth quarter earnings on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; of more than $28 billion in revenue with profit of $11.2 billion, respective 31 percent and 53 percent year-over-year increases. As far as usage goes, Facebook is up all around, with more than 1.84 billion people using its main social network at least once a day in December 2020, an 11 percent year-over-year increase. As of December 31st, 2020, more than 2.8 billion people check Facebook at least once a month, a 12 percent jump from the year before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vDSQF"&gt;When measuring usage of its bundled family of apps that also includes Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp — a metric the company refers to as “family active people” — the numbers are even better, as usual. More than 2.6 billion people check one of Facebook’s apps every day (up 15 percent from 2019), while more than 3.3 billion check one of the apps at least once a month (up 14 percent). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0708f7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More than 3.3 billion people use a Facebook-owned app at least once a month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SkhwjL"&gt;Facebook’s business was largely unaffected by its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560969/facebook-political-ad-ban-extended-trump-2020-election-concede-misinformation"&gt;decision in October to temporarily ban political advertising&lt;/a&gt; following the US election. (The company extended the ban by one month in December, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215067/facebook-ads-georgia-runoff-political-ad-ban-zuckerberg"&gt;exempted advertising for the Georgia Senate races&lt;/a&gt;.) That was to be expected; political advertising pales in comparison to e-commerce, standard retailer, and small business ad spend on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ual4Pc"&gt;Facebook’s “Other” category, which includes its Portal video chat devices and Oculus virtual reality business, also fared quite well last quarter, with a 156 percent jump in revenue to $885 million. Last quarter included the launch of Facebook’s second-generation wireless Quest headset, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;, and Portal devices have seen surging sales all year as people shifted to remote work and virtual hangouts at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXvtXD"&gt;But it’s not all good news for Facebook looking ahead. The company says it will “continue to face significant uncertainty as we manage through a number of cross currents in 2021” in its earnings report, signaling concerns the company won’t be able to maintain the same pace of year-over-year growth as it enters the second half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqOtX2"&gt;Unsaid in its report are privacy changes from Apple that could have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;significant consequences for Facebook’s ad business&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;new mandated privacy labels&lt;/a&gt; and Apple’s upcoming plan to mandate app makers get user consent to track people on iOS devices. Earlier this month, Facebook’s WhatsApp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;delayed a new privacy policy update&lt;/a&gt; that was sending users fleeing the app for competitors like Signal and Telegram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpWrtm"&gt;“At the same time, in the first half of 2021, we will be lapping a period of growth that was negatively impacted by reduced advertising demand during the early stages of the pandemic,” the company writes. “As a result, we expect year-over-year growth rates in total revenue to remain stable or modestly accelerate sequentially in the first and second quarters of 2021. In the second half of the year, we will lap periods of increasingly strong growth, which will significantly pressure year-over-year growth rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WW2smV"&gt;Facebook also continues to weather its fair share of public relations and platform moderation controversies surrounding misinformation, election interference, and the recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242616/facebook-refers-decision-suspend-trump-oversight-board"&gt;banning of former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. That is in addition to a new wave of US regulatory scrutiny punctuated last month by an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;unprecedented Federal Trade Commission lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; seeking to unwind the company’s pricey acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. But those issues appear to have little effect whatsoever on the company’s bottom line, for now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>So you got a 5G phone, but is your plan ready? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w_lwL3NUDvxHGb7l3SNRe6r20AM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68580559/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;5G in the US isn’t mind-bogglingly fast, but it is going to get better | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Your guide to the current state of 5G carrier plans in the US, what they cost, and whether it’s worth upgrading your plan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0STAxL"&gt;You’re the proud owner of a new 5G phone — congratulations! We’ve got some bad news, though: if you live in the US, 5G &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/study-finds-that-us-5g-speeds-are-slower-than-14-other-countries"&gt;probably isn’t going to be the mind-bogglingly fast experience&lt;/a&gt; that you’ve been promised. For most regions, it’s just a little faster than the 4G speeds we’re used to using. But here’s the good news: 5G is going to get better, so if you have a 5G phone you may want to make sure your plan delivers it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUbp57"&gt;If you got a phone recently, there’s a good chance it supports 5G. Pretty much every new phone in 2021 — with the exception of some budget models — will offer some form of 5G support. Whatever your preferred brand or operating system, 5G is coming your way soon if you don’t have it already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1ylmN"&gt;Your phone is ready for the next big thing, but what about your data plan? Across the board, the major US carriers’ unlimited plans already include access to 5G. However, carriers offer a mix of 5G bands that vary in speed and coverage. It’s complicated, as all things 5G have been since it first appeared in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ov9vPM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s complicated, as all things 5G have been since it first appeared in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AeQgSC"&gt;Consider this your guide to the current state of 5G and data plans in the US — which ones include 5G, which don’t, what variety of 5G they include, and whether you should consider upgrading depending on your carrier’s implementation of 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7M860"&gt;One important note for those with a 5G phone: even if you discover that your current plan does include 5G and it’s available in your area, you may still need to upgrade to a new SIM card if you moved it over from an older device. A SIM card that was activated in a 4G device will still work with a 5G device, but you may have trouble connecting to the 5G network. Check with your carrier if you’re not seeing the little 5G logo pop up on your screen and you think you should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6877V"&gt;For comparison purposes, the prices listed in this article are for one line of service per month before taxes and fees. Additional lines bring down the monthly cost per line, but your total bill increases, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5eQLb4"&gt;Verizon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E2ySFp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Unless you live in one of the few areas with Verizon’s truly fast UW 5G, we don’t think there’s a reason to change your plan just yet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yeRjtT"&gt;Verizon offers two varieties of 5G, the faster of which it calls “Ultra Wideband” (also referred to as millimeter wave or mmWave) and is available only in certain parts of certain cities. It’s scarce, but it is mind-bogglingly fast, and you’ll see a 5G UW logo on your phone screen if your phone is using that network. Oh, and 5G UW signals don’t reach indoors for the most part, so if you’re spending most of your time inside your house or apartment right now, you probably wouldn’t pick it up even if you live in a place where it’s available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="vsmFJ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ultra Wideband is scarce but mind-bogglingly fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="AxSy3H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wnDLVU"&gt;“Nationwide” is the company’s other 5G, a low-band variety that’s slower than mmWave but offers much broader coverage. In fact, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/heres-why-verizon-iphone-users-must-turn-off-5g-right-now"&gt;sometimes a bit slower than 4G&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re not happy with the 5G speeds you’re getting, you may want to try limiting your phone to LTE and see if things improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wc9Ye8"&gt;Check &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fcoverage-map%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s coverage map&lt;/a&gt; to see what’s available in your area. If you do live in a city with UW 5G, be sure to zoom &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way in to see the exact areas and streets with coverage — they’re marked in a darker shade of red that will appear once you zoom in close enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt3rAT"&gt;Verizon’s Shared Data (data capped) plans and its $80-per-month basic unlimited plan include the lower-tier Nationwide 5G only. For access to UW in addition to Nationwide 5G, you’ll need at least the $90 “Play More” unlimited plan. Verizon offers $10 off those monthly prices if you enroll in auto pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkrFa3"&gt;Verizon also includes Nationwide 5G on its prepaid data plans, which start at $75 per month for unlimited data or $40 per month for a 5GB data-capped plan. The most expensive unlimited plan also includes UW 5G as of early 2021. There’s a $5 monthly discount for auto pay as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H6XaJU"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dGY28e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Don’t worry about switching up your AT&amp;amp;T plan for 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Rje9sa"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s history with 5G is… fraught. Early on, the company marketed what was essentially LTE technology as “5G E” and (rightfully) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;caught a lot of flak for it&lt;/a&gt;. You won’t see that term in any of the company’s marketing these days, but AT&amp;amp;T customers still might see a 5G E logo on their phone screen when connected to this service. If you do see it, know that what you’re getting is not really 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;
&lt;aside id="P0HVlL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G really isn’t worth upgrading for yet, but if you’re on any of the company’s unlimited plans, you wouldn’t need to anyway&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="gXk39F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248430"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C6XNQm"&gt;Outside of that debacle, AT&amp;amp;T has invested in its true 5G offerings, which are structured similarly to Verizon’s: a fast mmWave version called 5G Plus in limited places and slower but more widespread standard 5G coverage. However, 5G Plus may be even more scarce than Verizon’s UW 5G. The company doesn’t provide any coverage maps for it, and it says only that it is deployed in “select innovation zones” in parts of certain cities. Testers for &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks/2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;’s annual mobile network test&lt;/a&gt; didn’t encounter 5G Plus in cities where AT&amp;amp;T offers it. The carrier’s standard 5G is of the low-band variety similar to Verizon’s Nationwide, and &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; testers also found that it sometimes lagged behind 4G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCcuum"&gt;All of this is to say that AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G really isn’t worth upgrading your plan for yet, but if you’re on any of the company’s unlimited plans, you wouldn’t need to anyway. Both 5G and 5G Plus are included in all postpaid unlimited plans, which start at $75 per month ($65 with auto pay). The Unlimited Plus prepaid plan also includes it at $75 per month ($60 with auto pay). AT&amp;amp;T’s only postpaid 4GB data-capped plan doesn’t include 5G and neither do its other prepaid plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNimDg"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T may have had a somewhat rocky start with 5G, but the technology will improve. And for now at least, the company isn’t charging a premium for its fastest 5G variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5N4Cb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fmaps%2Fwireless-coverage.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T 5G coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZW3lLd"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="z7bVnx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: All of T-Mobile’s postpaid and prepaid plans include 5G. If you’re on the base postpaid unlimited plan and live in a congested area you might find you have more reliable access to 5G by upgrading. But no need if you don’t notice slowdowns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PxCgUp"&gt;Of the three big carriers, T-Mobile might be in the best position to bring truly faster-than-LTE 5G to the most people — but it doesn’t seem to be there quite yet. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s efforts have been concentrated around high and low-band offerings. T-Mobile offers both, too, but it’s also working on converting Sprint’s former midband frequencies to 5G. This might be a sweet spot: not as fast as the mmWave stuff, but genuinely faster than 4G. &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/race-to-5g-5g-limps-to-nationwide-status"&gt;Recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; shows the network isn’t delivering on that promise just yet, but T-Mobile promised to extend midband 5G to 100 million people by the end of this year and doesn’t look to be slowing down any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpSW0x"&gt;All of the company’s postpaid plans include 5G, starting with the $65 per month ($60 with autopay) Essentials plan. One caveat: customers on that base-level plan are the first ones subject to slowdowns when the network is congested. T-Mobile also offers 5G on its prepaid plans for both unlimited and data-capped options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="wjFqsx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248478"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TFa17r"&gt;For now, we think T-Mobile customers can stay put on their current plan. Essentials plan customers who are happy with their network speeds and don’t notice slowdowns probably wouldn’t gain much from upgrading just yet. But it will be interesting to see if T-Mobile can make good on its ambitious promises to bring meaningfully fast 5G to more of its customers in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA0ipT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcoverage%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile 5G coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m4L2q7"&gt;US Cellular&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tQnXJX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: All plans (pre- and postpaid) include access to 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJEhwO"&gt;US Cellular 5G is of the low-band variety, so it’s still only a little faster than 4G. But the good news is if you’re on US Cellular, you have access to the company’s 5G: all plans (pre- and postpaid) include it. And if you’re in a rural area, US Cellular is more likely to offer 5G to you now, while major carriers’ coverage is still mostly concentrated around bigger cities. So there’s not much to deliberate here, if you have a 5G phone and your area is covered, you should be able to connect. We just wouldn’t advise anyone to switch to US Cellular only because it offers 5G where they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xH1tu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uscellular.com%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US Cellular coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x37LzS"&gt;MVNOs: Cricket, Metro by T-Mobile, etc.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jpsQGR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: If you’re happy with your MVNO plan, don’t switch things up just for 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAFgq4"&gt;Most mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs, do include 5G on their plans. Cricket’s unlimited plan offers 5G access using AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network ($60 per month for one line). All Mint Mobile plans include access to 5G on T-Mobile’s network, and Metro by T-Mobile prepaid plans come with 5G access, starting with a 10GB plan for $40 / month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rpGfnM"&gt;A significant caveat though: since MVNOs don’t own the networks they use, carrier subscribers are likely to get preferential treatment when there’s congestion. If you’re looking for the best of the best speeds, one of the big three might be the way to go. But again, that reality is still a ways off. Chances are, you wouldn’t be upgrading to a night-and-day experience if you did switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gExXvj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article stated that only T-Mobile’s postpaid plans offer 5G. T-Mobile in fact offers 5G on all of its prepaid and postpaid plans. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgbGhl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 27, 2021: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon has added a new prepaid unlimited plan that includes UW 5G access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9hcLa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bond film delays are reportedly causing product placement havoc for brands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qvjb3ZQpmF0-RPwdzmuf2X3Js8Q=/0x0:893x595/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68726980/gsmarena_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image featuring Daniel Craig using an HMD device.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD Global&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0IsE2s"&gt;The latest James Bond movie’s pandemic-related delays are reportedly causing problems for its marketing deals, with advertisers concerned that the film may end up featuring outdated product placements, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/13847637/james-bond-re-shoots-product-placement-deals/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The 25th Bond film, &lt;em&gt;No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt;, is currently due to release in cinemas on October 8th, over a year after it was originally meant to release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAJpek"&gt;“Some of those things were the very latest models back when they started filming” a source told &lt;em&gt;The Sun, &lt;/em&gt;“but by the time the movie comes out now it will look like Daniel Craig and all of the other cast members are carrying something that has been out for ages. That isn’t really the point of these deals.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2JULk"&gt;Although the film will reportedly feature Omega watches, Bollinger champagne, and Adidas footwear, it seems likely that HMD Global’s Nokia phones are at risk of dating most quickly. HMD Global announced last year that the film &lt;a href="https://www.hmdglobal.com/press-releases/one-epic-shoot"&gt;would include its Nokia 8.3 5G&lt;/a&gt; from last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/no-time-to-dies-lashana-lynch-discusses-her-key-role-in-the-new-bond-movie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the film is also set to include the Nokia 7.2, which was first released in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TxVBgJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMQ7JEk-Ydw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uQsdlE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; reports that the movie could face reshoots to hide its outdated products, and quotes a source as saying that some scenes may be “carefully edited.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNPAB1"&gt;“The big tech firms want the stars to have all the new up-and-coming products to help promote them and sell them to fans,” the source tells &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;. “It means some of the scenes are going to have to be very carefully edited and looked at to bring things up to date.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uz1wHN"&gt;We may have already seen an example of this kind of editing at work. Although one of the film’s stars, Lashana Lynch, appears to be using a Nokia 8.3 5G in the ad above (note the camera flash to the left of the array), a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM3kPYj_Grw"&gt;previous version released in March 2020&lt;/a&gt; seems to feature a Nokia 5.3, complete with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and headphone jack on the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An ad released in March 2020 appears to show a Nokia 5.3 with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O862jl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt; was originally due to release in April 2020 but was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164789/james-bond-no-time-to-die-movie-delayed-coronavirus"&gt;delayed to November&lt;/a&gt; last year after the pandemic forced cinemas around the world to close. The film was subsequently delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499362/james-bond-no-time-to-die-delay-april-2021"&gt;to April 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243496/bond-uncharted-ghostbusters-movie-delays"&gt;then to October 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Provided no more delays happen, the movie is currently slated to release around a year and a half after its original planned debut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q3GDv"&gt;Thankfully for HMD, there’s at least one phone in the film that’s unlikely to date too much. &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/no-time-to-dies-lashana-lynch-discusses-her-key-role-in-the-new-bond-movie"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt; will also feature a classic Nokia 3310, a phone that originally released way back in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVCS6p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra is first with new power efficient OLED display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X05E1VQO6Wexse-pPTai86o76kU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68726594/vpavic_210118_4377_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jQ5yMC"&gt;Samsung’s latest flagship, the Galaxy S21 Ultra, is its first phone to feature Samsung Display’s &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005831/en/Samsung-Display-Unveils-New-Low-power-OLED-Display-for-Smartphones/"&gt;new power-efficient OLED panels&lt;/a&gt;. In a press release, Samsung says the new display consumes 16 percent less power thanks to a “just-developed organic material” that means “electrons flow faster and more easily across the display’s organic layer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz8udY"&gt;“In other words,” Samsung explains, the technology means its “OLED panels can create brighter light while consuming less power, which improves the battery lifetime.” A smartphone’s display is typically one of its most power-hungry components, so efficiency gains here can have a big impact on the overall battery life of the device. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we remarked that the S21 Ultra has excellent battery life that lasts “beyond a full day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3OYpiH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Electrons flow faster and more easily across the display’s organic layer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="58fMXQ"&gt;Samsung confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the S21 Ultra uses an LTPO (aka a &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/666267/what-an-ltpo-display/"&gt;Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide&lt;/a&gt;) display, but it’s not the first of Samsung’s phones to do so. Last year, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=1334"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra also used LTPO display panels, which Samsung brands as HOP (Hybrid Oxide and Polycrystalline silicon). However, this week’s announcement says the S21 Ultra is the “first” to use the more efficient panels, suggesting Samsung Display has further refined the technology compared to the Note 20 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyJDW9"&gt;Prior to appearing in smartphones, LTPO displays have been used in smart watches. &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; notes that the Apple Watch Series 4 featured an LTPO display produced by LG, while Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active 2 used an LTPO display produced by Samsung Display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONy3Zk"&gt;If reports are accurate, Apple’s next flagship iPhones could soon benefit from Samsung Display’s power-efficient panel technology. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2128"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the South Korean company is in line to supply LTPO panels for Apple’s 2021 iPhones. According to the report, Apple will use 120Hz LTPO OLED displays in two of its four iPhones in the second half of the year, while the other two will have more traditional OLED panels. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new iPhone update fixes security bugs, so it’s best to install it ASAP</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jmkq7k"&gt;Apple just released iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4, and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146"&gt;the update notes&lt;/a&gt; contain some worrying language (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Under kernel updates, Apple notes that “a malicious application may be able to elevate privileges,” and under WebKit updates, it says “a remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code execution.” After both statements, the update notes say, “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCPp57"&gt;What this means, broadly, is that you should update your iOS devices as soon as possible. To put the language into plain terms: Apple found a security hole in its operating systems, and it also has evidence that someone may have exploited it. The update notes don’t have any further details, so for now, we don’t know who may have used the security breach or what they may have been using it for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X02zGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not time for cyber-lockdown, but it is time to update&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWXa7u"&gt;However it was used, the security breaches aren’t minor ones. An application being able to elevate privileges means that it could do things it’s not supposed to be able to do. Again, there aren’t any details, but broadly speaking, it means a malicious app could’ve bypassed some of Apple’s security protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RlwXb"&gt;The WebKit exploit isn’t better. A remote attacker being able to cause arbitrary code execution means an attacker could do things on your phone just from you visiting a website they control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nFOBQ"&gt;This isn’t to say it’s time to go into total cyber-lockdown mode, but it does mean that 14.4 isn’t an update you want to put off for a while. In the meantime, Apple says it’ll provide additional details soon, so we’ll keep an eye out for more information about the exploits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon plans to almost double its mmWave 5G coverage this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4S_z-943QoZMKipjS9DfyurWuSs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724737/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JXMAO1"&gt;Verizon has big 5G plans for 2021 after formally launching its next-gen network in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509364/verizon-5g-network-ultra-wideband-nationwide-apple-event"&gt;October of last year&lt;/a&gt;, and close to the top of its list of priorities is expanding coverage of its ultra-fast mmWave coverage. That flavor of 5G is currently restricted to select areas within select cities in the US, and it’s highly dependent on your proximity to a Verizon 5G site due to the inherent technology that powers it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAXx2l"&gt;Marketed under the name 5G Ultra Wideband (5G UW), this variety of 5G is the type with high speeds but poor coverage, meaning Verizon has its work cut out for it expanding network coverage in 2021. But in its earnings report on Tuesday, the company says it plans to nearly double its 5G UW network this year by adding more than 14,000 new “sites.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="baqSU8"&gt;Now, it’s kind of ambiguous what a “site” means. Adding a 5G UW site sounds, in theory, like a way to expand the coverage area of the service, or at the very least to improve the connection strength in an existing area of coverage, considering mmWave tech relies on rigging up networks of antennas, power supplies, and other equipment to help boost range and blanket areas that are, right now, only served by slower and farther-reaching standard LTE and low-band 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjuCUF"&gt;Some of that equipment is apparently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249058/5g-cellular-equipment-houston"&gt;already showing up unannounced on the lawns of Houston residents&lt;/a&gt; who don’t really have a say in whether their slice of county-owned yard has to play host to these “ground fixtures” the size of chest cooler. Yet, it’s not clear if Verizon plans to add test sites primarily to improve the range and consistency of the network in existing markets, to bring coverage to new ones entirely, or a mix of both. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZAxTn"&gt;That said, Verizon is, in effect, claiming it will double its coverage area to 30,000 sites by the end of the year. The company also says it plans to add 20 cities to its 5G UW coverage list, as well as 20-plus cities for its in-home 5G internet service. Presumably, that will be done through the site expansion to some degree. As of &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/verizon-hits-60-city-goal-with-4-new-super-fast-5g-cities#:~:text=Verizon%20today%20hit%20the%2060,%22%20millimeter%2Dwave%205G%20network."&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon surpassed its 60-city milestone for its 5G UW network, and earlier this week, it announced that prepaid customers can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248705/verizon-prepaid-5g-uw"&gt;begin accessing its 5G UW network&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon says Fios internet should be returning to normal in the Northeast after disruptive outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/STHJWLoKzC7slsq44ZHqbze82kQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68722836/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SK6kEZ"&gt;Verizon says that it has resolved issues with Fios, its fiber-optic network, that affected many locations in the Northeastern US on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfDvcT"&gt;“Yesterday there was a broad internet issue that caused a temporary degradation of service to customers in the Northeast for just under an hour,” a Verizon spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “There was an unrelated fiber cut that impacted a very small number of customers in Brooklyn, NY. The cause of the cut was a tree falling on the cable and service has been restored.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiIa1L"&gt;Users began reporting problems with Verizon &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt; shortly after 11AM ET, and the volume of reports peaked at more than 22,000 on Tuesday. Hotspots for problems on &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;Downdetector’s outage map for Verizon&lt;/a&gt; included Boston, New York City, Washington, DC, and more. A few &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers experienced outages as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3oXjw"&gt;“An internet issue impacting the quality of our Fios service throughout the Northeast has been resolved,” Verizon said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354171858720075776"&gt;via its support account on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to many users on the platform Tuesday afternoon. “Network performance and service levels are returning to normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PXvDm5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good afternoon and happy new year Darren, Thanks so much for reaching out to us. An internet issue impacting the quality of our Fios service throughout the Northeast has been resolved. Network performance and service levels are returning to normal. Please DM us if not back.  ^RME&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Support (@VerizonSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354171858720075776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zsiMLJ"&gt;The Verizon Support Twitter account reported &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354109889572982786"&gt;the fiber cut in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; at 11:52AM ET on Tuesday, and as of 4:04PM ET the same day, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354173506884415488"&gt;the company said the cut&lt;/a&gt; was still affecting customers in the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90C7DJ"&gt;People also reported issues with Google, Zoom, Gmail, and more &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt;, but the reports appear to have come from the same places that were experiencing problems with Fios. &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=status"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://status.zoom.us/"&gt;Zoom’s&lt;/a&gt; status pages aren’t showing any outages, so it’s possible problems with those services in the Northeastern US were tied to the Fios outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANgNyb"&gt;Acting Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairwoman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1354132790044815360"&gt;Jessica Rosenworcel said&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday that the FCC’s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau is looking into the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GrJNwU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have seen reports of internet-related outages on the East Coast, making it difficult for people to work  remotely and go to school online. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FCC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FCC&lt;/a&gt; Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau is working to get to the bottom of what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1354132790044815360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="v6JxWC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 27th, 11:39AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Verizon the outage and fiber cut in Brooklyn have been fixed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is opening up its full tweet archive to academic researchers for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DwzWEac3lDv9Fls_5_cZS3CPVKw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68723365/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V3gBCP"&gt;Twitter on Tuesday announced a significant shift in the type of data it makes available for free to third-party academic researchers interested in studying user behaviors and trends related to online discourse. Now, Twitter says it will no longer require researchers pay for premium or enterprise developer access and will instead make the “full history of public conversation” — what the company refers to as its full-archive search endpoint — available to any researcher or developer who applies as part of the launch of a new academic research track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83HTrd"&gt;The change is part of the company’s ongoing efforts to improve the Twitter API, the set of tools it makes available for those outside the company to build something on top of Twitter or use its mountains of data for research studies. Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364644/twitter-api-v2-new-access-tiers-developer-portal-support-developers"&gt;launched its new and improved API last summer&lt;/a&gt; as a way to make amends with the developer and research communities, both of which have often found themselves at odds with the platform’s continuous and sometimes adversarial product development over the years. This contentious relationship began most notably in 2012, when Twitter decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/23/3263481/twitter-api-third-party-developers"&gt;cut off key developer access to the platform&lt;/a&gt; to maintain stricter control over what data it let potential competitors use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SDe1qs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our developer platform hasn’t always made it easy for researchers to access the data they need.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5MjvWQ"&gt;Twitter acknowledges the less-than-ideal relationship it’s had with the developer and research communities. “Our developer platform hasn’t always made it easy for researchers to access the data they need, and many have had to rely on their own resourcefulness to find the right information. Despite this, for over a decade, academic researchers have used Twitter data for discoveries and innovations that help make the world a better place,” write product managers Adam Tornes and Leanne Trujillo in a &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2021/enabling-the-future-of-academic-research-with-the-twitter-api.html"&gt;blog post published today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBMDCn"&gt;Tornes and Trujillo point to steps Twitter has taken in the past year to improve its tools, including the release of a COVID-19 endpoint for free and a beta of the new academic research track to gather proper feedback ahead of today’s public launch. And the company is making a concerted effort to convince researchers it wants to help them, especially now that social media discourse has become more crucial in understanding online misinformation, election interference, hate speech, and other topics that took center stage during and after the 2020 US election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07L7Em"&gt;In addition to opening up its public archive, Twitter says it’s also giving approved applicants a higher monthly tweet volume cap of 10 million tweets, which is 20 times higher than what was available on the standard free track before. It’s also allowing more precise filtering to help researchers pinpoint tweets and other data relevant to what they’re studying and “new technical and methodological guides” for helping researchers find what they’re looking for and better make use of it in studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InpZt0"&gt;Twitter says interested academics and developers can apply to the new academic research  track on the company’s &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/use-case"&gt;developer website&lt;/a&gt;. The track will, however, come with some limitations. For now, the company will not grant access to independent researchers or journalists. You’ll have to be a student or part of an academic institution. Twitter also says it will be not be providing access to data from accounts that have been suspended or banned, which could complicate efforts to study hate speech, misinformation, and other types of conversations that violate Twitter rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWeL1x"&gt;This also means the account @realDonaldTrump is also not accessible through Twitter’s archive following US social media sites’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218805/donald-trump-platforms-bans-facebook-twitter-youtube"&gt;widespread deplatforming of Trump following the deadly US Capitol attack&lt;/a&gt;. Still, Trump’s tweets are archived online through his &lt;a href="https://www.trumplibrary.gov/"&gt;official presidential library&lt;/a&gt;, while independent websites and database tools like &lt;a href="https://www.thetrumparchive.com/"&gt;The Trump Twitter Archive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/realDonaldTrump"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;’s Politwoops&lt;/a&gt; have also been preserving the former president’s tweets, included the deleted ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eT2XhI"&gt;“We’ve heard a lot of interest from the academic research community in studying @realDonaldTrump,” Trujillo said during a call with reporters on Monday. “We’re having conversations internally about how we might give thoughtful consideration to the study of this topic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRUe7X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 26th, 3:47PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added more information around access to suspended or banned accounts and former President Donald Trump’s tweets. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s creator-focused Xperia Pro arrives in the US priced at $2,499</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BGsiYZS-3P06Gr77R_wAkXnmuIE=/0x0:9504x6336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721906/Xperia_PRO___DC___HDMI_Monitoring_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia Pro can be used as an external monitor for a camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PADRfM"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/professional-smartphones/xperia-pro"&gt;Xperia Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Sony’s first smartphone with 5G in the US, is launching today for $2,499.99. Sony is targeting the device at professional users, who it hopes will use its HDMI input to turn the phone into an external camera monitor and its 5G connectivity to quickly upload or live-stream footage. Sony says it currently has no plans to release the Xperia Pro in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZjkgE"&gt;Outside of its HDMI input and US 5G support, the Xperia Pro’s hardware is very similar to last year’s Xperia 1 II (which shipped with 5G support in Europe but was limited to 4G LTE in the US). That means it’s powered by a Snapdragon 865 processor with a 4,000mAh battery, and around the back, there are the same 12-megapixel wide, telephoto, and ultrawide cameras. The Xperia Pro also includes a tall 6.5-inch 21:9 aspect ratio OLED display, which Sony is once again describing as 4K but actually has a sub-4K resolution of &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/professional-smartphones/xperia-pro/specifications#specifications:~:text=4K%20HDR%20OLED%20(3840x1644)"&gt;3840 x 1644&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tph7hhTkcejHf5YX-8fs2ufGytQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260192/01_Xperia_Pro_group_black_withclock_Large.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although it’s got the form-factor of a smartphone, the Xperia Pro is aimed at professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aEsgyn2odI1RSQUFDlj5JYHy0Bo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260194/Xperia_Pro_40R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its HDMI input sits next to its USB-C port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OwgCb2"&gt;At $1,200, the Xperia 1 II was already an expensive smartphone, and the Xperia Pro is over double its price. But Sony argues its 5G support and HDMI input could be incredibly useful to professional users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3TPgn"&gt;Let’s start with the HDMI input, which is located on the bottom of the phone where the Xperia 1 II’s USB-C port. (The Xperia Pro’s USB-C port is still on the bottom of the device, but it’s shifted to the left.) Sony says it’s capable of taking up to a 4K 60fps HDR video stream and should work with any cameras that have an HDMI output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sONXBY"&gt;In practice, what this means is that you can connect the Xperia Pro to a camera’s HDMI output, for example, and use its bigger screen to get a clearer view of whatever’s being filmed or photographed. You can pinch to zoom into the image displayed on the screen or overlay gridlines to help with framing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Or04Ek"&gt;Where this functionality gets especially interesting is with the Xperia Pro’s 5G connectivity, which enables it to act as a live-streaming link for your camera in addition to being an external monitor. The Xperia Pro can stream footage from its HDMI input to YouTube directly, and it supports StreamLabs and StreamYard for streaming to other platforms like Twitch and Facebook Live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKYRzS"&gt;The phone supports both Sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G, and Sony claims that it has a unique four-way mmWave antenna array to maximize reception. There’s also a built-in network visualizer app that can be assigned to its shortcut key to help you find the best position to get a signal. Hopefully Sony’s software and hardware are enough to mitigate mmWave’s problems with limited coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7k6EnE"&gt;Ever since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147066/sony-xperia-phone-1-ii-specs-price-features-5g-triple-camera-headphone-jack-wireless-changing"&gt;started teasing the Xperia Pro&lt;/a&gt; early last year, Sony has emphasized that it’s a device for professional users, and its $2,499.99 price tag makes this more obvious than ever. When I asked Sony why it hasn’t released a 5G device aimed at consumers in the US, it told me it’s waiting for the technology to be more broadly implemented by carriers. Until then, Sony says it’s focusing on professional users who it thinks can get more use out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAiBCZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
