    <title>Oppo Find X3 Pro review: the Chinese phone to beat</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A legit flagship from one of China’s biggest brands&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hCylNm"&gt;You might know of Oppo as a company opaquely related to OnePlus, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318941/china-smartphone-market-share-oppo-huawei-vivo-apple-xiaomi-january-2021"&gt;recently became&lt;/a&gt; the leading smartphone maker in China — the beneficiary of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634046/huawei-donald-trump-us-trade-war-china-android-google-ban-5g-future"&gt;Huawei’s sanctions-induced&lt;/a&gt; slide in sales even in its home market. As such, the new Find X3 Pro flagship is an important handset for the company, presenting an opportunity to solidify its place as a major player in premium smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe1vfL"&gt;And this time around, Oppo isn’t keeping the Find X3 Pro in China. The company still doesn’t sell phones in the US, but there are international models with Google services available in countries like the UK, where it starts at £1,099 (about $1,500). If you have the option and you’re shopping for a high-end phone, it’s worth checking out, because this is one of the sleekest Android devices you’ll see this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vbGf9R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10474436"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SqUTec"&gt;From the front, the Find X3 Pro looks almost identical to the OnePlus 9 Pro. Both phones have a 6.7-inch 1440p 120Hz curved OLED screen with a hole-punch selfie camera in the top left; since Oppo and OnePlus share a supply chain, it’s almost certainly the same Samsung panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwM1hp"&gt;Turn the Find X3 Pro around, though, and it looks nothing like the OnePlus — or any other phone, really. The camera bump is somewhat reminiscent of the iPhone 12 Pro in its arrangement of three lenses within a rounded square, but the bump is part of a single piece of glass that smoothly rises up to accommodate the cameras. Coupled with the mirrored finish, it makes the phone look like something out of &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2&lt;/em&gt; — at least until you get your fingerprints all over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tBaLV"&gt;The Find X3 Pro feels relatively light and thin for a 2021 flagship phone, at 193g and 8.3mm thick, and the total lack of sharp edges anywhere on the device makes it very comfortable to hold. I’ve also been using it with an included Kevlar-style case that preserves almost all of the device’s thinness, which is a relief because this is one phone I would not want to risk dropping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkuPUXSiVmuGJfavu3V4-IpOqRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480715/DSCF7701.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Find X3 Pro has a microscope camera with a built-in ring light.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Z2Gh2Q"&gt;Like the OnePlus 9 Pro, the Find X3 Pro has a very good screen. However, Oppo is aiming to differentiate it with what it describes as the first full-path 10-bit color management system for Android, allowing you to capture and view more than a billion colors as opposed to the 16.7 million on other devices. The Find X3 Pro software even includes eye tests to help the display compensate for various forms of color blindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCcIZw"&gt;I haven’t been able to see a huge difference between this and other displays in general use, but we don’t yet live in a 10-bit world. In all likelihood, you’ll only ever make use of this capability by creating your own content with the Find X3 Pro’s cameras, and even then the advantage is going to seem niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrn53l"&gt;As for the cameras themselves, the Find X3 Pro has a respectable array of hardware. The heart of the system is two identical 50-megapixel Sony IMX 766 sensors for the main camera and the ultrawide; it’s not the biggest sensor out there, but it more than holds its own against flagship competitors. Oppo’s color tuning and HDR grading is relatively restrained, and it’s both unusual and refreshing to have an ultrawide that performs just as well in terms of resolution and dynamic range as the primary camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sample photo from the Find X3 Pro’s main camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5aI06HOVYn0d5jeHOo-9aJQ0TgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480719/IMG20210318202038_20210430172632.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sample photo from the Find X3 Pro’s main camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YNZb5B5TzKbuQ9qxqjMeFurwGG4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480720/IMG20210327170502_20210430172525.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sample photo from the Find X3 Pro’s ultrawide camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pU_Y7-9HrZ2N760iQBcaUAH4lyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480722/IMG20210319175637_20210430172609.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sample photo from the Find X3 Pro’s main camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHM8YDwiNbTn088S1Ugo13J2Xco=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480731/IMG20210306175021_20210430180033.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RuAbNM"&gt;There’s also a 13-megapixel 2x telephoto camera, which doesn’t match the other cameras’ performance. This is a little disappointing from Oppo, which did more than any other company to popularize periscope telephoto cameras. Granted, zoom lenses are never the best-quality optics on a smartphone, but this feels like a step back from the 5x unit on last year’s Find X2 Pro. You could make the case that a 2x zoom is more versatile because it improves the quality of shots between 2x to 4.9x, but why not include both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxcT13"&gt;I can ask the “why not both” question with a reasonable degree of fairness because Oppo chose to allocate a large section of the camera bump to a bizarre microscope tool. The three-megapixel sensor has a lens in front of it that Oppo says is capable of up to 60x magnification, and there’s even a ring light around the glass to illuminate subjects that would otherwise be obscured by the phone’s shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3c3eH"&gt;Is this cool? Admittedly, yes. It’s quite difficult to get subjects in full focus because of the extremely shallow depth of field, but you can absolutely capture ethereal images unlike anything you’ve ever seen from a smartphone by holding the Find X3 Pro up to threads, food, or OLED screens. But is it useful? Perhaps this is a failure of imagination on my part, but I think I’d take the periscope zoom. If you can think of a ton of reasons you might want a microscope-class camera on a phone, by all means enjoy this one.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A desk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lJRwTJ"&gt;The Find X3 Pro’s overall performance is as good as you’d expect from any other Snapdragon 888-equipped flagship. Oppo’s ColorOS skin is far snappier than it used to be, to the point that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344054/oneplus-9-oppo-coloros-in-china-hydrogenos"&gt;OnePlus itself is using it for phones in China now&lt;/a&gt;. The 4,500mAh battery doesn’t quite make this a two-day phone, but I never had any problem getting through a single day of heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUwrvF"&gt;Battery life is helped by the fact that Oppo has finally put put wireless charging on a flagship phone. This was by far my biggest complaint about its predecessor — it might not be a big deal for everyone, but if you’re used to wireless charging, the lack of it is absolutely a dealbreaker. Oppo’s 30W wireless system can supposedly charge the Find X3 Pro to 100 percent in 80 minutes, though I don’t have the necessary proprietary charger to test that. The wired charger, meanwhile, is 65W and gets you a 40-percent charge in ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p7RQsYsmJliIP3hSNQ3WVIpnCP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480716/DSCF7705.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Find X3 Pro looks very similar to the OnePlus 9 Pro from the front.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7BcYva"&gt;It sounds minor, but the addition of wireless charging is really all I needed to be happy with the Find X3 Pro as an everyday phone. I’ve been using it daily for about six weeks now, and I have very few complaints. I could’ve done without the microscope camera, sure, but Oppo is now as capable as any other Android manufacturer at turning in legitimately premium, performant phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItR0Wa"&gt;Don’t think you’ll get it at the sort of brand discount that OnePlus made its name with, though. The Find X3 Pro’s starting price in the UK is just £50 less than Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra. I think the Find X3 Pro is a reasonable competitor to that device, but I can’t see too many people picking it over the larger and more trusted brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sqFIOO"&gt;Still, the Find X3 Pro is an excellent device on merit, and further cements Oppo as a company worth paying attention to. This shouldn’t be surprising, of course, but the best phone from one of China’s biggest players is one of the best phones you’ll find anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple invests another $45 million in Gorilla Glass maker Corning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j4n_Ay95t5IS-URje6SNzqrAFuA=/11x0:1949x1292/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69261932/Apple_awards_Corning_an_additional_45_million_dollars_team_member_051021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corning manufactures glass for Apple and many Android device makers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PU0nfd"&gt;Apple is awarding Corning another $45 million investment from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund, in addition to the $450 million it’s already given to the US-based company over the past four years. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-awards-corning-45-million-from-its-advanced-manufacturing-fund%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428372%2Fapple-corning-45-million-investment-gorilla-glass-ceramic-shield-foldable-bendable-glass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the investment will “expand Corning’s manufacturing capacity in the US and drive research and development into innovative new technologies that support durability and long-lasting product life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFS5I0"&gt;Corning provides glass for a variety of Apple products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. The two companies have a history &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687299/plastic-iphone-gorilla-glass-origin-story-steve-jobs"&gt;dating back to the original iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, they collaborated on the iPhone 12 lineup’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509008/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-mini-displays-ceramic-hardened"&gt;Ceramic Shield technology&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple claims is “tougher than any smartphone glass” and makes its latest flagships four times more resistant to damage from drops. As well as Apple, Corning’s Gorilla Glass is used in phones from &lt;a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/products-with-gorilla-glass/smartphones.html"&gt;countless Android manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; including Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uh0Yrf1t9rpNe1vgj3Ofrwsth9I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19729421/corning_4k_bendable_glass.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corning’s ultra-thin glass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VmUHFo"&gt;Apple doesn’t say exactly how Corning will use the $45 million investment, but its timing coincides with &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/02/kuo-8-inch-foldable-iphone-2023/"&gt;recent reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple could launch a foldable iPhone in 2023. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251328/apple-corning-foldable-display-gorilla-glass-bendable-smartphone"&gt;Back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; we heard Corning was developing a bendable version of its glass, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;last February&lt;/a&gt; the company said it expects devices using the technology to reach the market in 12 to 18 months. If it works, the glass could allow for durable foldable smartphones that don’t require a layer of plastic protection used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/16/21139897/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-ultra-thin-glass-durability-scratch-test-jerryrigeverything"&gt;Samsung’s latest foldables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvSteK"&gt;“Today, when you buy a phone with Gorilla Glass, you’re touching glass … that’s what we’re working towards,” Corning said of its ambitions for bendable glass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vivo promises three years of Android updates for upcoming flagships</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g9t7Zt"&gt;Vivo’s upcoming X-series flagship phones will receive three years of Android OS upgrades and security updates, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vivo-commits-to-three-years-of-android-upgrades-for-future-premium-x-series-devices-301286977.html"&gt;the company announ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vivo-commits-to-three-years-of-android-upgrades-for-future-premium-x-series-devices-301286977.html#:~:text=SHENZHEN%2C%20China%2C%20May%209%2C,models%20launching%20after%20July%202021"&gt;ced today&lt;/a&gt;. The policy will come into force for phones launched after July 2021 in Europe, Australia, and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDdCFX"&gt;“We are making a promise to our customers that they will be able to enjoy a premium smartphone experience for an extended period and continue to benefit from the latest software features,” Vivo’s CTO and senior vice president Yujian Shi said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGBMwn"&gt;With today’s announcement, Vivo is joining a small but growing group of Android manufacturers promising three years of OS updates for their flagship smartphones. Google has long had a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en-GB#:~:text=pixel%20phones%20get%20android%20version%20updates%20for%20at%20least%203%20years%20from%20when%20the%20device%20first%20became%20available%20on%20the%20google%20store"&gt;similar policy for its Pixel phones&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;Samsung announced&lt;/a&gt; a “three generation” OS policy covering some Galaxy devices, joined by HMD in April with a promise of two years of Android OS updates and three years of security updates on its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22371937/hmd-nokia-x20-x10-g20-g10-c20-c10-android-phones-release-date-news-features"&gt;X-series phones&lt;/a&gt;. Even LG said it would offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22373088/lg-android-update-three-year-pledge-after-leaving-mobile-business"&gt;three years of Android OS updates&lt;/a&gt; the same week it announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22373088/lg-android-update-three-year-pledge-after-leaving-mobile-business"&gt;exiting the smartphone business&lt;/a&gt;. This year, Samsung added that select devices would also get an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;additional year of security updates&lt;/a&gt;, for a total of four years of support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xogXxg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A premium smartphone experience for an extended period”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bXcng6"&gt;Three years of OS updates is a big improvement over the two years that’s previously been the standard for most Android manufacturers, but in the future this could extend to as much as four years. Last December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22178833/google-qualcomm-snapdragon-888-faster-android-updates-four-years"&gt;Google and chip manufacturer Qualcomm announced&lt;/a&gt; they were working to make it easier for manufacturers to offer as much as four generations of Android OS and security updates, starting with devices equipped with Qualcomm’s latest flagship processor, the Snapdragon 888.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSsGwB"&gt;Vivo’s new policy puts it ahead of fellow BBK Electronics smartphone brands OnePlus and Oppo. &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-software-maintenance-schedule.862347/"&gt;As of 2018&lt;/a&gt;, OnePlus’s official policy has been to offer two years of Android version upgrades and three years of security updates. Meanwhile, the most recent statement we could find from Oppo (&lt;a href="https://ausdroid.net/2021/03/22/oppo-find-x3-series-buyers-promised-at-least-2-years-security-updates-and-2-new-android-versions/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;AusDroid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says the company offers two years of security updates, and that it’s general policy is to offer two generations of Android OS updates. Today’s announcement will undoubtedly create pressure on Oppo and OnePlus to follow Vivo’s example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmyzZg"&gt;These figures pale in comparison to Apple’s update history. Last year it released the latest version of iOS, version 14, on devices as old as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fuk%2Fios%2Fios-14%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DPlus-%2Ciphone%25206s%2C-iPhone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428342%2Fvivo-android-updates-three-years-x-series-phones-july-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2015’s iPhone 6S&lt;/a&gt;, the fifth major update to have come to the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE Blade 11 Prime review: wireless charging for under $200</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re already invested in a wireless charging lifestyle, the Blade 11 Prime is a budget phone to match it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FhlERh"&gt;The ZTE Blade 11 Prime offers one standout feature in a field of largely similar sub-$200 phones: wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCrkxr"&gt;In the smartphone trickle-down economy, wireless charging is basically guaranteed on any flagship-level phone, but it’s still hit-and-miss among midrange phones and all but absent from the budget class. You’re much more likely to find a really big battery on a sub-$200 phone than wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvbdFz"&gt;Outside of that feature, the $192 Blade 11 Prime’s specs are much the same as competing models like the Galaxy A12 and Moto G Play. Like those models, it offers a 6.5-inch 720p LCD, though it includes a little more RAM (4GB compared to 3GB) and a little less battery capacity (4,000mAh compared to 5,000mAh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4iWF3f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10488560"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tNoWZ2"&gt;Choosing a phone that’s priced under $500 means you need to pick your priorities carefully, and that’s even more true of a $200 phone. If wireless charging is your chosen priority, then I have good news: the ZTE Blade 11 Prime is the budget-priced phone for you. If it’s not a major priority and more of a nice-to-have item, then I’d suggest looking elsewhere. You won’t do a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; better on any individual feature, like a better screen or camera, but you can do a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H7aGzfYqtO3jDkBBbJVlrwVscPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499384/DSC00618.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blade 11 Prime supports the Qi wireless charging standard at 5W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZXqSGm"&gt;ZTE Blade 11 Prime screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0RE5qQ"&gt;The Blade 11 Prime is on the bigger side with a 6.5-inch display. Its 720p resolution is stretched a little thin here, and you’ll notice certain images looking a little pixelated if you look closely. The screen gets nice and bright, but its auto-brightness setting kept bringing the level down a little too dim for my liking. I also noticed faint repeating vertical lines on dark parts of the screen indicative of a low-quality panel — not a huge distraction but visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCGzys"&gt;It doesn’t have the biggest battery in its class, but the Blade 11’s battery performance is generally good anyway. I got about two days of light, mostly Wi-Fi use on a single charge. Spending a full day out and about on LTE would drain the battery faster, but most people could expect to get through at least a full day of heavy use before needing to charge up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lA0FtC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Blade 11 Prime’s marquee feature, wireless charging, works well if a little slowly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="84Tx3H"&gt;The Blade 11 Prime’s marquee feature, wireless charging, works well if a little slowly; the phone supports Qi charging at 5W. Taking it from 50 percent to a full charge took almost exactly two hours, during which the phone got warm but not worryingly so. As long as you don’t expect incredible speeds, wireless charging is a convenient option on the Blade 11 Prime, particularly if you’re the type of person who charges your phone overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFG6iS"&gt;We don’t expect dazzling processing speed from a $200 phone, but the ZTE Blade 11 Prime falls a little short even considering its price. It uses a MediaTek MT6762 Helio P22 chipset with a relatively healthy 4GB of RAM, but this combination struggles with even light tasks like scrolling through Instagram or Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XvFtlB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There was significant stuttering and hesitation just browsing my usual social media timelines&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SSJlfT"&gt;Apps open quickly enough, but there was significant stuttering and hesitation just browsing my usual social media timelines or scrolling through the home screen app drawer. Some slowness is expected in this price bracket, but I didn’t see as much consistent stuttering using the Motorola Moto G Play recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyYQzw"&gt;The ZTE Blade 11 Prime ships with Android 11, which is nice — some of its slightly less recent competitors are still on 10 waiting for an update. ZTE says there’s no plan to offer any additional Android OS upgrades, only that it will offer security patches as needed. That’s not too surprising given the phone’s price point; the Blade 11 Prime just isn’t built for longevity past a couple of years of use. There’s also 64GB of built-in storage, which isn’t a lot. If you don’t download too many apps or store too many photos on your device, you’ll be able to get by, otherwise adding a microSD card for additional storage to your purchase is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZCrwittUPuG9PycMvyuvK3xxNJ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499278/ajohnson_20210503_4571_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Camera hardware is modest: on the rear panel, you’ll find a 16-megapixel main and 8-megapixel ultrawide camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LNR8HQ"&gt;ZTE Blade 11 Prime camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3ytKxp"&gt;The rear camera system on the Blade 11 Prime includes a 16-megapixel main camera and an 8-megapixel ultrawide, plus a 2-megapixel depth sensor. It’s a basic setup, and it does fine in good lighting conditions. It’s a little more prone to clipping very bright spots in photos than other systems I’ve used recently, but it does a nice job overall with exposures of high-contrast scenes. In moderate indoor lighting, some detail-smoothing noise reduction is visible, and low-light photos look smeary even at the reduced image sizes used for social sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hslgFB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10488604"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QZ7zW0"&gt;As for the other cameras, they’re just fine. The ultrawide doesn’t handle high-contrast scenes as well as the main camera, with some noticeable noise appearing in shadows. There’s also a short delay after pressing the shutter button before you can take another photo that isn’t present when using the main camera. The selfie camera thankfully avoids over-smoothing faces, and photos look good as long as there’s plenty of available light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wIM3M88y4fLAFcJpaUPhyJED2Gc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499279/ajohnson_20210503_4571_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you aren’t already a wireless charging devotee, it would be best to look elsewhere in the budget phone class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="GHIFo6"&gt;If your budget is strict and wireless charging is a must-have, then the ZTE Blade 11 Prime is the right phone for you. But if you can make do without wireless charging, I’d strongly encourage you to look elsewhere. Iffy performance with basic tasks will be more of an inconvenience in the long run than having to plug in your phone every night to charge it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BrrNaH"&gt;This year’s Motorola Moto G Power would be a worthwhile alternative if you can spend a little more; you’ll get a faster processor and better battery life, though you should definitely plan on buying a microSD card to supplement its meager 32GB of storage. The G Play is a good alternative, too, even with a processor that’s a bit slower than the G Power’s.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and T-Mobile want your business more than ever right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tTzrv5sYQQxZijH2KvfJrbK-GNg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69253302/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;US telecom companies are braced for expensive changes in the coming years — and by extension, so are the rest of us.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Expect generous promotions and shiny new plans as the expensive 5G buildout continues&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PCj6nX"&gt;It’s a good year for old, crappy phones. The dusty old phone in your desk drawer running Android frozen-dessert-something-or-other — the one that might have a cracked screen — saw its stock go up recently with two generous trade-in promotions. T-Mobile and Verizon are both offering to take your old, damaged phone off your hands and replace it with a shiny new 5G model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUwvCI"&gt;There are a couple of reasons for this generosity. Verizon, in particular, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;written some big checks&lt;/a&gt; to pay for new C-band frequencies — highly desirable spectrum for 5G that offers good range and speed. The company has reassured its shareholders that the hefty expenditure will help grow its customer base and increase the amount of money it makes on existing accounts. It told investors at its March analyst event that “with C-band included, we think step-ups to premium [plans] will only accelerate.” So it’s unsurprising that the cracked phone deal requires a commitment to a “select unlimited plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="U0WiyG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That free 5G phone is just the start of what the carrier hopes will be a long, lucrative relationship&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ByLkC"&gt;Meanwhile, T-Mobile wants to make the most of a relatively strong hand right now. It has taken every opportunity possible to declare itself the “leader in 5G” and is likewise focused on reaching new customers, getting a 5G device in their hands, and getting them hooked on its 5G network. T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert talked up the success of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;new Magenta Max plan&lt;/a&gt; — an unlimited plan that doesn’t impose slowdowns after you reach a certain monthly data threshold — on the company’s first quarter earnings call as a kind of “if you build it, they will come” moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhtIFy"&gt;Customers on the plan use 70 percent more data than a typical LTE customer, and Sievert says they’re using their 5G data connection in situations when they might otherwise have looked for a public Wi-Fi network to join. “When you give somebody a true unlimited plan on a 5G phone that’s screaming fast on the biggest and best 5G network in this country, they use it.” That free 5G phone is just the start of what the carrier hopes will be a long and, ultimately, lucrative relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WzcTYa"&gt;Outside of those two companies, US wireless carriers across the board are braced for big changes this year — the impact of which will be felt by the rest of us in one way or another. The beginning of the year saw telecom companies on the upswing compared to last year’s tumultuous first quarter, with most adding more customers than they did in this quarter last year. T-Mobile gained a net of 773,000 postpaid phone customers, and AT&amp;amp;T added 595,000, its highest number in 10 years. Across the industry, companies felt the positive impacts of retail stores reopening to welcome customers with stimulus checks ready to spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OPuCJp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies felt the positive impacts of retail stores reopening to customers with stimulus checks to spend&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VHnP2f"&gt;While they’re in a better spot than they were when the country started shutting down this time a year ago, there are major hurdles to overcome in the near future. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, in particular, have a major project ahead of them in getting ready to deploy that newly won C-band — a costly venture on top of what they owe the federal government for the licenses. C-band is particularly important to those two companies, which are gambling on it to breathe life into their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;struggling nationwide 5G networks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYBUA3"&gt;Verizon is wasting no time; having pledged to spend $10 billion over the next three years on C-band deployment, it’s on track to spend between $2 and 3 billion by the end of the year and says it’s already ordered half of the equipment it will need. AT&amp;amp;T, meanwhile, is proceeding with a more cautious outlook, citing uncertainties around stressed global supply chains, and that other auctions this year could help fill out the company’s spectrum portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PTDKZZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon has pledged to spend $10 billion over the next three years on C-band deployment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kuENHA"&gt;Meanwhile, this is all the more motivation for T-Mobile to push aggressively for more subscribers now while the other players catch up to its relatively strong position in spectrum holdings. The company &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2021/T-Mobile-Raises-2021-Guidance-as-Network-Leadership-Fuels-Industry-Leading-Growth-with-Strong-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;raised its investor guidance&lt;/a&gt; and now expects to add a net of between 4.4 and 4.9 million postpaid customers this year, up from 4.0 to 4.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVc1pi"&gt;There’s another storm on the horizon, too, one that could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of wireless customers: T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;impending shutdown of its old CDMA network&lt;/a&gt;, which a large number of Boost Mobile (owned now by Dish) customers rely on. Dish says that T-Mobile is moving ahead with the shutdown much earlier than it said it would as an anti-competitive tactic, and Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen’s cries of foul play have gotten more dire in recent weeks, more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;calling Sievert a “Magenta Grinch.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J6oc8R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen’s cries of foul play have gotten more dire in recent weeks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x1rBXS"&gt;The company has also asked the California Public Utilities Commission to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-california-regulators-t-mobile-inquiry-reopen-9d87c61c-8349-440c-97eb-8cde807ba9bf.html"&gt;reopen the Sprint / T-Mobile merger case&lt;/a&gt;, and it has appealed to Capitol Hill lawmakers to review the situation. If the shutdown goes ahead as currently planned, lots of Boost Mobile customers will be shopping for a new phone soon — and potentially even a new wireless provider, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0ectx"&gt;So what’s next? For one, we can expect the aggressive play for new customers to continue, along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"&gt;dull roar of the 5G Hype Machine&lt;/a&gt; we’re all tired of hearing by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6ScUNY"&gt;In addition to the device offers, your carrier might try to upsell you to one of those premium unlimited plans if you do upgrade to a 5G device. Verizon is committed to those customer “step-ups,” and Sievert hinted that more Magenta Max-type offerings may be on the way, saying the plan is “only the beginning.” So if you do decide to dust off that old phone and turn it in for a new device this year, more power to you — might as well put an old piece of tech to work for you. Just be sure to take a good look at the fine print on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="oe9ohF"&gt;TikTok &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/share-sounds-and-login-with-tiktok-through-all-new-developer-kits"&gt;announced two new integrations&lt;/a&gt; for its app on Thursday: sharing audio back into TikTok using the new Sound Kit, and using your TikTok account to log in to other apps with Login Kit. Developers can apply to use the new SDKs to insert the short-form video app’s content in even more places, but they may open the company and its users to new privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00nlu6"&gt;The basic features of Login Kit will sound familiar. Facebook, Twitter, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17407334/snapchat-snapkit-ar-camera-developer-kit-login-platform"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; already offer similar integrations to speed up the logging in process. Like those other versions, TikTok says that using Login Kit will allow users to securely log in to other apps, but also let developers offer TikTok content inside those apps, like adding videos to a dating profile. Using Login with TikTok also requires you to allow whatever app you’re using to view your public profile and videos in order to work but doesn’t currently extend to the other information TikTok may know about you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ONCWPC37eoPhVQzeBEL0T3TVh2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496319/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_9.15.03_AM.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6NmS6t"&gt;Logging in with another social media account is convenient, but it comes with some baggage. Facebook in particular has been criticized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17148726/facebook-developer-data-crackdown-cambridge-analytica"&gt;for the data that gets collected with Facebook Login&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of the sources of information at the center of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal"&gt;the Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok has also been scrutinized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322612/tiktok-security-china-bytedance-spying-app-privacy"&gt;for its surveillance potential&lt;/a&gt; and a previous version of the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304228/tiktok-security-ios-clipboard-access-ios14-beta-feature"&gt;that accessed users’ clipboards&lt;/a&gt;. In regards to Login Kit, TikTok says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="DygHs5"&gt;Similar to other platforms’ SDKs, the only data TikTok can collect through Login Kit is the app’s name and associated events on our platform (i.e. event tracking for logins and authorizations). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPKDn8QP2PUwWgn955ye0MWrKww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496321/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_9.15.19_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sharing audio from outside apps to TikTok using Sound Kit and Login Kit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TnbfNe"&gt;One of the things that makes TikTok so compelling is all of the music it licenses for use in videos. With Sound Kit, that library of music could theoretically become even bigger, without TikTok having to strike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21546323/tiktok-sony-music-licensing-deal-labels-app"&gt;new deals with the big music labels&lt;/a&gt;. Sound Kit allows developers to share audio between their apps and TikTok, so if you make a particularly great mix in one app, you can start using it in your videos. To enable audio sharing, developers will have to integrate Login Kit and the accompanying permissions into their apps as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O52i0L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok’s audio library could grow even larger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ocNuEr"&gt;Developers have to apply to use TikTok’s tools and SDKs and abide by the company’s guidelines, but it’s easy to imagine some potentially sketchy use cases for Sound Kit, like sharing audio without a creator’s permission or pirating music. TikTok says the sounds shared through Sound Kit are treated like any other kind of audio on the platform. Audio clips can either be private or publicly shareable, and TikTok says&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CUlOI6"&gt;When a sound is shared to TikTok, we scan it for attribution to ensure it is original audio - if it’s identified as professionally generated content we label it as such in the music detail page &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9XFJf5"&gt;TikTok’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tiktok"&gt;already incredibly popular&lt;/a&gt; just by being a social media app with great video tools, but SDKs like Login Kit and Sound Kit show the app is maturing. With the new SDKs, there’s an even greater possibility TikTok’s features could become as ubiquitous as embedding a Tweet or sharing your Facebook friends list. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Division is getting a free-to-play game and mobile version</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FW9EkLRwLaT98z0rHQ2IJiI5Exs=/0x0:810x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69247860/Division_update_header.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ubisoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jPFnyY"&gt;Ubisoft &lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2MaVWnNfnfQ128qCKaUE3w/an-update-on-the-tom-clancys-the-division-universe?isSso=true&amp;amp;refreshStatus=noLoginData"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s developing a free-to-play game set in &lt;em&gt;The Division&lt;/em&gt;’s universe, called &lt;em&gt;The Division Heartland&lt;/em&gt;. The company also announced that a &lt;em&gt;Division&lt;/em&gt; mobile game is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sL5CYQ"&gt;The announcement is light on details, so it’s not clear yet whether the game will be a battle royale style like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but Ubisoft has said it’ll be coming to PC, consoles, and cloud gaming platforms at some point in 2021 or 2022. There are also basically no details about the mobile game, but Ubisoft said in a news release that more will be revealed at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMVV1S"&gt;It’s understandable why Ubisoft would want to launch its own version of the free-to-play and mobile shooter games: &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417447/fortnite-revenue-9-billion-epic-games-apple-antitrust-case"&gt;makes billions of dollars for Epic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;CoD: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; alone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22367089/tencent-timi-studios-call-of-duty-mobile-10-billion-2020"&gt;reportedly made $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. That’s not even mentioning the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396481/call-of-duty-warzone-100-million-players-apex-legends"&gt;100 million players&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Warzone, &lt;/em&gt;another lucrative title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmjq91"&gt;Whether Ubisoft’s offerings in &lt;em&gt;The Division&lt;/em&gt; universe will be as popular as its competitors remains to be seen, but Ubisoft is certainly trying to keep the game’s world culturally relevant: it’s still developing content for &lt;em&gt;The Division 2&lt;/em&gt;, and is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18660362/netflix-division-movie-jake-gyllenhaal-jessica-chastain-e3"&gt;working on a movie version with Netflix&lt;/a&gt; starring Jake Gyllenhaal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus Zenfone 8 Flip leak pairs flipping cameras with Snapdragon 888</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCi4BG0vVvAlij763OVfUNK4bEs=/0x0:1296x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245135/asus_zenfone_8_flip_image_feat.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zenfone 8 Flip.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-8-flip-specifications-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IDv02h"&gt;Asus’s successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21400709/asus-zenfone-7-flipping-triple-camera-zoom-ultrawide-battery-90hz-oled-display"&gt;last year’s Zenfone 7&lt;/a&gt; has leaked online, pointing to a return for the phones’ flipping camera array on May 12th. Specs and images of two upcoming devices — the Zenfone 8 and Zenfone 8 Flip — have been &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-8-flip-specifications-renders-exclusive/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on information provided by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1389987244295950354"&gt;leaker Ishan Agarwal&lt;/a&gt;. As its name suggests, the 8 Flip has three cameras built into a mechanical flipping mechanism that rotates them over the top edge of the display to take selfies, while the 8 has two rear cameras in a more standard rectangular camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MV8F8G"&gt;From the leaks, the Zenfone 8 Flip appears to be a comparatively minor spec bump compared to last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21408307/asus-zenfone-7-pro-review"&gt;Zenfone 7 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got a Snapdragon 888 processor rather than a Snapdragon 865 Plus, but the new model has the same massive 5,000mAH battery, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. The 1080p OLED display is still notchless thanks to the flipping cameras, still 6.67 inches in size, and still 90Hz, according to the leak. It also reportedly weighs the same at 230 grams, which could mean another heavy device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6Ffrdn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Full Specs &amp;amp; Renders of the ASUS Zenfone 8 &amp;amp; Zenfone 8 Flip, launching on May 12&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zenfone 8 is a compact smartphone with 5.92" screen size while th 8 Flip has a 6.67" AMOLED Display.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both feature Snapdragon 888 &amp;amp; 64MP Main Camera.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please link &amp;amp; credit: &lt;a href="https://t.co/9ZO803tRlk"&gt;https://t.co/9ZO803tRlk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/MCc2p5ISaK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MCc2p5ISaK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ishan Agarwal (@ishanagarwal24) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1389987244295950354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5rn2rP"&gt;The cameras also appear similar, with one key difference. While last year’s Zenfone 7 Pro had a 64 megapixel main camera paired with a 8 megapixel telephoto and 12 megapixel ultrawide, the new 8 Flip will apparently swap out the ultrawide for a 12 megapixel macro. We generally find ultrawide cameras much more useful than macro cameras on phones, making this an unfortunate change if accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pocxci1AUQaLgnCeFnRDlvumiys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22495517/asus_zenfone_8_render_01_1068x1066.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-8-flip-specifications-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zenfone 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aOE2WZ"&gt;Meanwhile, the standard Zenfone 8 is a much more traditional device, according to the leak. It’ll apparently have a smaller 5.92-inch 1080p display, but internally there’s the same Snapdragon 888 processor, and 8GB of RAM, albeit with a smaller 4,000 mAh battery and 128GB of internal storage. It’ll also reportedly come with one less rear-facing camera since it lacks the telephoto of the 8 Flip. That said, it should have the same number of cameras overall thanks to its separate hole-punch selfie camera on the front. It’s also fitted with an increasingly rare headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzXUYu"&gt;No details were given on the phones’ pricing or release dates, but with a launch event reportedly coming next week, we won’t have long to wait for official information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boost Mobile’s Unlimited Plus plan now comes with talk, text, and telemedicine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4X_fGEwnFlZHAv7va5R3q9wr-xQ=/88x0:1242x769/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237815/Image_22.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Boost Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vnZy8n"&gt;In what looks to be a first in terms of subscriber perks, Boost Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boostmobile.com%2Fadd-on-services%2Fhealth.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419961%2Fboost-mobile-unlimited-plan-healthcare-k-health" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that its $60 per month Unlimited Plus cellphone plan will come with access to to 24/7 telemedicine through &lt;a href="https://khealth.com/primary-care/"&gt;K Health&lt;/a&gt; starting this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHkcNn"&gt;Specifically, Unlimited Plus subscribers will get all of the features of K Health’s usual $9-per-month offering. That includes the ability to text chat or hop on a video call with a doctor through the K Health app, which uses the app’s AI suggestions to identify symptoms and potential ailments, and receive actual treatment, including medications and other prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MC1ps4"&gt;The service is free and available for all Boost Unlimited Plus subscribers and offered at a discounted price of $7.99 per month for all of Boost Mobile’s other customers. You can sign up to get access to the service first &lt;a href="https://omniform1.com/signup/v1/5f8dbd4d4c7fa4332c668d65_607704924c7fa46eaf0721f2.html"&gt;on Boost Mobile’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BophuI"&gt;Because this is ultimately a phone plan, you’ll also get 35GB of 4G LTE data per month, after which you’ll get throttled to 2G speeds. That comes with “unlimited” talk and text, and a 30GB mobile hotspot as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGVVJh"&gt;Offering online healthcare to customers was not on the top of my list of things Boost Mobile would do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;after getting absorbed by Dish Network&lt;/a&gt; (as part of T-Mobile’s merger with Sprint). But getting healthcare in the US is an often expensive proposition, and that’s before the bill comes after treatment. And, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;Boost has a large percentage of low-income customers&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom have likely been affected by the pandemic, so providing access to healthcare could be a real shot in the arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEoifF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T violated labor law but can still ban workers from recording conversations, NLRB rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the AT&amp;amp;amp;T logo is seen behind a..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGaP4iyZJ5usl-36np8MwMpow54=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237561/1231517624.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g8kGWp"&gt;An AT&amp;amp;T policy that bars employees from recording conversations with managers or colleagues is legal, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/05-CA-178637"&gt;ruling from the National Labor Relations Board Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The board found that while AT&amp;amp;T violated US labor law in how it had applied the policy, the recording ban itself was not illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJMi09"&gt;According to AT&amp;amp;T’s rules, “employees may not record telephone or other conversations they have with their co-workers, managers or third parties unless such recordings are approved in advance by the Legal Department.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECrBeb"&gt;In its decision, the NLRB overturned part of an earlier ruling which said that the policy’s potential to infringe on workers’ rights outweighed AT&amp;amp;T’s need to keep customer data private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im8CHx"&gt;The case centers on a complaint filed by AT&amp;amp;T employee Marcus Davis in 2016. Davis served as the union steward for the Communications Workers of America Local 2336. In May 2016, he attended a meeting with an employee who was being fired and recorded the conversation. Davis’s manager found out, asked to meet with him, and deleted the recording off of his phone. He later told Davis not to encourage other employees to make in-store recordings since doing so violated AT&amp;amp;T’s rules, and noted he “did not want anyone held accountable for not following policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BP9jl"&gt;The NLRB found that Davis was engaged in protected union activity. The board said AT&amp;amp;T violated federal labor law by telling him not to encourage colleagues to make recordings and implying that there could be repercussions for those who did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAwj6D"&gt;Yet the board also said that just because the policy was &lt;em&gt;applied&lt;/em&gt; illegally doesn’t mean it is inherently illegal. “A blanket prohibition on the continued maintenance of such rules, simply because of a single instance of unlawful application — even if that single instance is carried out by a misguided low- or mid-level supervisor whose action does not reflect corporate policy — fails to give proper weight to those legitimate interests,” the board wrote. “Indeed, it fails to give them any weight at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKF8HX"&gt;In her dissent, NLRB chairman Lauren McFerran said the rule was unlawfully over broad. “We all agree that some recordings by employees are protected by the National Labor Relations Act,”  she wrote. “By its terms, the rule does not differentiate between recordings protected by the National Labor Relations Act and those that are not...Indeed, as written, the rule applies even to conversations on nonwork time and in nonwork areas: an employee could not record a union meeting held in a breakroom at lunch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaGYli"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T did not immediately respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
