    <title>T-Mobile has 5G leverage and isn’t afraid to use it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OVKcu2qMlEhiNYS9VyX_VG9hVg4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867161/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="azC2BE"&gt;T-Mobile created a lot of buzz this week when it announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;bringing back an unlimited plan&lt;/a&gt; without data throttling. In the age of data caps and deprioritization, that seems like a pretty nice deal — and it might be. But as always, there’s more at play here than T-Mobile just offering a better unlimited plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRP5Eu"&gt;T-Mobile says its new plan, Magenta Max, is truly unlimited. It includes 4K video streaming and high-speed data without deprioritization, where all other “unlimited” plans impose slowdowns once a user hits certain thresholds. T-Mobile chief marketing officer Matt Staneff confirmed in a call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; yesterday that there are no strings attached to the deprioritization bit — it’s all-you-can-eat 5G data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RISIqI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile says its new plan, Magenta Max, is truly unlimited&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zTYmnm"&gt;There is one string to be aware of, though. There is a 40GB cap on tethering, after which customers will get 3G data. But T-Mobile insists there’s no other funny business. For example, there are no limits on 4K video streaming, provided the streaming service you’re using offers it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9wdiI"&gt;That’s notable because, according to the carriers, data deprioritization was imposed out of necessity to maintain network performance. Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/12/14592822/verizon-unlimited-data-plan-announced-2017"&gt;reintroduced unlimited data plans&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16181362/verizon-new-unlimited-data-plan-video-throttling-net-neutrality"&gt;shortly after, it imposed&lt;/a&gt; video quality limits and data deprioritization. In so many words, Verizon claimed this move was necessary because the network couldn’t handle the added congestion of unlimited subscribers. It wasn’t alone: throttling and reduced streaming video quality were standard practices across all major carriers at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T8uDjG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Let’s remember why T-Mobile has all of that sweet, sweet mid-band spectrum: Sprint&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GOrgtW"&gt;So how can T-Mobile afford to offer truly unlimited data now? According to the company, the difference is 5G. Specifically, the mid-band frequencies that T-Mobile uses for much of its 5G network allow for higher data capacities than 4G and are more robust than the narrow low-band frequencies Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T rely on for their nationwide 5G coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLE3N8"&gt;But let’s remember why T-Mobile has all of that sweet, sweet mid-band spectrum: Sprint. The acquisition gave T-Mobile access to Sprint’s network, but it also effectively cut major wireless carrier options in the US from four to three. A federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132924/tmobile-sprint-merger-approved-federal-court-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;allowed T-Mobile to go ahead with the deal&lt;/a&gt;, but under certain terms, that would help boost competition and (hopefully) consumer choice in other ways. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sprint / T-Mobile" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-InIUQ-LGioMTtAPRzCh4DYJ40w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9568273/IMG_20171025_120004_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s strong 5G network is due to its acquisition of Sprint last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Izcydv"&gt;T-Mobile’s follow-through on those conditions has been a mixed bag. It did as promised by spinning off Sprint’s prepaid Boost Mobile business and selling it to Dish Network. Dish was allowed to lease T-Mobile’s network as an MVNO while it builds its own 5G offerings, another part of the deal. The good news is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;Dish looks to be serious&lt;/a&gt; about bringing its network online soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uj08h"&gt;The bad news is Dish’s current wireless business &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/dish-sheds-363k-wireless-subs-warns-t-mobile-3g-shutdown"&gt;looks a little shaky right now&lt;/a&gt; and could face further setbacks if T-Mobile moves ahead with its 3G CDMA shutdown early next year, which many of Dish’s customers currently use. While that doesn’t technically violate the terms of the agreement, Dish chairman and co-founder Charlie Ergen &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/open-ran/dish-to-launch-5g-in-major-city-by-end-of-q3-/d/d-id/767565"&gt;called it an “anti-competitive” move&lt;/a&gt; that would clearly benefit T-Mobile and harm Dish’s efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTaUYh"&gt;So while T-Mobile’s unlimited plan is undoubtedly good for customers who sign up for it, the deal that made it possible might have weakened the US cellular industry as a whole. It’s possible, though, that we may see other benefits from T-Mobile offering this plan as it might put pressure on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T to follow suit. It wouldn’t be the first time the self-named Uncarrier pushed the more established companies to expand their offerings. (See also: the return of unlimited plans several years ago.) We’ve asked AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon for comment and will update this article if we receive information from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TMDSOq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile has extra incentive to attract new customers in the short term&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dv6Dk0"&gt;Another reason T-Mobile may be offering this plan now is to take advantage of its comparatively strong 5G performance before AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon get their hands on more mid-band spectrum as a result of the &lt;a href="https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction107"&gt;recently concluded C-band auction&lt;/a&gt;. It won’t be until the end of this year or early 2022 that their customers will start seeing the benefits of the additional frequencies, so T-Mobile has extra incentive to attract new customers in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdPax2"&gt;It’s also likely that the specifics of the plan will shift as the market and networks change. Wireless plans are notoriously complicated, and carriers will continue to change them when it makes good business sense to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AON4wV"&gt;So what’s a phone plan shopper to do? The best bet might be to jump on a good deal like this while it’s around if it makes sense for you and / or your family. Existing subscribers are often grandfathered in when plans inevitably change and may get to hang on to some of the benefits. Carriers are going to look out for their bottom line, so it’s a good idea to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTixTZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung now lets you return a new Galaxy Z Fold 2 or Z Flip foldable after 100 days</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUiqDAVQreHNadozWuHKui33ck4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68863967/vpavic_200907_4181_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gtd5Xt"&gt;Samsung is extending the return period for its newest foldable phones to 100 days, the company announced on Tuesday. That means buyers of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G and Z Flip 5G can purchase either device, use it for more than three months, and return it for a full refund. Samsung is calling this new program “Buy and Try,” and it’s the first time the company has launched a return initiative as generous as this for its mobile phones. The prior return window was 15 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJTHTD"&gt;“This new initiative will help consumers try and see if a foldable device is right for them, as part of Samsung’s commitment to making foldable devices more accessible for everyone,” a Samsung spokesperson said in a statement. Samsung says the program is launching today for purchases of either device made through its website and will run until April 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUTGlw"&gt;The Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G&lt;/a&gt; is technically the fourth iteration of the company’s foldable line, and it released last fall as a vastly improved version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938653/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-updated-android-price-specs-features-hinge"&gt;original (and severely flawed) Galaxy Fold&lt;/a&gt;. It costs $1,999.99, though Samsung is &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold2-5g/buy/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling the device on its website for $1,499.99&lt;/a&gt; with an eligible trade-in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLIyhF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 5G&lt;/a&gt; is Samsung’s third take on a foldable phone. Following a discount, it now retails for $1,199.99, though Samsung says you can &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-z-flip/buy/?link=galaxy-z-flip-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get one for as cheap as $649.99 with an eligible trade-in&lt;/a&gt;. Both store pages for the devices on Samsung’s website carry notices of the new 100-day return offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWc7tP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new partnership aims to improve haptic feedback on Android devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Qualcomm Lofelt" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NDLypBfVTwnmXPYkTS4tEVU9_s0=/69x0:807x492/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68862616/0_66eU5_KB84vIXV7A.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LLRmGy"&gt;Haptic feedback on Android phones running the Snapdragon 888 chipset might get noticeably better starting in the second half of 2021. Qualcomm recently announced (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/23/qualcomm-and-lofelt-join-forces-with-aim-to-improve-android-haptics/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that it’s working independently with a company called Lofelt to enhance haptics through &lt;em&gt;software&lt;/em&gt;, not hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uI46SY"&gt;That initially read as a puzzling decision, since hardware — not software — seems to play the bigger role in the quality of the vibration. But this actually sounds very clever, definitely more clever than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/21/11993380/put-some-bass-on-your-wrist-basslet"&gt;Lofelt’s Basslet vibrating wearable&lt;/a&gt; that it launched on Kickstarter in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxTUdl"&gt;Outside of some high-end LG phones, most Android phones deliver muddy or rattling vibrations that don’t feel that great. Even the best ones can’t compete with Apple’s Taptic Engine it builds in-house and builds into iPhones and Apple Watch wearables. Tactile, punchy vibration probably isn’t high up on the list of many people in terms of must-have features, but it can go a surprisingly long way in making you feel like you’re using a quality product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Qualcomm Lofelt" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wSZE_SMmiA5rHq5F1ZHtuU9fWe0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22323210/0_66eU5_KB84vIXV7A.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RvbHly"&gt;Lofelt has developed a framework and an open API for phone manufacturers (as well as in game controllers “and beyond” &lt;a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/qku6b8nf1d79/6lLhSn0gs9DIb54g7HmQrV/40df630d856a049a228fcd8680a7eaab/Lofelt_Qualcomm_Partnership.pdf"&gt;says the press release&lt;/a&gt;) that can convert universal haptic data into signals that are finely tuned and improved for that device’s specific hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEIpXh"&gt;So, instead of incorporating a standard haptic actuator on the chipset that companies are required to adopt, it developed a more scalable software solution that can work on any phone running the required Snapdragon hardware. Manufacturers can keep making phones the way they want, and Lofelt’s API can help to create a more uniform haptic experience across the vast Android ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fdfbot"&gt;Lofelt CEO and co-founder Daniel Büttner spoke at length on &lt;em&gt;Medium &lt;/em&gt;in a post called &lt;a href="https://medium.com/lofelt/the-keys-to-delivering-better-haptics-on-android-f502403c22e7"&gt;“The Keys to Delivering Better Haptics on Android,”&lt;/a&gt; and it covers everything you’d want to know about why the gap between haptics on Android and Apple devices has been so wide in the past few years. It comes down to fragmentation, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhVxx9"&gt;Apple could set a standard for haptics on both a hardware and software level by which its small batch of phones abide. Android, on the other hand, is the Wild West in terms of haptics, as it is in most other areas. The post illustrates that pretty much the only way forward to improve haptics in Android is through software. Hey, if you can’t reverse fragmentation at this point, you might as well lean into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8tB2z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dream of mid-air wireless charging teased with rollable Oppo X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YnofQDNtJeeqWU0JBdKfWuyPlgY=/88x0:736x432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860411/Jyr8m06UdO.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OHAS6g"&gt;Oppo has teased a new wireless charging solution that works when a phone is up to 10 cm (3.9 inches) away from a charging pad. The company has shown off its Wireless Air Charging tech in a &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4607703588020148"&gt;30-second clip on its Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/press/oppo-to-unveil-innovations-partnerships-at-mwcs-2021/"&gt;coincide with MWC Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;. The clip shows the Oppo X 2021 rollable concept phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;announced in November&lt;/a&gt;, charging above the pad, even when held at an angle. The technology offers charging speeds of up to 7.5W, Oppo says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgVaeJ"&gt;The Chinese manufacturer is the latest to announce a truly wireless air charging solution, following Xiaomi and Motorola’s teases from earlier this year. Back in January, Xiaomi announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;Mi Air Charge Technology&lt;/a&gt;, which it says can charge multiple devices at 5W “within a radius of several meters.” The next day, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-no-contact-wireless-charging/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on a demonstration from Motorola which showed one of its phones charging 100 cm (40 inches) away from a charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CWsriV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"&gt;Your browser does not support HTML5 video.&lt;source src="https://f.video.weibocdn.com/002un6p6gx07KAuN5DFt01041200ctFy0E010.mp4?label=mp4_1080p&amp;amp;template=1920x1080.25.0&amp;amp;trans_finger=0bde055d9aa01b9f6bc04ccac8f0b471&amp;amp;media_id=4607697065279496&amp;amp;tp=8x8A3El:YTkl0eM8&amp;amp;us=0&amp;amp;ori=1&amp;amp;bf=4&amp;amp;ot=h&amp;amp;ps=3lckmu&amp;amp;uid=3ZoTIp&amp;amp;ab=3915-g1,966-g1,3370-g1,1493-g0,1192-g0,1191-g0,1258-g0&amp;amp;Expires=1614082265&amp;amp;ssig=gG5MHIjc46&amp;amp;KID=unistore,video" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="37mkFZ"&gt;At 10 cm, the range of Oppo’s technology is more limited than Xiaomi’s competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-contactless-charging-1203197/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. The video’s presenter makes a very deliberate effort to hold the phone directly above the charging mat. However, the charging is shown working even when the phone is slightly tilted above the wireless charger, and while playing back a video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPJyZN"&gt;Distinctions like this are academic right now since none of these technologies have been released in commercial products. Xiaomi has confirmed its technology won’t be ready to release this year, and the rollable phone that Oppo used for its demonstration also doesn’t have an official release date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A closer look at Wireless Air Charging&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working on or off axis with the charger, you can charge up and use the smartphone at the same time without being tethered to a charging stand or cable!      &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MWC21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MWC21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOxMWC21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOxMWC21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/9iiunPBzPs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9iiunPBzPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1364108983821234178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NVDxYm"&gt;As well as developing wireless chargers that work over longer distances, manufacturers are also working to make standard wireless charging faster. Xiaomi is developing an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522730/xiaomi-mi-80w-wireless-charging-technology-announced"&gt;80W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; solution, which it announced just months after Oppo revealed its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325289/oppo-125w-fast-charging-65w-airvooc-wireless-charger"&gt;65W wireless charging tech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YGJC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 23rd, 6:53AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with official name of charging solution, and more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG denies the Rollable phone has been put on hold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TqQeaVOklqPzLrYnZIpT9moH_yE=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68859280/LGRollable.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71AgBO"&gt;LG Electronics has told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company’s phone with a resizable screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;the LG Rollable&lt;/a&gt;, has not been put on hold. “I can firmly deny that any such decision on future mobile products has been finalized,” says an LG spokesperson. The denial comes in response to &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210222005600320"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Yonhap News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that LG had reportedly told parts suppliers that the Rollable had been put on hold and that they could request a refund for their development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WO1AeI"&gt;Denying that a final decision has been made is not quite the same thing as reassuring everyone that the Rollable is still coming in 2021, but it could reflect the general uncertainty that comes with designing, manufacturing, and shipping complicated electronics during a global pandemic. And it could also be that the &lt;em&gt;Yonhap News&lt;/em&gt; report is somewhere near the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iidMdy"&gt;LG also firmly denied a report in January that it was planning to exit the smartphone business, and Korean outlet &lt;em&gt;TheElec &lt;/em&gt;wound up deleting that report, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240282/lg-smartphone-business-exit-2021-internal-memo"&gt;only to see LG turn around later and admit that it was indeed considering an exit from smartphones&lt;/a&gt;, even if the decision hadn’t been finalized yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cqafV"&gt;If LG did decide to put the Rollable on hold, it could be to change release dates or to re-engineer some part of its design. Not every change in manufacturing schedule necessarily means cancellation. It would probably come as a surprise to LG employees if it did get canceled, though: &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt;’s now-deleted story originally suggested that smartphone business or no, Project I (LG’s codename for the Rollable) would continue, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-not-shutting-down-smartphone-business/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgPYyP"&gt;LG has had a hard time competing with other smartphone makers like Samsung or Huawei, and its smartphone business has lost approximately $4.5 billion over the last five years. But it has seemed committed to making sure the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the last “unique” phone design it releases. The Rollable’s future is uncertain, but the story definitely isn’t over yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLBw29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BATTGi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDHcEJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejHZqN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Is1ek"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWy0oK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXKiuW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish is confident in its plan to offer 5G in its first major cities by end of Q3 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QclUa4"&gt;Dish Network co-founder and chairman Charlie Ergen underscored the company’s commitment to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8931827/dish-carrier-plans-5g-network-tmobile-sprint-us-confirms"&gt;building a 5G wireless network&lt;/a&gt; on today’s Q4 2020 earnings call. He restated the intention to bring 5G online in its first major cities by the end of Q3 2021 — that’s the period running from July through September — and was bullish on Dish’s ability to boost the US’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;somewhat dismal global position&lt;/a&gt; in terms of wireless network offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px7YNP"&gt;Ergen spent several minutes on &lt;a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/yi3fxcbb"&gt;today’s call&lt;/a&gt; recapping what the company has done so far in its network-building effort. With its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquisition of Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; last year, it’s currently offering prepaid service as an MVNO on T-Mobile’s network, but it has also been accumulating its own spectrum to make the move to a full-fledged carrier. That’s a good sign for wireless competition in the US; with Sprint no longer available as a choice, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708411/dish-tmobile-sprint-carrer-merger-assets-spectrum-boost"&gt;Dish is positioned to step up&lt;/a&gt; as a fourth major carrier option. And it kind of has to in order to satisfy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134278/sprint-tmobile-merger-court-ruling-opinion-decision-explainer-carriers-antitrust"&gt;the conditions of the T-Mobile-Sprint merger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PchgGb"&gt;To that end, Dish made low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum purchases last year, and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/c-band-assignment-phase-kicks-off-february-8"&gt;estimated to have spent $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in the recent C-band auction. With access to these different kinds of spectrum, Dish has the pieces of the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;5G “layer cake”&lt;/a&gt; that will help it establish fast service with wide coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PnayvP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"},{"title":"The iPhone 12 series is already driving 5G adoption in the US","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287683/iphone-12-pro-max-5g-sales-adoption"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lKc9dQ"&gt;“This isn’t our first rodeo,” Ergen said, stressing his confidence in the company’s ability to execute, despite the considerable risks. He didn’t stop there either; Ergen believes Dish can “help the United States actually start leading again in wireless.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUHguA"&gt;Maybe he’s right. There’s a big challenge ahead of Dish, but the company doesn’t face one of the challenges plaguing the major carriers right now: keeping 4G data flowing while adding 5G. This has led Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, in particular, to turn to a technology called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, or DSS, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196060/verizon-5g-slower-than-lte-speed-test"&gt;poor results&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, the bar is quite low at the moment for US networks, which might help Dish get a running start.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile just brought back a true unlimited data plan with 5G and no throttling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lDgbCAqNAIeyRHBvOHBQ-5Kz3W4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855699/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDBh15"&gt;T-Mobile has just announced a new monthly phone plan called Magenta Max that the company says is designed for the era of 5G. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fstories%2Fmagenta-max&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22295466%2Ft-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to this press release&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile claims Magenta Max is “the first and only 5G consumer smartphone plan that can’t slow you down based on how much data you use.” That makes it sound like the carrier is doing away with what’s known as deprioritization, where your speeds are subject to slowdown after you exceed a certain amount of data in a billing cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kuw1DY"&gt;“T-Mobile has lit up the highest-capacity 5G network available — a network so powerful it can start unleashing the power of 5G to deliver unlimited premium data,” the company said.  Magenta Max promises “unlimited 4K UHD” video streaming compared to the DVD-quality (or 1080p at best) limit that comes with many unlimited plans. T-Mobile is also extending the company’s “Netflix on Us” promotion to single-line customers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R0-wI8Q_HvbP_ntwWv_Xf5KfwWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320564/max.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="95rEr5"&gt;Magenta Max takes the place of the previous Magenta Plus plan and will be available starting on February 24th. It includes 40GB of high-speed tethering data, plus the usual T-Mobile perks like free in-flight Wi-Fi from Gogo, extensive international coverage, and Scam Shield protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KPA93Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VA4WAj"&gt;T-Mobile says pricing is “$57 per line per month for three lines with autopay and monthly taxes and fees included.” For a limited time, that’s dropped to $47 per line per month for three lines. Single-line customers will have to pay more at $85 per month with autopay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWVMpe"&gt;A lot of this has a “too good to be true” sound to it, so I’m also on the lookout for any asterisks or limits that T-Mobile isn’t talking about on the surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fInXA9"&gt;Alongside Magenta Max, T-Mobile is also making changes to the core Magenta plan. It’s bumping up the monthly deprioritization ceiling to 100GB from the 50GB it’s at currently. Customers will also get more high-speed tethering data: it’s now 5GB compared to 3GB before.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACCGYzU2wR3-6BaupyrR4XrSoRA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855298/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;In the US, 5G remains a work in progress, despite carriers waving “5G Mission Accomplished” banners for years | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The fourth industrial revolution will not be televised&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="2rF2Fy"&gt;After an introduction from Consumer Technology Association president Gary Shapiro, Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg takes the stage. He wears a simple black T-shirt with an unmistakable red check and begins delivering his keynote speech. The topic at hand is 5G, something Vestberg speaks about enthusiastically. The keynote covers the eight “currencies” of 5G, features a professional athlete, and highlights how 5G will transform the drone industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPtmvC"&gt;That was CES 2019. It was also CES 2021. Verizon hasn’t been alone in fueling the 5G hype machine; AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile have been talking up their 5G networks for years. Now, it’s showtime. With major flagship phones and a lot more budget devices supporting it, this is the year when a critical mass of phone buyers will finally see for themselves what all this talk is about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaXFel"&gt;Here’s the bad news: if they’ve been listening to the hype, they’re going to be disappointed. We’ve been promised a fourth industrial revolution with fantastical things like remote surgery and driverless cars. Instead, what we have now is widespread 5G that’s more or less the same speed as (or even slower than) 4G and super-fast mmWave 5G in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; parts of &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; major cities with highly limited range. So where is this 5G future we’ve been promised? The truth is that it’s coming along, but it will materialize more slowly and in less obvious ways than what we’ve been led to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uEFYKL"&gt;Spectrum wars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dzciVm"&gt;To understand the complicated 5G situation in the US right now, you first need to know that there are low-, mid-, and high-band frequencies that carriers can use. Low-band is slower but offers widespread coverage. High-band, often called mmWave, is very fast but extremely limited in range. Mid-band sits in a sweet spot between the two, with good range and better-than-LTE speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXZ3ph"&gt;If you were building a 5G network from scratch, you’d probably want a bunch of mid-band spectrum, right? The trouble is, spectrum is a limited resource. &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/authors/sascha-segan"&gt;Sascha Segan&lt;/a&gt;, lead mobile analyst at &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; and a wealth of 5G knowledge, sums up part of the spectrum problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjjNjv"&gt;“Our government did not make the right channels available to the carriers,” he says. “Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have basically just been using leftover odds and ends of their 4G spectrum... putting the 5G encoding on these leftover bits and bobs so they can pop a 5G icon on the screen. And the performance is meaningless.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hRkK5K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s kind of like having that super fast sports car and you’re stuck on the Santa Monica freeway.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xixtRf"&gt;The technology Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are using to get nationwide 5G coverage is called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS), which allows 4G and 5G to coexist on the same spectrum. That helps carriers make the transition from one technology to the other, but it comes at a cost. Michael Thelander, president and founder of wireless industry research firm &lt;a href="https://signalsresearch.com/"&gt;Signals Research Group&lt;/a&gt;, sums it up this way: “It’s kind of like having that super fast sports car and you’re stuck on the Santa Monica freeway. You can’t experience the full capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Sv52l"&gt;T-Mobile, on the other hand, doesn’t need to rely on spectrum sharing as much as the other two, thanks to its acquisition of Sprint and its mid-band spectrum. That has given it an edge in its 5G offerings thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WD5bmM"&gt;By early 2022, though, we will likely see Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T catching up. A swath of mid-band spectrum known as C-band went up for auction in late 2020. And while we don’t know which companies won which blocks of spectrum, we know those two carriers, in particular, spent big; bidding &lt;a href="https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction107"&gt;topped out at over $80 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uw17dY"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VsP8hz"&gt;The networks might not be firing on all cylinders yet, but more and more mobile devices are ready for them. In fact, by the end of the year, it may be harder to find a non-5G phone than one that supports the technology. Not only do Apple and Samsung’s flagship phones support 5G across their lineups, but it’s also making its way into more midrange and budget devices, thanks to new 5G-ready low-end processors like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon 480&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiBmo5"&gt;More people than ever will buy a 5G phone this year — likely not because they really wanted 5G, but because the phone they were going to get anyway supports it. The good news is that there really isn’t a downside to buying a 5G phone now if it’s time to upgrade. The “5G tax” that put a higher price tag on 5G phones over the past couple of years seems to be disappearing, and we haven’t noticed any other drawbacks like excessive battery drain in our testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuP5JW4ilTFsD1GqJPcjnL_wagE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973509/vpavic_4243_20201017_0144.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 series includes 5G connectivity across the lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sPWa6a"&gt;So what’s the reaction like so far from, say, someone who bought an iPhone 12 — not for 5G, but because it’s the new iPhone? “They’re frustrated and angry,” says Segan. “With both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, because of what I’ll call technical difficulties, their nationwide 5G is often slower than their 4G. So people are getting these iPhones and they’re finding that frequently they have worse performance than they had before 5G.” The “technical difficulties” he refers to include DSS in Verizon’s case and the limitations of the narrow 5MHz band that AT&amp;amp;T often uses for its 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5fWGR"&gt;That’s not great. But a couple of factors will make a difference over the next year. First, that C-band spectrum will start coming online around the end of the year. If you’re one of the frustrated owners of an iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21, there’s good news: your phone is already approved to use C-band, so if you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T, you should see speed improvements when that happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u7PitC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re finding that frequently they have worse performance than they had before 5G”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MvPKH7"&gt;Not all 5G phones support C-band, though. Those that don’t will need a software update to use it, and there’s no guarantee that your phone’s manufacturer will offer one. Inexpensive 5G models, in particular, may not see a C-band update, even if they have the hardware to support it. Phone makers need to apply for Federal Communications Commission approval to enable it and may be less likely to bother with the cost of this step for phones with a shorter lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFIJxS"&gt;The other factor is something that will likely happen sooner than C-band becoming available: large gatherings. That’s when Segan thinks Verizon’s Ultra Wideband could really shine. “When we’re all vaccinated, I think people are going to be desperate... for all of these dense, crowded, communal experiences that we will have been missing for a year and a half. And so Verizon should be working on applications and experiences right now like the thing they did at the Super Bowl, or what they’ve talked about doing at Disney World, that you can only do on Ultra Wideband.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4L8b2T"&gt;Again, that will depend on your 5G phone supporting the right &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of 5G — not every 5G phone supports mmWave. The aforementioned iPhone and Samsung flagships do, and other Verizon models that support are denoted as “UW.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oDOGa4"&gt;Where are our jetpacks?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ftsEj7"&gt;And what about the stuff of CES keynotes like remote surgery and self-driving cars? That’s on the way, too, but it’ll take longer. Thelander explains: “The first focus of 5G was really a feature called ‘enhanced mobile broadband’ and that’s just getting fast data speeds to the consumer on their smartphone. Things like factory automation and the functionality behind that, that was really developed afterwards, so it lags, from a standardization perspective.” &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first focus of 5G has been to boost mobile data speeds for consumers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uvow5O"&gt;Getting the technology piece sorted out is only half of the equation. “Once you’ve got a certain feature or functionality defined in a standard, now a vendor has to go out and build that functionality, then you have to test it, and then you have to have the industry adopt it,” Thelander says. “The technology may be there, the standard may be there, it may work fine, but it has to be implemented and rolled out. And you have to have the business case for it. How do you make money off of it? All those types of things… it just takes time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SQZrz1"&gt;Despite networks constantly waving their “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mission-accomplished"&gt;5G Mission Accomplished&lt;/a&gt;” banners in TV commercials over the past year, 5G is very much still a work in progress. It’s going to get better, but how soon that happens for you depends on a lot of factors: which phone you have and what bands it supports, which network you’re on, where you are, and what you’re doing. It seems clear now that there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637213/5g-race-us-leadership-china-fcc-lte"&gt;never really was a “Race to 5G”&lt;/a&gt; — just technological progress as usual, which is often slow, confusing, and uneven. That’s a little bit harder to sell in a keynote or a commercial.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung launches EKG support for latest Galaxy Watch devices in 31 more countries</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JqgB59A0xwDD-a74CvLEbwmn9lA=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854417/dseifert_200811_4139_0015.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vr5afU"&gt;Samsung has launched support for electrocardiogram (EKG) readings and blood pressure monitoring on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20903452/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-fitness-tizen-apps-features-android-price"&gt;Galaxy Watch Active 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Watch 3&lt;/a&gt; devices, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/ecg-support-for-galaxy-watch-2-galaxy-watch-3-rolling-out-to-31-markets/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The feature comes courtesy of the Samsung Health Monitor app, which is now available to download from the company’s app store in 31 additional countries. Prior to today, the features were restricted to owners of one of those two devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452541/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-active-2-ekg-ecg-electrocardiogram-update"&gt;in South Korea and the US only&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYgQdV"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251411/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-active-2-ekg-blood-pressure-health-monitor"&gt;first announced last month&lt;/a&gt; it would be adding the features to its latest Galaxy Watch devices through software updates, considering both smartwatches have the requisite sensors used for measuring heart rate and blood pressure and performing an EKG. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5IgP8dTfI_Iz4vIYnji5V5zCOPw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320177/Watch3_Three_UIs_ECG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fDLB4N"&gt;Now, users in 31 more countries — mostly in Europe — should have access after Samsung was given the CE marking clearance for its Samsung Health Monitor app in the EU. That regulatory approval signals the software meets the health and safety standards required for distribution in the region. &lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;notes you’ll need the app downloaded and updated to the latest version on both a compatible Galaxy Watch and Samsung phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPFhQh"&gt;The full list of countries includes Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UAE, and the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s Mate X2 foldable adopts Samsung’s dual-screen design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s1J-_p6smxsTD9tnRewI5aZrcjM=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68853932/image_178.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mate X2 has an 8-inch screen that folds inward.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dVrUeQ"&gt;Huawei has announced the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Fphones%2Fmate-x2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22294983%2Fhuawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mate X2&lt;/a&gt;, its first all-new foldable device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238269/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-price-release-date-specs-mwc-2019"&gt;since 2019’s Mate X&lt;/a&gt;. The new phone has received a radical redesign compared to the original device, with a large screen that unfolds from the inside of the device rather than around the outside. For using the phone while folded, the Huawei Mate X2 has a second screen on its outside, similar to Samsung’s approach with the Galaxy Fold series. Images of the phone were leaked minutes ahead of its official announcement by &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/huawei-mate-x2-first-official-images-1613994247-1984855950"&gt;Evan Blass on &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUTUPv"&gt;This being a Huawei device, the Mate X2 will launch without support for Google’s apps or services, which is likely to severely limit its appeal outside of China. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Fphones%2Fmate-x2%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22294983%2Fhuawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Huawei’s site&lt;/a&gt;, the phone will run on EMUI 11.0 based on Android 10. However, during its live stream, the company said it plans for the Mate X2 to be among the first phones to be updated to its own operating system, HarmonyOS, starting in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjKndz"&gt;The internal screen on the Mate X2 measures 8 inches with a resolution of 2480 x 2200, while the exterior screen is 6.45 inches with a 2700 x 1160 resolution. Both are OLED and have refresh rates of up to 90Hz. They’re also both slightly bigger than the 7.6-inch internal display and 6.2-inch external displays found on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;. Internally, the phone is powered by the company’s flagship Kirin 9000 chip, the processor that debuted in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529915/huawei-mate-40-pro-hands-on"&gt;Mate 40 Pro&lt;/a&gt; last year. This is paired with 8GB of RAM and a battery with a rated capacity of 4,400mAh that can be fast-charged at up to 55W. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Yg-uODZq9hpnIhWL4-EpjdiE2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320067/msedge_6RvUDEI1g5.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Huawei&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mate X2 is available in four colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GsHFfr"&gt;There are four cameras on the rear of the phone: a 50-megapixel wide-angle, a 16-megapixel ultrawide, a 12-megapixel telephoto with a 3x optical zoom, and an 8-megapixel “SuperZoom” camera with a 10x optical zoom. The selfie camera on the outside of the phone has a 16-megapixel resolution, and there doesn’t appear to be a selfie camera in or around the foldable inner screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMPOaj"&gt;The Mate X2 is technically the third phone in Huawei’s foldable lineup. Last year, it released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;Mate XS&lt;/a&gt;, an updated version of the original Mate X, which featured a more durable display and faster Kirin 990 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjsHSx"&gt;Huawei says the Mate X2 will be available in China with 256GB of internal storage for ¥17,999 (around $2,785) or for ¥18,999 (around $2,940) with 512GB of storage. Available colors include blue, pink, black, and white. It’ll be available to buy in China on February 25th, but it’s unclear when the phone could be released outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;
