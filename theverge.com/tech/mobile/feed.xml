    <title>Motorola’s G100 midrange battery champ is now available in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z_32l8T3w0dnMhLeTfkXSnc6SLY=/0x53:1250x886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619427/motog100.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G100 offers respectable midrange specs like 5G and a Snapdragon 870 processor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWa3Uk"&gt;Motorola is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-moto-g100%2Fp%3FskuId%3D627&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F22%2F22589232%2Fmotorola-moto-g100-price-specs-screen-battery" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now selling the Moto G100 in the US&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;introducing it earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for Latin American and European markets. It comes with midrange specs like a big 5,000mAh battery, 5G, and a 90Hz screen for a $599 MSRP. From now until August 5th, Motorola is offering a $100 discount off the full retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9wLWt"&gt;There are two important footnotes on the G100’s US carrier compatibility: it’s a GSM-only phone, so will work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile but not Verizon, and its 5G connectivity is only compatible with T-Mobile’s 5G network. Outside of that, it appears to be a respectable midrange device, if priced a little on the high end. It uses a Snapdragon 870 processor with 8GB of RAM, sub-6GHz 5G, and a 6.7-inch 1080p display with 90Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui1Wz7"&gt;Motorola’s US phone releases this year have been concentrated around the $200-400 range, making G100 one of the pricier devices the company has introduced stateside recently. While a big battery, faster-refreshing screen, and a higher-tier processor feel fitting of its $599 price tag, its lack of IP-rating and broad carrier / 5G support could set it back against similarly priced peers like the Samsung A52 5G or the Pixel 4A 5G (if you can still find one).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Corning’s new Gorilla Glass protects smartphone camera lenses and lets in more light</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xah9S1vZYGRDEGm9CqBSMH5FeeM=/128x0:1223x730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619421/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_1.03.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Corning&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XZGMF2"&gt;Corning &lt;a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/news/news-releases/2021/07/corning-expands-corning-gorilla-glass-composite-products-to-optimize-performance-of-mobile-device-cameras.html"&gt;has announced a new set of glass composites&lt;/a&gt; to protect the ever-growing number of camera lenses on the back of smartphones and capture more ambient light in the process. The new composites, called Gorilla Glass with DX and Gorilla Glass with DX+, offer “advanced optical performance, superior scratch resistance, and durability” according to Corning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsdd4e"&gt;Technically, this DX variety of composite isn’t entirely new, Corning offered a version of &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/07/19/corning-gorilla-glass-dx-smartwatch/"&gt;Gorilla Glass with DX / DX+ for smartwatches&lt;/a&gt; as early as 2018. But Corning says making the switch to smartphone camera lens covers added additional challenges because the glass needed to be more scratch-resistant and somehow let in more light, two qualities that can be at odds. Corning breaks down how it achieved both improvements in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="45Ltmf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/olO8scCNMu0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mor20n"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/corning-gorilla-glass-dx-for-phone-camera-lenses/"&gt;Corning tells &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Gorilla Glass with DX and Gorilla Glass with DX+ let in 98 percent of ambient light while still being just as scratch resistant as typical Gorilla Glass. In comparison, Corning claims lens covers with traditional anti-reflective coatings only let in about 95 percent of light. Maximizing the amount of light smartphones can gather while cutting down on reflections and glare is helpful for squeezing better performance out of smartphone cameras. It might also provide more information for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18203363/ai-artificial-intelligence-photography-google-photos-apple-huawei"&gt;the variety of computational processes&lt;/a&gt; that are now the norm in smartphone photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAhjZe"&gt;The company hasn’t announced what phones will feature the new glass composites, but Corning does say that Samsung is signed on as the first company to use the new Gorilla Glass camera lens covers. Given the Unpacked event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Samsung has scheduled for August 11th&lt;/a&gt; quickly approaching on the horizon, maybe we’ll see the glass in action sooner than we expect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s Smart Display is real and it’s just as pointless as we suspected</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2IZO507inYUFf5uJ1_7AS9-1OwI=/236x0:2600x1576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618624/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_9.04.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t appear that Verizon’s Smart Assistant can do a whole lot.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEtNSY"&gt;We got our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22552037/fcc-filing-shows-verizon-amazon-alexa-smart-display"&gt;first look at Verizon’s Smart Display&lt;/a&gt; last month thanks to an FCC filing. Yesterday, Amazon confirmed the device’s existence &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"&gt;as part of its Alexa Live presentation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s being introduced as part of the Alexa Custom Assistant program that allows third-party device manufacturers to add custom assistants built on top of Alexa technology to their products, and we regret to inform you that it looks just as useless as we first suspected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpVTyh"&gt;Here’s what it offers: standard smart display stuff, like an eight-inch screen, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi connectivity, and of course, Alexa. It also comes with LTE, a spec included in the FCC filing and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/verizons-smart-display-is-real-and-responds-to-hi-verizon/"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; following the announcement. But the purpose of 4G appears to be limited to providing connectivity while setting up or troubleshooting Verizon home internet. Amazon says this will reduce the need to “send service technicians to a customer’s house or have a customer call the Verizon Call Center for help.” So that’s kind of a narrow use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RU8gvM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4v4o9L6A2M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wo4LJA"&gt;There are also Verizon-service-specific commands that can be accessed by saying “Hi, Verizon,” like checking your bill or running a speed test. You know, things you can easily do on your phone or computer. You can ask Verizon smart assistant-type questions, like the current weather, but based on a promotional video published by Amazon it looks like Verizon will... just ask Alexa for you. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HavCIk"&gt;If you ever thought to yourself, “Self, wouldn’t it be great to have a way to check my phone bill hands-free while I eat a sandwich in the kitchen?” then maybe you’ve just found your match. Otherwise, this doesn’t exactly look like the smartest of smart displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgAwlr"&gt;Verizon hasn’t revealed a price or firm release date yet; &lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports that the display will be available later this year in limited beta testing with Verizon home internet customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ capable Nord 2 made better by midrange price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2W5lNlzw3BMBuy6VTfnQgOJ3hQ=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617009/Many_OnePlus_Nord_2s_having_fun.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qwsZhO"&gt;OnePlus has officially announced the Nord 2, a successor to last year’s excellent midrange debut. Like the original, the Nord 2 is releasing in Europe and India, and there are no plans for a US release. In Europe and the UK, prices start at £399 / €399 for its 8GB RAM / 128GB storage model, rising to £469 / €499 for a 12GB RAM / 256GB version (about $550 and $645, respectively). In the UK, preorders open on July 22nd from OnePlus.com and Amazon, and the phone goes on general sale on July 28th. You can read my first-hand impressions of the phone over in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22350856"&gt;full review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="doHCw5"&gt;OnePlus being OnePlus means we already had a good idea of what to expect from the Nord 2 before today. But now we know that in addition to its 50-megapixel main camera, the phone also has an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor on its rear. Round the front, there’s a 32-megapixel selfie camera, although there’s no secondary ultrawide selfie camera like last year’s Nord. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jI19GFzBN9gvbX1OxAD4l8E1w2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731129/Nord_2_Haze_Blue_07.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord 2 in blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hC6Eax"&gt;Like the original Nord, the Nord 2 has a 1080p 90Hz OLED display, but on this year’s model it’s ever so slightly smaller at 6.43-inches (compared to 6.44-inches). In Europe, the phone is available in blue and gray, while an additional green color will be available in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukdGY2"&gt;Internally, alongside the &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/nord-2-and-its-mediatek-dimensity-1200-ai-chipset-your-questions-answered.1464619/"&gt;MediaTek 1200-AI processor&lt;/a&gt; that OnePlus revealed earlier this month, in Europe the Nord 2 will be available with either 8 or 12GB of RAM, paired with 128 or 256GB of storage, respectively. There’s also a (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnePlus_IN/status/1417490218521964552"&gt;pre-announced)&lt;/a&gt; 4,500mAh battery with Warp Charge 65 fast charging, which OnePlus claims should be able to charge the phone to 100 percent in under 35 minutes. It’s 5G-compatible (sub-6GHz only) and includes dual-SIM support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGUOFV"&gt;The Nord 2 runs OxygenOS 11.3 out of the box, which &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-2-oliver-zhang-interaction/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt; is the first version of the software to reflect the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;merger with Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus is promising two years of Android updates and three years of security updates for the Nord 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FU1goy"&gt;As well as the Nord 2, OnePlus also used its event today to announce a new pair of true wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22351408"&gt;OnePlus Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which go on sale next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1d7lX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qihfpj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord 2 review: focused on the essentials</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;From its screen to its fast-charging, the Nord 2 has it where it counts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QP7RPd"&gt;From the start, OnePlus has positioned its midrange lineup of Nord phones as a less expensive, entirely separate lineup to its flagship devices. But with the Nord 2, which comes as a direct successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;original Nord&lt;/a&gt; released last year, the line between the two seems blurrier than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd6ENN"&gt;While the original Nord had its own character, such as a unique design and exclusive features like an ultrawide selfie camera, the Nord 2 feels more like a stripped down flagship. It’s got a very similar camera bump to the OnePlus 9, for example, and although the specific sensors are different, its cameras fill the same functions. But all the core essentials are still there: a vibrant high refresh rate screen, good battery life, and easy-to-use software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdYBz8"&gt;A more affordable, non-flagship starting price means it’s hard to argue with these tradeoffs. The OnePlus Nord 2 costs £399 / €399 for its 8GB RAM / 128GB storage model, rising to £469 / €499 for a 12GB RAM / 256GB storage version. (OnePlus isn’t selling the Nord 2 in the US, but those prices roughly convert to $470 and $588, respectively.) For this review, I’ve been using the 12GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kczner"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10662161"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uOChn3"&gt;With its 6.43-inch display, the OnePlus Nord 2 is a hair smaller than the OnePlus 9 (which has a 6.55-inch display), but otherwise this is a very similar-looking device. There’s a rectangular camera bump on the back containing three cameras, a hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera on the top left on the front, and a USB-C port on the bottom (but sadly, no headphone jack). Biometrics are handled via a snappy in-display fingerprint sensor, and there’s a physical slider to switch between silent and vibrate on the right of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmod5R"&gt;You’ll find Gorilla Glass on the front and back of the phone, but since its frame is plastic you might want to use a case if you’re particularly worried about the frame’s finish wearing off. Otherwise I didn’t notice the phone flexing any more than a typical aluminum framed phone. Like the original Nord, the Nord 2 doesn’t have an official IP rating for dust or water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2F0vrl"&gt;Oh, and this is also a 5G phone: you get sub-6GHz support, but no mmWave. Given the latter high-speed, low-range network type has &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/5G-mmWave-connectivity-is-finally-making-its-way-Europe-wide-with-promises-of-Gigabit-speeds.548139.0.html"&gt;barely started to roll out&lt;/a&gt; in the Nord 2’s release markets, it’s not something many people are likely to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neMCas"&gt;The most notable sign that this isn’t a flagship OnePlus device is its processor, which is a MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI rather than one of Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 888 chips. Considering MediaTek is a brand more commonly associated with budget devices, I was apprehensive about its inclusion on the OnePlus Nord 2, but I came away pleasantly surprised by performance overall. Yes, you miss out on Qualcomm-exclusive features like high quality AptX Bluetooth audio, but otherwise switching between apps was hitch-free, and the processors’ GPU happily made the most of the phone’s smooth 90Hz display while scrolling through even a relatively graphically intensive Twitter feed (which, in comparison, stuttered on the original Nord). I noticed the phone being slightly slow to wake up on a couple of occasions, however, but overall performance was on a par with, if not slightly better than the original Nord in everyday usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ipx1ZhE-EHjm4X0xIzPN5Ol4yPA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726845/jporter_210719_4669_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squint, and you could believe the Nord 2 is a OnePlus 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v1w9x3"&gt;The Nord 2’s 1080p screen is generally hard to fault. It does everything well that you’d expect from an OLED display. Whites are crisp and bright, colors are punchy, and blacks are, well, black. Its 90Hz refresh rate is technically a step down from the 120Hz panel that you’ll find on phones like the OnePlus 9, but in practice I didn’t notice a downgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xztwe"&gt;As a bonus, this time around the Nord 2’s screen is actually flanked by stereo speakers (one downward-firing and one from the phone’s earpiece), as opposed to the original Nord, which only ever played media audio out of its downward-facing speaker. You’ll still want to use headphones for proper listening, but the speakers’ volume meant I had no trouble hearing podcasts played out of the phone’s speakers while cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOcGqr"&gt;I got a little under five hours of screen-on time out of the Nord 2’s 4,500mAh battery, easily enough to last through a full day with a little to spare. But I was more impressed by the inclusion of Warp Charge 65 fast-charging here. When charging from zero, I hit 89 percent after a half hour, and 99 percent after 35 minutes, which felt remarkably quick. You have to use one of OnePlus’ proprietary chargers and the cable it comes with to get these speeds, but at least you get both in the box. The Nord 2 doesn’t support wireless charging, which isn’t entirely surprising at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kjLKKz7Xz8c1jP-lSq8gSOGTn9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726843/jporter_210719_4669_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a small hole-punch for the 32MP selfie camera on the top left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rSF9yoYjvHTO6az1G4XJDEhrq0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726846/jporter_210719_4669_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A physical slider lets you put the phone into silent mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SLy64y"&gt;The Nord 2 runs on OxygenOS 11.3 out of the box, which is notable for being the first version of OnePlus’ software to reflect its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;integration with Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-2-oliver-zhang-interaction/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. But despite the under-the-hood changes, the phone didn’t feel radically different in everyday usage. I found a few changes in the Settings menu, though, where several controls have been renamed and shifted positions slightly. It meant I struggled initially to find OnePlus’ standard screen calibration options, for example, but they’re still there in a slightly different sub-menu. It bodes well for the future of OxygenOS, which continues to be an uncluttered take on Android that I mostly appreciate for its ability to keep out of my way. In terms of ongoing support, the company promises you get two major Android updates and three years of security updates with the Nord 2, though it declined to say how regular these security updates would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GZmTk"&gt;Around the back of the Nord 2, you’ll find three rear cameras. Its main camera uses a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor (which OnePlus previously used for the ultrawide cameras on the 9 and the 9 Pro), which is flanked by a much lower-resolution pair of cameras: an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor of questionable utility. On its front there’s a 32-megapixel selfie camera, but it’s not paired with an ultrawide camera this time around, which makes me, personally, a little sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmRMZC"&gt;I generally liked the shots I got out of the Nord 2, and OIS on the main sensor means it’s easy to get consistently sharp shots every time you hit the shutter button. That said, they definitely have OnePlus’ typically punchy look, which prioritizes vibrancy over accuracy. It’s most obvious when you look at landscape photograph shots: I can promise you the grass in the photographs below was much less green and much more yellow in reality. Edges also tend to have a slightly over-sharpened look to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A9Uh0epNtadAvXUQRGIFHtFOFqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726847/jporter_210719_4669_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord 2 includes three rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eL8cN1"&gt;At night, the Nord 2’s standard photography mode automatically takes photos that are almost as bright as the Google Pixel’s Night Sight mode, and if you head into the phone’s dedicated Nightscape Ultra mode you get photos that almost look like they were taken in daylight were it not for how washed out they appear. In its standard photography mode, this brightness hides the fact that low-light shots aren’t particularly detailed, like in the photo below of an apartment block where the dividing lines between wooden slats have been smoothed out of existence. You’ll be able to make out your friends if you photograph them in a dimly lit bar, but their skin might come out looking a little smooth and plasticine-y in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GtA5eV"&gt;Oddly, this vibrancy doesn’t carry over to the ultrawide camera, where shots seem much more muted and arguably more color-accurate in comparison. There’s also less detail thanks to the lower resolution sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fvkvFT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10662184"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XTa70A"&gt;When it comes to people, the OnePlus Nord 2 can’t seem to resist the temptation to brighten skin tones, raise shadows, and make everything look a little flat. Even with its beautification mode turned off, I still got the impression the Nord 2 was avoiding showing me every last wrinkle and pore in my face. To its credit, the effect means you can barely tell I took the shots below while sweating my way through a horrid UK heatwave, but I think the overall photographs end up looking blander as a result. It’s a similar story with the phone’s selfie camera, although this is partially offset by the extra detail from defaulting to 32-megapixel shots, while the main camera on the rear defaults to around 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWQLwq"&gt;OnePlus’ continued insistence on including low-resolution monochrome sensors on the backs of its phones is baffling. The black and white photography option that makes use of it is still buried all the way at the end of the camera’s list of filters, and even once you go to the trouble of using it, I’ve yet to notice any difference it makes compared to a software-based filter. You can even cover up the monochrome sensor on the Nord 2 while you take a black and white shot, and the phone seemingly continues on unperturbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obmHyO"&gt;But complaints about the easily ignorable monochrome sensor aside, I think the Nord 2’s cameras get a lot of things right if you share its preference for bright, colorful shots. OIS on the main camera means it’s relatively easy to get crisp photographs, and you could do a lot worse at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-C, but no headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Q86Vsv"&gt;A month ago, OnePlus announced the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22543244/oneplus-nord-ce-5g-review"&gt;Nord CE&lt;/a&gt; or “Core Edition,” an affordable phone which was pitched as offering the essential features of a OnePlus smartphone without any extra bloat. But the more I use the OnePlus Nord 2, the more I think that this is the phone that fits that description much more accurately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCZ2uz"&gt;From its screen, to its cameras, its processor, and its software, the Nord 2 feels like a flagship phone stripped of any unnecessary features. There’s no Hasselblad-branded cameras, just a reasonably specced set of sensors. There’s no flagship Qualcomm chipset, but instead you get a processor that has no trouble handling the day-to-day duties of a modern smartphone. No wireless charging, but fast wired charging that more than makes up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="dIZhB2"&gt;All of this adds up to a compelling device if you’re looking to spend between £400 and £500 and you’re in a market when OnePlus is actually selling the Nord 2. A stripped down flagship it may be, but it’s hard to argue with what’s been left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="KaXPyQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10662155"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Predictably, T-Mobile’s merger promises weren’t enough to make a carrier out of Dish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c7Sxbus-lHW2cjZyGTaBgjHD3FA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69615817/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Sprint acquisition deal included too few requirements and put too much trust in a big corporation to do the right thing. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w4r1In"&gt;When T-Mobile acquired Sprint in April 2020, it brought our major wireless carrier choices from four down to three. Recognizing that this would indeed be a bad thing for US wireless customers (aka all of us), T-Mobile agreed to a set of conditions with the FCC’s blessing that would theoretically position Dish Network to fill the Sprint-shaped hole in our wireless landscape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZdDcv"&gt;In other words, one wireless competitor was allowed to reduce competition only if it agreed to help set up another competitor in its place. Sounds a little suspect, right? Surely a deal like that would include a lot of conditions, requirements, and oversight to make sure it would actually work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cq1jlv"&gt;But looking back, these were the major requirements imposed on T-Mobile to prop up Dish as a competitor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CfeG9G"&gt;Sell Sprint’s prepaid business, including Boost Mobile, to Dish within 120 days after the close of the merger, and maintain Boost’s competitiveness before the divestiture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rw0lgm"&gt;Provide Dish’s wireless customers with access to the T-Mobile network for at least six years through a wholesale MVNO agreement while Dish builds its own network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jgbqcS"&gt;Provide transition services for up to three years afterward to ensure Boost customers are transferred smoothly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kB3OaQ"&gt;Not do anything anti-competitive toward Boost, like throttling or limiting access to new network technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TLnpY1"&gt;Sell Sprint’s 800MHz spectrum to Dish three years after the closing of the merger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z7SbSn"&gt;Give Dish the option to acquire old Sprint cell sites and retail stores that T-Mobile opts to  decommission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NM9THA"&gt;Provide Dish with reasonable advance notice of network transition plans that could affect Boost customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="eTekCm"&gt;What’s missing there is any definition of success. The burden for the success of the plan lay on Dish’s shoulders, not T-Mobile’s, with Dish being the one legally required to cover 70 percent of the US population with 5G by 2023 (or now &lt;a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20200914/5g/dish-officially-gets-more-time-to-build-out-its-licenses-and-only-5g-will-do"&gt;possibly 2025&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxOBcZ"&gt;Here we are roughly a year later and so far, T-Mobile appears to have technically done everything it said it would do for Dish by now. But is the scheme to prop up our fourth wireless carrier working? It sure doesn’t seem so. The fact that Dish has now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;fled into the arms of AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; shows how insufficient T-Mobile’s support has been: instead of relying on the partner mandated by the $26 billion mega merger, Dish now has to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;spend $5 billion on a competitor&lt;/a&gt; to get where it wants to go. While not the final proof, it’s the latest reminder that the deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585761/dish-t-mobile-att-sprint-competition-editorial"&gt;was built on a shaky premise to start with&lt;/a&gt;, and regulators largely took it on faith &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962739/t-mobile-sprint-nextel-merger-prices-rural-coverage-promises"&gt;that big corporations would keep their promises&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LmnTgu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is the scheme to prop up our fourth wireless carrier working? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0G42tr"&gt;From the beginning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908539/t-mobile-sprint-merger-dish-network-failure-stopped-antitrust-experts-doj"&gt;critics of the merger deal&lt;/a&gt; suggested that it depended too much on T-Mobile and Dish doing the right thing and was so vague that it left the door open for funny business that could seriously hamper the effort to prop up Dish. The new T-Mobile wasted little time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429587/t-mobile-sprint-merge-jobs-promise-pandemic"&gt;breaking its promise of being “jobs-positive from day one”&lt;/a&gt; and it didn’t take long after the Boost sale for it to mess with Dish, too. In October 2020, T-Mobile told Dish it would be shutting down Sprint’s old CDMA network — which many of Dish’s Boost customers rely on — on January 1st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4heND"&gt;T-Mobile says it went above and beyond its obligations set out in the merger deal, and that may be technically true: regulators only required six months’ notice, and the company gave 14. T-Mobile’s filings with the FCC related to the merger don’t state exactly when it anticipated shutting down the CDMA network, just that it wouldn’t do so before January 1st, 2021. But T-Mobile also publicly promised it would “&lt;a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/t-mobile-sprint-merger-doj-clearance"&gt;ensure continued and seamless operation of Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; […] following transition to Dish’s ownership,” and yet its CDMA shutdown is on an even more aggressive timeline than rivals AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2PuKA3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving Dish a bit more than a year’s notice of a major service upheaval for many of its new customers is bullshit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOqW8Y"&gt;Getting the word out to customers that they’ll need to buy a new device and acquiring enough phones for them takes time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T started notifying its customers&lt;/a&gt; of its February 2022 3G shutdown in July of last year, and as Dish has pointed out repeatedly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358628/verizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022"&gt;Verizon has delayed closing down its CDMA network&lt;/a&gt; by several years to give itself enough time to migrate customers still using 3G phones. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;a recent letter to the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, Dish also pointed to other statements T-Mobile made that led it to believe that it would have a three-year period to migrate customers off the old network. T-Mobile’s response to the partner it was supposed to prop up? It more or less says that &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10411042233063/Letter%20to%20Acting%20Chairwoman%20Rosenworcel%20-%20Final.pdf"&gt;Dish wasn’t paying close enough attention&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwvJGB"&gt;Giving Dish a bit more than a year’s notice of a major service upheaval for many of its new customers is, to use the technical term, bullshit. (We’re not even counting the global health crisis and the chip shortage which might have made this task harder.) And while T-Mobile may be right when it claims to have played by the rules, it certainly qualifies as funny business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdYdnn"&gt;Clearly, the deal didn’t require enough from T-Mobile, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134278/sprint-tmobile-merger-court-ruling-opinion-decision-explainer-carriers-antitrust"&gt;relied too heavily on then-CEO John Legere and Dish’s Charlie Ergen seeming like pretty cool guys&lt;/a&gt; to the judge, Victor Marrero. Putting the onus on Dish to pay up if it missed its 2025 deadline predictably did nothing to encourage T-Mobile to play nice and help Dish along. Unless Dish can pull off something incredible, it looks like we’ll be living without that fourth major wireless carrier for a long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google gives Pixel 4 XL an extra year of free repairs for power issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-adPzqMK7Q5i3AAb7EwEi3NHccw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69611569/vpavic_191016_3730_0029.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ENwDJK"&gt;If your out-of-warranty Pixel 4 XL has been exhibiting some problems, you might be able to get a free repair. Google recently &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10169830?hl=en"&gt;posted a support page&lt;/a&gt; outlining a “one-year extended repair program” for the larger of its two 2019 flagships. Those who are eligible can receive a free repair for up to a year after their original warranty expires. As for who’s covered by this program, Google points to “certain power-related issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EuqPLc"&gt;More specifically, the company says these are the problems that “may” get a free repair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wAVXaX"&gt;A Pixel 4 XL that can’t be powered on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NPYIhX"&gt;The Pixel 4 XL restarts or shuts down randomly without any user action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rGk1L3"&gt;Charging problems with the power adapter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="smPuWr"&gt;Wireless charging issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7lmSNv"&gt;The battery on a Pixel 4 XL is draining “significantly faster than earlier in its use”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TM5eKI"&gt;That’s a pretty wide spread of potential ways to qualify for the repair program. But Google cautions that if there are other major problems with your phone (like a damaged screen) that “prevent” the complimentary repair, those will have to be fixed first — and for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpK70V"&gt;Pixel 4 XL owners can bring their device to &lt;a href="https://www.ubreakifix.com/locations"&gt;a uBreakiFix store&lt;/a&gt; to see if it qualifies for a free fix. According to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/20/google-might-be-extending-your-pixel-4-xls-warranty-for-an-extra-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, repair staff at those locations are very familiar with the situation. You can also start the repair process directly with Google to see if your issue is covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFv7Xm"&gt;The extended repair program is available in the US, Canada, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan. Google specifies that it does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; apply in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, or the UK. That’s because Pixel 4 XLs purchased in those countries already came with a longer two-year manufacturer’s warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods update to arrive later this year with iPhone SE refresh coming 2022: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csz6F4-t8Kc9zJwssBSsQVlCehg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610248/akrales_170124_1410_A_0093.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-generation AirPods will reportedly have a shorter stem than current models (above). &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CtMfh8"&gt;Apple will start production on updated AirPods next month, with plans to launch the third-generation earbuds later this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-to-go-all-in-on-5G-for-its-2022-iPhone-lineup"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the latest rumor regarding Apple’s product schedule, which will reportedly include an all-5G iPhone line-up in 2022, including a revamped iPhone SE sporting the as-yet-unannounced A15 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5QeOa"&gt;A refresh of Apple’s entry-level AirPods have been rumored for a while now, with previous generations launched in 2016 and 2019. Back in May, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the earbuds will have a design similar to the AirPods Pro, with “a new case and shorter stems poking out of the bottom of each one.” If &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; is right about production starting next month, we can expect to see the new-look AirPods revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;alongside the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; this September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4qe52"&gt;In addition to the earbuds, Apple might also release new versions of the MacBook Pro later this year, says &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;. This rumor seems pretty solid, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that the new laptops will be available in 14-inch and 16-inch screen sizes, with next-gen Apple-designed Arm processors, the return of MagSafe charging, and the end of the Touch Bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhhfLd"&gt;Looking ahead to 2022, Apple is expected to equip all new iPhones that year with 5G compatibility. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; says the company will not update the smaller iPhone 12 Mini in 2022 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;disappointing sales&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/05/2021-iphone-13-name-report/"&gt;reports suggest&lt;/a&gt; it will offer an iPhone 13 Mini later this year). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0zPpn"&gt;Instead, in 2022, the company will refresh the cheaper iPhone SE with 5G and an A15 processor. The updated iPhone SE will reportedly use a Qualcomm chip for 5G compatibility, an interesting note given that Apple is reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168779/apple-leak-cellular-modem-johny-srouji-town-hall"&gt;building its own modems&lt;/a&gt; in order to further wean itself off third-party designs. The new iPhone SE will also reportedly keep its 4.7-inch LCD displays, says &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;, making it the obvious choice for consumers who prefer a smaller device. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/23/2022-iphone-se-details/"&gt;Earlier reports&lt;/a&gt; about the third-generation SE said it will also retain the home button and Apple’s Touch ID sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s gaming expansion starts with mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wT03y_BYKhH9s7Od7inytuRN6MQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608381/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SWOM4W"&gt;Netflix revealed that its initial efforts in gaming will be focused on mobile games and that the games will be included with users’ Netflix subscriptions, the company announced as part of its second-quarter earnings report on Tuesday. The news comes just days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;the company said it hired&lt;/a&gt; former EA and Oculus exec Mike Verdu to head up its gaming work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyHJ5A"&gt;Here is exactly what Netflix said about gaming, &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;from its letter to investors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sm3E6C"&gt;We’re also in the early stages of further expanding into games, building on our earlier efforts around interactivity (eg, &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;) and our &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; games. We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV. Games will be included in members’ Netflix subscription at no additional cost similar to films and series. Initially, we’ll be primarily focused on games for mobile devices. We’re excited as ever about our movies and TV series offering and we expect a long runway of increasing investment and growth across all of our existing content categories, but since we are nearly a decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about how our members value games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OPRa37"&gt;There are still no details on what types of games will actually be available, though Netflix recently extended its TV deal with Shonda Rhimes &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/netflix-shonda-rhimes-extend-deal-to-include-feature-films-gaming-and-virtual-reality-content-1235014998/"&gt;to include feature films and gaming content&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also no word on how games will be delivered to Netflix subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXDMdT"&gt;The company has acknowledged in the past that it competes with games for time and attention, with co-CEO Reed Hastings writing that “we compete with (and lose to) &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; more than HBO” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18187357/netflix-views-numbers-disney-amazon-fortnite-youtube-earnings-bird-box"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. COO Greg Peters discussed the company’s interest in games in April (&lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Netflix-Inc.-Q1-2021-Earnings-Call-Apr-20-2021.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) as part of its first quarter earnings. And the company has already dipped its toes into gaming with experiences like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152973/netflix-carmen-sandiego-interactive-special-black-mirror-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carmen Sandiego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV1aJe"&gt;But with the recent hiring of Verdu and the new information shared Tuesday about its initial plans, now it seems like Netflix is more focused on games than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is also switching to Android Messages as default for RCS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zZHxdIDdhTmygFE3Ihttsj-XPac=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69605640/rcs_static.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T2m9QY"&gt;Beginning next year, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-google-messaging-services-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon will join AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile in preloading Android Messages&lt;/a&gt; as the default texting app on all Android phones it sells. It’s the final step for making RCS Chat — the next-gen standard designed to replace SMS — the default experience for Android. In the US, that only leaves one large cohort that will not use RCS as a default SMS replacement: iPhone users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QbOmp"&gt;Verizon has also said it will fully support interoperability between carriers, so in theory the improved images, video, read receipts, and group chats should just work — assuming everybody you’re texting with is also using Android Messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Oy5tR"&gt;Verizon was the last of the big three US carriers to get on board with Google’s latest strategy to push RCS as the new default for texting. After years of cajoling, shaming, and downright pleading, the company has made deals with carriers to simply use the standard Android Messages app, which supports RCS by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UdagT8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AT&amp;amp;amp;T joins T-Mobile in switching all Android phones to Google’s Messages app for RCS ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556686/att-android-phones-rcs-google-messages"},{"title":"T-Mobile is betting big on Google’s Android services: RCS, YouTube TV, Pixel, and more ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"},{"title":"EXCLUSIVE: CHAT IS GOOGLE’S NEXT BIG FIX FOR ANDROID’S MESSAGING MESS ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/19/17252486/google-android-messages-chat-rcs-anil-sabharwal-imessage-texting"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dLNUl0"&gt;Hiroshi Lockheimer, senior vice president of Android, Chrome OS, and the Play Store, is quick to note that end-to-end encryption for RCS inside Android Messages is also in the process of rolling out. It’s available for “peer-to-peer” chats (i.e. a chat with one other person), but group chats are on the roadmap as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ah3HiB"&gt;Default, end-to-end encrypted chats between Android phones raise an interesting conundrum for Apple. Next year, texts between Android phones and iPhones will be less secure than texts within those two ecosystems — because they will be on SMS instead of RCS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2PUe2"&gt;Apple’s Messages app offers end-to-end encryption if all users are on the iMessage system, and it has shown no appetite to either offer iMessage on Android nor to adopt RCS on the iPhone. Google, meanwhile, is happy to take the opportunity to needle Apple by openly inviting it to use RCS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IiDxaT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I would hope that as everyone focuses on security and privacy it becomes an important part of the discussion.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="container"&gt;“Going forward, the default messaging experience on Android is going to be more secure,” says Lockheimer, who has previously invited Apple to adopt RCS. “The fallback messaging experience on the other platform will not have encryption if it’s still SMS. I think that that is a pretty interesting dynamic and I would hope that as everyone focuses on security and privacy it becomes an important part of the discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaFqbW"&gt;Lockheimer wouldn’t confirm if Google is in active discussions with Apple, but it doesn’t seem as though RCS is likely to come to the iPhone soon and the company has declined to comment on the matter several times over the years. But there is clearly a pressure campaign on, even if it’s not very strident. Speaking about Apple adoption, Lockheimer says, “I actually do think getting the three major carriers in the US to adopt RCS in a consistent manner is a big part of the equation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiSTq3"&gt;Currently, there are 473 million monthly active RCS users around the globe, &lt;a href="https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/rcs/"&gt;according to the GSMA&lt;/a&gt;. Adoption in the US is likely to boost that number by quite a bit. Google has no plans to try to introduce a messaging app that supports RCS on the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kbd3J"&gt;Although RCS has been closely associated with Google, the company often points to the fact that it is meant to be a standard that is shared by the entire mobile industry and managed by the GSMA. Carriers are able to use their own RCS infrastructure instead of Google’s. Still, RCS is closely tied to Google in many people’s minds and Google offers RCS services to carriers and will even allow consumers to directly use RCS via its services if their carrier doesn’t offer it. Google began pushing RCS as the new texting experience on Android after its own messaging attempts (notably Hangouts and Allo) floundered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xlX5hJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The RCS rollout has been a long, complicated slog&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LTm6tu"&gt;Lockheimer claims that Google prefers the slightly more open RCS approach to a Google-owned texting solution being the default on Android. “We don’t think there should be one messaging app to rule them all. We fully realize people are going to use multiple messaging apps,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BERDuW"&gt;As for Verizon, it will continue to offer its Verizon Message+ (VM+) application alongside Android Messages for customers who wish to use it. It’s a maligned app and for good reason: it’s rife with awkward interface controls and Verizon branding — but since it’s really the only way to sync Verizon text messages across different devices, it’s going to stick around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7TrxU"&gt;Apparently Verizon and Google intend to find a way to ensure that VM+ and Android Messages share a text message database so that messages stay in sync. That’s potentially a first step toward opening up RCS to third-party applications — something that’s been impossible so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJUX3W"&gt;Google’s deal with Verizon caps a flurry of RCS activity that kicked off this past March with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;T-Mobile deal&lt;/a&gt;, then the end of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534173/google-android-summer-features-earthquake-messages-emoji-kitchen-auto-voice-access"&gt;encrypted chat beta in June&lt;/a&gt;, and finally a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556686/att-android-phones-rcs-google-messages"&gt;deal with AT&amp;amp;T in June&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4Junm"&gt;Unfortunately, as with all things Android and RCS, the results of that activity won’t be felt by users until later. Verizon won’t be making the switch to Android Messages until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGXtCf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
