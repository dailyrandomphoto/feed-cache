    <title>Dear wireless carriers: the 5G hype needs to stop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kf0ie2OmFi9vJERCQ2Xnrr77vzc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69206320/VRG_ILLO_4037_5G_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4yHhZ4"&gt;Just stop. Stop telling us why your 5G network is the very best and fastest and most reliable. Stop running commercials about how life-changing your 5G network is. Definitely stop telling us why your 5G network is better than the other guy’s 5G network because can you &lt;em&gt;even imagine&lt;/em&gt; building a 5G network the way they have? Please stop with all of this, it’s been a very long year and we’re tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsUxd7"&gt;It would be one thing to make all of these fantastical claims like you do if any of them reflected any real person’s experience. They don’t. Your 5G networks are just not that good yet. They’ll get better, and that’s nice! But please stop pretending like the 5G train has pulled into the station and all we have to do is get on board to be whisked away to the low-latency, Gigabit future when you’re still building the tracks. And the train station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZrRbfP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;please stop pretending like the 5G train has pulled into the station&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9NUTGe"&gt;We’re tired of false starts. First there was 5G Evolution, which sounds exciting. It rhymes with revolution! But then it turned out to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;just another name for LTE&lt;/a&gt;, which was a bummer. Then there was mmWave, which you called Ultra Wideband because it sounds cooler. It will drive cars, do surgeries, fly drones, you said. You’ll experience download speeds on your phone so astoundingly fast that your sunglasses will fly off your face just being so close. And sure enough, the speed was impressive, that one time we were on the right street corner trying to download a whole movie. But then the crosswalk signal turned green and we kept walking, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326857/verizon-5g-ads-coverage-speeds-nationwide-misleading-nad-tv"&gt;we lost the signal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNpLJv"&gt;Now we learn that Ultra Wideband suddenly means mmWave &lt;em&gt;and C-band&lt;/em&gt;, and that C-band will actually change everything and we’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324345/verizon-c-band-5g-unlimited-plans"&gt;have to pay more if we want to use it&lt;/a&gt;. This is confusing, we’re tired, and now we have to go look for our sunglasses. So please let us know when you’ve settled on whatever frequencies will actually change our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="cDCA3F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Just build the network and we’ll see for ourselves if it really is great&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ngHBpI"&gt;We know you’re excited about how you’re building your 5G network, but please don’t explain to us in detail &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fthe-current-state-of-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F29%2F22409675%2Fverizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;why your spectrum is the best spectrum&lt;/a&gt; and the other guy’s spectrum is garbage. You sound like a kid who wrote a PowerPoint presentation for her parents with a point-by-point argument for why she deserves a later bedtime. We, the general phone-using population, do not care to be dragged into these details. Just build the network and we’ll see for ourselves if it really is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="721s6X"&gt;You’ve spent a lot of time recently &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-reports-strong-start-2021-company-accelerates-5g-growth" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;breathlessly telling your shareholders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Ft-mobile-further-solidifies-5g-leadership-position-with-successful-c-band-auction&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F29%2F22409675%2Fverizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;why you won the C-band auction&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve been scraping the bottom of the barrel on live sports entertainment over the last year, but last time we checked, a federal spectrum auction is not the Super Bowl! Nobody’s keeping score! Unless you’re playing &lt;a href="https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Calvinball"&gt;Calvinball&lt;/a&gt;, you can’t declare something to be a sport, run around the field, then put on a referee uniform and say that you won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="XR5TIx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We all just want our phone service to work when we need it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSNlN9"&gt;This may come as a shock, but we don’t cheer for our wireless carriers as if they were baseball teams. We don’t trash-talk our friends about how our carrier’s 5G network is &lt;em&gt;absolutely crushing&lt;/em&gt; their carrier’s 5G network. We don’t ask them how they can live with themselves knowing that their carrier is building their 5G network the &lt;em&gt;wrong way&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2GP4x8"&gt;We all just want our phone service to work when we need it. We want to tweet our stupid tweets, share our dumb pet photos, follow our actual baseball teams, and do so with as little inconvenience as possible. Sure, we want faster service! But we don’t want to know how the sausage is made. Please stop for now and let us know when you’re ready to serve it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUhMa5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEAu9i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish chairman calls T-Mobile the ‘Grinch’ for going back on merger promises</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XcfFIuBT76j5-Jaypf0loEG6YDM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69206248/acastro_200804_1777_dish_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HgTetD"&gt;Today’s Dish Network Q1 earnings call took an unexpected turn into Whoville when chairman Charlie Ergen compared T-Mobile to the Grinch. The comparison came up when discussing the “Uncarrier’s” decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;go ahead with its CDMA shutdown&lt;/a&gt;, a move that will potentially see millions of Dish’s Boost Mobile customers losing service at the beginning of next year. Ergen made no secret what he thinks of the move: “They’ve become the Grinch.” He went on to add, “the Uncarrier’s become the uncaring carrier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1NEEk"&gt;Dish Network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquired Boost as a condition of the Sprint / T-Mobile merger&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of positioning Dish to take Sprint’s place as the US’s fourth wireless carrier. A year later, the company faces a major setback following T-Mobile’s announcement that it plans to shut down the CDMA network many Boost customers use by the beginning of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OD6CX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Uncarrier’s become the uncaring carrier”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XKmjWh"&gt;Dish has issued statements warning that the consequences to its business would be dire, and &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-california-regulators-t-mobile-inquiry-reopen-9d87c61c-8349-440c-97eb-8cde807ba9bf.html"&gt;recently asked&lt;/a&gt; the California Public Utilities Commission reopen its investigation of the merger. The company’s wireless business hasn’t been looking rosy even without considering the impending shutdown; it continued to lose subscribers with a net decrease of 161,000 last quarter, which is around half of the 363,000 it lost in the previous quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kP87p"&gt;Ergen has previously voiced his disappointment in the timing of the shutdown, calling it anti-competitive, but he went a step further on this morning’s investor call with his Grinch metaphor, describing T-Mobile’s move as “heartless.” But he puts a hopeful spin on the metaphor, noting that the Grinch ended up giving back all of the toys he took from the Whos, and his heart grew three sizes that day. Ergen says the comparison was inspired by recently reading the book to his granddaughter, and that rather than the character’s trademark green color, he “kept seeing a magenta Grinch.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is giving its top prepaid hotspot plan a big price cut and more data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F6nYNSjSefgz4FUmbf23KKjuw7g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69202232/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customers already enrolled in the prepaid plan will get a data boost and a lower price when their plan renews.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCXn6a"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says it will now offer a prepaid 5G data-only plan with up to 100GB of data for $55 per month — a big upgrade from its previous offering of 40GB for $75. The new pricing extends to Cricket Wireless customers as well as AT&amp;amp;T’s direct prepaid subscribers, though those on Cricket won’t be able to access the 5G network. These plans allow customers to buy data for their tablet or mobile hotspot separate from their voice plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEnrf2"&gt;That 100GB is a lot of data at a lower price than the other major carriers are offering; currently, T-Mobile has a prepaid data-only plan of 50GB for $50 and Verizon has a 30GB plan for $65 per month. It may be no coincidence that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497743/verizon-home-lte-service-rural-communities-48-states"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; are also eager to expand their own 5G and LTE-based fixed home wireless products, but AT&amp;amp;T may have a little more room to be aggressive with its mobile hotspot offerings while it remains committed to pushing its fiber home internet service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWxMmR"&gt;The company says that current Cricket customers already enrolled in the 100GB data-only plan — previously $90 per month — will see the new price reflected on their next bill. Likewise, existing AT&amp;amp;T customers will get a data bump and a price decrease automatically. New customers can sign up for the plans starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon says problems with phone calls in Southern California are now fixed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b5uYohPrrW1XYNybYSJ5xRXQML0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195325/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o4yCkB"&gt;Many Verizon customers in Southern California reported difficulties making calls on Tuesday afternoon, and the company confirmed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time that was a “network issue” affecting voice services in parts of the region. That issue was resolved overnight, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4u39G"&gt;During the outage, if you were having trouble making calls, the spokesperson recommended putting your device in airplane mode or restarting your phone, which they said should fix the issues. And in response to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1387143438316064784"&gt;one person on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, Verizon’s support account recommended using Wi-Fi “if possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jrHKmG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We do apologize, Verizon is currently experiencing a wireless network issue in your area. Our technicians are aware of this issue and are working to resolve it quickly. It is best to use Wi-Fi if possible. Please also enable Data Roaming. *AOR&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Wireless CS (@VZWSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1387143438316064784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qx0gQT"&gt;On Tuesday, I found &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carlisleshelley/status/1387139550410010627"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeGoff20/status/1387140510335205377"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; of people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RickyJimenez/status/1387140515435466752"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tscarrithers/status/1387140551258951681"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; making phone calls in Southern California, but it wasn’t clear exactly how far the outage extended or exactly which areas might have been affected. Downdetector’s &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;map of user reports&lt;/a&gt; strongly indicated that the outage is affected Los Angeles, San Diego, and the surrounding areas. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CyZS7tN_0NfpXa4gKbvJbGVRV_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22474098/Screen_Shot_2021_04_27_at_2.09.59_PM.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O4DHZM"&gt;As of 4:39PM ET on Tuseday, Downdetector counted &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/"&gt;nearly 8,000 reports of problems with Verizon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSbVCq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 28th, 2:29PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added confirmation from Verizon that the outage was fixed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram’s group video calls will finally launch in May</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ixIbVRqXLhoVbk-Qj50vBt2inbc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199888/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TCa1EK"&gt;Telegram CEO Pavel Durov &lt;a href="https://t.me/durov/160"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that the iOS version of Telegram will be updated to support group video calls in May (&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/telegram-add-group-video-calls-125053371.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company originally planned to add the video call feature to its messaging service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234254/telegram-messaging-app-group-video-calling-security-usability"&gt;at some point in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but the feature never materialized. Telegram did at least make it into the new year with one video call addition: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/15/21370420/telegram-video-calls-os-android"&gt;end-to-end encrypted one-on-one video calls&lt;/a&gt; were added in August 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXaM55"&gt;Durov’s announcement of the new launch date was shared — naturally — in his personal Telegram channel. He writes that group video calls will have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="jxGndK"&gt;Screen sharing, encryption, noise-cancelling, desktop and tablet support — everything you can expect from a modern video conferencing tool, but with Telegram-level UI, speed and encryption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qGq5qq"&gt;Telegram already offers end-to-end encryption on its one-on-one video calling, but the company hasn’t explicitly confirmed the feature here. We’ve reached out to confirm that it plans to offer the same on group video calls when they launch in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fc4J8B"&gt;Telegram has grown significantly over the pandemic, taking advantage of the shift to working from home and the general desire to stay connected securely. The company announced it reached &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/400-million"&gt;400 million monthly active users&lt;/a&gt; in April 2020, up from &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/200-million"&gt;200 million in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Some of that has to do with its competitor, WhatsApp, fumbling how it communicated its new privacy policy to customers, which inspired some users to leave the Facebook-owned app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;for Telegram and Signal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tihane"&gt;Despite seeming a bit less nimble, WhatsApp actually beat Telegram to offering end-to-end encrypted group video calls. The company&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/30/17632650/whatsapp-group-video-calling-feature-now-live"&gt; added group video and voice calling&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile launches LTE-based SyncUp Tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-W8JVbG76a6O-mdfEZJsOyqHfqI=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199710/SyncUP_TRACKER_Black_Front_Left_Laynard_RGB_2020_10_01_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SyncUp uses LTE rather than Bluetooth or UWB so it doesn’t need to be within range of your phone (or someone else’s) to be located.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfl65d"&gt;It seems that 2021 is the year of the tracker, with new options from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and now T-Mobile in the form of its SyncUp Tracker. But unlike those other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20901686/tile-tracker-mate-pro-slim-sticker-release-date-news-features"&gt;Tile-type&lt;/a&gt; tracking devices, SyncUp uses LTE rather than Bluetooth or Ultra Wideband for real-time location information, a la &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/10/17841570/samsung-smartthings-tracker-gps-lte-m"&gt;Samsung’s SmartThings&lt;/a&gt; tracker. That means it doesn’t rely on being within a certain range of your phone (or other phones) to tell you where it is — but it does come with a $5 per month data charge on your T-Mobile phone plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAxx6S"&gt;The SyncUp offers some nice tracking features: you can make the device ring to help locate it when it’s out of sight, for example, and it offers geofencing to send you an alert when it leaves a predetermined area. It’s also IP67 dust and water resistant. More unusually, it offers a light sensor as an optional feature to detect if it’s been moved from somewhere dark, like the inside of a suitcase, to somewhere brighter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzKIvKSkEiy0BEErMMBX5VLh1no=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475640/T_Mobile_SyncUP_TRACKER_Lifestyle_Bike_21CM0084_030421_0918.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SyncUp’s rechargeable battery should last up to seven days on a charge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="urUnmC"&gt;Some trackers fit into the “set it and forget it” category with long-lasting batteries that only need to be replaced once a year or so. The SyncUp is not one of these devices. Its 900mAh battery needs to be recharged about once every seven days, so it’ll either be something you use occasionally as needed, or one more gadget in your life that you have to remember to charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cifbMS"&gt;Since the SyncUp operates on T-Mobile’s data network, you’ll need one of their data plans to use it: specifically, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fplans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F28%2F22407716%2Ft-mobile-syncup-tracker-lte-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;postpaid Magenta plan&lt;/a&gt;, though the company says it plans to make the tracker available for Sprint and prepaid customers in the future. With autopay, T-Mobile says prices start at $5 per month per connected device, and it’s compatible with both Android and iOS phones. It goes on sale next Friday, May 7th, for $60 outright or $2.50 per month with financing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Messages gets One UI-inspired redesign on recent Samsung flagships</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ch1vt6_NLoK8sH3bBnc2aqFebW0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198083/vpavic_210118_4377_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2dXjib"&gt;Google’s Messages app is getting a redesign on Samsung’s Galaxy S21 devices, bringing its appearance into line with Samsung’s other One UI software, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-messages-galaxy-s21-one-ui-design/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Screenshots posted by &lt;em&gt;XDA &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS21/comments/mwav0k/google_messages_adopting_a_oneui_design_anyone/"&gt;users on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; show the app’s home screen has been divided into two sections: an upper information area with an unread messages counter and a lower section with links to each conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXN2Db"&gt;The redesign follows Samsung’s decision to use Google’s messaging app as the default for its S21 lineup in select markets. With the redesign the Messages app now looks like it belongs as a default, with a look that’s similar to other Samsung software like its Notes or Settings apps. However, in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s21-makes-google-messages-app-native/"&gt;Samsung Messages is still the default&lt;/a&gt; messaging app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/adJl93OB6F_tPCxPBjY-x8XS1IY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475098/Google_Messages_One_UI_Design_461x1024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-messages-galaxy-s21-one-ui-design/" target="_blank"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The home screen now features a large title area in the top half.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KKzb6F"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/27/google-messages-one-ui-galaxy-s21/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Google has been testing the redesign previously, but that it’s now getting a widespread rollout on S21 devices outside of the US. With the app’s appearance now more in line with Samsung’s design style, it will be interesting to see whether Samsung is tempted to make Google’s app its default within the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go Fest is back this July as a global event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KNf92PjhiT2Bf076B3GdZyXX_4Q=/128x0:896x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194356/Ez_vg5sWEAQ5F9D.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image for Pokémon Go Fest 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y8aulW"&gt;The annual &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; Fest is back again this summer, scheduled for July 17th and 18th. Last year’s event was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272334/pokemon-go-fest-2020-online-niantic"&gt;held online&lt;/a&gt; due to the COVID-19 pandemic, instead of taking place in person in select cities around the globe. It sounds like this year’s fest will once again happen virtually; developer Niantic describes the event as a “global event.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6Rc4S"&gt;Niantic didn’t share many other details, though it did tease that this year’s event could be particularly noteworthy. “2021 marks both the twenty-fifth anniversary of Pokémon and the fifth anniversary of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, so trust us when we say you won’t want to miss &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; Fest 2021!” &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/pokemongofest2021-save-the-date"&gt;Niantic said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qxExJA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Time to mark your calendars, Trainers!  ️ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonGOFest2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PokemonGOFest2021&lt;/a&gt; will be a two-day global event from July 17 to July 18!   We can’t wait to show you what’s in store. &lt;a href="https://t.co/L0fcETooMj"&gt;https://t.co/L0fcETooMj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jljTUQBE1h"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jljTUQBE1h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1387090560637456384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fF0EfE"&gt;Last year’s online-only &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; Fest was a huge success, with “a record number of millions of trainers” in 124 countries and regions catching nearly a billion pokémon in total, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344717/pokemon-go-fest-2020-stats-numbers-niantic"&gt;Niantic said&lt;/a&gt; after the 2020 fest. Niantic also said that players walked nearly 15 kilometers each on average.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE is selling a $200 phone with wireless charging through Visible and Yahoo Mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sjp5VRooId_eTJ7urb12esvpm5Y=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194294/Blade_11_Prime_Front_Left.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZTE Blade 11 Prime features a 6.5-inch display and also supports wired reverse charging.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cR9ydL"&gt;ZTE is offering a feature rarely seen in the budget class of phones: wireless charging. The Blade 11 Prime is on sale now in the US for $192 through Visible and Yahoo Mobile, two MVNOs that use Verizon’s network. It’s an otherwise fairly unremarkable budget device, with a 6.5-inch 720p display shipping with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdOn9x"&gt;In addition to wireless charging, the Blade 11 Prime supports reverse wired charging to provide some power to other devices in a pinch. However, the phone’s 4,000mAh battery is on the smaller side, so the feature is probably best reserved for emergencies. The 11 Prime uses a MediaTek 6762 chipset with 4GB of RAM and offers 64GB of built-in storage. It features 16-megapixel standard and 8-megapixel wide rear-facing cameras, plus an 8-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t200QA9ZovjDyprLI6twl9ojvXY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473490/Blade_11_Prime_Back.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: ZTE&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 11 Prime includes a 16-megapixel main camera in its rear triple-cam array.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DUlctz"&gt;There’s not a lot to get excited about here outside of wireless charging, but it is a nice feature to have available as an option in the budget class. More than a few phones around $200, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;OnePlus Nord N100&lt;/a&gt;, offer huge battery capacity as a differentiating feature, but the option to use a wireless charger that’s likely compatible with other gadgets you already own is another handy proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Backbone One is a stunning controller that turns your iPhone into a more capable gaming device</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Complete with software features that make it easy to join parties, record, and share video clips&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mbWWFf"&gt;As the high-profile disputes about what content you can play on your iPhone rage on between Apple, Epic Games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;Google, and Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, a company called Backbone is focusing instead on making sure you get the most out of the games that are currently available. Like Razer did with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431952/razer-kishi-controller-iphone-ios-review"&gt;Kishi controller for iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and as other companies have with snap-on controllers of their own, Backbone is introducing one for $100 that it calls the Backbone One. You can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplaybackbone.com%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone-one%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21525741%2Fbackbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy it from Backbone’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JltN1G"&gt;With the controller fully extended, it can fit any iPhone running iOS 13 or later, starting with the iPhone 6S and including the new iPhone 12 lineup. It’s great for Apple Arcade games that support controllers. &lt;em&gt;Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; play wonderfully with the One. And, for popular games like &lt;em&gt;COD: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; that don’t have controller support switched on from the start, Backbone curates visual tutorials that appear before it launches to walk you through the steps to turn it on in the game’s settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj5Dex"&gt;Since the Backbone One launched, it now works with &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393793/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-iphone-ipad-hands-on"&gt;the xCloud iOS beta&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22176273/google-stadia-ios-beta-live-now-mobile-safari-iphone-ipad-cloud-gaming"&gt;Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Even playing games like &lt;em&gt;Hades &lt;/em&gt;through the Steam Link app (with my PC connected via Wi-Fi) felt surprisingly natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1n-iRgtg4cNfJG9iV9Qy9fsR30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989942/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The analog stick is sized similarly to the ones built into the Joy-Con for Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DwtkqN-w96Qpe_ZU3kc0i5S13g4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989940/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The triggers are also similar to those on the Joy-Con, yet these have a more satisfying travel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RBU5X5"&gt;Unlike most controller accessories made thus far, the Backbone One is a hybrid of tightly integrated hardware and software. If we’re looking at the hardware, it’s arguably the best of its kind yet. Both sides of this controller have rounded edges that fit naturally in my hand. I praised the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;design of the Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt;, but this has a more subtle look that doesn’t cover up as much of your phone’s edges. Each button has a more responsive, tactile click, and the analog sticks feel roughly the same size as Nintendo’s Joy-Con for the Switch. Speaking of the Joy-Con, the One’s rear triggers actually feel &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="58jOQj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9545130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dT19br"&gt;The Backbone One features passthrough Lightning charging, with support for Lightning headphones if you have a set. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack, giving you another way to listen to audio — even if your iPhone doesn’t have the port itself. As for power consumption, Backbone says the One itself demands less power from your iPhone than many wired Lightning earbuds do. I didn’t notice more battery usage during gameplay with the controller attached than I normally would without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R4p9F_Zg3IM1_Vae-Y_dIeslxJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989938/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0008.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miraculously, the One adds a 3.5mm port, so bust out those wired headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RfRkKTciPYMa4kacwguTUQNRdnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989939/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0007.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lightning port supports passthrough charging, as well as audio for Lightning EarPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l1gqUO"&gt;The hardware alone might make it worth the purchase, but the software is what really makes it unique. The One doesn’t require its companion app to work with any iOS game that supports a controller, but using the app turns your iPhone into a game console of sorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jz4iFB"&gt;Pushing the controller’s orange Backbone button while the One is connected to your phone will open up the Backbone app, which looks like an operating system. There, you’ll find all of your installed games cleanly laid out in an almost tvOS-esque interface. The app also shows new games available for download in the App Store that support controllers. To add games to the Backbone interface, just tap the orange button when you first boot up each new game. This app takes advantage of the iPhone’s excellent haptics to buzz when you flip around the menu, and the company made its own satisfyingly subtle vibration effect that you’ll feel while quickly flying through a bunch of tiles in the interface with the L1 and R1 shoulder buttons. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A full look at what you’ll see when you press the orange Backbone button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ru0rOB"&gt;Scroll down a little more in the app, and you’ll find photo and video clips you’ve saved and those from friends. This controller has a dedicated button to let you snap a screenshot in-game, or even record a video clip, which are features that should be familiar to anyone who’s used a modern gaming console. Notably here, though, is that you can press and hold that button for a moment to bookmark key moments on the fly. The Backbone button illuminates a red LED while you’re recording, so it’s easy to see at a glance when you’re live. Backbone handles recording and accessing clips much more elegantly than the Xbox One, PS4, PC, or Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmj6IX"&gt;After a video clip is saved, you can then trim and share the clip in the Backbone app, as well as via iMessage or any social media apps you use. One special thing to note is that Backbone says it can record 1080p clips at 30 frames per second in the HEVC / H.265 codec (supported on the iPhone 7 and newer), so you’ll have higher-quality video without sacrificing as much storage space as other codecs require. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Backbone button pulses red to indicate when you’re recording the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oSMZng"&gt;Yet another software feature you’ll get with the controller is the ability to create parties and voice chat with friends in the app. These parties operate independently of the game you’re each playing (you don’t even need to be playing a game), so it’s a good way to connect even if you aren’t all into &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, for example. If you’re into recording clips with your friends, the video recording feature will pick up your voice in the mix, along with everyone else’s in the party (indicated by the small orange light near the iPhone’s top bezel in iOS 14). Each participant can choose to mute their mic by double-pressing the left-most button that has three horizontal dots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kgmECWkKc--QQXEotbQMAmPsNHI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989935/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0012.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can start or join a party to voice chat through the Backbone app with other users for free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CHeiZ4"&gt;Snapshots, video recording, and organizing parties for voice chat are just a few ways in which Backbone takes the reins in iOS to create a more interesting experience than Apple itself offers to gamers. It also offers rich presence notifications, chiming in with a notification — whether you’re in the Backbone app or not — to tell you when a friend has logged on, or with an invite that you can click to join a party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxoO9S"&gt;On its face, the Backbone One is just a controller — and a very good one, at that. But with software enhancements that take advantage of iOS in some clever ways, Backbone makes the iPhone feel like a bona fide gaming platform that I want to remain a part of. When the hardware and software are all working together, with the ability to easily join up with friends and record clips, the One feels like a gaming experience that somehow beats Apple to the punch of fleshing out its own gaming ambitions. It is no longer just like a phone strapped into a few pieces of plastic but the start of something very special. And for $100, without monthly charges to use its software and party tools, it’s an appealing price if you do a lot of mobile gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Backbone One controller supports all the way back to the iPhone 6S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bFdquo"&gt;As well as it works on iOS, the Backbone One seems perhaps better suited to launch on Android, given that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; isn’t available on Apple’s App Store. Though, since the One launched, Google Stadia and Microsoft’s xCloud game streaming services have come to iOS, giving you more content to play than before. Backbone wouldn’t comment when I asked about an Android-specific version of the One. But this iOS controller is already worth the cost of admission if you’re an Apple Arcade subscriber or just enjoy a few one-off games. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wHPQc6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 10:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Backbone confirmed that &lt;/em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;em&gt; is supported by the One. Also, I’ve updated this review to note that Google Stadia and xCloud are both accessible on iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
