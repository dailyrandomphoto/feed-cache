    <title>Realme’s bulky magnetic wireless charger is almost as fast as promised</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sCHWRHeVVfHKxufRxvech5n-DSk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69751721/DSCF7747.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The MagDart charger has a hefty cooling fan.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6WaizF"&gt;Earlier this month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607214/realme-magdart-announced-magnetic-wireless-charger-devices"&gt;Realme launched MagDart&lt;/a&gt;, its MagSafe-a-like ecosystem of magnetic wireless charging products. The headline device is a 50W brick that Realme professes to be the fastest magnetic wireless charger in the world — it’s supposed to be able to charge a 4,500mAh battery from 0 to 100 percent in 54 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybi3Mj"&gt;Naturally I was interested in trying this for myself. Realme sent me a 50W MagDart charger, a 65W SuperDart wall charger to plug it into, and a Realme Flash “concept phone” with built-in MagDart compatibility. (The only other Realme phone to work with MagDart is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534618/realme-gt-hands-on-europe-launch-price-specs"&gt;new GT flagship&lt;/a&gt;, and even that requires a specialized case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IY5D6P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aWfnOh"&gt;The Flash isn’t a commercial device, but it’s a very nice phone nonetheless. That’s mostly because it’s very obviously a repurposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, made possible by the fact that the two companies share ownership and suppliers along with Oppo and Vivo. The camera configuration has been reshuffled a little — for little reason, since the onboard software doesn’t even include a camera app — but the hardware is otherwise identical. The Flash’s “About phone” screen even still lists the device name as the OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKvFybczN8yqodinvrfYCJQWedA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794463/DSCF7751.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Realme Flash is clearly a repurposed OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oOK2d9"&gt;The MagDart charger, meanwhile, is a chunky metal box with solid construction and a glossy top panel that makes contact with the phone. The magnetic force is fairly strong; you can attach the Flash and hold it facing the ground, though it’ll fall if you shake it around a little. Despite the charger’s bulky build, it’ll still stay attached if you try to pick the phone up, so you can’t really use it as a stationary wireless charger without securing it to a hard surface. There’s a cooling fan that varies in its noise output. At its loudest, I would say it’s comparable to an Intel-based MacBook Pro with a couple too many Chrome tabs open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIp7gv"&gt;When it came to testing the performance, I found that the charger wasn’t able to wake the phone at 0 percent power. For that reason, I used a USB-C cable to turn the phone on and get it to one percent, then took my measurements from there. I didn’t use the phone while charging other than to wake the screen to check the battery status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2iY7k"&gt;Basically, it turns out that this is indeed a very fast wireless charger, though not quite as fast as Realme claims. After 15 minutes the Flash was already at 35 percent, and reached 60 percent after half an hour. The 45-minute mark took it to 82 percent, but by the promised 54 minutes it was only at 95 percent. The Flash eventually hit 100 percent at a round 60 minutes. For comparison, an iPhone 12’s battery will only be around half full after that long.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oFiFE3Ax-iR29WxSuKDmFW8ytUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794466/DSCF7752.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The charger will stay attached if you pick your phone up from the desk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2TxnVL"&gt;So yeah, MagDart works. I’m not really convinced by the form factor, though — if speed was a priority, plugging in a cable wouldn’t be much less convenient than this, if at all. You can’t practically use the phone with this charger attached, either. (I’ll note here that Realme has also developed a thinner 15W MagDart charger that looks similar to Apple’s MagSafe charging puck).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZUdzu"&gt;Still, magnetic wireless charging is all about versatility, and the MagDart technology seems to work well for what it is. For readers in the US in particular, it’ll be worth keeping an eye on whether it shows up in actual shipping OnePlus devices any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how much it costs to fix a Z Fold 3 or Z Flip 3 with a broken screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OTDk2waIZmsFLjnEJEzqlkj8r94=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750869/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3KW8h2"&gt;Samsung’s new foldables are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;quite impressive&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;making them as durable as possible&lt;/a&gt; — but sometimes, accidents happen. We asked Samsung how much it would cost to replace a Z Flip or Z Fold 3’s screen should something happen to it, and here’s what the company told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eV8jmP"&gt;Samsung provides a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/warranty/?model=N0053854" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one year warranty&lt;/a&gt; with the phones, so if your screen breaks in a way that’s covered, you shouldn’t have to pay for a repair. Out of warranty, fixing the interior folding screen of a Z Fold 3 costs $479. Doing the same for a Z Flip 3 costs $369. Thankfully, the external displays are much less expensive — fixing a broken outer screen will set you back $149 for the Fold and $99 for the Flip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MngxoL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Out of warranty, the Fold’s folding screen costs $479 to replace, and the Flip’s costs $369&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wh3XmT"&gt;Samsung also offers its Samsung Care Plus subscription, which costs $12.99 a month for either phone (though Samsung is currently running a preorder deal where you don’t have to make Care Plus payments for 12 months). For Care Plus subscribers, Samsung says there’s a $249 charge for an out-of-warranty screen repair — though the company says that the “deductible covers up to three screen repairs per year.” Care Plus also extends your warranty for two more years after the original expires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2U2HC"&gt;For traditional, non-folding phones, there’s often the option to repair the screen yourself, which can end up costing less than having the manufacturer do it. However, for Samsung’s new foldables, this isn’t likely to be easy. Samsung’s aforementioned push for durability means &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;the phones are filled with a lot of sticky, hard to remove stuff&lt;/a&gt; like tape, glue, and goo. The company says the folding screens are made out of multiple layers, which are sealed with a “pressure-sensitive adhesive.” As someone who’s taken apart their share of devices, that sounds like an absolute nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qyTv7z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The repair prices for the new foldables are less than the ones for the older versions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5Dhxz"&gt;That said, this isn’t much of a change. It’s not like Samsung’s previous foldables were particularly easy to repair. And while the company’s prices are higher than those for more traditional phone repairs — a broken iPhone 12 screen &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement"&gt;costs $279 to replace&lt;/a&gt;; a Galaxy S21 5G’s costs $199 — Samsung is actually charging less than it used to. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/repair/pricing/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to Samsung’s site&lt;/a&gt;, the Z Fold 2’s inner screen costs $549 to replace out of warranty and the Z Flip 5G’s costs $499, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20881040/samsung-galaxy-fold-screen-replacemet-premier-service-cost-unboxing"&gt;depending on when you bought the phone&lt;/a&gt;, you may be eligible for a one-time replacement &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/repair/pricing/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for significantly less&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="r7SH13"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Samsung beefed up its new folding phones: metal, tape, and a dab of goo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T TV will officially become DirecTV Stream next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OinA03PZVPpaBuocoQNiLrsiIA0=/154x0:1690x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750375/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_1.40.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DirecTV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x5jZBY"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV and its defunct AT&amp;amp;T TV Now sibling will officially become DirecTV Stream, a new unified service spun out of a deal between TPG Capital and AT&amp;amp;T for the telecommunication giant’s streaming properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d221R0"&gt;DirecTV began updating AT&amp;amp;T TV and AT&amp;amp;T TV Now customers of the change on August 14th. On the welcome screens of both services’ mobile apps informing them that the change would officially take place on August 26th, a spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. DirectTV Stream rebrands AT&amp;amp;T’s services acquired in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608577/att-directv-tpg-deal-u-verse-att-tv-new-company"&gt;TPG Capital deal&lt;/a&gt;, which did not include HBO Max. (WarnerMedia, home to HBO Max, is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22448140/warner-bros-discovery-warnermedia-new-name-merger-att"&gt;merge with Discovery&lt;/a&gt; in mid-2022.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0NtNZ5iNptz861sh1Y1R-ioM2FM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793519/IMG_1845.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DirecTV&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AuFsLd"&gt;According to a company &lt;a href="https://www.directv.com/stream/"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;, “AT&amp;amp;T satellite, streaming or IP video customers will automatically keep their video service, any bundled wireless, internet or HBO Max services, and associated discounts with no action needed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPf9GG"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21160860/att-tv-now-available-android-tv-google-assistant-streaming"&gt;launched last year&lt;/a&gt; as the company’s premium TV streaming experience. AT&amp;amp;T TV Now, the company’s skinny streaming bundle, technically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226881/att-tv-now-streaming-skinny-bundle-cord-cutting-youtube-hulu-fubo"&gt;became AT&amp;amp;T TV&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, and new customers could no longer sign up for Now. (The company &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/at-t-tv-now-is-merging-with-at-t-tv-wait-what-1846043744"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that AT&amp;amp;T TV Now customers would still be able to access their accounts, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20dzAE"&gt;If all of this sounds needlessly confusing, it is. With any luck, this will be the last significant branding change that AT&amp;amp;T’s existing or future streaming customers see for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Motorola Edge gets a 108-megapixel camera but ditches the edge display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGvwBZN9FIO3y82ldrGugAWgMx4=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749378/edge.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9D1ly"&gt;Motorola has a new version of its $700 Edge smartphone, bringing better cameras, a more modern processor, and an updated design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUpRAK"&gt;As with last year’s Edge, the new model doesn’t quite offer the best hardware Android has to offer, with a Snapdragon 778 5G processor, 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, or 8GB RAM / 256GB storage, but those sacrifices might be worth it for the decidedly midrange price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNbqBS"&gt;Despite that, the new Edge does feature the 108-megapixel camera that was one of the marquee features on the Edge Plus, along with a larger 5,000mAh battery and mmWave 5G — both of which were also offered on the Edge Plus but were downgraded to a 4,500mAh battery and sub-6GHz-only specs on last year’s Edge. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPL4-EVXAsWWm3hWTNZ6aLNXNqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22791020/Motorola_edge__2021__design.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gkzgT1"&gt;The display is a 6.8-inch LCD display with a 144Hz refresh rate, but calling the new phone the Edge (with no numbering to help distinguish it from the 2020 model) is actually a bit of a misnomer, given that the 2021 model ditches the “endless edge” waterfall display that gave the original Edge and Edge Plus their names. That said, given that the curved screen was by and large a gimmick on last year’s models, it’s not much of a loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJSipX"&gt;Cameras are the aforementioned 108-megapixel main camera, along with an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide that offers Motorola’s “Macro Vision” feature, and a 2-megapixel depth camera. A 32-megapixel front-facing camera rounds out the proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlooYj"&gt;Still missing on the spec sheet is any form of wireless charging, although the new Edge does add some extremely basic IP52 water resistance (which, while better than nothing, is basically just enough to protect from the odd bit of rain). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2YQ4t2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Motorola debuts Edge 20 flagships globally with fast refresh screens and 108-megapixel cameras","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599860/motorola-edge-20-pro-lite-camera-5g-global-launch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kAPH4y"&gt;It’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the same hardware as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599860/motorola-edge-20-pro-lite-camera-5g-global-launch"&gt;trio of Edge 20 models&lt;/a&gt; that Motorola released internationally earlier this summer (which, among other differences, feature smaller 6.7-inch displays) although it most closely resembles the middle-of-the-road Edge 20 in specs. The Edge 20 does beat the North American model Edge in a few areas, however: it features an 16-megapixel ultrawide and an 8-megapixel 3x telephoto camera as its other two rear cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bytbmy"&gt;The latest version of the Edge is also definitively a successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21347201/motorola-edge-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;last year’s regular Edge model&lt;/a&gt; — not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241919/motorola-edge-plus-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;premium flagship Edge Plus hardware&lt;/a&gt; that aimed to challenge high-end phones from Samsung and OnePlus. For now, there’s no word on Motorola as to whether it’ll be trying again at competing in the crowded high-end Android market in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="veVCeb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another “limited time” discount&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GSXO30"&gt;Pricing for the 2021 Edge also matches last year: it’ll technically be sold for $699.99, but Motorola is once again offering a “limited-time” discount right from the start to drop the price down to a more wallet-friendly $499.99. The company isn’t saying how long that price will be offered at this time, although if it’s anything like last year, sales won’t be too hard to come by. It’ll be available in the US unlocked from sellers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola’s website, with carrier versions from Verizon and Spectrum mobile planned “in the coming months.” A release in Canada is also planned for the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 RT is reportedly on the way, but not for North America or Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRhACtAz2Fq9RI5-MNtmbh7OlKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749115/ajohnson_210623_4644_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus N200, a sub-$300 phone, is the kind of budget device the company is offering in the US.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOzJfA"&gt;OnePlus may be getting ready to launch another variant of its 9-series phones, the 9 RT, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-rt-october-oxygenos-12"&gt;according to an &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; source&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the report, it looks to be a slightly upgraded version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348430/oneplus-9r-specs-price-availability"&gt;the OnePlus 9R&lt;/a&gt;, which was launched earlier this year with more modest specs than the flagship 9 and 9 Pro. That model never made it to North America, and it seems this will also be the case for the 9 RT. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;the Nord 2&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577770/oneplus-base-9-pro-north-america-us-canada"&gt;the 9 Pro base model&lt;/a&gt;. But who’s keeping track?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqvGAG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;, the OnePlus 9 RT will launch in October with a Snapdragon 870 processor, 120Hz OLED, a 4,500mAh battery, and OxygenOS 12 out of the box. For its main rear-facing camera, it will reportedly use the 50-megapixel sensor behind the same (very good) ultrawide as in the 9 and 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7dodMO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OgEhY8"&gt;The OnePlus 9 RT will debut in China and India, according to &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;, and there are no plans to make it available in North American or European markets. That’s not too surprising, and it tracks with OnePlus’ recent strategy of limiting US releases to the high-end likes of the 9 and 9 Pro, along with the budget-oriented N200 and N10 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxyUYs"&gt;It’s possible that OnePlus sees an opportunity to gobble up some of the budget market share &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375938/lg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola"&gt;formerly occupied by LG&lt;/a&gt; and has focused its US strategy accordingly. In any case, it looks increasingly clear that bringing midrange devices like the Nord 2 and upper-midrangers like this rumored 9 RT to the US aren’t part of the company’s strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM and AT&amp;T are teaming up to bring 5G to Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC cars by 2024</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WkzfhWvzwOugACCEJ7PzffaU8l8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746864/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1GbrA"&gt;General Motors and AT&amp;amp;T are partnering to bring 5G connectivity to “millions” of vehicles over the next decade. The improved connectivity will mean better software performance, enhanced navigation, and faster music and video streaming capabilities, company officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Z8AfB"&gt;Starting with model year 2024, all Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, and GMC vehicles will come equipped with 5G. In addition, all of GM’s current model year 2019 and newer vehicles, which are equipped with 4G LTE, will experience “faster connectivity speeds and many of the same performance benefits of future 5G-equipped vehicles” thanks to GM’s fifth-generation cellular network architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vp45w4"&gt;In other words, cars made in 2019 and beyond will have improved data speeds and software performance, as well as reduced transmission latency, thanks to this new effort by GM and AT&amp;amp;T. But that will depend on when AT&amp;amp;T’s network is ready to take on millions of new customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OCyEdF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;5G has the potential to be 100 times faster than 4G&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pdVYLB"&gt;5G, so named because it is the fifth generation of cellular technology, has the potential to be 100 times faster than 4G LTE, according to Ericsson, but for many smartphone owners, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;it’s been a mixed bag&lt;/a&gt;. The infrastructure is taking longer to build than originally expected, and most smartphones that claim to use 5G aren’t any faster than 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmTFcw"&gt;That’s why GM and AT&amp;amp;T are waiting until 2024 before rolling out the new 5G-equipped vehicles. “It’s really not a function of what’s missing in the vehicles,” said Thomas DeMaria, executive director of 5G connectivity at GM. “It’s more around the maturity of the 5G technology, and also the readiness of 5G.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TkSswj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G: everything you need to know","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9sR1Zo"&gt;In the interim, GM’s 4G LTE-equipped vehicles starting with model year 2019 and newer will migrate to run over AT&amp;amp;T’s new 5G core infrastructure. According to the automaker, that will align with the timing of GM’s rollout of 5G, which will start with model year 2024. “As the new network infrastructure is built out over the next several years, we will test and learn to see if these improvements can be realized sooner,” a GM spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDtu3y"&gt;In addition to better data speeds, customers can also expect better security when using their cars to make phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmT8Ci"&gt;“What 5G enables versus 4G LTE, number one it’s complying with the overall 5G standards, which are much higher than 4G LTE,” Gregory Wieboldt, AT&amp;amp;T’s senior VP for global business and industry solutions, said in a call with reporters. “And it’ll offer more privacy for the identity and stronger encryption for your call and your data, because it’s run on a smarter network software platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FL4Ntb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568437/halo-driverless-car-tmobile-5g-las-vegas"&gt;Self-driving cars are often held up as the ultimate application of 5G&lt;/a&gt;. For example, the low latency of 5G can help deliver safety information to an autonomous vehicle’s AI “brain” before it is even visible to a human driver. But in the US, at least, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;our networks just haven’t met the bar yet&lt;/a&gt; to make it a reality. GM and AT&amp;amp;T downplayed the significance of their rollout of 5G for autonomous vehicles at this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJNS8v"&gt;“The network in the vehicle systems are increasingly relying on what I would call data augmentation,” DeMaria said. “So autonomous functions, ADAS [advanced driver assist systems] functions and other connected services, including navigation systems, increasingly are relying on supplemental data coming in from the network. So we’re going to continue to see that trend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbtpZJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo introduces true continuous zoom lens for smartphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/toE_dzxwC9P3Co72BH6oie-1zzs=/79x0:945x577/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746137/OPPO_Continuous_Optical_Zoom_2021.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DWxcjX"&gt;Oppo has held a “Future Imaging Technology Launch Event” online today to make some camera-related announcements, following the reveal of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608812/oppo-next-generation-under-screen-camera-tech-announced"&gt;“next-generation” under-display selfie camera&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7VVzV"&gt;Oppo is known for demonstrating camera tech in prototype form long before it hits the market. The company was the first to demonstrate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/1/14755916/oppo-5x-zoom-camera-prototype-hands-on-mwc-2017"&gt;periscope telephoto cameras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18759380/under-display-selfie-camera-first-oppo-announcement"&gt;under-display cameras&lt;/a&gt;, for example, both of which are increasingly common on high-end devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1fNJC898kmxEfv5pPpmBaudV1ks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792007/OPPO_Continuous_Optical_Zoom_2021.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EZNGtf"&gt;The first new announcement is a telephoto lens with continuous optical zoom. Unlike periscope telephoto lenses used today, the lens elements move throughout the 85-200mm-equivalent zoom range meaning that the images should be crisp at every focal length without the need for digital zoom, cropping, or artificial sharpening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9vdWh"&gt;Vivo announced a similar product for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21157292/vivo-apex-2020-concept-phone-cameras-screen-specs"&gt;Apex 2020 concept phone&lt;/a&gt;, but the range was a lot more limited — roughly 130-195mm-equivalent. This Oppo module starts at 85mm, a common focal length for portrait headshots, which should make it a lot more versatile. Oppo points out that using one camera across more focal lengths ensures more consistent performance in terms of color and white balance, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFgrzy"&gt;Unfortunately, Oppo isn’t saying when it might ship this camera on a commercial device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iz6fs-jJ9tMine1rDM_KXWE74-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792004/OPPO_s_Five_axis_OIS_lens_shift.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u7Agmo"&gt;The next announcement is a five-axis optical image stabilization system that makes use of both lens-shift and sensor-shift techniques as well as movement data from the phone’s gyroscope. Lens shifting is used for more gradual stabilization, while sensor shift is applied in more dramatic situations, and includes the ability to roll the sensor as well as along the X and Y axes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNKRKd"&gt;Oppo says this allows for three times better stabilization than you can achieve with regular OIS camera modules, which is also what Vivo says about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326786/vivo-x50-pro-plus-gimbal-camera-global-india-release-price"&gt;gimbal-style systems it’s been shipping since last year&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the zoom lens, though, Oppo is confirming a release timeframe for the OIS system — it’ll start appearing in Oppo phones in the first quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fBwdFXdBMyMtwUj9nDFKlbQmzSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792003/Illustration_of_OPPO_s_next_generation_RGBW_Sensor_pixels.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WBVnIM"&gt;Oppo’s last major announcement is a new image sensor that uses an RGBW sub-pixel layout, adding extra white subpixels for what the company claims is a 60-percent increase in light sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sV5Kcx"&gt;Oppo acknowledges that earlier attempts at RGBW sensors had their limitations, but it thinks the new effort should make a big difference due to more advanced manufacturing processes and improved demosaicing algorithms. It’ll be available pretty soon, too — the company says it’ll appear in phones shipping in Q4 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile data breach exposed the personal info of more than 47 million people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="T-Mobile network advertises seen on a Jumbotron in Times..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SeY8vHs9AcZ2ShHiYHqB1aj5rMU=/0x30:4793x3225/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741585/1229111902.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by John Lamparski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPCyBJ"&gt;T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/additional-information-regarding-2021-cyberattack-investigation"&gt;released more information&lt;/a&gt; about its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/15/22626270/t-mobile-investigating-report-customer-data-breach'"&gt;most recent data breach&lt;/a&gt;, and while the company’s findings fall short of the reported 100 million records, the numbers are staggering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unYsU5"&gt;While saying its investigation is still ongoing, the company confirmed that records of over 40 million “former or prospective customers” who had previously applied for credit and 7.8 million postpaid customers (those who currently have a contract) were stolen. In its last earnings report (&lt;a href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/400059132/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/NG_TMUS-06_30_2021-EX-99.1.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), T-Mobile said it had over 104 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoGq9b"&gt;The data in the stolen files contained critical personal information included first and last names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and driver’s license / ID numbers — the kind of information you could use to set up an account in someone else’s name or hijack an existing one. It apparently did not include “phone numbers, account numbers, PINs or passwords.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LMVzP9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile found out about the breach based on a forum post&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="96Jzp9"&gt;That isn’t the end of it, either, as over 850,000 prepaid T-Mobile customers were also victims of the breach, and for them, the exposed data includes “names, phone numbers, and account PINs.” Affected customers have already had their PINs reset and will receive a notification “right away.” There was also unspecified information accessed for inactive prepaid accounts. However, T-Mobile says, “No customer financial information, credit card information, debit or other payment information or SSN was in this inactive file.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jZ2JEM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KlIcW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customers trust us with their private information and we safeguard it with the utmost concern. A recent cybersecurity incident put some of that data in harm’s way, and we apologize for that. We take this very seriously, and we strive for transparency in the status of our investigation and what we’re doing to help protect you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="AUHUn2"&gt;The notice includes boilerplate language saying that “We take our customers’ protection very seriously,” but it rings especially hollow from T-Mobile considering that this is at least the fourth data breach exposed in the last few years, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security"&gt;one in January&lt;/a&gt;. According to the company’s statement, its investigation began based on a report of someone claiming in an online forum that they had compromised T-Mobile’s servers. A spokesperson for the FCC says in a statement that “Telecommunications companies have a duty to protect their customers’ information. The FCC is aware of reports of a data breach affecting T-Mobile customers and we are investigating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMaLXg"&gt;A Twitter account advertising stolen data for sale &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/t-mobile-investigating-claims-of-massive-data-breach/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; the attack affected all 100 million customers and included IMEI / IMSI data for 36 million customers that could uniquely identify specific devices or SIM cards, but T-Mobile’s announcement does not confirm that is the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyYN5X"&gt;T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/brand/data-breach-2021"&gt;added a page on its site&lt;/a&gt; where customers can go for information as well as shortcuts to change their PINs and passwords. It’s offering two years of free identity protection services from McAfee, recommends postpaid customers change their PIN, and mentions its Account Takeover Protection capabilities to prevent SIM-swapping attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Unite is coming to iOS and Android on September 22nd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8ZU538"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, the five-versus-five MOBA game that released in July for the Nintendo Switch, will debut on iOS and Android devices on September 22nd. The Pokémon Company shared today during a livestream that you can pre-register for the mobile game now on your respective devices (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1512321575"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonunite"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;). You’ll be notified when it’s officially available to download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJqIX3"&gt;Whether you play &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; on mobile or a Nintendo Switch, the game will offer cross-platform play to broaden who you can play alongside or against. By linking your account on both the Switch version and the mobile game, you’ll be able to have cross-progression, which will allow you to play the game with your saved data and characters on whichever device is more convenient. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="f39xKq"&gt;Samsung has confirmed that it will stop showing ads in default apps including Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Theme. It follows comments made by its mobile chief TM Roh in an internal town hall meeting &lt;a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20210817140800017"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Yonhap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Samsung has made a decision to cease the advertisement on proprietary apps including Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Theme,” the company said in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “The update will be ready by later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ObzCj"&gt;“Our priority is to deliver innovative mobile experiences for our consumers based on their needs and wants,” the company said. “We value feedback from our users and continue our commitment to provide them with the best possible experience from our Galaxy products and services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J6jD8T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Samsung has made a decision to cease the advertisement on proprietary apps”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ypoQ1j"&gt;In our review of this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, we said it was unforgivable that Samsung would choose to show the “kind of ad that’s normally at the bottom of a crappy, overloaded website” in its default weather app. Yes, it’s been possible to dodge or disable these ads and switch to non-Samsung versions of each app, but you shouldn’t be expected to have to do that after spending $1,199 on a flagship smartphone. They’re part of the reason why Samsung’s otherwise clean One UI software has started to feel messy over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2xeRB"&gt;Samsung did not share a specific date for when the ads would be removed from its software, but &lt;em&gt;Yonhap &lt;/em&gt;previously reported that the change will be made via a forthcoming One UI software update. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/17/samsung-ads-removal-report/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; has published&lt;/a&gt; a collection of screenshots if you want to see just how bad Samsung’s apps currently look.&lt;/p&gt;
