    <title>Senators call on FCC to quadruple base high-speed internet speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Janet Yellen Confirmation Hearing For Treasury Secretary Before Senate Finance Committee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxcU2F0IVLZoMntp4hEn5oqPCt0=/0x0:5374x3583/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909919/1230675894.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6A0XFv"&gt;The federal government’s definition of high-speed broadband has remained stagnant over the last six years, sitting at 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up since 2015. But faced with pandemic-fueled network loads and a new push for infrastructure spending, lawmakers are getting ready to upgrade that definition. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344741/2021_0304_Bipartisan_Broadband_Speed_Letter_FINAL__1___1_.pdf"&gt;In a letter to government leaders&lt;/a&gt; Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators called for a quadrupling of base high-speed broadband delivery speeds making 100Mbps down and 100Mbps up the new base for high-speed broadband. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUMUQu"&gt;“Going forward, we should make every effort to spend limited federal dollars on broadband networks capable of providing sufficient download and upload speeds and quality,”  Sens. Michael Bennet (D-CO), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Angus King (I-ME), and Rob Portman (R-OH) &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344741/2021_0304_Bipartisan_Broadband_Speed_Letter_FINAL__1___1_.pdf"&gt;wrote to the FCC&lt;/a&gt; and other agencies. “There is no reason federal funding to rural areas should not support the type of speeds used by households in typical well-served urban and suburban areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rR7OeW"&gt;The letter calls on the FCC and other agencies to change their definitions of “high speed broadband” to anything above 100Mbps down and 100Mbps up — a shift that would prohibit the FCC from identifying an area as being served with broadband unless it met those speed criteria. It’s a complete change of pace from the FCC under former Chairman Ajit Pai’s leadership, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;which established&lt;/a&gt; the previous 25 / 3Mbps standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv6jGE"&gt;“We find that the current speed benchmark of 25/3 Mbps remains an appropriate measure by which to assess whether a fixed service is providing advanced telecommunications capability,” the FCC’s report said earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXhF1C"&gt;The current base speeds for high-speed broadband aren’t nearly enough for a moderately sized family working from home. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;Zoom recommends&lt;/a&gt; 3.8Mbps upload speeds for just one 1080p video, and the shift to remote schooling and work has forced many families to run multiple simultaneous streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmEMFX"&gt;“Ask any senior who connects with their physician via telemedicine, any farmer hoping to unlock the benefits of precision agriculture, or any student who receives livestreamed instruction, or any family where both parents telework and multiple children are remote learning, and they will tell you that many networks fail to come close to ‘high speed’ in the year 2021,” the senators wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyqIxM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 3/4/21 at 8:15AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated quotes to reflect final text of the letter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s $260 Redmi Note 10 Pro has a 120Hz screen and a 108-megapixel camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jltKGHYnQkYNli9YcfnYVoHLGc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909890/DSCF7567.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gL9v7g"&gt;Xiaomi has announced its Redmi Note 10 line, the latest in its phone series that’s titanically popular in India and beyond. As is tradition for the Redmi Note phones, the 10 series brings some high-end features to much lower price points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ShkYe"&gt;The Redmi Note 10 Pro is the main attraction here, with several variants including the Note 10S, Note 10, and Note 10 5G adjusting various specs to meet different price points. The Note 10 Pro’s standout feature is its 6.67-inch 1080p OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVULZW"&gt;The Note 10 Pro also has a 108-megapixel primary camera alongside an 8-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel “telemacro”, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. On paper, that puts its camera setup in reach of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;Xiaomi’s new Mi 11 flagship&lt;/a&gt;, though the Note 10 Pro’s 1.55-inch 108-megapixel sensor is a little smaller. The holepunch selfie camera, meanwhile, is 16 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Is_OcSDViqMD2ts3YzIE2xsXkd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344632/DSCF7564.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DxgQOC"&gt;Other specs include a Snapdragon 732 processor, 6GB or 8GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of storage, a 5,020mAh battery, 33W fast charging, a microSD card slot plus two separate SIM card slots, stereo speakers, a fingerprint sensor in the power button, and a headphone jack. The biggest omission is wireless charging, but that’s not a surprise for a device in this price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPmWz8"&gt;Xiaomi wouldn’t provide full international pricing details ahead of the launch, but the Indian variant of the Redmi Note 10 Pro is called the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max and starts at Rs. 18,999 (~$260) for a model with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The non-Max Indian Note 10 Pro is identical but has a 64-megapixel main camera instead and starts at 15,999 (~$220) for the 6GB/64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi Mi 11 review: undercutting Samsung</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A great deal if you can get it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="xOHYgJ"&gt;Who is Samsung’s biggest mobile competitor? The first name that comes to mind is Apple, of course. But most people aren’t really in the habit of switching back and forth between iOS and Android with each phone purchase. So who is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7rtoAT"&gt;Samsung is consistently ranked as the biggest phone maker in the world. Huawei is usually number two, largely because of its sales in China where Samsung is a nonentity. And number three right now is Xiaomi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RmTVP"&gt;The reason I bring this up is because Xiaomi’s latest flagship phone, the Mi 11, is not only extremely good in its own right but a phone that arguably outflanks Samsung’s latest lineup. It costs less than the $799 Galaxy S21 in markets where it’s sold, but in many ways, it has more in common with the $1,199 S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtftQU"&gt;The Mi 11 would be a strong competitor to any S21 phone if you saw the two next to each other in a US carrier store. The only problem is you won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zA1dnA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10371499"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UB9Pg7"&gt;The Mi 11 isn’t particularly exciting to look at, but it’s well-built and solidly designed. It follows Xiaomi’s usual glass sandwich blueprint, with a frosted glass back panel and an iridescent but fairly understated gradient finish. The biggest visual flourish is the squircle-shaped camera bump, which features three distinct layers stepping up to the large primary lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWCLX6"&gt;With a 6.8-inch screen, this is not going to be a phone for people who prefer smaller devices, but it manages to feel relatively svelte all the same. The slight chin below the display is very thin, and the screen curves gently on the sides. At 8.1mm thick and weighing 196 grams, it’s noticeably thinner and a little lighter than last year’s Mi 10, with a slightly smaller (but still big) 4,600mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zSAt51"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Mi 11 more than passes the “feels like a flagship” test&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="klqqBv"&gt;That may well have something to do with its Snapdragon 888 processor, which is Qualcomm’s high-end chip for 2021; unlike last year’s 865, the 5G modem is integrated directly into the SoC, saving space and power. My Mi 11 review unit pairs the 888 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, though more expensive models have options for 12GB and 256GB, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dB5wnF"&gt;In use, the Mi 11 more than passes the “feels like a flagship” test. As expected based on the spec sheet, it’s as fast and responsive as any Android phone on the market. There’s a strong haptics system, and the Harman Kardon-branded stereo speakers sound good, though I’m not sure they have anything in common with my long-serving &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.harmankardon.com%2Fcomputer-speakers%2FSOUNDSTICKS%2BIII.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310843%2Fxiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SoundSticks&lt;/a&gt;. Xiaomi’s MIUI 12 software is based on Android 11, and it’s far more streamlined than earlier iterations; Xiaomi has come a long way with its software design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUBxP9"&gt;Battery life is strong: I got almost exactly five hours of screen time on one recent day of testing, and more than three of those hours involved using the phone to take photos and videos in bright, direct sunlight, all with the screen at its maximum 120Hz and 1440p settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DeWrvI4ucX_V5eUV_uZc2ZKJynk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341980/DSCF7528.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mi 11 has a nearly identical screen to the Samsung S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LqkdLs"&gt;That brings me to the display. If the Mi 11’s screen isn’t identical to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;much-vaunted OLED panel found in Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, it’s extremely similar. Both are 6.8-inch curved LTPO OLED panels with a 120Hz refresh rate, a 3200 x 1440 resolution, and a maximum brightness of 1,500 nits. What matters is that the Mi 11’s display is extremely good, which it is. It’s sharp and smooth, with excellent contrast and color reproduction, and the extra brightness is noticeable on sunny days. I know not everyone is a fan of curved screen edges, but these are about as subtle as it gets, and I didn’t have any issues with visual distortion or accidental touch input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzYiIO"&gt;My only complaint about the screen is a weird one: the corners are cut at a more dramatic angle than the edges of the phone itself, resulting in a bezel that intrudes more than it probably should. I’m not sure why Xiaomi designed the phone this way — the otherwise similar Mi 10 didn’t do this — but the effect is quite odd. Still, it’s not something I’ve really noticed since I first started using the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzcVNm"&gt;I’ll also add that the optical in-display fingerprint sensor in the Mi 11 is sometimes noticeably slower than what I tend to see in phones from competitors like Vivo and Oppo. It’s rarely inaccurate, but the half-second it normally takes to recognize my fingerprint can sometimes feel closer to a second, and those split-second delays do add up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nWq4WFe31gkIXYDVt8ncUjLqy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341984/DSCF7532.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mi 11’s main camera uses the same sensor as last year’s Mi 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tc8QRC"&gt;One area Xiaomi where seems to have saved money on the Mi 11 is its camera system. The primary sensor is the same 108-megapixel Samsung ISOCELL Bright HMX from the Mi 10, which Xiaomi says it co-developed with Samsung’s component division. It’s backed up by a 13-megapixel ultrawide and a 5-megapixel “telemacro,” meaning there’s no real telephoto capability unless you want to get really close to your subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNI7Ku"&gt;Despite the pedestrian hardware, I’m generally happy with how the Mi 11 cameras perform, particularly considering its price. Detail and dynamic range are strong in good light, with fairly neutral color rendition, and low-light performance also holds up well. The biggest weakness is dim lighting situations that fall between those two extremes, which can get noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ficAVj"&gt;The large, high-resolution sensor has its benefits, but there are clear drawbacks. You might value the fact that it offers shallower depth of field (without a portrait mode) than most other phones, for example, but you’ll also have to deal with occasionally busy bokeh or areas of the scene that appear unexpectedly out of focus. And while the 108-megapixel sensor can render a lot of detail, it’s absolutely not a substitute for a telephoto lens; pictures taken at even 2x digital zoom exhibit a lot of artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_L4ar3mORQuysQYWY4S8GG1vRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344505/IMG_20210211_175537.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sBdMuwrBwGQUfQVI7ynl3GArIjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344506/IMG_20210211_143734.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/20NxvunWA-68-_5gwgrJ2Ueekrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344507/IMG_20210221_124336_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8TfqCDHzhc5TUD_9rf68OAX8TsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344508/IMG_20210206_173725.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RDkFET"&gt;I wouldn’t normally even mention the macro lens, which is often a useless 2-megapixel sensor thrown at a phone just so the maker can claim a triple- or quad-camera system, but the Mi 11’s 5-megapixel 50mm-equivalent unit is a little better than most. It actually autofocuses, for one thing, which makes it much easier to capture what you’re trying to see close up. I still don’t feel the need for an extreme macro lens on my phone, but I was at least able to use it to check out the tiny &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;PlayStation icons texture on my PS5 controller&lt;/a&gt;. So there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0ZLtc"&gt;Overall, the Mi 11 camera system is more than fit for purpose, but it’s also perhaps the only thing about this phone that doesn’t go toe-to-toe with more expensive flagships. The lack of a telephoto lens hurts it, and the last-gen image sensor has its quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jAC2nqt2b4m5gwbic4vBnEiUlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341985/DSCF7534.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fit and finish of the Mi 11 are comparable to any premium phone you might find.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lB1wvq"&gt;My biggest takeaway from the Mi 11 is that Samsung is lucky Xiaomi doesn’t sell phones in the US. The Galaxy S21 starts at a full 100 euros more than the €749 Mi 11, despite having a smaller, lower-resolution screen and a plastic back. The same goes for the S21 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYqkqI"&gt;The €1,249 S21 Ultra is where the comparison gets interesting. Samsung’s highest-end phone is far more expensive, but Xiaomi matches or beats it spec-for-spec except on the battery and the camera. The S21 might be the better all-around phone for people who can afford it, but if I lived in Europe, I know which one I’d consider to be a better value for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZmGHw"&gt;That’s the rub, though. At this point, Europe is one of the few places where Xiaomi and Samsung actually compete with one another at the high end. Until that changes, flagship Android phone buyers in the US won’t have much reason to consider Xiaomi part of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KVnynN"&gt;The Mi 11 isn’t a phone so spectacular that I would urge you to jump through import hoops in order to acquire one. It’s just a very good phone that will be an extremely compelling option in any market where it’s sold. If you happen to live in one of them, it has my strong recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arizona advances bill forcing Apple and Google to allow Fortnite-style alternative payment options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TWEgfW8HMIiY9WkmROupVEYvJps=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905040/bfarsace_201106_4269_001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4YCz23"&gt;The Arizona House of Representatives just passed landmark app store legislation in a 31-29 vote on Wednesday that could have far-reaching consequences for Apple and Google and their respective mobile operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwGZtT"&gt;The legislation, a &lt;a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/proposed/H.2005COBB.pdf"&gt;sweeping amendment to Arizona’s existing HB2005&lt;/a&gt;, prevents app store operators from forcing a developer based in the state to use a preferred payment system, putting up a significant roadblock to Apple and Google’s ability to collect commissions on in-app purchases and app sales. It will now head to the state senate, where it must pass before its sent to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDD94Y"&gt;The amendment specifically prohibits stores exceeding 1 million downloads from requiring “a developer that is domiciled in this state to use a particular in-application payments system as the exclusive mode of accretive payments from a user.” It also covers users living in Arizona from having to pay for apps using exclusive payment systems, though it’s not immediately clear if that means developers outside Arizona can avoid paying commission to Apple and Google when they sell something to a state resident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPkq8S"&gt;The bill specifically exempts game consoles “and other special-purpose devices that are connected to the internet,” and it also bars companies like Apple and Google from retaliating against developers who choose to use third-party payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yZst2P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bill opens the door to alternative payment systems on iOS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bo2fXl"&gt;The amendment narrowly passed the Arizona House Appropriations Committee last week in a 7-6 vote, which sent it to the floor of the state’s House of Representatives for a full vote on Wednesday. Notable opponents of the bill have been Arizona Democrats, who’ve argued that state legislatures shouldn’t get involved in ongoing legal matters between companies, in reference to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; between Apple and Google and companies like &lt;em&gt;Forntite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games. There was also concern the bill would interfere with interstate commerce and raise unconstitutionality claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQuEBI"&gt;The bill opens the door to developers using third-party payment systems, thereby allowing them to bypass the industry standard 30 percent cut Apple and Google have collected for years. It’s not clear how the tech companies will respond, as the bill could have significant effects on their businesses in the state of Arizona while also putting pressure on them to change the rules for all developers everywhere. Both Apple and Google declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6jqkl"&gt;“Today, Arizona put a marker down and became the first state in the nation to advance a digital market that is free and fair,” said the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), the industry group composed of Epic, Tinder parent company company Match Group, and Spotify that is responsible for helping draft the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySd8Ae"&gt;“The Coalition for App Fairness is pleased to see the House passage of HB 2005, which will encourage business innovation in Arizona and protect consumer choice. While this is cause for celebration, it is only a first step toward achieving a truly level playing field for all,” the statement goes on to say. “We look forward to working with the Arizona State Senate to move a solution forward that builds on this momentum to provide consumer freedom, lower costs, and increase developers’ ability to thrive and innovate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oco2KR"&gt;The bill has attracted intense lobbying from Apple and Google. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/Policy/apple-google-lobbyists-arizona-bill"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;published earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, Apple tapped lobbyist Rod Diridon and also hired Kirk Adams, the former chief of staff to Arizona’s governor, to help make its case to the House of Representatives. Apple also joined the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and pushed the body to begin combating the bill, &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;reported. “We went through a very difficult weekend where Apple and Google hired probably almost every lobbyist in town,” Arizona State Rep. Regina Cobb, a Republican and the primary sponsor of the bill, told&lt;em&gt; Protocol&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULD3Hv"&gt;In testimony in front of the House, Apple’s chief compliance officer, Kyle Andeer, made the case that the App Store provides value to developers that warrant its commission. “The commission has been described by some special interests as a ‘payment processing fee’—as if Apple is just swiping a credit card. That’s terribly misleading. Apple provides developers an enormous amount of value — both the store to distribute their apps around the world and the studio to create them. That is what the commission reflects,” Andeer said in written testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sd59ZZ"&gt;“Yet this bill tells Apple that it cannot use its own check-out lane (and collect a commission) in the store we built,” he goes on. “This would allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free — even if they’re selling digital goods, even if they’re making millions or even billions of dollars doing it. The bill is a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcWRtn"&gt;“Apple and Google have a monopoly on how you download apps to your phone. Because of that, for any app that offers digital services like games or music, you have to pay through Apple or Google’s monopolistic payment processing system,” Cobb wrote in an &lt;a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2021/02/19/its-time-to-free-ourselves-from-big-tech-monopoly/"&gt;op-ed for the &lt;em&gt;Arizona Capitol Times&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “You have to use their system and their payment processor, and then they tax you for it. Small app developers have to absorb the cost and struggle to survive or pass the tax onto their consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4X4AfZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple and Google have a monopoly on how you download apps to your phone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kxcyR5"&gt;The sentiment is one shared by vocal critics of Apple and Google, like Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson. He has submitted testimony for two bills — this one in Arizona and another in North Dakota — in support of legislation to break up what he sees as monopolies on software distribution, and he’s waged an impassioned campaign against Apple in particular since last summer, when the iPhone maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;engaged in a dispute with Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; over its new Hey email application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XrU4T"&gt;“Apple operates a tollbooth on the only road to distribution of mobile software for the dominant iPhone platform. And this doesn’t just hurt app developers, but consumers as well. When Apple tried to shake down our company for the 30% cut of revenues, they explicitly encouraged us simply to pass on the cost to consumers. And that’s exactly what other developers have done,” Hansson wrote in testimony to the Arizona House Appropriations Committee last week. He added that the bill “would not only provide immediate relief to Arizona developers and consumers, it would instantly make the state the most desirable place on earth to start a new software company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvANiS"&gt;The bill is one of many — including ones in Georgia, Hawaii, and Minnesota, as well as one that already failed in the North Dakota state senate — making their way through local legislatures. The multistate push can be drawn back to a national lobbying effort from the CAF. The industry group consists of not only Epic, Match, and Spotify, but also dozens of other companies dissatisfied with the rules imposed by Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store. Epic is also engaged in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against both Apple and Google over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;last summer, a dispute that sits at the heart of the ongoing app store debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3CIISd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bills are part of a multistate lobbying effort from the Coalition for App Fairness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OBPaKu"&gt;The CAF, which worked alongside Match to approach Cobb for HB2005, has been hiring lobbyists around the country to approach representatives with draft bills that would make it easier for developers to bypass rules thought to be ironclad within the mobile app world. Specifically for Apple, these bills are targeting rules dictating that iOS users and the platform’s developers only buy, sell, and distribute software through the App Store. (Google allows alternative app stores on Android, though it does present security warnings and other obstacles to users who download and use them.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNk0wf"&gt;Additionally, these bills are taking aim at rules saying app makers must use the preferred payment systems of Apple and Google, as a backup defense in the event alternative app stores remain off the table. It’s those terms, written into developer agreements the companies make app makers sign to distribute software through the stores, that allow both companies to take anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of all revenue generated from digital goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ir14ht"&gt;The Arizona bill follows a similar, though broader and potentially more disruptive bill in North Dakota that last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;failed to pass the state’s senate&lt;/a&gt;. The North Dakota bill would have forced Apple and Google to allow alternative app stores onto iOS and Android, in addition to allowing developers to use alternative payment systems. The North Dakota bill, which failed in an 11-36 vote, would have also barred companies from retaliating against developers that opted to use alternative app stores or payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj1Erq"&gt;Apple similarly lobbied hard against the North Dakota bill, with Apple’s chief privacy engineer, Erik Neuenschwander, testifying that the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it.” He further argued that it would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into iPhone by design,” &lt;a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/north-dakota-senate-bill-targets-monopolistic-app-stores/article_dc491c88-97e0-54cd-beb2-5a26044cb97c.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdVDxR"&gt;Central to all of these bills and the fierce lobbying efforts surrounding them from both sides is a debate threatening one of the most lucrative pillars of Apple’s (and to a lesser extent Google’s) business: Should app store owners be able to set the rules for what kind of software is allowed onto mobile phones, and should those rules also force developers into paying commissions for accessing the platform? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBdiGX"&gt;Just a few years ago, that Apple and other companies would take 30 percent of all revenue was considered a settled matter. While some companies, like Netflix and Spotify, complained vigorously about unfair treatment, Apple’s iron grip on the App Store, and by extension the iPhone, felt inexorable. It was simply how mobile app distribution worked — unless you were a large company like Amazon, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;cut special deals with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="w8Xx9F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple already has an incredible advantage over any company that dares compete with them.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WCuqfA"&gt;But growing resentment from developers large and small, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301453/antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-reform-cicilline-buck"&gt;an upswell in regulatory fervor in Washington&lt;/a&gt;, and growing consumer hostility toward Big Tech have created an unprecedented movement hoping to rein in Silicon Valley’s most powerful corporations. Square in the sights of all these parties is the App Store — specifically the 30 percent cut, or “Apple tax” as it has come to be known, and the payment system requirements that help enforce it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUSoVB"&gt;Apple has already made some concessions in its relationship to developers in response to rising antitrust pressure. Most prominently, the company announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;new small business program late last year&lt;/a&gt; allowing developers making less than $1 million in annual revenue to lower the App Store cut they pay to Apple from 30 percent to 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLbUvg"&gt;But those concessions are far from stopping Apple’s critics, nor the lobbying efforts of its most committed opponents, from pushing for more. “Apple already has an incredible advantage over any company that dares compete with them, and soon that might well be most of the economy,” Hansson wrote in the conclusion of his HB2005 testimony. “Giving us at least a fighting chance by enforcing a choice in payment processing is the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6B1z3"&gt;Following the bill’s passing, Hansson said his company Basecamp was fully prepared to relocate to Arizona to take advantage of the perks. “This means everything,” he wrote on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wljdkv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are going to prepare app updates for both Android and iOS that give Arizonans the right to signup for service using our normal payment processing setup. Then start the conversation with lawyers on what it’ll take to relocate Basecamp to Arizona. This means everything.&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1367197326041903106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G will get monthly security updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ZV7tgWoE7QEsRsnDV09hg0DKmo=/319x0:3765x2297/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68898786/a52_5g_blass.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The upcoming Galaxy A52 5G is shaping up to be a competitive midranger indeed. | Photo by Evan Blass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lZC4ko"&gt;Samsung’s upcoming midrange device, the Galaxy A52 5G, appears to be in line to receive monthly security updates. First &lt;a href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/nieuws/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-krijgt-maandelijks-beveiligingsupdates/"&gt;spotted by Galaxy Club&lt;/a&gt;, the yet-to-be formally announced A52 5G &lt;a href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb"&gt;appears on Samsung’s security update page&lt;/a&gt; for its monthly update cycle. Along with earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;rumors of high refresh rate screens&lt;/a&gt; — and &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-camera-specs-update-schedule-leaks_id130451"&gt;a new leak that suggests&lt;/a&gt; the main camera will offer optical image stabilization — this looks like Samsung is taking the A51’s successor very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrnslb"&gt;Samsung generally reserves spots on the monthly update schedule for flagship and higher-end devices. While this isn’t the first time a midrange A-series device has been scheduled for monthly updates, last year’s Galaxy A51 and A51 5G are on the quarterly update schedule. Putting the A52 5G on the monthly schedule makes it more competitive with the likes of the Pixel 4A 5G, which receives frequent updates directly from Google. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iH7h35S0hyqg02Ev01y8ovYBIWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22340151/a52_updates.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung has listed the unreleased Galaxy A52 5G on a support page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nXJ5sP"&gt;As far as leaks and rumors go, update schedules aren’t as exciting as hardware specs like screen refresh rates and megapixel counts. But they’re just as important; regular updates ensure that bugs and issues can be fixed in a timely manner. Samsung has committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;offering a minimum of four years&lt;/a&gt; of regular security updates for many of its Galaxy devices, including the A-series. The A52 5G will probably drop down to quarterly and then occasional frequency toward the end of those four years, but this still goes a long way to making the device usable for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="r3GGJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s Galaxy A51 has two good things going for it: the screen and the price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZH1fE0"&gt;There’s still no word on an official release date for the Galaxy A52 5G and A52, but it seems likely that a launch is imminent. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is boosting AR performance on Android phones with dual cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rVDrG2Da_KkqCtDvBT67AevvE2Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68895806/vpavic_191016_3730_0029.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aq3EMv"&gt;Google is updating its augmented reality SDK so that phones with dual cameras can capture better depth information. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/01/googles-about-to-enhance-ar-performance-by-taking-advantage-of-your-phones-dual-cameras/"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent update to the Google Play Services for AR app, which is how Google distributes ARCore features, now notes “Dual camera stereo depth on supported devices” in its changelog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDIf0S"&gt;For now, it appears that the support will be limited to Google’s own Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, which were both released in 2019. The &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of compatible ARCore devices on Google’s developer site says that dual camera support will roll out in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NN0JB1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google keeps adding Pixel features it claims it didn’t need: 2020 edition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496779/google-pixel-5-ultrawide-telephoto-camera-headphone-jack-direction-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ERD4y1"&gt;Notably, this means that the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G, both of which are 2020 Pixel phones with dual cameras, won’t see the benefits for now. That may be because their secondary cameras are ultrawides rather than the Pixel 4 and 4 XL’s telephotos, which would have implications for how they could produce more detailed depth maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWhWoV"&gt;In any case, it’s another consequence of Google’s indecision on Pixel camera lenses. The company long insisted that it only needed a single camera due to computational features like &lt;a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/10/see-better-and-further-with-super-res.html"&gt;Super Res Zoom on the Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20916938/pixel-4-camera-vs-iphone-11-pro"&gt;confusingly added a telephoto lens&lt;/a&gt; on the Pixel 4 anyway, then backtracked and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496686/pixel-5-camera-comparison-sensor-specs-features"&gt;swapped it out for an ultrawide&lt;/a&gt; on the Pixel 5.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus teases ‘moonshot’ announcement for March 8th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Xno249q3aytutMWFumC0Z21Xqo=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68890549/EvZGXbPUYAEGwSM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The teaser image for the March 8th event.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4AxgVb"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau is teasing a “moonshot” announcement on March 8th, when the company expected to reveal details about its next flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 9. “Something new is on the horizon” a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fuk%2Fmoonshot&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F1%2F22306934%2Foneplus-9-launch-event-date-moonshot-pete-lau" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;teaser site reads&lt;/a&gt;, alongside a photograph that looks an awful lot like the famous “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise"&gt;Earthrise&lt;/a&gt;” photograph from the Apollo 8 mission. That photo was taken with a Hasselblad camera, the 180-year-old Swedish company rumored to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272052/oneplus-9-pro-hasselbland-quad-rear-cameras-ultrawide-telephoto-zoom-specs"&gt;partnering with OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; on its upcoming phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rdIV9"&gt;In the past, manufacturers have also used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/20/18232998/huawei-p30-pro-quad-camera-leica-specs-features"&gt;photographs of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; to advertise the capabilities of their phones’ zoom cameras for astrophotography, indicating that this could be a key feature of the OnePlus 9 lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DR7Onq"&gt;The tease comes days after tipster Ishan Agarwal &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-9-pro-9r-watch-march-launch-exclusive/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company would be announcing three new smartphones — the OnePlus 9, 9 Pro, and 9R — and a smartwatch in mid-March. According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxJmb/status/1366308703562059785"&gt;tipster Max Jambor&lt;/a&gt;, the company will announce the launch date of the OnePlus 9 series on March 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fTtPun"&gt;Other rumors about the upcoming OnePlus 9 Pro include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;wireless fast charging at 45W&lt;/a&gt;. The step-down OnePlus 9 is expected to have a flat 6.55-inch 120Hz 1080p display, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-9-specs-1195130/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while the 9 Pro will reportedly have a 6.78-inch 120Hz 1440p display. Both phones are expected to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor. A third phone, rumored to be called either the OnePlus 9R or OnePlus 9 Lite, could also be announced with an older Snapdragon 865 processor, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-lite-snapdragon-865-will-launch-alongside-oneplus-9-9-pro"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon support says you should turn off 5G to save your phone’s battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Verizon Communications logo seen displayed on a smartphone with the 5G inscription background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYLHsvbhArPFRlGPayxGnme_6xc=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68887873/1227822210.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwJAmv"&gt;Despite its relentless promotion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22194419/5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide"&gt;5G phones&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that it spent more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;$45 billion bidding&lt;/a&gt; on a new faster spectrum, Verizon support now is advising people on Twitter to turn off their phones’ 5G access to preserve battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1vDDR"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1366055566347546635?s=20"&gt;Sunday morning tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon support helpfully suggested that “one way to help conserve battery life is to turn on LTE” if users found their batteries were “draining faster than normal.” That step would, of course, turn off 5G in a phone that has it available. It’s also worth pointing out that you don’t actually “turn on LTE” when doing this step — LTE is always enabled as a fallback for the 5G network. But Verizon is obviously being cautious so as not to actually tell its customers to “turn off 5G”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fAfQh69dqwsWSeWwmy_E0WegA_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22334862/verizon_says_turn_off_5g.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GIze4C"&gt;Twitter users naturally pointed out that switching to LTE-only would mean turning off 5G (which is available in some newer phones), but the helpful support person said it was important to troubleshoot “steps to find the root cause of any issues with speed,” adding that Verizon is “quickly launching more 5G areas, and making updates constantly to improve speeds.” Verizon’s nationwide 5G network uses a technology called DSS, which in many instances is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;actually slower than the LTE network&lt;/a&gt; it’s trying to replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXMAO1"&gt;Verizon announced its big 5G plans for 2021 last month, after formally launching its next-gen network in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509364/verizon-5g-network-ultra-wideband-nationwide-apple-event"&gt;October 2020&lt;/a&gt;.  One of its top priorities is expanding coverage of its ultra-fast mmWave coverage, which is currently restricted to parts of some cities in the US. It’s also heavily dependent on how close you are to a Verizon 5G site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jauZ6Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oxXD2Q"&gt;Both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T spent big bucks in the FCC’s Auction 107, bidding on the C-band spectrum. Verizon spent $45.4 billion— twice as much as AT&amp;amp;T’s $23.4 billion. AT&amp;amp;T’s current nationwide 5G network also relies on DSS with speeds close to or lower than 4G LTE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ottI2"&gt;The new frequencies won’t become available until the end of the 2021 at the earliest, and will be available in limited locations first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMmHq3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram update adds auto-delete option to all messages, expiring invites, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4wPLt53eGo3fE1HuGhq53pQ4DZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68877478/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8fbrHy"&gt;Telegram is updating its messaging app with options for auto-deleting messages, expiring invite links, and new unlimited groups, the company &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/autodelete-inv2"&gt;shared in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Much like Signal, Telegram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;received a burst of new users&lt;/a&gt; in the confusion over WhatsApp’s privacy policy and now the company is adopting features that were already part of its competitors’ apps, features which offer more security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7yZYj"&gt;Auto-deleting messages were already possible in Telegram’s encrypted Secret Chats, but this new update for iOS and Android adds the option to make messages disappear in any kind of chat. Auto-delete can be enabled inside of chats, and set to delete either 24 hours or seven days after messages are sent. Auto-delete won’t remove every message though; if a message was sent before the feature was turned on, it’ll stick around. Telegram’s competitors have had similar features: WhatsApp introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550634/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-feature"&gt;a feature in 2020&lt;/a&gt; and Signal has had disappearing messages &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/disappearing-messages/"&gt;since at least 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mAUhhCNzCkl3DyjKNSkMkB69h4g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328934/telegram_auto_delete_1.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Messages can auto-delete after 24 hours or seven days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bYzqM1"&gt;Telegram’s also making changes to groups that might allow for the kind of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261435/elon-musk-clubhouse-podcasts-robinhood"&gt;immediate, informative audio experiences&lt;/a&gt; that have become popular on Clubhouse. New “Broadcast Groups” allow for an unlimited number of members, but limit creating posts to group admins so they can, well, broadcast. Voice chats on the other hand are open to everyone in a broadcast group, and Telegram thinks the feature should be “ideal for large communities, where people can follow along and catch exclusive interviews, news, or just casual talks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIbBnv"&gt;To help keep these groups exclusive (or grow them fast) Telegram is adding in expiring invite links that can be set to expire after a certain number of uses, a certain amount of time, or both. With the new invites, group admins should be able to better moderate who joins and keep private subject matter a little more private.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eyzJbIQJuQi50OtVWI-JZhwtGjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328939/telegram_invite_links_1.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invite links can be set to expire after a certain number of uses or a set duration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4uHoi2"&gt;Many users left WhatsApp for Telegram out of concern that Facebook would read their messages. Expanding privacy features like auto-delete seems like a good way for Telegram to address those concerns. But even with new privacy options, Telegram still doesn’t universally offer a feature many users expect — end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpLWdT"&gt;All messages on Telegram are technically encrypted, but Secret Chats are the only ones that are exclusively viewable on the devices of the people participating. It’s a difference that Telegram says &lt;a href="https://telegra.ph/Why-Isnt-Telegram-End-to-End-Encrypted-by-Default-08-14"&gt;enables features like the new broadcast groups&lt;/a&gt;, but even with auto-delete it might be a dealbreaker for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWLDw2"&gt;You can see &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/autodelete-inv2"&gt;the full list of new features&lt;/a&gt; on Telegram’s blog.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis compiles the entire FFVII timeline into one mobile game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4czh9798E_aU-w_L-bb-XPRWbg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876956/FFVIIEC05_en.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="obmwZW"&gt;Square Enix announced two mobile games set in the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII &lt;/em&gt;universe today. One is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301945/final-fantasy-7-soldier-prequel-battle-royale-android-iphone"&gt;battle royale game aiming for a 2021 release&lt;/a&gt;, and the other is &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis&lt;/em&gt;, a compilation of all the games and stories set in the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII &lt;/em&gt;universe (&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Advent Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Before Crisis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crisis Core&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dirge of Cerberus&lt;/em&gt;). The latter is slated to launch sometime in 2022 on Android and iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZEohX"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-ANNOUNCED-FOR-PLAYSTATION5-CONSOLE"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis&lt;/em&gt; is a chapter-structured single-player experience that covers the entire timeline in one of the most popular installments in Square Enix’s RPG franchise. The compilation will feature all the events from each game, in addition to new story elements focusing on the “origins of SOLDIER.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDRBeR"&gt;In an interview &lt;a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202102/26215104.html"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;Weekly Famitsu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; director Tetsuya Nomura strongly hints you’ll meet a younger Sephiroth: “it goes without saying that you will get to see the early days of a certain legendary hero when he was younger.” He also says the game will be released in monthly installments, and will have a materia combat system more like the original game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXr1Kq"&gt;Watching the announcement trailer, &lt;em&gt;Ever Crisis&lt;/em&gt; reminds me of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/18/16979602/final-fantasy-xv-pocket-edition-ios-android"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a 2018 title that served as an abridged version of the fifteenth main installment in the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXtJxJ"&gt;The description for the trailer on YouTube notes it is “another possibility for a remake,” and the visuals look greatly improved from the original version of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; on the PlayStation, as pointed out by Twitter user Nibellion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s43iHR"&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p id="7ObkCb"&gt;The announcement comes following news that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; is getting a PS5 patch on June 10th&lt;/a&gt;, which will include improvements that take advantage of the next-gen hardware as well as a new episode focusing on the character Yuffie. &lt;/p&gt;
