  &lt;p id="CYT4Y2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; is Google’s first phone with a custom-designed SoC, and the appeal of the Tensor chip isn’t in raw power, it’s what the combination of hardware and software can do. Speech and image processing that happens on device are great for Google Assistant or improving photographs, but a feature many owners will appreciate at launch is &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/phone-app-updates/"&gt;an improved Phone app that’s built to manage annoying calls to customer service lines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6gNLDId5wrMsjhGLKvfOZCCUXlk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939435/Dialer_P6_Marketing_Wait_Times.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jdw4RD"&gt;According to Google, the app can tell you the current hold time for a business’s 1-800 number before you even dial, as well as the projected wait times for later in the day or week. These projections are “inferred from call length data that is not linked to user identifier.” Google didn’t get more specific, but it sounds similar to Google Maps monitoring traffic flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuOtOq"&gt;Direct My Call is a feature built for anyone who has ever forgotten the list of choices by the time an automated message is reading off the third one. It presents the options and their associated numbers right on the screen, so that you don’t have to listen to the entire spiel again just because you were distracted for a moment. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0h0y8RKFdaqkQosjY8SA78MsAHQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939410/pixel_call.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yovcCJ"&gt;Meanwhile, the Google Duplex-powered Hold for Me feature is expanding to Pixel owners in Australia, Canada, and Japan soon. Google will also prompt users to share information about businesses that call using numbers not already in its directory, with the intent to eventually share that information to other people who receive calls from those businesses. That could add some information to businesses that simply use multiple numbers... or give you a heads-up that a bill collector is on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeLJO9"&gt;It’s not clear whether these features will always be Pixel-exclusive, or if they’ll be available on older Pixel models.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Pixel Stand supports up to 23W wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jO_jzzIrG-FNLvO9ldwBzDr5CW0=/181x0:1260x719/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016546/screenshot.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Pixel Stand wireless charger.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BzztjI"&gt;Google revealed a new second-generation Pixel Stand wireless charger on Tuesday. The new charger offers charging speeds of up to 23W with “compatible Pixel phones” and up to 15W with other Qi-certified devices. To keep the stand cool while it’s charging at those higher speeds, the new Pixel Stand has a “nearly silent built-in fan,” which could be similar to the fans inside recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22335032/oneplus-9-pro-fast-wireless-charging"&gt;chargers&lt;/a&gt;. We haven’t used the stand ourselves, though, so we’ll have to wait and see if the fan is as quiet as Google claims it will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03ia0t"&gt;Like Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17941176/google-pixel-stand-wireless-charger-announcement-price-release-date"&gt;first Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt;, the second-generation version is designed to let your phone sit in portrait mode. That could make it easier to keep up with texts and notifications as they come in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPPvhL"&gt;The new Pixel Stand will cost $79, though the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen?hl=en-US"&gt;charger’s Google Store page&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t give a specific release date. You can’t order it yet, though Google says it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szJ03U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22497573"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel 6 event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6’s Tensor processor promises to put Google’s machine learning smarts in your pocket</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRnhH4F6TRpJmtwSmpP9JVm15HM=/0x4:1304x873/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016540/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_1.08.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lkwHn1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are officially here&lt;/a&gt;, and with them, the debut of Google’s new Tensor chip. Google has finally revealed more information on what the new SoC can actually do, for the fastest Pixel phones ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tFw24"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;initial reveal&lt;/a&gt; of the Pixel 6 and the Tensor chip was largely centered on its AI-focused TPU (Tensor processing unit) and how the custom hardware would help Google differentiate itself from competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjpSJ9"&gt;That’s still the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-google-tensor/"&gt;big focus of Google’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; today: the company calls Tensor a “milestone for machine learning” that was co-designed alongside Google Research to allow it to easily translate AI and machine learning advances into actual consumer products. For example, Google says that the Tensor chip will have “the most accurate Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)” that it’s offered, for both quick Google Assistant queries and longer audio tasks like live captions or the Recorder app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ry5Dmf"&gt;Tensor also enables new Pixel 6 features like Motion Mode, more accurate face detection, and live translations that can convert text to a different language as quickly as you can type it. Google also says that the Tensor chip will handle dedicated machine learning tasks with far more power efficiency than previous Pixel phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gpvg7L"&gt;But there’s a lot more to a smartphone chip than its AI chops, and with the reveal of the Pixel 6, we finally have more details on the &lt;em&gt;rest &lt;/em&gt;of the chip, including the CPU, GPU, modem, and the major components that make Tensor tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lTFKze"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s Tensor chip is only the first step toward truly great Pixel phones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609924/pixel-6-google-tensor-soc-chip-cpu-gpu-samsung-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPA2FORP_FDIJPtCcyA4M3rZw44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939258/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_1.10.47_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Joi0va"&gt;As rumored, the Tensor chip uses a unique combination of CPU cores. There’s the custom TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) for AI, two high-power Cortex-X1 cores, two midrange (rumored to be older Cortex-A76 cores), and then four low power efficiency cores (likely Arm’s usual Cortex-55 designs). Graphics are offered by a 20-core GPU, in addition to a context hub that powers ambient experiences like the always-on display, a private computer core, and a new Titan M2 chip for security. There’s also a dedicated image processing core to help with the Pixel’s hallmark photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rIv2O"&gt;It’s not entirely clear why Google would choose to use the Cortex-A76 cores instead of the more modern Cortex-A78 (which are both more powerful and more power efficient). But it is worth noting that the &lt;a href="https://nanoreview.net/en/soc/qualcomm-snapdragon-765g"&gt;Pixel 5’s Snapdragon 765G&lt;/a&gt; also used two Cortex-A76 cores for its main CPU cores, so it’s possible Google is sticking with what it knows. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6VEpDSX5ZyjsCkTpKEst72BmF8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939331/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_1.25.43_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S6Ce3G"&gt;The new phones should still be the fastest Pixel phones yet, with Google promising 80 percent faster CPU performance compared to the Pixel 5, and 370 percent faster GPU performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2I9uV"&gt;The real question, though, is how the Pixel 6 and its Tensor chip hold up compared to other traditional Android flagships. Google’s CPU configuration is a unique one, compared to the more traditional four high-performance and four efficiency cores used by major Qualcomm and Samsung chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nHipu"&gt;In theory, Google is offering double the number of X1 performance cores — the most powerful Arm design — than the Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100, which both use a single &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;Cortex-X1, three Cortex-A78, and four Cortex-A55&lt;/a&gt; cores. But Google is also swapping out the two high-end cores with midrange ones, which may help battery life and performance... or may just result in a weaker overall device. We’ll find out soon once we’ve had the chance to put the Pixel 6 and Tensor through their paces. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 is now available for Pixel phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Pixel running Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rAlVt-rNjyvS47ulzWJjSnahSbQ=/0x0:1875x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016203/android12hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CEtPXJ"&gt;The final version of Android 12 has been available to developers and eager fans for a few weeks on AOSP, but today, it officially launched for people who want to easily pick up the update over the air. It’s available to install right now on Pixel 3 and up, including the Pixel 3A, Pixel 4, Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, the Pixel 5, and the Pixel 5A. It’ll launch on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22495075"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, as well. Android 12 will be coming later this year to Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Tecno, Vivo, and Xiaomi devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKAdZA"&gt;The most noticeable feature in Android 12 is the new Material You design, which lets you go a little deeper to tweak the look of the homescreen to your liking. It’s more expressive than previous versions of Android, with tools to let you coordinate colors that can extend across app icons, pull-down menus, widgets, and more. Speaking of widgets, many of those have been updated to match the new look, and Google shared today that by the end of October, it plans to have over a dozen new or refreshed widgets available for its first-party apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 running on Pixel 6" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJxL1Hdpwnwi6X74iXuiib8rr_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938464/pixelandroid12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at some of the new widgets made for Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uk9I0L"&gt;There are plenty of other features in Android 12, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;you can read more about them in my review of the software&lt;/a&gt;. Google also &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/android/android-12/"&gt;published a blog&lt;/a&gt; that goes deep on the features you’ll be able to experience. But if you’re mainly interested in Material You, you should know that Google says it’s a “Pixel-first” feature, though it will be coming to “more device makers and phones soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EghAY"&gt;It’s likely that Pixel phones will receive several more “Pixel-first” features in the future with Android 12. For the past couple of years, Google has released feature drops that make it a little sweeter to be a Pixel user. Some of the features only work on newer Pixel phones, though, so that’s all the more reason to consider picking up the new Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro. Google shared during its hardware event that these phones will get a minimum of five years of support, which is impressive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRFxm0"&gt;To get the update, head to your Pixel phone’s settings app, click “System,” then find “System update” and click into it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have big screens, big ambitions, and small prices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5De6cYg1oD4_rn2GWs6Lgp7kRxk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016178/bfarsace_211014_4802_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Google claims to finally be ready to take on Apple and Samsung&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TCOahY"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22729135/google-pixel-6-pro-leaked-photos-images-renders-evan-blass"&gt;many leaks&lt;/a&gt;, official teases, and months of waiting, Google has finally given its latest Pixel phones a formal launch. The new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are the latest high-end phones from the company that hasn’t traditionally been able to make much of a dent in the high-end phone market. Both are available for preorder starting today, October 19th, and will begin shipping on October 28th. Google says all the major US carriers, plus retailers such as the Google Store, Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and others, will be selling the phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIFGEC"&gt;There are a lot of things to cover with the new Pixels, but the most important place to start is this: $599 and $899. Those are the starting prices for the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, respectively. That pricing is aggressive compared to similar iPhones, Samsungs, or even OnePlus phones, especially when you consider that Google is providing 128GB of storage in both base models. (The 6 can be equipped with up to 256GB, the 6 Pro has options up to 512GB.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpTmvm"&gt;Aggressive pricing has long been a Pixel &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;, and though the new Pixel 6 and 6 Pro represent a new push from Google to make phones that are competitive with the best from Apple and Samsung, these prices are just lower than the competition. A big draw for a lot of people might be that, at the end of the day, the Pixels just cost less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUbJxf38TEYXXa1KB0-HKkD7i6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934843/cwelch_211015_4802_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the Pixel 6 Pro (left) and the Pixel 6 are large phones — Google isn’t offering small and large options this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UfOfNy"&gt;The other big thing to note with the Pixels is their new processor, a custom-designed ARM SoC (System on a Chip) that Google is calling Tensor. Google says it’s competitive with the Snapdragon 888 from Qualcomm, which is what you find in basically every other high-end Android phone available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHplBf"&gt;There’s a lot going on with this processor. The most important piece is that there’s a custom TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) for AI built right into the chip and many main processing pipelines. In addition, there are two high-power application cores, two mid-range cores, four low-power cores, a dedicated coprocessor for security, a private compute core, and an image processing core. The Pixel 6 pairs the new chip with 8GB of RAM, while the 6 Pro has 12GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vjG5Ci"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a lot going on with Google’s new Tensor processor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cXG8bQ"&gt;Visually, the new phones are a departure from prior Pixel phones. Though they share a common design language, that language doesn’t really connect back to the Pixel 5 or the Pixel 4 that came before. Instead, these are flashier, shinier phones, with polished metal frames (on the 6 Pro) and glossy glass backs (on both). Google is offering each phone in three different colors, but the 6 Pro’s are decidedly more “professional” (read: boring), while the regular Pixel 6 colors are clearly more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5bLu7"&gt;I haven’t really been able to put a finger on how I feel about the new designs, but there’s something undeniably generic about them. Take the G logo off the back, and these could be phones from Samsung, TCL, OnePlus, Oppo, or any one of a number of other Chinese OEMs. Prior Pixel phones often were criticized for having a plain look that bordered on reference designs, but they all had a Google-y aesthetic to them. I’m not sure these new models have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmRQgK"&gt;By the way, Google’s rules for reviewers and influencers dictate that today, we can write about hardware impressions and specs but not provide any details on software, performance, or image quality. It’s meant to provide a sort of hands-on experience — rest assured, we will have much more to say in the full review.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera module is the most prominent part of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwpk-zXoSnjbk7Cl9atGkDmIE68=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934831/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a new standard wide camera and new ultra wide camera in both phones; the Pixel 6 Pro adds a 4x telephoto camera to the mix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KbtPK1"&gt;The most prominent feature on the 6 and 6 Pro is the back camera housing. I call it a ledge; you might call it a shelf; Google seems to refer to it as a “bar,” but it’s an enormous protuberance that spans the entire width of the phone and houses two (Pixel 6) or three (6 Pro) cameras and related sensors in it. The bar is large, but unlike camera housings located in the upper corner, like you get on an iPhone or Samsung, it doesn’t cause the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro to rock when placed down. A case will likely help mitigate the size, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OPMn1T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A camera upgrade years in the making&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KIDafJ"&gt;That back camera housing is so prominent because, as usual with Pixel phones, the camera is one of the most important parts of these new models. Google has finally switched to a new camera sensor after using the prior one for four straight generations. Both phones have a 50-megapixel main sensor that is hard coded to output 12.5-megapixel images. It’s a much larger sensor than Google’s used before — physically larger than even the iPhone 13 Pro’s new camera sensor — comes with 1.2μm pixels, and is behind an f/1.85 aperture optically stabilized lens. Google says it captures 150 percent more light than the Pixel 5’s camera. Next to it is a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera with a 114-degree field of view, f/2.2 lens and similarly large 1.25μm pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsVTtt"&gt;If you spring for the Pixel 6 Pro, you also get a 4x telephoto camera that’s not available on the standard Pixel 6. This uses folded optics, has 48-megapixels (also binned down to 12-megapixel output), and has an f/3.5 aperture lens. 4x is slightly longer reach than you get with the iPhone 13 Pro’s 3x tele but not nearly as far as the 10x lens that Samsung has been putting on its high-end phones (not to mention the even longer lenses companies like Xiaomi and Huawei have deployed recently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNnlCY"&gt;The front cameras differ between the models, too, with the Pixel 6 getting an 8-megapixel, 84-degree field of view and the 6 Pro using an 11.1-megapixel, 94-degree camera. That translates into you’ll be able to fit more people in a selfie with the 6 Pro than you can with the 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awL99E"&gt;The new processor enables some new image editing features, like a “magic eraser” tool that gets rid of distracting elements in your images automatically and new long-exposure and motion blur capture modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TX8iLW"&gt;For video, both phones can shoot up to 4K 60fps, now complete with Google’s auto HDR image processing, or capture up to 240fps slow-mo video at 1080p. While Google has generally excelled at still image capture, it has long been behind Apple in video capture — we’ll be seeing just how far it’s come and if it’s more competitive now when we review the phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHl6jRq1h1U8Rsi2ktVZD-U71Kc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934844/cwelch_211015_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 has a 90Hz, 1080p, 6.4-inch OLED screen (left); the 6 Pro steps up to a 6.7-inch, 120Hz, 1440p OLED with LTPO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqvN2U"&gt;Turning to the front of the devices, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro both have large, OLED displays. The 6’s screen measures 6.4 inches diagonally, has 1080p wide resolution, and can refresh at 90Hz for a smoother scrolling experience. It’s a flat panel and has slightly larger bezels all around than the 6 Pro, which utilizes curved sides on its 6.7-inch, 1440p screen to minimize the bezels. The 6 Pro also uses LTPO technology to vary its refresh rate from as low a 10Hz all the way up to 120Hz, depending on what you’re doing on the phone. Both phones’ displays are covered in the latest Gorilla Glass Victus glass and support HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPEjNj"&gt;The screens are bright and look good, though if you turn them off-axis, you can see noticeable color shift, and there’s a visible shadow in the 6 Pro’s curves. Those are things we don’t see in the best screens from Apple and Samsung at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1YAfnl3T0GOFnK8ksZlW-HFD40=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936585/cwelch_211015_4802_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The curve on the Pixel 6 Pro produces a noticeable shadow on light backgrounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JDXcqe"&gt;As you can probably guess from those screen sizes, both of these phones are big. Unlike prior years where Google provided a small and a big option, there’s no real small phone in this lineup. In fact, the Pixel 6 is effectively as big as an iPhone 13 Pro Max; the 6 Pro is even larger, though its curves help mask its large footprint somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCEWce"&gt;Between the two, the 6 Pro certainly feels more “premium.” Its aluminum sides are thinner and polished to a shine; the regular 6 has thicker, matte sides. And there are more rough edges to find: there’s a different radius curve for the camera bar than the rest of the phone and inconsistencies with the clickiness of the buttons in the units we’ve been able to handle so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="jsbNa6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There aren’t any major feature omissions this time around — a rarity for Pixel phones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o6Wk2c"&gt;Rounding out the hardware features are the things you’d expect to find on a premium phone in late 2021. Both have wireless charging (and reverse wireless charging for accessories), IP68 weather resistance ratings, in-screen optical fingerprint sensors, stereo speakers, and fast charging support. But you won’t get a charger in the box — you’ll have to either buy a 30W brick separately or use something you already have to take advantage of that last feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZfnWZ"&gt;Both phones also support 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, though only the 6 Pro and a special version of the 6 for Verizon (which costs $100 more) have millimeter wave support. Batteries are large in both models, as well: 4614mAh in the 6 and 5004mAh in the 6 Pro. We won’t know for sure until we’re able to fully review them, but the concerns of Pixel phones coming with underequipped batteries seem to be fully in the past at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m07WNB"&gt;Lastly, the Pixel 6 Pro also has an ultrawideband chip, similar to recent iPhone and Galaxy models.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro color options are a bit boring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MBIkzqa8G4XMu3yO_gP0NDAn7qY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934836/bfarsace_211014_4802_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s more fun in the regular Pixel 6 color options (a basic black and grey one is also available).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0L0coA"&gt;As you’d expect from a Pixel, the new models ship with the latest version of Android — in this case, Android 12. We’ve already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;gone in depth on Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, but the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro add a few new features that leverage their custom processors, such as faster on-device translation and those new AI-powered image editing features mentioned above. Importantly, Google says the new phones will get a minimum of five years of software support, longer than any other Pixel before and longer than virtually any other Android phone you can buy now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GCCDXt"&gt;Google really wants us to know that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are a turning point for the company. In an interview ahead of the announcement, Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said “this is truly the starting line for Pixel, in that, we’ve brought together all the elements that we think we need to be a real player in this space.” We can’t tell yet whether Google will finally be a “real player” in the smartphone world with its Pixel phones, but the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro do look like its best effort yet. Stay tuned for our full review in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can preorder Google’s just-announced Pixels.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p512wU"&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are freshly announced, and they’re already up for preorder. The new Pixels promise to offer the latest from Google, including new designs, new cameras, a new and uniquely designed Google Tensor CPU, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57DFat"&gt;This year’s Pixel phones come in two flavors: the standard Pixel 6 and the larger, triple-camera equipped Pixel 6 Pro. The base Pixel 6 with 128GB of storage starts at a price of $599, while the Pixel 6 Pro runs $899 and up if you prefer to go above the base 128GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3iYB8E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US"&gt;Google has already kicked off its preorders on its own store&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers and carriers are coming online shortly. We will update this post as more options become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pixel 6 and 6 Pro launch event live blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3YgsF1z4R1qUrFipuIgnquXaxGU=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016057/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The biggest Pixel in years — literally&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="8lbYBY"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;pre-annoucements&lt;/a&gt;, ads and yet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732322/pixel-6-pro-price-leak-us-eu"&gt;more leaks&lt;/a&gt;, the time has come for Google to officially launch the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. We already know many details: the custom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt; that powers it, the colors and many of the specs, and even some of the software features have all been officially announced. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;rumors have filled in more details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7Wplu"&gt;But there will be more to hear from Google. This is easily the most important Pixel the company has launched in years, it’s a launch where the company says it is taking on flagships from Apple and Samsung at the high end. Google hasn’t really talked big game about its phones before, so even if we’ve seen a lot of rumors, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; Google goes about making this launch happen will be interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKj7Ak"&gt;We’ll likely get a deeper dive into the specs on these phones, including whether the new camera system really is good enough to justify the massive camera ledge on the backs of these phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdCxGr"&gt;We’ll be live blogging the event alongside our other extensive coverage of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, so watch along as we watch Google finally try to step up to the big leagues.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google will likely reveal more about the Pixel 6 lineup at its October 19th event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s virtual event is set for 1PM ET / 10AM PT on October 19th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="sN2xqV"&gt;Google may have already announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6 and 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but it looks like the company may still have a few more surprises in store for us — or at least a few more details. Despite announcing the new phones earlier this year, the tech giant will hold a virtual Pixel event on October 19th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GSBWt"&gt;During the “Pixel Fall Launch” event, we anticipate we’ll learn more about the new phones and their respective specs. The company may also announce a new subscription bundle called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720374/google-pixel-pass-subscription-premium-services-bundle-extended-warranty"&gt;Pixel Pass&lt;/a&gt;,” which would add an extended warranty and premium subscriptions to Google services like YouTube to the new Pixel phones. We expect Google will explore the Pixel 6’s new Tensor SoC chipset in more detail, too, much of which still remains a mystery. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;Reports indicate&lt;/a&gt; that Google’s first in-house chip consists of a combination of new cores and weaker old ones — an unusual design choice we may finally understand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ05tm"&gt;Other event highlights are less certain. Could we get a glimpse of Google’s first folding Pixel phone, the Pixel Fold? Possibly. After a mid-2020 leak &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; the company may release it in late 2021, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;more recent report&lt;/a&gt; indicates Samsung will start producing folding OLED panels this month for the new device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkTX5h"&gt;Earlier this month, Google also said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; will roll out to Pixel devices in the “next few weeks,” so there’s a possibility the company will provide details as to when we can expect the design-focused update to roll out to Pixel devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmfYEs"&gt;Regardless of what’s announced, however, we’ll be watching the virtual event live, so check this page for the latest announcements as they’re revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Google’s Pixel 6 Fall Launch event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c93P4AT40TVWAvvqseYVcnkFFDQ=/436x0:3661x2150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015018/FA8qbJ0VQAsbGif.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and Android 12 will bring a fresh look to Google’s latest hardware.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JHyOof"&gt;With the number of leaks and pre-announcements for the Google Pixel 6, it may seem like the phones should already be here by now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Thanks to Google&lt;/a&gt;, we already know the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro exist, what they will look like, and that they will use a Google-designed CPU. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;We also have an idea what the camera specs will be&lt;/a&gt;, what the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714141/google-pixel-6-pro-marketing-images-leak-evleaks-wireless-charger-face-unlock"&gt;new wireless charging stand probably looks like&lt;/a&gt;, and even what’s inside, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716681/google-pixel-6-pro-leaked-video-assemble-disassemble"&gt;courtesy of a teardown video&lt;/a&gt; that has since been removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUkzG9"&gt;The only thing left is for Google to fill out the remaining details we don’t know and launch the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro. Google has one of the worst track records for keeping things secret, so perhaps hoping for a surprise or two might be a stretch, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356760/foldable-google-pixel-q4-2021-leaked-internal-document-5-5a-4a-5g"&gt;long-rumored, folding Pixel&lt;/a&gt; could still materialize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22486864"&gt;alongside other surprises&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to know for sure is to tune in to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;company’s Pixel Fall Launch event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xk2u34"&gt;What time does the Pixel 6 event start? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hqdhnu"&gt;The Pixel 6 event will be a pre-recorded stream airing online at 1PM ET / 10AM PT today, Tuesday, October 19th. You can mark it on your Google Calendar using a &lt;a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&amp;amp;text=Pixel%20Fall%20Launch&amp;amp;dates=20211019T170000Z/20211019T180000Z&amp;amp;sprop=website:http://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/&amp;amp;details=On+October+19%2C+we%E2%80%99re+officially+introducing+you+to+Pixel+6+and+Pixel+6+Pro%E2%80%94the+completely+reimagined+Google+phones.+Powered+by+Google+Tensor%2C+Google%E2%80%99s+first+custom+mobile+chip%2C+they%E2%80%99re+fast%2C+smart+and+secure.+And+they+adapt+to+you.+%23Pixel6Launch%0A%0AWatch+this+keynote%2C+click+here+on+October+19th+at+10am+PT%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fpixelevent.withgoogle.com%0A%0AShop+the+Google+Store%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gle%2FGoogleStore"&gt;handy shortcut&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/"&gt;Pixel Event page&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re an iOS user, Google conveniently (and hilariously) includes a &lt;a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/downloads/Pixel-Fall-Launch.ics"&gt;.ics file&lt;/a&gt; on that same page for your convenience — and because it knows a lot of people use the calendar app built into their iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sjJcsH"&gt;Where can I watch the Pixel 6 event?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IINoCH"&gt;Google is hosting the event stream, for the general public and press alike, directly on the &lt;a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/"&gt;Pixel Event page&lt;/a&gt;. It will most certainly be a YouTube live video, so you can also set a reminder on the embedded video once it’s up. If available, we’ll also add the live video to the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpJsSY"&gt;You can rest assured that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be watching and reporting, and you can follow along on our live blog while you watch or if you’re unable to stream the video at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47Wvup"&gt;Other ways to keep up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="o0aRXA"&gt;Follow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge"&gt;@verge on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Edtfbj"&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/verge/"&gt;@verge on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Someone unboxed the Pixel 6 early and didn’t bother to turn it on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 color choices" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-XfVzGdHxQQaqtli3WLbugSjLuk=/0x22:3170x2135/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011701/pixel_6_phones.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Pixel 6 color choices | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auC0LN"&gt;Google’s upcoming phones have made early appearances in leaks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/14/20865699/pixel-4-xl-leaked-photos-camera-specs"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/3/17814936/google-pixel-3-xl-leak-found-in-lyft"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/3/18527905/pixel-3a-xl-best-buy-leak-6-inch-display-64gb-ram-specs-features"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/3/4691652/did-google-just-leak-the-nexus-5-kitkat-video"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/12/3493954/lg-nexus-4-full-review-leaked-ahead-of-announcement"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; again, so it’s really no surprise that someone seems to have obtained a retail-boxed Pixel 6 unit ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;the fall launch event tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iG6u53"&gt;In a video posted initially to TikTok, then deleted but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CristianDimboiu/status/1450058587091390469"&gt;still available on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for a few hours, @CristianDimboiu took a literal approach to unboxing by removing the “Sorta Seafoam” green device from its carrier without going any further. We didn’t see the screen turn on or see the screen at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dxeipT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google Pixel 6 - World First Unboxing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GooglePixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GooglePixel6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6Launch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6Launch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/0z6wttnVp7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0z6wttnVp7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris DB (@CristianDimboiu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CristianDimboiu/status/1450058587091390469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fd2ZyY"&gt;Fortunately, Google apparently ships its new phone upside down so that we could see the camera bar at the back with multiple lenses. It also appears that this phone ships with a cable and USB-C adapter but no charger, so hopefully, new owners will have one handy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1JoRQ"&gt;Now the video has been removed from Twitter as well. However, it was so short that it’s hard to say you missed anything of note unless you really wanted to hear K Camp’s TikTok hit, Lottery, playing at maximum volume. Check back here on Tuesday at 1PM ET / 10AM PT for Google’s launch event to get a much more thorough look at both Pixel 6 devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNmEWL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Google’s own preview&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the Pixel 6 Pro adds a telephoto lens to the mix, but more about the hardware performance, display characteristics, and software tweaks will have to wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cmdcuV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Pixel 6: what to expect from Google’s thoroughly pre-announced phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PFB3Oe"&gt;What we know so far about the Pixel 6 family, thanks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732322/pixel-6-pro-price-leak-us-eu"&gt;to retailer leaks over the weekend&lt;/a&gt;, is that pricing may have dropped compared to the Pixel 5. If information from Target is correct, then the 128GB Pixel 6 will go on sale for $599, while the 128GB Pixel 6 Pro costs $898.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66ECom"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 18th, 8:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted that the video has been removed from Twitter and TikTok.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
