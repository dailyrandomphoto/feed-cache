    <title>The BlackBerry keyboard lives on in this new Android phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVzzJYtocOfElCkblMsP62xwykE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304306/IMG_20210518_162259.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EuW3H4"&gt;Even though the iPhone arrived as a harbinger of doom for phones with physical keyboards well over a decade ago, the fanatical enthusiasm for BlackBerry isn’t something that just goes away completely. People loved their BlackBerry keyboards, and their relative efficiency when compared to touchscreens wasn’t really the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nApvQN"&gt;Still, the niche gets tinier by the year, and it falls on similarly tiny companies to serve it. Now we have the Titan Pocket, a new Android phone launching today &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/titan-pocket-the-smallest-qwerty-android-11-smartphone"&gt;on Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; from Unihertz, which previously released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332385/jelly-2-phone-size-screen-kickstarter-price-specs-features"&gt;miniature Jelly phones&lt;/a&gt; and, more pertinently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20826305/unihertz-titan-phone-keyboard-hands-on-kickstarter-specs-price-features"&gt;another BlackBerry-esque device called the Titan&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDQl9C"&gt;The Titan was like a rugged take on the BlackBerry Passport, which was a weird phone even for BlackBerry fans. Its sibling, the Pocket, keeps the rugged style but comes in much more manageable dimensions. The 3.1-inch LCD screen is actually a little smaller than a BlackBerry Classic’s, though it has a similar resolution at 716 x 720, which makes for a fairly sharp pixel density of 328 ppi.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XBpKRDDFEQI2oCJ2f11S3ryzRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522380/IMG_20210518_162324.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Titan Pocket is a lot more rugged than the average BlackBerry.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BgELwz"&gt;Obviously, you can’t fit all that much content on a screen like this. The Gmail app only shows three emails at once, for example. But if you’re longing for the days of firing out email blasts on your Blackberry, well, the Titan Pocket shows about as much of your message as any other smartphone would when bringing up a touchscreen keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0u9iY"&gt;I was never a BlackBerry addict myself, so those who were may feel differently, but I think the Titan Pocket’s keyboard is pretty good. I’m way faster on a touchscreen, of course, but the keys are responsive and easy to distinguish, and the backlighting looks much better than it did on the bigger Titan. The Pocket delivers on its promise of a satisfyingly tactile typing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Z7Cd2n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tUh5H6"&gt;Beyond the keyboard, the Pocket runs a basically stock version of Android 11 that hasn’t been customized much for its form factor. You can set some basic functions, but it’s not as deeply integrated as what BlackBerry users were used to. By default, pressing or holding down a letter key on the home screen just starts typing in a Google search, for example. (This would be a useful feature if not for the fact that the cursor appears in the search bar behind the first letter you typed, making it essentially useless since you’ll have to fix a typo on every single search.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCAPwV"&gt;And as with the larger Titan, you’ll find many examples of how Android apps don’t really know how to deal with square screens. Games are mostly out, and fullscreen video usually only plays on its side. (Then again, I suppose the BlackBerry Bold wasn’t exactly an incredible entertainment device itself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fY84pp"&gt;Accordingly, the Titan Pocket is not a powerful phone. It has a MediaTek P70 processor, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage; you’ll sometimes see some lag when scrolling through Twitter and so on, but generally performance seems adequate for the kind of thing you’ll be doing on a phone like this. Other features include a microSD card slot, an IR blaster, and a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJSbGO"&gt;The standout spec is the 4,000mAh battery, which is no doubt helped by the sturdy, 16.8mm-thick design and should give the phone some pretty serious endurance considering the small screen and low-power processor. This phone’s vibe is decidedly less C-suite than an actual BlackBerry, but if you need to send emails while hiking, it could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEF6k_lvl3malWN2WedCaY8DLfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522379/ptp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Titan Pocket doesn’t do a great job with moving subjects or low-light conditions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7UlRgl"&gt;As long as you don’t also need to take stunning photos on the hike, that is, because the Titan Pocket’s single 16-megapixel camera predictably isn’t very good. It should do a reasonable job in bright conditions, like just about anything else, but the square-by-default results aren’t great for low light or moving subjects. Like my dog most of the time, as you can see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DcPZb"&gt;But hey, this is a niche device at a pretty low price. Its camera might be worse than most other phones out there, but its physical keyboard is better than all other phones out there by virtue of existing at all. Its &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/titan-pocket-the-smallest-qwerty-android-11-smartphone"&gt;Kickstarter pricing&lt;/a&gt; starts at $159 and goes up to $219, making it a potentially viable option as a second device despite its obvious limitations. Unihertz has a good record shipping crowdfunded phones, and while this one doesn’t do much for me personally, I can imagine it might for others.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Display is showing off new foldable tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTk_hAE5ag1ZXNCS4g7AKUWtiz0=/0x15:820x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300675/foldable_concept.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s display division is working on a bi-folding OLED panel suitable for folding phones.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8J1SSe"&gt;This year has seen no shortage of rollable display demos from manufacturers, and now Samsung Display is the latest company to show off new concepts for folding and sliding screens. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsungs-new-foldable-and-udc-panels-reveal-an-exciting-future/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt; the concepts being showcased as part of a virtual Display Week exhibition (if you forgot to mail out your Happy Display Week cards, there’s still time since it &lt;a href="http://www.displayweek.org/"&gt;runs through Friday&lt;/a&gt;) including a “multi-foldable” mobile display and a large 17-inch folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRlPZr"&gt;The company calls its first concept S-foldable, with a bi-fold design that opens up to a maximum screen size of 7.2 inches. It’s similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; except, well, plus one fold. There’s also a sliding mobile display similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;ill-fated rollable concept&lt;/a&gt; LG showed off earlier this year before leaving the smartphone space altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BQ1emc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10505033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8S0EHO"&gt;Samsung Display is also showing two concepts for bigger panels, including a 17-inch foldable OLED that’s tablet-sized when folded and can function as a monitor when unfolded. Finally, there’s a more traditional-looking laptop display; it doesn’t fold or flex, but it does include an under-display camera — hopefully it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;better than the last one&lt;/a&gt; we used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prKcyC"&gt;Samsung Display is a division of Samsung Electronics, and it produces OLED panels for use by Samsung and other consumer tech manufacturers. So while these concepts may end up in future Samsung products, it’s certainly not guaranteed. The company as a whole hasn’t been shy about embracing foldable technology, getting into the foldable device market early. It may have more company soon; display OEM TCL has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;shown off its own concepts&lt;/a&gt; and says it will bring one to market this year. Until then, we’ll be watching and filling out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"&gt;foldable concept&lt;/a&gt; bingo cards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sharp’s new flagship phone has a giant 1-inch camera sensor and Leica branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tr6IWS0pnW4PQD5469hI0pVApoo=/0x0:2090x1393/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297483/sharp.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dP3AC6"&gt;It appears that Leica has found a new mobile camera partner, following Huawei’s sanctions-induced retreat from the international smartphone market. Sharp just announced the &lt;a href="https://jp.sharp/k-tai/aquos-r6/"&gt;Aquos R6&lt;/a&gt; in Japan, and its Leica-branded lens sits in front of what is now the largest camera sensor on any phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxTt8t"&gt;The 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor is similar in specs to what you’d find in Sony’s high-end RX100 compact cameras. It’s only the second 1-inch sensor ever to make its way into a smartphone, and the first to make its way into a phone from an traditional phone manufacturer — Panasonic released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6151671/panasonic-leica-cm1-android-cameraphone"&gt;Android-powered CM1 back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t exactly a mainstream device. The closest any current phone gets to a 1-inch sensor is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Xiaomi’s new Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, which has a 1/1.12-inch component behind the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="waAUWN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Only one rear camera, but it’s a big one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nQ5jK0"&gt;The f/1.9 “Summicron” lens is also much wider than on other phones’ primary cameras, with an equivalent focal length of 19mm — that’s in ultrawide territory. Oddly, it’s the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; outward-facing camera on the R6, so you’ll need to use digital zoom for more conventional focal lengths. The camera bump also houses an LED flash and a time-of-flight sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OGUE0"&gt;The Aquos R6’s other big feature is its display, which Sharp calls a Pro IGZO OLED. It’s a 6.6-inch 2,730 x 1,260 panel with a peak brightness of 2,000 nits and a variable refresh rate of 1 to 240Hz. Most Android phones to date haven’t been able to offer OLED displays with truly variable refresh rates that adapt to content in real time — this panel sounds like the most advanced available on any phone right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L183Uj"&gt;Elsewhere the R6’s specs are standard for a 2021 flagship: a Snapdragon 888, 12GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 5,000mAh battery. It’ll go on sale in June in Japan through carriers NTT Docomo and SoftBank. Pricing isn’t yet available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is reportedly in talks to merge its media business with Discovery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lEIbzCpdGrzvXV40hGeiICItzxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69295421/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vlDm8s"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery are in talks that would combine AT&amp;amp;T’s media business with Discovery’s reality-TV dynasty to create a massive new entertainment entity, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/at-t-is-said-in-talks-to-combine-content-assets-with-discovery-kor6r2uj?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources. &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-05-16/why-att-is-spinning-off-hbo-cnn-warner-media-discovery"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; corroborated the story&lt;/a&gt;, noting that “many Warner Media executives were stunned by the news.” Neither company confirmed the deal, but if it came to pass, the combined company would be a potentially significant competitor for streaming brands like Netflix and Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gm5ih"&gt;But as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, AT&amp;amp;T only recently added some major entertainment brands to its portfolio when it &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-m-a-at-t/att-closes-85-billion-deal-for-time-warner-idUSKBN1JA36U"&gt;acquired Time Warner for $85 billion&lt;/a&gt;, a deal that was finalized in 2018. And while AT&amp;amp;T’s streaming channel HBO Max has performed relatively well since its somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21268490/hbo-max-launch-price-warnermedia-att-dc-harry-potter-friends-disney-netflix-peacock"&gt;messy launch last May&lt;/a&gt;, it’s still not quite as robust as older streamers like Netflix. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212963/new-discovery-plus-streaming-channel-roku-hbo-peacock"&gt;Discovery launched its own streaming platform&lt;/a&gt; Discovery Plus, which launched with shows spun off from its Discovery Channel catalog, including a new &lt;em&gt;House Hunters&lt;/em&gt; series and new series from the creators of &lt;em&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUuVmy"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s WarnerMedia unit owns cable channels CNN, HBO, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and the Warner Bros. movie studio. Discovery’s offerings include cable networks HGTV, Food Network, and TLC. But as more people migrate away from traditional cable TV and to streaming options, most media companies are trying to find new ways to reach audiences.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODc2pC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s sources indicated a deal could be announced as early as this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ib44Au"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Sunday May 16th, 9:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added mention of the LA Times’ corroborating report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter politely asks you to protect its targeted ad dollars in new iOS 14.5 prompt</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ubKsTG_gcfxb7B5-IGw6T3eiUqI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69290632/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="shKhfk"&gt;As part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; forces developers to ask permission for something they used to be able to do for free: track iOS users. Today, Twitter is joining the ranks of other developers and adding a prompt that asks users to enable tracking on iOS (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/14/twitter-app-tracking-transparency-support/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJ2nR0"&gt;Twitter’s main justification for listening to its request is straightforward — having the feature enabled allows it to serve “better” ads. The company includes a link to settings so you can make those changes, but read Twitter’s explanation before you decide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZXbtIX"&gt;Keep ads relevant to you by allowing Twitter to track data from other companies on this device, like apps you use and websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gEzkzL"&gt;The company also includes a link to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/about-ios-tracking"&gt;a support post&lt;/a&gt; in the Twitter help center which explains why it has to ask for permission, includes a link to its current App Privacy Policy, and goes over what enabling or disabling tracking does in iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SHLWi8XOwvk6Hm6F5shHPFyKnow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22515698/Image_23.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Twitter ad tracking prompt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bHoO3K"&gt;It’s a surprisingly low-key attempt to get users to allow Twitter to track them, considering the company highlighted Apple’s addition of App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14.5 as a potential risk in its recent &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1'21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;earnings statement (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KRFfUZ"&gt;We continue to expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021, assuming the global pandemic continues to improve and that we see modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14.5. How much faster will depend on various factors, including our execution on our direct response roadmap and macroeconomic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2fOfnN"&gt;Facebook and Instagram took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking"&gt;a far more aggressive approach&lt;/a&gt; to convince users its use of ad tracking is on the up-and-up — even going as far as including a vague threat that enabling tracking will “help keep Facebook/Instagram free of charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syShzs"&gt;Companies like Twitter and Facebook rely on tracking users to support their separate, often very lucrative ad businesses. After all, it’s usually ad sales that pay for free social networks,  and customer data helps to target those ads. As a company that’s more interested in selling hardware and subscription services, Apple doesn’t really have to worry about things like that, but brash changes like the new tracking permissions can leave developers scrambling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8Qksg"&gt;App Tracking Transparency has proven popular, though — around &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/"&gt;96 percent of US users&lt;/a&gt; are opting out of tracking according to some recent surveys. And with Google considering developing its own methods for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266823/google-anti-tracking-feature-android-privacy-apple-ios-app-tracking-transparency"&gt;blocking tracking on Android&lt;/a&gt;, we might just have to get used to apps coming to us and begging for free data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked renders reveal an even more affordable 5G Samsung phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ZAfjACwY8f9NyWLvRz0TSI92Eg=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69288778/a22_5g_render_91mobiles.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Images show what could become Samsung’s least expensive 5G phone, nabbing the A32 5G’s title.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: 91mobiles&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0akzLd"&gt;A new batch of leaked images shows what could become Samsung’s least expensive 5G phone yet: the Galaxy A22 5G. The Galaxy A32 5G currently holds that title at an already low $279. The images come from &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-a22-5g-4g-renders-specs-exclusive/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and match up with previous leaks hinting that the phone might be on its way with a 200,000 KRW price (~$180), though it may be only destined for India and parts of Asia in the immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNeDqF"&gt;The leaked images show two variants — 5G and 4G versions — with two slightly varied sets of specs. The 5G model will allegedly have a 6.4-inch LCD and a rear triple-camera array (probably a 48-megapixel main / macro / depth sensor combo). A MediaTek Dimensity 700 chipset looks likely, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/samsung-galaxy-a22-5g-spotted-on-geekbench/"&gt;previous &lt;em&gt;Geekbench&lt;/em&gt; leak&lt;/a&gt;, plus a substantial 6GB of RAM. The 4G model includes one additional rear camera and an OLED rather than LCD. They’re both expected to offer large 5,000mAh batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qWEWzJht9WJPHWtWQrDOCXNTW3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22515022/galaxy_a22_5g_image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 91mobiles&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaks suggest that the A22 5G will offer a 6.4-inch LCD, rear triple-camera array, and 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ95qB"&gt;There are a few other budget phones between the $200 and $300 mark offering 5G, including the Realme 8 5G for €199 (~$240) and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; for $300, but the A22 5G stands to become one of the first in the sub-$200 range, depending on how things shake out. In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;5G is still in a sorry state&lt;/a&gt;, but wireless carriers are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425022/verizon-t-mobile-att-phone-promotion-magenta-max-5g-c-band"&gt;racing to improve their networks&lt;/a&gt; and may be eager to stock their shelves with more aggressively priced 5G devices like the A22 5G soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1uOtk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maker of expensive Japanese toaster gets into smartphone business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Balmuda, the $230 Toaster From Japan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NeCaoMZFTxhN_weahLHvEaIx1uQ=/0x46:4000x2713/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69285400/544949442.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZjDnaN"&gt;Balmuda, a Japanese design company known for its stylish appliances, has &lt;a href="https://www.balmuda.com/jp/news/997"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to make a smartphone. There aren’t many details on the device itself yet, but it’ll be a 5G handset that’s expected to be released in November. SoftBank will sell it as a carrier model, while Balmuda will also offer an unlocked version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFJ85s"&gt;In its announcement, Balmuda notes that since the smartphone business is getting increasingly commoditized, the company wants to provide an experience that only it can. However, the actual manufacturing is out of Balmuda’s wheelhouse, so it’s partnering with Kyocera on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AVbR7V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Balmuda’s toaster sells for about $235 in Japan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X1ePyZ"&gt;Balmuda has a fairly limited product line for the home including air purifiers, humidifiers, lights, speakers, rice cookers, and so on. Its best known product is a toaster called “Balmuda The Toaster,” which sells for 25,850 yen (about $235, though it’s &lt;a href="https://store.moma.org/for-the-home/kitchen-dining/cookware-kitchen-tools/balmuda-the-toaster/13327.html"&gt;available in the US for $329 through the MoMa Design Store&lt;/a&gt;) and uses steam to ensure your &lt;em&gt;shokupan&lt;/em&gt;, among other things, is perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-03/meet-balmuda-the-230-toaster-from-japan"&gt;Bloomberg reported five years ago&lt;/a&gt; that it had become a cult hit in Japan with a three-month waiting time to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUPHwg"&gt;I have the toaster, and while I’m not sure I would necessarily recommend anyone spend $235 or $329 on a toaster, it is a pretty great toaster. The neat design touches everywhere, from the tiny little mug you use to pour in water for the steam to the cute noises it makes when you turn the timer dial, do make me somewhat curious as to what Balmuda could bring to a phone. We’ll let you know when we find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get an unlocked Google Pixel 3 for $160 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFj59s7JBVL0bYJjCB6kT3SYJbI=/0x0:1720x1147/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283574/Google_Pixel_3_Front_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fv8hjQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;Google Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; was one of the best Android phones of 2018, and though it might not be the showstopper it once was, it’s a standout if you can find it for the right price. Thankfully, if you’re looking to upgrade or take the plunge into the Android ecosystem, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=UnlockedGooglePixel3Woot051321&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgoogle-pixel-3-64gb-unlocked%3Fref%3Dw_ngh_dd_el" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is currently offering&lt;/a&gt; a 64GB, unlocked version of the Pixel 3 for $160 — a discount of $240.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvEh6q"&gt;Despite its age, the Pixel 3 remains more than capable with its Snapdragon 845 processor. The phone lacks a headphone jack and its bezels aren’t exactly small, but it packs a 5.5-inch OLED display and a terrific 12-megapixel rear camera, one capable of capturing vibrant shots and decent low-light photos. The Pixel 3’s dual front-facing cameras even churn out wide-angle selfies, while its support for wireless charging makes it one of the cheapest phones outside of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22425011/zte-blade-11-prime-review-price-specs-screen"&gt;ZTE Blade 11 Prime&lt;/a&gt; to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N2Vpz4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498496"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cu6NGw"&gt;Right now, Woot is selling the pink Verizon model, however, it’s compatible with most other US carriers, including AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;despite Google discontinuing the Pixel 3 in March&lt;/a&gt;, the phone will continue to receive software updates — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; — through October 2021. If you’re looking for a budget phone and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt; is still outside your price range, it’s hard to go wrong with the Google Pixel 3.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nokia’s nostalgia-invoking 2720 Flip is coming to the US on Verizon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qkXUUsZjtBn0NvNApvxQgmXBE0Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69282174/jporter_191001_3703_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2720 Flip is a feature phone with a classic design and access to modern apps.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RKpZG0"&gt;Have you been dreaming of consciously uncoupling from your smartphone? Ready to embrace a digital detox lifestyle but want to stay connected to your friends? Are you nostalgic for the days of tapping out messages in T9? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdxuST"&gt;Dream no more — HMD’s Nokia-branded 2720 Flip is arriving in the US soon. It’s an updated take on the classic flip phone, offering 4G connectivity and compatibility with modern apps like WhatsApp, Google Maps, and Facebook. Two years after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/5/20850793/nokia-2720-flip-phone-hmd-800-rugged-110-feature-phones-ifa-2019"&gt;launch in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, it’s coming to the US on Verizon on May 20th for $80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Pgrvw7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nokia 2720 Flip review: proof you can’t opt out of the smartphone generation","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20896976/nokia-2720-flip-phone-review-specs-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QUVsIM"&gt;While in concept the 2720 Flip sounds appealing if you’d like to spend less time staring at your smartphone, in practice we found it to be more frustration than it’s worth. Keeping up with WhatsApp conversations via T9 is difficult, and lack of compatibility with password managers and banking apps make it challenging to live with the Flip as your primary phone in 2021. Still, HMD and Verizon have reason to think that there are US customers for this phone, so nostalgia lives on for now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is the latest major company to skip MWC’s in-person show this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4IywQI3xUz-250OpuDNYG9PZtnA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280917/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zwVjAq"&gt;Qualcomm has announced that it will skip Mobile World Congress’ in-person show in Barcelona this year, making it the latest major company to announce that it will miss the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;potential COVID-19 superspreader event&lt;/a&gt; in June in favor of an online presence at the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ac822a"&gt;“While we appreciate the health and safety measures being put into place by the GSMA for MWC Barcelona, we have decided that it is in the best interest of our employees and customers for Qualcomm’s participation to be virtual this year,” the company said in a statement &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/qualcomm-wont-be-exhibiting-in-person-at-mwc/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAVkG2fo1pR2bTqIZSfKZd5kxZ9e2u3fNw5XNOikLFfzwDpFDDSR5ulJ9J4Dw_6DQwlpcS1II1EBJ-bdsmKcC-S6dgBjCDb6g3nQtVFinKW_ZUziSHkrdXCMbDpqsVpvX0D9bgpJkZHBWFqEvLCwXS_0NaOjmzdQxv_Tnxpe0wIP"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6K9zHH"&gt;Qualcomm is by no means the only major company opting for a digital appearance at MWC this year: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360692/google-mwc-mobile-world-congress-phone-2021-nokia-ericsson"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, Nokia, Ericsson, Sony, and Oracle have all pulled out of this year’s show entirely, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;Samsung and Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; have announced that they will also attend digitally instead of their traditional in-person appearances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ECaHxk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"MWC insists on holding potential COVID-19 superspreader event in Barcelona","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aChfGB"&gt;MWC 2020 was one of the first major conferences to shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123846/mobile-world-congress-gsma-coronavirus-lg"&gt;despite the GSMA’s attempts&lt;/a&gt; to try to put on the show, even with rapidly increasing case numbers around the world and new travel restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2JevQ"&gt;The GSMA is still insisting on holding this year’s event with only minimal COVID-19 mitigation policies, including asking attendees to have had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of their arrival and plans for “controlling crowd density” — neither of which is expected to be enough to prevent the spread of the coronavirus at an event this large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlRm5e"&gt;In 2020, MWC was only canceled after numerous major companies (like LG, ZTE, Sony, and Amazon) pulled out of the event. And while the GSMA has given no indication that it’ll be looking to adjust its plans for this year’s show yet, it’s possible the increasing number of  exhibitors that won’t be attending could change that. &lt;/p&gt;
