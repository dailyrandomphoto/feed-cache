    <title>TCL won’t release a foldable smartphone this year</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dyG2CT"&gt;Electronics company TCL is pausing its plans release a lower-cost foldable phone this year, the company confirmed in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; Its clamshell-style foldable phone, codenamed Project Chicago, was in mid-development when the company made the decision to put it on indefinite hold. According to TCL the delay is due in part to rising production costs and supply chain shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZkmUG"&gt;“Although the foldable market is growing each year, it is still a premium product category,” Stefan Streit, chief marketing officer of TCL said in a statement t&lt;em&gt;o The Verge. &lt;/em&gt; “In combination with recent component shortages, the COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs in foldable production, TCL has made the difficult decision to suspend the launch of its first commercially available foldable smartphone until the company can produce and bring it to market at a price point that’s accessible to as many consumers as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdOmRe"&gt;Streit added that the company is “closely monitoring the market to determine the best time to launch a foldable smartphone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HzjOj"&gt;The company gave out a few sample devices to reviewers (looks like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmJJvzrGODk&amp;amp;ab_channel=MrMobile%5BMichaelFisher%5D"&gt;MrMobile got their hands on one&lt;/a&gt;) , but said it did not have any additional devices available, or any photos of Chicago to share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLt1bP"&gt;The news comes a few weeks after the launch of Samsung’s latest foldable devices: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; (TCL decided to pause its Chicago device before Samsung’s launch) But both of the foldable Samsung phones are on the higher end of the price range; the Flip 3 goes for $999, and the Fold 3 is priced at $1,799.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jo7aU9"&gt;TCL &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/5/21165069/tcl-foldable-trifold-phone-hands-on-rollable-concept-prototype-display-tablet"&gt;showed off a few foldable&lt;/a&gt; prototypes last year, and again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;earlier this year at CES 2021&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a “rollable” screen design. In April &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383668/tcl-fold-n-roll-concept-rollable-phone-tablet"&gt;TCL showed off a Fold ‘n Roll&lt;/a&gt; device that could expand from a 6.87-inch phone screen to become an 8.85-inch phablet, or a 10-inch tablet size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCYO0w"&gt;The company says it’s not giving up on the foldable product category but doesn’t have a time frame for when its first foldable device may be commercially available. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to sell or trade in your old Android phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Pixel next to Google Pixel 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CogPkUXbGT37svqJiHkPL4h09Iw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844389/pixel_pixel2_vladsavov.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YTcT3i"&gt;There are a plethora of new and exciting smartphones that have just come onto the market (or are about to), and it wouldn’t be at all surprising to find out that you are planning to upgrade from your current phone. Samsung has introduced two new folding phones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;, along with its flagship &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Google has released its latest mid-priced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; and has announced its upcoming &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/magazine/google_pixel_6?hl=en-US"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPirAZ"&gt;Whether you want to buy one of Samsung’s new folding phones or one of the upcoming Google 6 phones without paying full price, trading in your old phone — or selling it — is a smart way to do that. On the other hand, there are those who will decide instead to buy a lightly used phone from an older generation that will suit their needs without breaking the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzeqwI"&gt;If you’ve got an older model and are ready for an upgrade, here are a few steps to take in order to get your device ready to sell, followed by how much cash you can expect to earn back. We’re going to concentrate on Samsung and Google Pixel phones here, but you can probably expect similar results with phones from other vendors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oxubhS"&gt;Inspect your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CXxopT"&gt;If your old device is in good condition, you shouldn’t have much of a problem finding a new owner. As mentioned in our guide on selling your iPhone, having a phone in good condition is crucial to finding a buyer who’s willing to pay top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pUgLB"&gt;Even if your phone isn’t in the best shape, you should still be able to get &lt;em&gt;something &lt;/em&gt;for your trade. Take into consideration its blemishes, including scratches, dents, cracks, and any other quirks that the next owner should know about. Be honest or else it will probably come back to bite you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OGt0Dv"&gt;Erase your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ffByZn"&gt;There are three steps involved in securely wiping your Android phone. These steps can vary slightly depending on whether you have a Samsung, a Pixel, or a phone from another manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ws0xuU"&gt;First, instructions for a Samsung running Android 11:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="XYw9xt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Disable Factory Reset Protection.&lt;/strong&gt; This feature prevents your phone from being wiped if it’s stolen. To disable it, all you have to do is turn off your Screen Lock. (You’ve had your Screen Lock set, right?) Navigate to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Lock Screen	” &amp;gt; “Screen lock type” and select “None.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TaEHML"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Remove your account. &lt;/strong&gt;Navigate to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Accounts and backup” &amp;gt; “Managed accounts” and tap on the account (or accounts, if you have more than one) that’s listed there. Then tap on “Remove account.” (Incidentally, if you haven’t backed up your phone recently, you can go to “Accounts and backup” &amp;gt; “Backup” to get that done.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dD1Ir5"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Factory reset the phone. &lt;/strong&gt;The next step is to factory reset the phone to completely wipe it of all your data. Back at the main settings menu, select “General management” &amp;gt; “Reset” to  take you to the final step. Select “Factory data reset.” You will get a warning page listing the data that will be erased; any accounts you’re still signed into (and you should go back and remove them); and which apps will be removed. Ready? Tap on “Reset” (you’ll be prompted to put in your Samsung account password).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="cnZ8rV"&gt;The instructions here are for a Pixel running Android 12 beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="CvdFUj"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Disable Factory Reset Protection.&lt;/strong&gt; This feature prevents your phone from being wiped if it’s stolen. To disable it, all you have to do is turn off your Screen Lock. (You’ve had your Screen Lock set, right?) Navigate to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Security” &amp;gt; “Screen lock” and select “None.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uOXeGA"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Remove your account. &lt;/strong&gt;Using Android 12, erasing your phone starts with navigating to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Passwords &amp;amp; accounts” and tapping on the account (or accounts, if you have more than one) that’s listed there. Then tap on “Remove account.” You’ll get a warning pop-up. Tap on “Remove account” again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9aIV6A"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Factory reset the phone. &lt;/strong&gt;The next step is to factory reset the phone to completely wipe it of all your data. Back at the main settings menu, select “System.” If you haven’t backed up your phone to Google Drive recently, you can go to “Backup” and select “Back up now.” Otherwise, going into “Reset options” will take you to the final step. Select “Erase all data (factory reset).” You will get a warning page listing the data that will be erased, and if you’ve neglected to sign out of any accounts, it will be listed there (and you should go back and remove it). Otherwise, tap on “Erase all data.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="odtDGL"&gt;Trade your phone in?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AVX9Bj"&gt;When you trade in your phone to a manufacturer or carrier, you may be trading price for convenience. It’s up to you which you choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qWtJb"&gt;At the time of publish, Samsung says it is offering up to a $750 trade-in credit on a Galaxy Z Fold3 5G or Z Flip3 5G. Interestingly, Samsung’s offers tend to be relatively generous. For example, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17093588/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-phone-review"&gt;three-year-old Galaxy S9&lt;/a&gt; will give you a credit of $150, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/17/17703434/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review-battery-specs-price-pen-stylus"&gt;Galaxy Note 9&lt;/a&gt; goes up to $400 as does a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-android-phone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy S10 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, while if you’re trading in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155012/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review-5g-screen-camera-space-zoom-price"&gt;Galaxy S20 5G Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, you can score $750 in trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sfjc84"&gt;During its preorder period, Google says it offers up to $600 for a trade-in. I pretended to have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;Pixel 4 XL&lt;/a&gt; with 128GB storage that was in working condition and free of cracks, and I was offered $170, while a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Pixel 4a 5G&lt;/a&gt; with 128GB brought a quote of $190. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; with 128GB storage got me an offer of $58, and finally, an original unlocked Pixel with 32GB or 128GB was worth a big $25.01.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRrsai"&gt;You may be able to get a good deal with a carrier as long as you read the small print. For example, Verizon is offering a discount of up to $800 on specific new phones (such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 5G&lt;/a&gt;) if you trade in one of a long list of phones (and commit yourself to its Unlimited plan). &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original Google Pixel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MW7paS"&gt;Sell your phone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZSXwS"&gt;As for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73hQPc_RInM"&gt;where you can sell&lt;/a&gt; your old phone, &lt;a href="http://swappa.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swappa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a top pick with a healthy community of buyers and sellers. With Swappa, you create a listing along with a price; when your device is sold, you receive payment from Swappa and then ship the phone directly to the buyer. Swappa charges a fee from the buyer, depending on the price of the phone, but you are responsible for shipping costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdPOfD"&gt;Since what you can get from a site like Swappa can vary, I looked at the lowest price suggested (for which you would more likely find a buyer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0AVz9"&gt;First, Samsung. A Galaxy S9 in fair condition with 64GB brought a low price of $129; a Galaxy Note 9 rated a low price of $219; a Galaxy S10 Plus bottomed out at $249, while a Galaxy S20 5G Ultra started at $539. Even considering that these are the cheapest prices that these phone will go for, there is considerable difference between these and the trade-in prices for Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTZ4VX"&gt;Meanwhile, original Pixel with 32GB of storage brought a low price of $62, while a Pixel XL got low price of $60. An unlocked Pixel 2 with 64GB rated a low price of $90; the 2 XL version was quoted with a low price of $99. An unlocked Pixel 3 with 64GB in good condition had a low price of $115; the 3 XL version in fair condition brought a low selling price of $95. Finally, you could score a Pixel 4 XL in good condition with 64GB for $250.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EE4Ox7"&gt;There are, of course, other sites where you can sell your phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofjsLE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decluttr.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22666545%2Fandroid-pixel-samsung-galaxy-sell-trade-how-to-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decluttr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; buys the phone from you and then resells it. The company gives you a price online; you then ship your phone to Decluttr within 28 days. The phone will be inspected; if there are issues, you will be offered a revised price which you will have 14 days to accept or decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xczo9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gazelle.com%2Ftrade-in&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22666545%2Fandroid-pixel-samsung-galaxy-sell-trade-how-to-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gazelle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; works in much the same way: the company gives you a price online and you then ship your phone to Gazelle within 30 days. The phone will be inspected; if there are issues, you will be offered a revised price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6JQzg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fservices%2Fbest-buy-trade-in%2Fpcmcat133600050011.c&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Buy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lets you either mail in your phone or bring it to your nearest Best Buy retail store; either way, you can trade it in for an e-gift card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5F5SmE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://flipsy.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flipsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deals with a variety of retail sites; it will let you know what vendors offer how much, and then you get 14 days to ship the device. The vendor pays for shipping. If the vendor doesn’t agree with your assessment, they will send a revised offer; since each vendor has its own return policies, it’s a good idea to check before you ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3Gx6n"&gt;And of course, there’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Findex.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22666545%2Fandroid-pixel-samsung-galaxy-sell-trade-how-to-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eBay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Selling here can be a bit complicated, but basically you get up to 250 listings for free each month; once you sell your item, there is a 10.2 percent fee plus a $0.30 transaction fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktxNwU"&gt;Other places where you can sell your phone free of charge (except, of course, for shipping fees) include &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/selling/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook Marketplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://craigslist.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craigslist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tb6JxY"&gt;Whether you use one of the resources listed here to make up the cost of a new Google Pixel 6 or decide that the convenience of trading in the phone is worth the extra bucks is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is testing new ‘Favorites’ to bring order to your chaotic feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZKNcTBubP5QtM-Fi0UGPO_qALP4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842022/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yFl5h3"&gt;You’re on Instagram looking for your best friend’s daily dog update, but you have to scroll endlessly through a sea of posts you care little about, and probably forget what you’re looking for in the first place. After a few extra annoyed scrolls, you close the app in frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOJ2Yd"&gt;It seems Instagram is well aware of your plight, because it is quietly testing out a solution for your messy feed called “Favorites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph25cH"&gt;According to Alessandro Paluzzi, a mobile developer who first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;posted about the new feature on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Favorites lets you categorize your most important Instagram accounts (friends and creators) as your priorities, so that their posts will land “higher” in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dhrAp6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Instagram&lt;/a&gt; is working on "Favorites"  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ℹ️ Posts from your favorites are shown higher in feed. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NfBd8v4IHR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NfBd8v4IHR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZMmGi"&gt;If this feature sounds familiar, it’s because Instagram was testing a different &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15856858/instagram-favorites-private-sharing-friends-list"&gt;Favorites feature back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which you let you limit the exact audience for each post. For example, you could share your wedding photo with just your designated favorites, rather than with your entire following. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="74JCiE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new feature gives you more control over who you see first in your feed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc6osZ"&gt;The 2021 iteration of Favorites, however, is about giving you more control over your feed — by telling Instagram which accounts are most important to you. After all, you may follow a bunch of different brands and creators on your account, but you don’t necessarily prioritize their content on the same level as your closest friends and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkjEUC"&gt;Currently, Instagram ranks the order of your feed by the most recent and shared posts from the people you follow, plus other “signals” like how likely you’ll engage with a post, according to the company’s June 2021 &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about its algorithm. While you may “like” many posts you see, those may not be the content you’re actually looking for, but might be sending Instagram all the wrong signals on what you actually want to see in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="treq2k"&gt;It’s not clear whether this Favorites feature will become an official feature at all or if it will change before it’s rolled out more broadly. In the meantime, you just might see this feature in your account menu, just below &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18117718/instagram-close-friends-stories-favorites"&gt;“Close Friends”&lt;/a&gt; — a feature that lets you control who you share your Stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VeQr8E"&gt;We’ve reached out to Instagram for more information on this new feature and will update this article should the company respond.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Jio’s smartphone collaboration has been delayed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3U7MdyLIpYSaVzSMTTKwHi5EUq0=/1x0:835x556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838947/jiophone_next_google.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bklin2"&gt;The JioPhone Next, a smartphone being jointly developed by Google and Indian tech giant Jio Platforms, has missed its planned September 10th launch date, the &lt;a href="https://www.ril.com/getattachment/9071467e-5a43-415e-bfed-b831d0360df8/JioPhone-Next-in-Advanced-Trials,-with-Festive-Sea.aspx"&gt;companies have announced&lt;/a&gt;. The delay is needed to give both companies more time to refine the device, and to navigate problems created by the global semiconductor shortage. The JioPhone Next is now scheduled for wide release around Diwali, which will take place in early November. The phone is currently in testing with a small number of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fidBXi"&gt;The phone is designed to be an affordable 4G smartphone to help the roughly 300 million Indian users currently on 2G networks upgrade to 4G. When it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548453/jiophone-next-google-android-smartphone-affordable"&gt;announced the phone in June&lt;/a&gt;, Jio’s parent company Reliance said it would include voice assistant, augmented reality, and translation features. All this is build into an “optimized operating system based on Android,” which appears to bear some relation to Android Go, if &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/jiophone-next/#:~:text=the%20google%20camera%20go%20app%20icon%20spotted%20in%20one%20of%20the%20promotional%20images%20leads%20us%20to%20believe%20that%20it%20might%20feature%20android%20go"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; is to be believed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFYo2f"&gt;Work on the phone was first announced in 2020, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325343/google-reliance-jio-investment-india-4-5-billion-dollars-7-percent-facebook"&gt;Google announced a $4.5 million investment&lt;/a&gt; in Jio. As part of the collaboration, Reliance announced earlier this year that it’s shifting its retail business onto Google’s cloud infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi promises its 120W fast charger won’t kill its new phone’s battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shoppers are seen leaving the Chinese multinational..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qU_JsUcuMu9inFyT4qdB0knyVvo=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838893/1235139501.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pf8peD"&gt;If you’ve been following the Chinese phone scene for the past few years, you’ll have noticed the inescapable fast-charging arms race. It feels like every few months there’s a new champion, with high-wattage chargers constantly pushing down the time it takes to fill a phone battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1130hI"&gt;This month, Xiaomi is making its biggest effort yet to bring its “HyperCharge” technology to a mainstream, global audience. The upcoming Xiaomi 11T Pro has a 120W charger, a huge power increase on the current global flagship Mi 11, which uses a 55W charger that can get you to 100 percent in 45 minutes. Xiaomi hasn’t revealed estimating charging times for the 11T Pro yet, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s China-only Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; also had a 120W charger that took just 23 minutes to fill up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnqpRS"&gt;A common reaction I see to this kind of fast charger is that they’ll surely have a negative impact on battery longevity, or that there must be safety issues, or both. So I talked to Daniel Desjarlais, international head of communications and global spokesperson at Xiaomi, about the company’s fast-charging technology efforts and what people outside China should expect from the 11T Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mc9AEM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is something that we’ve really, really heavily tested.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C1o9h5"&gt;First off, how does it work? “It’s like having two different inlets to fill the gas in your car and two separate tanks,” Desjarlais says of Xiaomi’s dual-cell battery design, which is similar to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/11/8/20954678/oppo-reno-ace-super-vooc-fast-charging-review"&gt;other high-powered fast-charging solutions&lt;/a&gt; work. “Now, rather than filling at a certain slow rate on one side, you can fill up two at the same time. This is all done on the side of the phone, the charger outputs 120 watts and rather than trying to push the maximum of five volts, a single channel splits it into two, three, four channels. This allows us to increase everything — everything is done at 20 amperes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ybnUo"&gt;Desjarlais went on in detail to explain what happens with the technology in the battery itself, and how Xiaomi’s thermal monitoring systems work to maintain the optimum charging speed at each point in the cycle, but as a non-engineer I’m frankly not qualified to comment on the electrical design here. What I am qualified to comment on is phone design and consumer expectations, and I know a lot of people do worry about the tradeoffs with these fast-charging systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAuClI"&gt;On the question of longevity, Desjarlais says you can expect endurance in line with other more conventional phones. “This is something that we’ve really, really heavily tested,” he says. “Generally, for this level of charging with the batteries that we’ve tested it with, after 800 charging cycles you’ll still have 80 percent battery health. Now, that 20 percent might sound like ‘oh wow, I’m losing 20 percent,’ but that’s quite standard across basically all charging tech. 800 cycles, for most people, it’s going to be two years roughly. So that’s quite solid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lb8nZD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We don't just want to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChargeBetter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ChargeBetter&lt;/a&gt;, but we also want to make sure it's safe for our users. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XiaomiHyperCharge?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XiaomiHyperCharge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/9AyMy3Jjzg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9AyMy3Jjzg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1433716399738925061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UIOxPN"&gt;For comparison, Apple — a company that has faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573710/apple-battery-gate-throttle-iphones-settlement-amount"&gt;heavy scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; over its long-term battery performance while offering slower charging tech than most of its competitors — &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387"&gt;tells customers&lt;/a&gt; to expect a lithium-ion battery to retain “up to 80 percent of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles.” If Xiaomi’s testing figures are accurate, a phone like the 11T Pro shouldn’t suffer from an unusually short lifespan, even if its owner only ever uses the fast charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xADjjO"&gt;When I ask whether using slower chargers would improve battery health further, Desjarlais says “There’s relatively minute differences between the two. Of course, the optimal situation would be yes, to use the slower charger if you’re going to charge overnight and use the fast charger for more rushed situations.” But Xiaomi’s testing has been carried out with the presumption that you could get good battery health if you use fast charging all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SExidK"&gt;As for safety, Desjarlais says the testing has been extremely thorough and includes third parties, with 34 different battery protection features included in the device itself. “Generally this is part of the reason why this technology is coming out now for global markets,” he says. “We wanted to make sure that we met all the regulations, but also that it was incredibly safe for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql77da"&gt;Still, I wondered about those potential tradeoffs. Are there really no downsides to a charging system like this? Could a phone with more conventional charging be thinner, or house a bigger battery, for example? According to Desjarlais, there’s no negative impact. That said, the actual charger is quite a bit larger than the average phone pack-in, and will of course draw more power (albeit for shorter periods of time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8jatb2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Join us for the global launch of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xiaomi11TPro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Xiaomi11TPro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xiaomi11TSeries?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Xiaomi11TSeries&lt;/a&gt; and more products on Sep 15, 2021 at 20:00 (GMT+8)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let the magic begin! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cinemagic?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Cinemagic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ade9PECzWP"&gt;https://t.co/ade9PECzWP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1436252424390406149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jk4AVJ"&gt;Xiaomi thinks its fast-charging technology is here to stay, and there still could be room for improvement. Earlier this year, for example, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/30/22461435/xiaomi-fast-charging-world-record-200w-wired-120w-wireless"&gt;demonstrated a prototype 200W system&lt;/a&gt; that filled a 4,000mAh battery in 8 minutes, though Desjarlais would only say that “Whether or not this comes [in a commercial product] is something that you’re going to have to wait and see on,” citing the need for further safety and performance testing. He had much the same answer about Xiaomi’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;truly wireless Air Charge&lt;/a&gt; teaser, saying “It’s a wonderful concept and it’s something that we’re continuing to examine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0o07nD"&gt;Obviously, safety and effective performance should be the least you expect out of any given phone feature. With fast charging, the question is whether customers in Xiaomi’s global markets will consider it a selling point. “For us, I think the big goal here is there’s a lot of people out there who consider fast charging to be an extraneous feature,” Desjarlais says. “But there’s also a lot of people out there for whom this is a big value add. It’s something you don’t really realize how good it is for your day-to-day life until you have to rush out the door to catch a cab in five minutes and your phone isn’t really charged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGkfe0"&gt;Xiaomi’s international launch event for the 11T Pro and the rest of the 11T series is taking place next week on Wednesday, September 15th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vivo finally adopts wireless charging with new X70 Pro Plus flagship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VvNw_B1RXfeUxBh1ueLvdoreV1E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838079/vivo_X70_Series_Photo_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1f8OIT"&gt;Vivo has announced the X70 series, its latest line of flagship phones. It sees the company further extend its camera partnership with renowned lens company Zeiss while refining the blueprint laid down by the X50 and X60 phones from the past year-plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfwdW3"&gt;The X70 Pro Plus is the top-of-the-line device, featuring a Snapdragon 888 Plus processor, a 6.783-inch (yes that’s the stated spec) 1440p OLED screen, and a 4,500mAh battery that uses Vivo’s 55W FlashCharge technology. More importantly, it has 50W wireless fast charging that also works with Qi. This is Vivo’s first ever phone to support wireless charging, which should make it a more viable switching option for anyone who’s already put Qi chargers all over their house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9QWaP"&gt;The X70 Pro Plus’ Zeiss-branded camera array includes a 50-megapixel main sensor, a 48-megapixel gimbal-stabilized ultrawide, a 12-megapixel telephoto, and an 8-megapixel periscope telephoto. Vivo has added three new simulated bokeh modes based on the optical characteristics of classic Zeiss glass, including Distagon, Planar, and Sonnar. The Pro Plus also has a new Vivo-designed image processor called the Imaging Chip V1 that’s designed to improve performance in noise reduction and motion compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NHxEAVX3jccigTqloEf670PS-eM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836445/vivo_X70_Pro_Photo_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XVn4nW"&gt;The X70 Pro and X70 have smaller 6.56-inch 120Hz displays, Mediatek Dimensity 1200 processors, and 44W FlashCharge — but still no wireless charging. The X70 Pro’s camera system bumps the ultrawide down to 12 megapixels, while the X70’s triple array includes a 40-megapixel primary and two 12-megapixel sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WL6CLI"&gt;Vivo hasn’t given full pricing or release information for the X70 series except to say that it’s “gradually rolling out in markets such as India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates, and more” from today. We’ll bring you more as we have it — the X70 Pro Plus in particular is looking like a compelling device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG claims its ‘Real Folding Window’ beats folding glass, will ship in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1u4QfWnyjomjhiJqSwTaxDhj11w=/16x0:835x546/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826689/lg_chem_folding_glass.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sY01G8"&gt;Bendable glass was supposed to unlock &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek"&gt;a future straight out of science fiction&lt;/a&gt;: phones that fold. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;the actual glass we got&lt;/a&gt; wound up relying on factory-installed plastic screen protectors to avoid shattering when you fold it. Now, LG wants to cut out the middleman by improving the plastic instead: the company &lt;a href="https://www.lgchem.com/company/information-center/press-release/news-detail-8713?lang=en_GLOBAL"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; its “Real Folding Window,” a cover material it claims will be as hard as glass but without the whole cracking issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ms8LSb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More PET, less glass&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GWUE2"&gt;What’s the secret? Well, LG doesn’t quite say in its press release, only that it’s a “new material” that it uses to coat both sides of a sheet of plastic film — PET film, to be precise. (PET is probably best known as the plastic in your soda bottle.) The idea is that if you apply that coating to the plastic and then apply that cover material to a flexible OLED panel, you’ll have a folding screen that lasts longer and with a less noticeable crease than today’s folding devices. LG says it should be more competitive on price, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8m2GD"&gt;In fact, LG says the coated PET should work with tablets, laptops, and rollable-screen phones, too, like the one we’re still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296298/lg-rollable-denial-not-on-hold-or-cancelled"&gt;waiting for LG to decide whether it will cancel&lt;/a&gt;. Also, it sees potential for devices where the screen folds &lt;em&gt;outward&lt;/em&gt;, not just inward like we’ve seen with Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;Moto Razr&lt;/a&gt;. LG also says it sees “significant improvements to the fold lines that occur on the folding parts of the screen.” Maybe it could unlock a lot more of the wacky folding phone designs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"&gt;we’ve seen in prototypes and patent applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vqLyt3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A field guide to the wacky future of foldable phones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"},{"title":"Folding phones are the stuff of science fiction","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DczbVu"&gt;LG’s current timeline doesn’t see it commercializing this tech until 2023, though, and it’s not clear how it’ll actually stack up to glass in other ways (like clarity) when it arrives. Samsung’s on the PET train, too; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;as we’ve written&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 3 cover their ultra-thin glass (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;technically made by German manufacturer Schott&lt;/a&gt;) with a “Stretchable PET” layer that we found far superior to the gummy screen protector Samsung had to ship on prior models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGplI1"&gt;Samsung is reportedly ramping up production of folding screens for other phone makers as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;including Google&lt;/a&gt;. And it has been reportedly &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2077"&gt;working with Corning&lt;/a&gt;, which has been building its own folding glass to compete with Schott. Having even more competition from LG is a good thing if you’re a gadget lover hoping foldable prices will come down to earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qszr7b"&gt;Even without the additional suppliers, Samsung is already pushing folders hard: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;we called Samsung’s $1,000 Galaxy Z Flip 3 “the first folding phone for normal people”&lt;/a&gt; and thought the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; was “nearly normal” as well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fashion follows function: what’s next for the phone industry</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KsdFVb"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is a totally normal phone with One Weird Trick: it folds. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Dan Seifert explained in our full review&lt;/a&gt;, it’s the beginning of a new phase for foldables, one where buying a folding phone is something that could appeal to anybody, not just techies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6wHfV"&gt;Samsung is promoting the phone in the ways Samsung usually does, touting features and spec improvements. But it’s also doing another thing: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r75GjfTy2_w"&gt;promoting the phone as something stylish&lt;/a&gt;. A full-on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsLP5SLsUY0"&gt;music video ad with BTS&lt;/a&gt; joins online vertical video ads that are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r75GjfTy2_w"&gt;as focused on the clothing and pockets the phone fits&lt;/a&gt; in as the phone itself. In essence, it’s the latest in a long time of tech companies trying to make the case that their phones are fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MJ77E"&gt;That’s nothing new, but it’s still notable because with the Z Flip 3, it’s so &lt;em&gt;explicit.&lt;/em&gt; Sure, there’s a spec argument about how its improved pocketability is a good reason to buy the Flip, but really that’s not its central appeal. The Z Flip is interesting because it’s different and because it looks better than your average phone. And maybe, if Samsung is very lucky, the fact that it’s a flip phone could connect it to the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/y2k-style-celebrity-runway-trend"&gt;Y2K fashion trend happening right now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3urvw"&gt;The smartphone industry operates a lot like the fashion industry. Both have seasonal lineups (often in the spring and fall), both have a wide range of prices for products that do essentially the same thing, both encourage you to put a premium on a brand label, both have big communities of people who obsessively follow every trend &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an even larger group of people who couldn’t care much less, and, of course, both have entire industries of influencers and journalists whose job it is to track the changes in those industries. (Hi, welcome to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 in Samsung’s stylish new case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mYbTSA"&gt;There are plenty of other parallels to draw, but the key difference between fashion and phones is that phones have been sold on the basis of their technological progress. This year’s phone performs &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; or is faster or has some new thing it’s capable of that last year’s phone can’t do. And though there are obviously technical enhancements to clothing, usually the main reason to buy the new stuff is to stay on trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gOszr"&gt;With fashion, the impetus is to participate in what’s new and what’s &lt;em&gt;now. &lt;/em&gt;Phones have usually been about participating in &lt;em&gt;the future&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEc15H"&gt;And though I don’t think the march of technological progress in phones is going to grind to a halt, I do think that we’ve reached a point where the differences between a cheap phone and an expensive phone aren’t about basic functionality anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hk7PBO"&gt;Expensive phones are about quality and brand — sure, the camera works better, but you’re also getting a nicer screen, better materials, and whatever cachet comes with that phone’s brand. Sounds a lot like fashion, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWaSiQ"&gt;Apple has, of course, been pushing its phones as fashionable objects (or at least as stylish ones) for some time. It has the stronger brand and cultural cachet — both of which matter in fashion! But Apple’s influence and the overall technological trends have led most phones to look basically the same: big flat glass on the front and back, metal rails, camera bump. The only places for expression are the shapes of the rails and the color of the glass. Yawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uTI5YF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As the feature differences between cheap and expensive phones get smaller, brand and style will become more important differentiators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="82ET1o"&gt;Is the Z Flip 3 more stylish than other phones? That’s something I’ll leave you to decide. At minimum, it’s a phone that breaks out of the boring flat-glass-slab sameness of every other smartphone out there. That is meaningful, and it (pardon the pun) communicates something about you to the people who see it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQp9Xo"&gt;The Z Flip 3 also has many other cultural connotations. It’s a green bubble, it’s a Samsung, it’s a techy thing, it’s not common. All of these are reasons to like (or dislike) this phone, and few have anything to do with the refresh rate of its inner display (which is great, btw). The tech of the Z Flip 3 is actually boring, if I’m honest, but the phone itself is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xkVQx"&gt;What would it mean for the next iPhone or next Galaxy phone to not have any technical improvements &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; but simply look different? We already know that form factor changes drive huge sales numbers for Apple. We’ve already seen the same basic dynamic happen with the various iPods Apple cycled through year after year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaSEFQ"&gt;One more thing: like clothing, phones participate in our perception of &lt;em&gt;ourselves&lt;/em&gt;. In some cases, that can arise from the physical thing itself — but more often, it’s how you choose to use it: what apps you keep on your home screen, how often you use them, whether you let yourself get sucked in for hours on end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93oDi6"&gt;That’s one reason that cases are such a big and important business. It’s not just about protecting the phone; it’s about expression. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/14/17441686/verizon-at-t-phone-case-designer-selection-next-gen-store"&gt;Ashley Carman has written about just how big the case business is&lt;/a&gt; and how closely big carriers are following fashion trends to make cases that people will want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="SgtKea"&gt;[Helena Elicerio has] been the company’s phone case product manager for the past two years. She previously worked in fashion as a buyer-merchandiser for companies like Gap and Delia’s, where she did essentially the same job she does now — evaluating products, trend spotting, and designing — except with clothing.&lt;br&gt;“When I was in fashion, one of the things people used to always make fun of me for was that I always changed my phone cases,” she says. “I don’t think anybody tied [cases] immediately back to a fashion accessory. I have an iPhone, but it looks exactly like everyone else’s, so this is how I can show my personality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2OhzUN"&gt;This whole analysis may seem overwrought, but I think a better way to put it is under-analyzed. I’ve long believed that we do not take gadgets as seriously as we should as cultural objects. It’s tempting to say “It’s just a phone,” but I believe that’s the equivalent of saying “It’s just a jacket” or “It’s just a dress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4YhFwi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of thinking strictly about “design” with phones, it’s time to start thinking about fashion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ncxCQC"&gt;Part of the importance of clothing is what it communicates to others. But the more important part is how it makes us feel. Confident, comfortable, bold, fit, stylish, or simple: clothing is about more than simply covering our bodies. And after clothing, what other physical object is on your person every day? Why shouldn’t its features include those feelings in addition to its megapixel count? I would argue that it does but that we’re doing a bad job of talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2mR4B"&gt;I believe that when it comes to phones, we’ve been too set in a design mindset instead of a fashion mindset. We’ve accepted the idea that form must follow function but that truism doesn’t apply to clothing, not really. And as the functionality of phones ceases to be a significant differentiator, something else will take its place. If we don’t understand what that new differentiator is, why it matters, and how it operates, we’re setting ourselves up to be snowed by the companies that do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qu7eFr"&gt;Tech operates in our culture like fashion does. And when you get right down to it: clothing is also technology, just very, very old technology. The way we see ourselves is mediated — and has always been mediated — by technology. Phones are fashion and fashion is culture, and all of that is way more complicated than it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTpPIn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PxFTi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niantic admits it needs to communicate better with Pokémon Go players</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pokemon Go" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TiCSj5sU9zyrQNHl1wdX2afZbic=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804127/jbareham_160711_1134_0005_02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRurPf"&gt;Last month Niantic sparked a backlash in the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; community when it announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605874/pokemon-go-pokestop-distance-halved-us-new-zealand"&gt;reverse some of the changes&lt;/a&gt; it made last year to make the game more playable while staying at home. The company said it would set up a “task force” to figure out the best way to move forward and would announce its findings by today, September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUoay0"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22642030/niantic-pokemon-go-pandemic-interaction-distance-80-meters"&gt;announced last week&lt;/a&gt;, the first main point of action is that Niantic will keep the 80-meter interaction distance for pokéstops and gyms everywhere around the world, after first saying it’d revert to the pre-pandemic 40-meter distance first in the US and New Zealand. Niantic now says it realizes that altering mechanics like this in a real-time, region-specific manner is impractical, and will apply features in the same way across the globe going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CqScUa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We went through a rough learning experience.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qmcMo1"&gt;“We went through a rough learning experience recently when we had to adjust the game settings for New Zealand quickly in response to their lockdown,” executive producer Steve Wang says in a statement. “This experience taught us that we are not going to be able to effectively adjust the experience on a country-by-country basis in real-time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgCYzC"&gt;Wang says that while the increased interaction distance will stay, the team still believes that discovering things in the real world is an important part of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; and plans to “develop new ways that motivate and reward Trainers for exploring and exercising in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWMetl"&gt;The other main finding of the task force was that Niantic “has a lot of room to grow when it comes to communication with our players.” To that end, the company says it’ll post bi-monthly developer diaries to “share the latest priorities, events, and features,” and will engage in “regular conversations with community leaders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kXUWa"&gt;Niantic isn’t giving a whole lot of new, concrete information here, but it’s quite unusual for a gaming company to call itself out like this. What will ultimately matter most, of course, is how it handles similar situations in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Midrange Samsung Galaxy S21 FE appears again in leaked manual</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pZZyie-EG6IUu6-eJO8tlaTIF0E=/1x0:1147x764/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801948/msedge_cwyTkgz4Rn.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render of the unannounced phone from the leaked manual.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-5g-user-manual-makes-no-mention-of-microsd-slot/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_CNo4aG0QZ2u7M8IsX0IwJps0YlMeItRJH4K0Ll1_CzQ-1630443096-0-gqNtZGzNArujcnBszQ0l" target="_blank"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qYtVdr"&gt;A user manual for Samsung’s Galaxy S21 FE (aka “Fan Edition”) has been &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-5g-user-manual-makes-no-mention-of-microsd-slot/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_CNo4aG0QZ2u7M8IsX0IwJps0YlMeItRJH4K0Ll1_CzQ-1630443096-0-gqNtZGzNArujcnBszQ0l"&gt;published online by &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, giving us another look at the unannounced midrange counterpart to the company’s Galaxy S21 flagship. As you’d expect from a manual, the document spends more time outlining how to use the phone than it does describing its specs, but it’s a guide for what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHbW9V"&gt;For starters, images included in the manual appear to confirm that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1400945475558199298"&gt;previously leaked renders&lt;/a&gt; are accurate. That means we’re looking at a similar design to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt;, albeit seemingly with a less premium finish. Three cameras are shown on the S21 FE’s rear while on the front there’s an in-display fingerprint scanner and a hole-punch notch for a selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-XbCbJJT3RrrhDqLSUVxy0rvuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819522/msedge_K8x7I5KuYH.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One section of the manual describe’s the phone’s reverse wireless charging feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9wSAPz"&gt;Other details mentioned in the manual include an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, an ultra-wide camera, and support for Samsung’s Wireless DeX software to allow the phone to mirror its display to supported TVs and use its screen as a touchpad. There’s no sign of a headphone jack, microSD card slot (which appeared on last year’s S20 FE), or an included charging brick in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncznlI"&gt;In terms of specs, &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; notes that previous rumors claim the phone will be powered by a Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 processor depending on the market, which would put it roughly in line with the Galaxy S21 flagship from earlier this year. Its battery is expected to have a capacity of 4,500mAh, with support for 25W fast charging and reverse wireless charging also mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2SlIL"&gt;The question now is when, if ever, we might see the phone officially announced. Earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;Samsung was forced to deny reports&lt;/a&gt; that it had cancelled production of the unannounced phone due to production difficulties caused by the global chip shortage. The emergence of a user manual suggests the phone will see an official release, though it doesn’t outright confirm it. For reference, last year’s Galaxy S20 FE was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451701/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-price-release-date-specs-features"&gt;announced on September 23rd&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of its release on October 2nd, suggesting we might not have long to wait to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
