    <title>Verizon Fios is experiencing outages on the East Coast</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SK6kEZ"&gt;Verizon Fios, the company’s fiber optic network, appears to be experiencing outages in many locations on the US East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPdUWQ"&gt;There are more than 22,000 user reports of problems with Verizon &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt;, and there appear to be hotspots on &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;Downdetector’s outage map for Verizon&lt;/a&gt; in Boston, New York City, Washington, DC, and more. A few &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers are experiencing outages as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/seXuvG_la5wS6LQRhP7-imbOyDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260844/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_9.25.33_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zsiMLJ"&gt;Many people on Twitter are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=verizon%20fios&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live"&gt;also reporting&lt;/a&gt; issues with their Fios service. Verizon’s support account has replied to some individuals reporting problems, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354113894688698369"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; it has been “informed of a potential outage in the area.” The account also said there has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354109889572982786"&gt;a fiber cut in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, which could be the cause of the issues for some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z2cgKX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have been informed of a potential outage in the area and our technicians are working to resolve as quickly as possible.  You may visit &lt;a href="https://t.co/MFnsE6wLnF"&gt;https://t.co/MFnsE6wLnF&lt;/a&gt; for updates once the issue is confirmed.&lt;br&gt;^DNS&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Support (@VerizonSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354113894688698369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="90C7DJ"&gt;People have also reported issues with Google, Zoom, Gmail, and more &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt;, but the reports appear to be coming from the same places that are experiencing problems with Fios. &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=status"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://status.zoom.us/"&gt;Zoom’s&lt;/a&gt; status pages aren’t showing any outages, so it’s possible problems with those services on the East Coast are tied to the Fios outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANgNyb"&gt;We’ve asked Verizon to comment, and the company says it’s looking into it now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s creator-focused Xperia Pro arrives in the US priced at $2,499</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BGsiYZS-3P06Gr77R_wAkXnmuIE=/0x0:9504x6336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721906/Xperia_PRO___DC___HDMI_Monitoring_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia Pro can be used as an external monitor for a camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PADRfM"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/professional-smartphones/xperia-pro"&gt;Xperia Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Sony’s first smartphone with 5G in the US, is launching today for $2,499.99. Sony is targeting the device at professional users, who it hopes will use its HDMI input to turn the phone into an external camera monitor and its 5G connectivity to quickly upload or live-stream footage. Sony says it currently has no plans to release the Xperia Pro in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZjkgE"&gt;Outside of its HDMI input and US 5G support, the Xperia Pro’s hardware is very similar to last year’s Xperia 1 II (which shipped with 5G support in Europe but was limited to 4G LTE in the US). That means it’s powered by a Snapdragon 865 processor with a 4,000mAh battery, and around the back, there are the same 12-megapixel wide, telephoto, and ultrawide cameras. The Xperia Pro also includes a tall 6.5-inch 21:9 aspect ratio OLED display, which Sony is once again describing as 4K but actually has a sub-4K resolution of &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/professional-smartphones/xperia-pro/specifications#specifications:~:text=4K%20HDR%20OLED%20(3840x1644)"&gt;3840 x 1644&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tph7hhTkcejHf5YX-8fs2ufGytQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260192/01_Xperia_Pro_group_black_withclock_Large.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although it’s got the form-factor of a smartphone, the Xperia Pro is aimed at professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aEsgyn2odI1RSQUFDlj5JYHy0Bo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260194/Xperia_Pro_40R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its HDMI input sits next to its USB-C port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OwgCb2"&gt;At $1,200, the Xperia 1 II was already an expensive smartphone, and the Xperia Pro is over double its price. But Sony argues its 5G support and HDMI input could be incredibly useful to professional users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3TPgn"&gt;Let’s start with the HDMI input, which is located on the bottom of the phone where the Xperia 1 II’s USB-C port. (The Xperia Pro’s USB-C port is still on the bottom of the device, but it’s shifted to the left.) Sony says it’s capable of taking up to a 4K 60fps HDR video stream and should work with any cameras that have an HDMI output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sONXBY"&gt;In practice, what this means is that you can connect the Xperia Pro to a camera’s HDMI output, for example, and use its bigger screen to get a clearer view of whatever’s being filmed or photographed. You can pinch to zoom into the image displayed on the screen or overlay gridlines to help with framing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Or04Ek"&gt;Where this functionality gets especially interesting is with the Xperia Pro’s 5G connectivity, which enables it to act as a live-streaming link for your camera in addition to being an external monitor. The Xperia Pro can stream footage from its HDMI input to YouTube directly, and it supports StreamLabs and StreamYard for streaming to other platforms like Twitch and Facebook Live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKYRzS"&gt;The phone supports both Sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G, and Sony claims that it has a unique four-way mmWave antenna array to maximize reception. There’s also a built-in network visualizer app that can be assigned to its shortcut key to help you find the best position to get a signal. Hopefully Sony’s software and hardware are enough to mitigate mmWave’s problems with limited coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7k6EnE"&gt;Ever since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147066/sony-xperia-phone-1-ii-specs-price-features-5g-triple-camera-headphone-jack-wireless-changing"&gt;started teasing the Xperia Pro&lt;/a&gt; early last year, Sony has emphasized that it’s a device for professional users, and its $2,499.99 price tag makes this more obvious than ever. When I asked Sony why it hasn’t released a 5G device aimed at consumers in the US, it told me it’s waiting for the technology to be more broadly implemented by carriers. Until then, Sony says it’s focusing on professional users who it thinks can get more use out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAiBCZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rejoice! Amazon’s new app icon isn’t just a logo in a white box</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XehTHhcOFBSDbMFdiuHA3SueY4U=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68720166/download.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/amazon/id335187483" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DUsEYd"&gt;It looks like Amazon is rolling a new app icon on iOS, and unlike countless other recent app redesigns, it isn’t just a logo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/2/26/18242369/slack-icon-android-ios-white-purple"&gt;dropped inside a white background&lt;/a&gt;! Rejoice! The new icon cleverly takes cues from perhaps Amazon’s most recognizable “product” — its shipping boxes and their bright blue tape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlkVmh"&gt;Here it is — in &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/amazon/id335187483"&gt;the app’s listing on Apple’s UK App Store&lt;/a&gt;. (There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xerusdesign/status/1353864407785369601"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/northead/status/1353861529930772481"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DenisMarciniak/status/1353838774950703105"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thatjamesboy/status/1353807214264385537"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of others seeing the icon on their devices as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bGR1ED2uNa6jdsD2sxJU8fC6swA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259694/Screen_Shot_2021_01_25_at_5.32.35_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VxL0R5"&gt;Whoever worked on this new app design, which will be instantly recognizable on your home screen, deserves a raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkSntW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; We’ve updated the headline to clarify that the new design is an icon, not a logo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>5G boxes are coming to people’s homes, whether they want them or not</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkVO6SfuvjlgEbC6yOjb84JnHg4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719277/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nDFbTN"&gt;When most people look out their windows in the morning, they likely aren’t expecting to be surprised by a chest freezer-sized box that’s feeding a 5G antenna, but that’s the exact experience some Houston residents have been having. Verizon has been installing the boxes as part of its 5G network rollout since at least 2019, and from the &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Streamlined-5G-buildout-puts-ground-15889021.php#photo-20522171"&gt;reporting done by the &lt;em&gt;Houston Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it seems as if it’s been anything but smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzhQWp"&gt;The boxes are known as “ground fixtures,” and they supply power and data to 5G antennas that are placed on utility poles nearby. The ones gracing people’s front window views are being set up to build out Verizon’s 5G home internet service. It’s well-known at this point that, while millimeter-wave tech is blazing-fast, it also has terrible range. The solution to that is to blanket an area with antennas, and the equipment for that has to go somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZsLc77"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Streamlined 5G buildout puts ‘ground furniture’ in Houston’s front yards &lt;a href="https://t.co/je47v706lk"&gt;https://t.co/je47v706lk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Houston Chronicle (@HoustonChron) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HoustonChron/status/1352590511404675072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TAx3ol"&gt;The first speed bump is that Verizon is under no obligation to get permission from homeowners before installing the boxes. In fact, it’s not even required to notify them that it’s going to happen. This is because, technically, the boxes (and the utility poles that go along with them) are installed on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_verge#Terminology"&gt;right-of-way&lt;/a&gt;, which is land owned by the county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3Qbk4"&gt;The permits to place the equipment are dirt cheap to telecoms, only costing $300. They used to be $2,700 before a law was passed by the state of Texas in 2017. But it’s not just Houston that’s having to deal with the surprise boxes, and it’s not just Verizon putting them down. This drama &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/03/18/want-5-g-wireless-box-front-your-house-editorials-debates/410824002/"&gt;has been playing out for years&lt;/a&gt; as telecoms are trying to expand their networks and prepare for the 5G transition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgCPlf"&gt;While it may be startling, there are other complaints homeowners have. A common one is that the cellular equipment &lt;a href="https://www.inquirer.com/business/5g-wireless-verizon-fios-bucks-county-doylestown-pole-20190904.html"&gt;brings their property values down&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to some extreme emotional reactions. And then, perhaps worst of all, there’s the mistakes that can come with installing new equipment: the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;’s article tells of contractors digging into pipes and bursting them, flooding a street not with 5G signal, but with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S65NJh"&gt;While the strife is currently limited to certain areas, it’s perhaps a sign of things to come. As 5G continues its rollout, we can probably expect to see many more stories like this, where the desires of homeowners push up against the desires of telecoms and the community at large. If discussions aren’t starting about how to deal with it now, the surprises are going to keep showing up — if not on our doorsteps, then at least somewhere in the vicinity. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon prepaid customers can now access fast 5G Ultra Wideband </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qZZpbDEc25r3ju_2LnklEcThvHc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68718427/aurora.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Verizon’s 5G UW delivers truly impressive speeds. | Verizon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eyl0jj"&gt;Verizon is extending access to its fast mmWave 5G network to its prepaid customers for the first time. A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fprepaid%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22248705%2Fverizon-prepaid-5g-uw#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new unlimited plan&lt;/a&gt; starts at $75 a month — $10 more than the standard unlimited prepaid plan — and includes access to Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband network. Previously, 5G UW access was limited to postpaid customers on certain unlimited plans. All prepaid and postpaid plans continue to include access to Verizon’s slower Nationwide 5G network, which is currently only a bit faster than LTE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ1kp0"&gt;The 5G UW network does offer impressive speeds, but it’s limited by very short signal range. Currently, Verizon offers the service in parts of 64 cities, so if you’re thinking about upgrading to a plan that includes UW, you’ll definitely want to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fcoverage-map%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22248705%2Fverizon-prepaid-5g-uw#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;consult the coverage map&lt;/a&gt;. Bear in mind also that the signal doesn’t penetrate walls, so don’t expect to pick it up in your living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JqRMhk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"So you got a 5G phone, but is your plan ready? ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22194419/5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="u1STAx"&gt;It’s also worth noting that not all 5G phones support 5G UW, particularly budget devices. Compatible phones sold by Verizon are often indicated by a UW in the model name, but if you plan to bring your own device, that’s something worth checking. 5G phones that don’t support UW will still work with the company’s Sub-6GHz Nationwide 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ob6dTN"&gt;Facebook is aiming to improve transparency around political advertising on its platform by opening up more data to independent researchers, including targeting information on more than 1.3 million ads that ran in the three months prior to the US election on November 3rd of last year. Researchers interested in studying the ads can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18201361/facebook-political-ad-transparency-tools-blocked-user-data-privacy"&gt;apply for access to the Facebook Open Research and Transparency (FORT) platform here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVlX8f"&gt;The move is significant because Facebook has long resisted willfully allowing access to data around political advertising, often citing user privacy. The company has gone so far as to even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18201361/facebook-political-ad-transparency-tools-blocked-user-data-privacy"&gt;disable third-party web plugins&lt;/a&gt;, like ProPublica’s Facebook Political Ad Collector tool, that collect such data without Facebook’s express consent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="04O4iW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook wants to help researchers better understand how its products are used for political ads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MXwQtn"&gt;Numerous research groups around the globe have spent years now studying Facebook’s impact on everything from democratic elections to news dissemination, but sometimes without full access to all the desired data. Only last year, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18531060/facebook-data-researchers-social-science-one-first-studies"&gt;partnering with Harvard University’s Social Science One&lt;/a&gt; (the group overseeing applications for the new political ad targeting initiative), did Facebook better formalize the process of granting anonymized user data for research studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVDAnL"&gt;In the past, Facebook has made some crucial political ad information in its Ad Library available to the public, including the amount spent on certain ads and demographic information about who saw those ads. But now the company says it wants to do more to improve transparency, specifically around how advertisers target certain subsets of users with political advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XdfZum"&gt;“We created this tool to enable academic researchers to study the impact of Facebook’s products on elections, and included measures to protect people’s privacy and keep the platform secure,” reads a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18201361/facebook-political-ad-transparency-tools-blocked-user-data-privacy"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Sarah Clark Schiff, a Facebook product manager, published on Monday. “By making the targeting criteria, such as location and interests, selected by advertisers running social issue, electoral or political ads available for analysis and reporting, we hope to help people better understand the practices used to reach potential voters on Facebook.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cofSLB"&gt;Schiff says Facebook is open to partnering with academics to “further understanding of the impact of digital advertising on the US 2020 elections.” The company will also be retaining its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;sort_data%5Bdirection%5D=desc&amp;amp;sort_data%5Bmode%5D=relevancy_monthly_grouped"&gt;US 2020 Election Spend Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, but it will be moved to its &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/actions/preparing-for-elections-on-facebook/"&gt;Elections page&lt;/a&gt;, where it will still be available for download. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wByqHN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google search on mobile is getting a redesign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zOqV751QsMg5zZ_cRzREpq8CnEM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68706649/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sF9PFg"&gt;Google is redesigning how search results look on mobile, the company announced &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/mobile-redesign-2021"&gt;in a blog on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. “We wanted to take a step back to simplify a bit so people could find what they’re looking for faster and more easily,” Aileen Cheng, who led the redesign, said in the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWJgjX"&gt;The redesign will have larger and bolder text that’s intended to be easier to scan quickly, and you’ll see more of Google’s font in results. Search results will also take up more of the width of your screen, thanks in part to reduced shadows. Google also says the redesign will use color “more intentionally” to help highlight important information without being distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TB0O87"&gt;To get an idea of how the redesign differs from the current experience, compare this render of the redesign with a screenshot of the current search experience I took from my iPhone 12 mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rgy90U6pgXZbA3DiBn7rPHMJyrI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253128/OSRP_NEW.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUoY1cfOnZDauik-Hu3Bx-yTAfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253126/IMG_0168.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2YBvC8"&gt;It looks like the new design puts more information higher up the page and reduces some visual clutter, which will hopefully make results easier to parse without forcing you to scroll down too far to find what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7S1wM"&gt;Google says the redesign will roll out in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor announces its first post-Huawei phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNLv0oIpgCV-YYhA0_gtZBZP9uo=/0x0:1098x732/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68703668/hv40.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JMIZyw"&gt;Honor has announced the new V40 5G flagship phone, its first since Huawei sold the company off to a Shenzhen-based consortium of Chinese partners. The phone is exclusive to China for now, but Honor’s V-series usually makes its way to the rest of the world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21151055/honor-9x-pro-release-date-price-camera-google-apps-service-mwc"&gt;under “View” branding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qR5Qj"&gt;The V40 has a 6.72-inch OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 1000+ processor. The primary camera has a 1/1.56-inch 50-megapixel sensor. The 4,000mAh battery can be charged wirelessly at 50W or at 66W with a cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPGY4t"&gt;Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was selling off Honor in November due to “tremendous pressure” and a difficulty in securing an adequate supply chain. While Honor was operated independently from Huawei, it relied on the parent company for much of its technology, such as HiSense’s Kirin processors. That meant it was hit just as hard by US sanctions banning US companies from doing business with Huawei. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RVez89sFMcc4GyZJZiEFicb5yWg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251828/v40.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tejl7I"&gt;The V40 phones will of course have been in development since earlier than November, but now that Huawei has divested itself of Honor, the international “View 40” version of the V40 may be able to ship with Google services on board. That would allow Honor to sell phones in Western markets and beyond without the huge disadvantage of having to rely on Huawei’s AppGallery, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;still can’t compete with Google’s Play Store&lt;/a&gt; outside of China, where Google has no presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1aJcx"&gt;At the same time, Honor no longer has the advantage of relying on Huawei’s supply chain, so it’s going to have work to do in order to establish itself as a strong brand in its own right once the phones launch elsewhere. For now, it’s available in China with prices starting at 3,599 yuan (~$550) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. 3,999 yuan (~$620) doubles the storage to 256GB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grab an unlocked Google Pixel 3 XL for $300 at B&amp;H Photo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Z45hpI5e0M_Ov4XG_LnbFjt_BA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701428/jbareham_181011_2989_0486.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lhezox"&gt;If you are looking for a smartphone with a good camera but don’t want to spend a ton of money, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615542-REG%2Fgoogle_ga1296_us_pixel_3_xl_64gb.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is selling a 64GB unlocked Google Pixel 3 XL for $300&lt;/a&gt;. The phone was released in late 2018, but it is still a solid contender for people who prefer Google smartphones and want a camera that offers solid image quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIRiCl"&gt;The Google Pixel 3 XL includes a 6.3-inch QHD OLED screen display, a 12.2MP dual-pixel camera on the back, and two 8MP front-facing cameras. While this phone is almost three years old, it does come equipped with the latest Android 11 OS and will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;also receive Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, which will launch sometime this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4DpoXd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j9zaOm"&gt;The Google Pixel 3 XL was one of the tech giant’s two flagship smartphones released in October 2018, with both phones being praised at the time for their front and rear cameras, larger displays, and clean designs. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;discontinued both phones last March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aROE7p"&gt;For $300, the Pixel 3 XL seems like a great deal that delivers a ton of features and is ideal for people who are unconcerned about not having 5G support. If you’re looking for more information on the Pixel 3 XL, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Dieter Bohn gives an in-depth look &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 870 reheats the Snapdragon 865 for 2021 phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eX7yPnMfq5jFz2rX_XK0M0NPkjk=/149x0:1771x1081/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68688359/Snapdragon_870_5G_Mobile_Platform.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YZEDtY"&gt;Qualcomm has announced a new mobile phone processor: the Qualcomm Snapdragon 870, a successor to last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995562/qualcomm-snapdragon-865-5g-camera-gaming-artificial-intelligence-improvements"&gt;Snapdragon 865&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/8/21312035/qualcomm-new-snapdragon-865-plus-gaming-performance-faster-cpu-gpu-wifi"&gt;865 Plus&lt;/a&gt; models. To be clear, the 870 isn’t a new next-gen design — that title goes to the Snapdragon 888, which makes far more substantial improvements in performance and new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCoHLD"&gt;The 870, on the other hand, is virtually identical to the 865 and 865 Plus, with the same design right down to the Kryo 585 CPU and Adreno 650 GPU cores. The 870 is clocked at 3.2GHz, however, making it about 10 percent faster than the original 865’s 2.84GHz and about 3 percent faster than the 865 Plus (which offered 3.1GHz speeds). Think of it almost like a Snapdragon 865 Plus-plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wotbFe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Think of it almost like a Snapdragon 865 Plus-plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bmiTkY"&gt;Qualcomm says that the reason for the new chip is in response to manufacturer and market demands. The 870 is designed for companies that want to offer a top-tier processor but don’t need the absolute best features that the flagship Snapdragon 888 offers and the higher price tag that it demands. Instead, the company says that it expects that Snapdragon 870 phones should hit a sub-$800 price tag (although, confusingly, we’ve already seen Snapdragon 888 phones like the $799 Galaxy S21 start to bleed into that range).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Bk9nK"&gt;Presumably, there’s also a marketing aspect here: the Snapdragon 870’s new branding and modest (if still real) speed improvements over even the Snapdragon 865 Plus mean that companies using the chip in their phones get a “new” 2021 chip to boast about on spec sheets, without concerns of getting looked over by customers for having an “outdated” or “old” processor like the 865 or 865 Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r99Uf3"&gt;Qualcomm says that the first Snapdragon 870 phones should be available in Q1 of this year, with Motorola, OnePlus, Oppo, and Xiaomi among the list of manufacturers planning to use the new processor in their devices. &lt;/p&gt;
