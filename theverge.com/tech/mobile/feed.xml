    <title>Google says it’s improving fingerprint scanner performance with a Pixel 6 update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uN_XFSCdx54aHN63T8GT35iSso4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156269/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qnscZx"&gt;Google quietly rolled out a Pixel 6 update that addresses fingerprint scanner issues, as first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pixel-6-november-update-fingerprint-bug-fixed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The update details have been confirmed in a post on a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/135866170/november-software-update-for-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-us-and-japan-only-selected-carriers"&gt;Google Support page,&lt;/a&gt; which vaguely notes that it includes “minor bug fixes and some fingerprint sensor performance improvements for Pixel 6 and 6 Pro,” without really giving us any details about how the sensor was improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9NzPW"&gt;Dan Siefert called out the fingerprint reader in our reviews of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro last month&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it’s often finicky to use or slow to recognize your print. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768853/google-explains-pixel-6-fingerprint-scanner-unreliable"&gt;Google responded&lt;/a&gt; by saying that the scanner’s “enhanced security algorithms” may result in sluggish or unreliable performance. Google never really indicated whether the scanner’s performance had something to do with issues in the device’s software or hardware, and its initial response implied that the scanner was supposed to be slow for its security features to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y1ts1F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPm4ouSR_NI?rel=0&amp;amp;start=288" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LANtM2"&gt;But now that Google has rolled out an update, the issue might be software-related after all. To see if the update actually made a difference, I asked some of my colleagues at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;about their experiences with the fingerprint scanner after downloading the Pixel 6 update. Here are our findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="G6OY1P"&gt;I haven’t noticed a difference in the scanning, but it seems like it’s making me use my fingerprint less to unlock the phone. —Richard Lawler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUQj0P"&gt;I think the fingerprint reader does work better — I never had trouble with the left thumb, but the right thumb always took two or three tries, and now it seems to work pretty quickly. —Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbN0jN"&gt;It’s certainly not so much faster (or more accurate?). But even best case, it’s still slower than an S20. —Dieter Bohn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X2GE4n"&gt;Overall, the results of the Pixel 6 update are a mixed bag. It seems like it offers &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; improvement, but it still doesn’t put it on par with fingerprint scanners from other companies. Reactions from users on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qvg2nz/google_releases_surprise_pixel_6_november_update/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; offer the same kind of varied results; while &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qvg2nz/comment/hkxbxai/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;some say&lt;/a&gt; the update fixed the problem, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qvg2nz/comment/hkyc83e/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;others say&lt;/a&gt; the difference is there, but only slightly. It’s unclear whether the update to the fingerprint scanner will be the last of its kind or if Google has another one planned in the future. Then again, the issue may be related to the fact that Google decided to use an under-the-screen optical scanner instead of an ultrasonic one — and in that case, Pixel 6 owners may be stuck with the issue. For now, the sensor seems to be &lt;em&gt;just good enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baH1vl"&gt;Google says that the update — which consists of two software builds: one for Verizon-specific devices (SD1A.210817.037.A1) and one for international models (SD1A.210817.037)  — has started rolling out today and will “continue over the next week.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41vb7N"&gt;It’s also worth noting that while the update is just 14.56MB, Google says it takes about 25 to 30 minutes to download and install depending on the number of apps you have, which my colleagues can also attest to. The update will be available to you in November if your device is on any of the major wireless carriers in the US or Japan, including AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Google Fi. You can view the full list of carriers on &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/135866170/november-software-update-for-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-us-and-japan-only-selected-carriers"&gt;Google’s website&lt;/a&gt;. If your carrier isn’t listed, the update will be pushed to your device in December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon charges $5 per month to make calls from Alexa using your mobile number</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aF3EPDuYbER4xsF-Y2ECFaRFdHs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155212/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jvIeDE"&gt;Verizon’s new Number Share Home plan gives you the ability to make and receive calls from your Echo Show, Echo Dot, and Echo using your existing phone number, as noted in a post on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-introduces-hands-free-calling-alexa-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GKqGOs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“Alexa, call Keith.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introducing Number Share - Home, a new feature that allows &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Verizon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Verizon&lt;/a&gt; customers to make and receive hands-free audio calls through their supported Amazon Alexa-enabled devices. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexa99?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@alexa99&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@amazonnews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/S3bfgHJskP"&gt;https://t.co/S3bfgHJskP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon News (@VerizonNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonNews/status/1460630466063654917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4lRA0K"&gt;The feature costs an extra $5 / month, but Verizon will waive the fee for three months if you purchase an Alexa-enabled device through them. And if you already have an Alexa device that you’d like to use, Verizon will only give you one month for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8c3e5t"&gt;Once enabled, you make hands-free calls in the same way that you’re probably already familiar with. Say, “Alexa, call [name],” or “Alexa, dial [phone number]” to make a call, and then say, “Alexa, answer,” when a call comes in. You can also use your device to contact emergency services with the “Alexa, dial 911” command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwztGG"&gt;When you place a call through your Echo device, your Verizon phone number will display on the recipient’s caller ID. Verizon also notes that you can switch between your Alexa device and a “Verizon-distributed Android mobile phone” during calls, but it remains unclear how to do so, as well as which devices that specific feature is available on. From the phrasing Verizon uses, it appears as if live call swapping excludes iPhones, as well as Androids not purchased through Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v5ooyP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon’s Number Share plan lets you make as many calls from your Echo device as your mobile plan allows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIS94u"&gt;If you’re interested in setting up the service, you can connect your Verizon number with your Alexa account by opening the Alexa app and hitting “More.” Then, select “Settings” followed by “Communication.” From here, tap “Verizon,” and then follow the steps outlined on the screen. Amazon offers more details about the service &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=23680112011"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZpLjW"&gt;Echo devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/29/16387398/amazon-echo-free-voice-calls-us-canada-mexico"&gt;already give you the ability to make free calls&lt;/a&gt; through its Alexa Communication feature, but it can be sort of limiting. While Alexa-enabled devices support unlimited phone calls to other Alexa Communication users, it only lets you call up to 10 phone numbers in the US, UK, Mexico, and Canada (excluding 911). Plus, you can’t receive incoming calls from regular phone numbers — it only supports inbound calls from other Alexa users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWm9aH"&gt;Verizon’s Number Share Home plan lets you make as many calls from your Echo device as your mobile plan allows, and it lets you receive calls from anyone. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428700/amazon-att-phone-number-calls-alexa-link-feature-smart-home-echo"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T rolled out a similar partnership with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; as an extension of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428700/amazon-att-phone-number-calls-alexa-link-feature-smart-home-echo"&gt;NumberSync program&lt;/a&gt;. This lets you make and receive calls from your AT&amp;amp;T number on Alexa-enabled devices, as well as from your iPad, Mac, and smartwatch. And unlike Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T’s NumberSync doesn’t tack an extra charge on top of your existing phone bill (aside from any data charges that you may rack up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MmiN5"&gt;Verizon offers a separate plan to share your mobile number with any non-Alexa devices, called &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/numbershare-faqs/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Number Share Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21438693/verizon-apple-watch-carrier-plan-lower-monthly-cost-price"&gt;make and receive calls from your smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18054516/palm-smartphone-lifemode-phone-numbers-verizon-message-plus"&gt;Palm device&lt;/a&gt; at an added cost of $10 / month. Combining both of Verizon’s unbundled Number Share plans means you’ll be paying an extra $15 / month, which is more than you’d be paying on AT&amp;amp;T. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Verizon about the possibility of a bundled Number Share plan in the future but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s next-gen CPU for PCs will take on Apple’s M-series chips in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/edX4v77nA3kW2EvQsAhvtIRNTd4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149215/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TLQ8zg"&gt;Qualcomm is looking to seriously beef up its PC processors, with the company announcing plans for a next-generation Arm-based SoC “designed to set the performance benchmark for Windows PCs” that would be able to go head to head with Apple’s M-series processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUUJaB"&gt;Dr. James Thompson, Qualcomm’s chief technology officer, announced the plans for the new chips at the company’s 2021 investor day event, with the goal of getting samples to hardware customers in about nine months ahead of product launches with the new chip in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P-dwsweD-t8IQVEQQbEqDEMFVUI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018587/Image_from_iOS__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PlzmE3"&gt;The new chip will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;designed by the Nuvia team&lt;/a&gt;, which Qualcomm had bought earlier this year in a massive $1.4 billion acquisition. Nuvia, notably, was founded in 2019 by a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/three-of-apple-and-googles-former-star-chip-designers-launch-nuvia-with-53m-in-series-a-funding/"&gt;trio of former Apple employees&lt;/a&gt; who had previously worked on the company’s A-series chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcd7zn"&gt;The company is making big promises, too: in addition to offering competition to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;stellar M-series chips&lt;/a&gt; (which power its latest MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops and iMac and Mac Mini desktops), Qualcomm is aiming to lead the field for “sustained performance and battery life,” too. Additionally, Qualcomm promised that it would be scaling up its Adreno GPUs, too, with the goal of offering desktop-class gaming capabilities for its future PC products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eb6seA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"New Qualcomm CEO sees former Apple execs as key to beating M1","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560967/qualcomm-apple-cristiano-amon-nuvia-laptop-processors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Z0C1X0"&gt;Qualcomm has tried to break into PC chips before, with products like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020"&gt;Snapdragon 8cx line of processors&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;partnership with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; on the Surface X’s SQ1 and SQ2 chips. But where Apple’s Arm-based chips offered a revolutionary experience of power and battery life when it launched the M1 lineup last year, Qualcomm’s PC efforts have been lackluster so far. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="oUdhTU"&gt;Every Tuesday on &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we’re pulling apart a different new tech standard that is designed to replace tech standards before it. Last week, we explored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772024/vergecast-podcast-usb-c-future"&gt;the fractious history and fraught future of USB-C&lt;/a&gt;.

On the &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; RCS special, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dieter Bohn walks you through the messy past and uncertain future of the texting standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pr5g2w"&gt;Dieter also talks with Sanaz Ahari, senior director of communications products at Google, and Ron Amadeo, reviews editor at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to help explain how RCS works, why it’s dependent on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;the big three US carriers&lt;/a&gt;, what features can be added to the service in the future, and of course, whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715696/svp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;Apple will ever support it on the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Balmuda Phone is a compact Android phone from a high-end toaster company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MKeX3hdAWiaNxxPC4GogvZITY8w=/0x0:3339x2226/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148021/7ABABA5A_D83B_498D_9F33_08E0C80D8CE5.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone has a 4.9-inch 16:9 1080p display.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6pt1nF"&gt;Japanese design company Balmuda today announced its first smartphone at a press event in Tokyo. The straightforwardly titled Balmuda Phone is the debut product from Balmuda Technologies, a new division of the company previously known for stylish, premium home appliances like air purifiers and rice cookers. Balmuda’s toaster in particular has a cult following in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqEM2i"&gt;As you’d expect, the Balmuda Phone is quite a bit different to other phones on the market. CEO Gen Terao said on stage that he felt that smartphones have gotten too big and unwieldy in recent years, so the Balmuda Phone was designed with compactness and elegance as the primary goals. It has a very sharp 4.9-inch 16:9 1080p display and is roughly comparable to a 4.7-inch iPhone SE; the display is slightly bigger and the phone is 2mm wider, but the smaller bezels mean it’s 15mm shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fN__psLPI6HAZ0JLLqx4FcYmkaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018299/913677DF_0F3E_4043_89E8_3AEDC7B09DF4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone is much thicker in the middle than on the edges.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P0QexY"&gt;The Balmuda Phone is a full 13.7mm thick at its thickest point, but the back panel tapers down heavily toward the edges. There’s a single large camera with a 48-megapixel sensor in the top right corner, and a similar-looking cutout in the top left houses a fingerprint sensor. The 8-megapixel selfie camera is housed in a hole-punch cutout at the top right of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XHTgf"&gt;The phone’s specs are generally mid-range. The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 and there’s 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The battery is just 2,500mAh, which will hopefully be offset somewhat by the lower-power processor, though we’ll have to test for ourselves to see. The phone does thankfully have wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arA421"&gt;Where Balmuda is really differentiating itself is with design. It’s a well-worn tech writing cliche to say that something “feels good in the hand,” but that was clearly Balmuda’s intent here with the compact size and curved back that nestles into your palm like a pebble. I have big hands, granted, but I think just about anyone would find this more comfortable to use than the hefty 6-inch slabs most of us carry around these days. While the case is plastic, build quality feels solid and there’s a nice contrast between the textured back panel and the glossy edges. All in all it’s a cute, attractive object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2rl_ANrYzkkReSjuhmQ1rPu8ur0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018298/1C8A4701_958F_4569_B34D_2A9B396E407A.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone has a textured plastic back and comes in black or white.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9QdLYwVGs4Ir1fsShFoeNDs55Ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018304/IMG_0777.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Balmuda’s built-in calendar app, which syncs with Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fNb9Ee"&gt;The software, based on Android 11, is also very different to what you’d find on most Android phones today. There’s an interactive home screen with various elements of the wallpaper customizable for different shortcuts; for example, you could swipe on one of the lines to launch Google Maps. Horizontal swipes move you between some of the built-in software, like a calendar, a notes app, and a calculator. All of these had neat design touches, like the notes app’s visual timeline of photos and memos, or the calculator app’s built-in currency conversion and ability to handle large Japanese numbers that are counted in the 10,000s rather than the thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEkgcb"&gt;The Balmuda Phone will be available in Japan on contract with SoftBank later this month, and Balmuda is selling an unlocked model itself for 104,800 yen (about $920). That might sound like a lot for a compact Android 11 phone with these specs, but then $329 probably sounds like a lot for a toaster, too. In both cases, you’re paying for the design and the user experience rather than the bill of materials, and this clearly isn’t aimed at anyone who wants a conventional Android flagship. As someone who does own Balmuda’s toaster, I’m looking forward to finding out how well the phone holds up under general use — because much as I like the toaster, a smartphone is a lot more important to my life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile hits its goal of 200 million covered by ‘ultra capacity’ 5G a few weeks early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4CjWuAi_BscdAQlGVVu0NurvA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70145975/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtc5b9"&gt;T-Mobile has announced that its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Ft-mobiles-game-changing-ultra-capacity-5g-now-reaches-200-million-people-nationwide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F15%2F22783712%2Ft-mobile-5g-ultra-capacity-mmwave-200-million-coverage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Ultra Capacity” 5G network&lt;/a&gt; now covers over 200 million people in the US, a goal the company had previously set to reach before the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ihkFg"&gt;T-Mobile uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675255/tmobile-5g-uc-icon-iphone"&gt;its “Ultra Capacity” 5G label&lt;/a&gt; for its mid-band and mmWave networks, both of which offer much faster speeds than its low-band “5G Extended Range” network. The low-band network — which is closer to 4G LTE in actual speed — has an even wider reach, with T-Mobile boasting that it “covers 308 million people across 1.7 million square miles.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7bC9S5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MpcsZm"&gt;The rollout here is particularly notable given T-Mobile’s success with its mid-band network — &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fastest-mobile-networks-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; crowned the carrier&lt;/a&gt; as the fastest in 2021, largely due to the strength and coverage of its mid-band spectrum rollout. Meanwhile, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have seen their mid-spectrum efforts largely been put on pause: the two companies were planning on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;relying on C-band spectrum&lt;/a&gt; to shore up their mid-band coverage, but that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;rollout has been put on hold&lt;/a&gt; after FAA warnings that the networks could mess with radio-based safety systems on some planes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCxgKC"&gt;Of course, there’s a big difference between “covering” that many people and actually having them use T-Mobile, and despite the celebrations here, T-Mobile only actually gives service to just a fraction of those customers. At the end of 2020, the &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2021/T-Mobile-Adds-5.5-Million-Postpaid-Customers-in-2020--the-Most-in-Company-History--and-Further-Expands-5G-Network-Leadership-by-Exceeding-Ambitious-2020-5G-Goals/default.aspx"&gt;company had just over 100 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, which is still a far cry from the 200 million people that can now theoretically access its faster 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOmQmK"&gt;And just because T-Mobile’s 5G UC network has hit the milestone doesn’t mean that there’s still not a lot of work to do in building out its network further: thanks to concentrated population clusters in the US in major cities and dense urban areas, it’s comparatively easy to reach “big” coverage numbers. T-Mobile’s future rollout plans are expected to go much slower as a result, with the company hoping to reach 5G UC coverage for 300 million people over the next two years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Under-display cameras are slowly getting better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0KzxHaot5gReB6iNuMOFEtYRBUI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144165/UDC_v02.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VoB38H"&gt;As is often the case with new technology, under-display cameras didn’t make a great first impression. It’s a nice idea in theory, of course — you don’t need a notch or a hole-punch if you can put a selfie camera under the display — but the earliest efforts had some issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGn1Zb"&gt;ZTE’s Axon 20 last year was the first phone to ship with one, and it was bad. The camera quality was incredibly poor, and the area of the screen looked more distracting than a notch. Samsung followed up this year with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, which had similar issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Zlghiy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The world’s first under-display selfie camera isn’t very good","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="n8DWBZ"&gt;But things are actually getting better. Two newer phones on the market, Xiaomi’s Mix 4 and ZTE’s Axon 30, use a different approach to the technology, and it’s an improvement on the previous generation. Instead of having a lower resolution area of the screen that allows light through to the camera, they shrink the size of the pixels without reducing the number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUPvyE"&gt;This means that the part of the screen that covers the camera is really difficult to see in normal use. Look at how the Axon 30 compares to the Axon 20 on a white background, which was the most challenging situation for the older phone to disguise the camera in. It’s also much harder to make out than the camera on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PtU8R9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10865855"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hDMSTZ"&gt;Image quality from the camera is improved, too. Look at these selfies:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0SGA5EZ5oacEfndGn3D1Kscres=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015429/ztecomp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A selfie from ZTE’s Axon 20 on the left, and from the Axon 30 on the right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YH093A"&gt;Now, the camera is clearly still compromised compared to one that doesn’t have to gather light from behind a screen. ZTE and Xiaomi lean hard on algorithms for post-processing — you can tell because the live image preview looks much worse than the final picture. The results still look over-processed and unnatural, even if they’re more usable than their predecessors’. Video quality is also bad, because it’s probably too much to ask for these phones to do the processing in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ10Pg"&gt;Still, the pictures you get are definitely usable most of the time. If you’re not a big selfie person, or if you don’t use your phone for Zoom calls, I think you could get away with it. If those use cases are important to you, though, you should probably stick with a hole punch or a notch. Especially if you just don’t care about hole punches or notches, as I believe is the case for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBjkrc"&gt;There’s more to the idea than just reducing the size of your phone bezels, though. We spoke to Steven Bathiche from Microsoft’s Applied Sciences group on how the company is working on under-display cameras for an entirely different reason — so you can maintain eye contact while looking at your screen on video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEdVii"&gt;For that conversation, as well as more on how ZTE and Xiaomi’s phones work in practice, check out the video up top.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says a fix is coming for update that erased major Pixel 6 feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAZ-1KCcusee49erWj4-_sIKw1Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70135494/akrales_211022_4802_0839.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SX3YdU"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/135090859/magic-eraser-was-there-to-use-until-this-morning-now-gone-%F0%9F%A4%B7%E2%80%8D%E2%99%80%EF%B8%8F?hl=en"&gt;reports from some users&lt;/a&gt;, an update to Google Photos removed one of the Pixel 6’s big features: the Magic Eraser tool that lets you remove unwanted objects or people from your photos. If your Pixel downloaded the affected version (5.67, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-magically-erases-magic-eraser-latest-google-photos-update"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), fear not: Google says it’s working on a fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rj0Dcp"&gt;While the version of Photos with the Magic Eraser erased doesn’t appear to be available in the Play Store anymore, its &lt;a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/photos/"&gt;presence on APK Mirror&lt;/a&gt; confirms that it was at one point (though we wouldn’t recommend downloading it). According to one user, the broken version displayed a tip about the object removal feature, despite it no longer being accessible in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iaijh6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says a fix is coming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fSbyUs"&gt;Google spokesperson Alex Moriconi told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company “identified an issue early in the rollout of [its] latest Photos update and are providing a fix shortly.” Google also says that the issue didn’t affect everyone, which reflects our experience — two &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff with Pixel 6s said that they didn’t have any Google Photos updates available and that they were still able to use Magic Eraser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3viRbA"&gt;While it seems like the update is no longer spreading, it’s still understandable why the users that got it would be shocked to find Magic Eraser missing — it was one of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8YiEmekf_34?t=114"&gt;Google’s main selling points&lt;/a&gt; when it launched the phone around a month ago. Plus, the missing feature being designed to delete things adds dramatic irony, as &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;’s “Google magically erases Magic Eraser” headline pokes fun at. Given the relatively small number of posts about the issue, though, it hopefully won’t affect you too much. If it does, keep your eyes peeled for an update to Google Photos; help is apparently on the way. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rittenhouse trial judge still baffled by pinch-to-zoom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kyle Rittenhouse Trial Continues In Kenosha, WI" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ZRp1eJWDGDRsvDOEwxypppFmuQ=/472x487:4865x3416/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70135398/1236522232.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;nbsp;Judge Bruce Schroeder takes a moment to take a personal call as the court waits for and evidence video to be played as Kyle Rittenhouse, left, and his attorney Mark Richards look on at the Kenosha County Courthouse on November 12, 2021 in Kenosha, Wisconsin | Photo by Sean Krajacic-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="83Tq5c"&gt;The prosecution and defense continue to argue over evidence in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse for killing two people during a protest in Wisconsin, with a surprising amount of confusion from both the defense and Judge Bruce Schroeder about what happens when you pinch-to-zoom on a touchscreen device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLND8s"&gt;On Wednesday, Schroeder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775580/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-judge-apple-ai-pinch-to-zoom-footage-manipulation-claim"&gt;stated it was up to the prosecution to prove that zooming on a video in with an iPad&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t alter or manipulate the footage. “iPads, which are made by Apple, have artificial intelligence in them that allow things to be viewed through three-dimensions and logarithms,” the defense said as part of its objection, adding that the iPad “uses artificial intelligence, or their logarithms, to create what they believe is happening. So this isn’t actually enhanced video; this is Apple’s iPad programming creating what it thinks is there, not what necessarily is there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ru18F3"&gt;Judge Schroeder let the objection stand after giving prosecutors only 20 minutes to find an expert witness to explain how pinch-to-zoom on an iPad worked. (It should be noted, of course, that iPads do not have any “logarithms” that allow video to be viewed in three dimensions or “recreate” parts of an image that are not there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ODrit"&gt;During arguments over jury instructions &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-live-kyle-rittenhouse-lawyers-and-judge-discuss-jury-instructions-as-trial-for-kenosha-shooting-continues-day-9"&gt;broadcast live today&lt;/a&gt;, the judge went further, pulling out his own smartphone to demonstrate his continuing bafflement at pinch-to-zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyLxan"&gt;Specifically, the judge saves texts from his friends by taking screenshots and emailing them to himself. He showed one such screenshot to the courtroom today, noting that “some of them are pretty long” and “show up in my email like this, like a little ribbon,” so he zooms on them and “it’s just a blur.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="maNtzk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s just a blur”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r27KD2"&gt;According to the judge (talking to the prosecution), “You were talking the other day... about it’s just like a cellphone where you can expand a picture and make it bigger. But it’s not making it any bigger; it’s just a blur. Well, it’s not making it any bigger...it’s making it bigger, but it’s nothing but a blur.” He then questioned, “how that can be reliable... because it isn’t reliable for me and getting my messages on my phone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBcwBz"&gt;The prosecutor responded, “I think you’re taking the picture wrong on your phone. I’m not tech support, but...” The judge replied, “I’m not surprised,” prompting laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vaz2Yr"&gt;Let’s explain what’s going on here. Judge Schroeder appears to be using a Samsung Galaxy 20. That means he’s likely activating “scroll capture,” a Samsung screenshot feature that produces long images of an entire window — in this case, the entire text conversation. So those screenshots show up as long skinny images on his screen in order to fit. When he emails (or texts) that image to himself, the image is then &lt;em&gt;compressed&lt;/em&gt; to a smaller resolution and file size, so when he tries to zoom in on it, it’s blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aG4dmh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Judge Schroeder appears to be activating scroll capture on his Galaxy S20&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vNWu6O"&gt;None of this is useful evidence in support of the defense’s objection about iPad pinch-to-zoom. First of all, a Galaxy S20 runs Google’s Android operating system with various Samsung customizations, while the defense’s specific objections were about Apple’s “logarithms” on an iPad. So from the start, whatever a Samsung phone is doing is not relevant to an objection about how an Apple device works. Secondly, the defense’s objection is about those Apple logarithms &lt;em&gt;adding&lt;/em&gt; data to an image such that it can be viewed in three dimensions or recreate what is not there. Here, Judge Shroeder’s phone is plainly not adding any data to the image: it remains &lt;em&gt;blurry&lt;/em&gt;. If anything, his experience supports the &lt;em&gt;prosecution’s &lt;/em&gt;ability to zoom a video. But again: different software from different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U39FA9"&gt;The judge closed the conversation by failing to silence his phone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="FbCO0W"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-develops-industrys-first-lpddr5x-dram"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; its next-generation RAM tech made for mobile devices, which it says can be used in future smartphones but also in servers, cars, and “the metaverse.” While Samsung’s press release doesn’t mention how its new LPDDR5X RAM chips could help people enter the “digital reality,” the tech should help make devices run faster and last longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsHQxN"&gt;Putting the buzzwords like metaverse, AI, and 5G aside, Samsung is promising some real improvements to speed and power usage: it says its next-gen RAM will have 1.3-times faster processing speeds versus the previous-gen LPDDR5, will be capable of higher densities (up to 64GB per chip), and will use 20 percent less power than the last generation. Some of these improvements, according to Samsung, can be chalked up to the new 14nm process it’s using to create the chips. Also, for all the ribbing about the metaverse, lower-power draw and better performance could actually help with AR and VR headsets with onboard processors or phones that are driving those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="pBAd70"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10833239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ecLAES"&gt;Samsung didn’t immediately respond to a request for clarification about the improvements of the 14nm process versus its previous-gen RAM chips, which &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-begins-mass-production-of-16gb-lpddr5-dram-at-worlds-largest-semiconductor-line"&gt;it marketed as “10nm-class,”&lt;/a&gt; meaning &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-industrys-first-8gb-lpddr5-dram-for-5g-and-ai-powered-mobile-applications"&gt;that the process was between 10nm and 20nm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="temZrD"&gt;Samsung doesn’t say when its LPDDR5X RAM chips will be available to manufacturers (including Samsung’s phone division), but &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17058/samsung-announces-lpddr5x-at-85gbps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; has speculated&lt;/a&gt; that they’ll start showing up in devices around 2023. &lt;a href="https://overclock3d.net/reviews/cpu_mainboard/intel_12th_gen_ddr4_vs_ddr5_with_asus_z690_plus_tuf_gaming_d4/1"&gt;As with regular-power DDR5&lt;/a&gt;, which is making its way to desktop computers, it’s not likely that you’ll be able to immediately notice a massive generational leap between devices using LPDDR5 and LPDDR5X memory. However, it’s these kinds of improvements that help our devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749341/smartphones-future-predictions"&gt;get better and better with each generation&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s nice to see Samsung pushing one of the less exciting aspects of a phone’s performance forward — even if it’s using vague promises about the metaverse to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;
