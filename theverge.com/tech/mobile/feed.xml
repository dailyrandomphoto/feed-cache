    <title>Telegram’s group video calls will finally launch in May</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ixIbVRqXLhoVbk-Qj50vBt2inbc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199888/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TCa1EK"&gt;Telegram CEO Pavel Durov &lt;a href="https://t.me/durov/160"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that the iOS version of Telegram will be updated to support group video calls in May (&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/telegram-add-group-video-calls-125053371.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company originally planned to add the video call feature to its messaging service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234254/telegram-messaging-app-group-video-calling-security-usability"&gt;at some point in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but the feature never materialized. Telegram did at least make it into the new year with one video call addition: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/15/21370420/telegram-video-calls-os-android"&gt;end-to-end encrypted one-on-one video calls&lt;/a&gt; were added in August 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXaM55"&gt;Durov’s announcement of the new launch date was shared — naturally — in his personal Telegram channel. He writes that group video calls will have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="jxGndK"&gt;Screen sharing, encryption, noise-cancelling, desktop and tablet support — everything you can expect from a modern video conferencing tool, but with Telegram-level UI, speed and encryption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qGq5qq"&gt;Telegram already offers end-to-end encryption on its one-on-one video calling, but the company hasn’t explicitly confirmed the feature here. We’ve reached out to confirm that it plans to offer the same on group video calls when they launch in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fc4J8B"&gt;Telegram has grown significantly over the pandemic, taking advantage of the shift to working from home and the general desire to stay connected securely. The company announced it reached &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/400-million"&gt;400 million monthly active users&lt;/a&gt; in April 2020, up from &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/200-million"&gt;200 million in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Some of that has to do with its competitor, WhatsApp, fumbling how it communicated its new privacy policy to customers, which inspired some users to leave the Facebook-owned app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;for Telegram and Signal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tihane"&gt;Despite seeming a bit less nimble, WhatsApp actually beat Telegram to offering end-to-end encrypted group video calls. The company&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/30/17632650/whatsapp-group-video-calling-feature-now-live"&gt; added group video and voice calling&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile launches LTE-based SyncUp Tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-W8JVbG76a6O-mdfEZJsOyqHfqI=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199710/SyncUP_TRACKER_Black_Front_Left_Laynard_RGB_2020_10_01_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SyncUp uses LTE rather than Bluetooth or UWB so it doesn’t need to be within range of your phone (or someone else’s) to be located.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfl65d"&gt;It seems that 2021 is the year of the tracker, with new options from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and now T-Mobile in the form of its SyncUp Tracker. But unlike those other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20901686/tile-tracker-mate-pro-slim-sticker-release-date-news-features"&gt;Tile-type&lt;/a&gt; tracking devices, SyncUp uses LTE rather than Bluetooth or Ultra Wideband for real-time location information, a la &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/10/17841570/samsung-smartthings-tracker-gps-lte-m"&gt;Samsung’s SmartThings&lt;/a&gt; tracker. That means it doesn’t rely on being within a certain range of your phone (or other phones) to tell you where it is — but it does come with a $5 per month data charge on your T-Mobile phone plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAxx6S"&gt;The SyncUp offers some nice tracking features: you can make the device ring to help locate it when it’s out of sight, for example, and it offers geofencing to send you an alert when it leaves a predetermined area. It’s also IP67 dust and water resistant. More unusually, it offers a light sensor as an optional feature to detect if it’s been moved from somewhere dark, like the inside of a suitcase, to somewhere brighter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzKIvKSkEiy0BEErMMBX5VLh1no=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475640/T_Mobile_SyncUP_TRACKER_Lifestyle_Bike_21CM0084_030421_0918.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SyncUp’s rechargeable battery should last up to seven days on a charge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="urUnmC"&gt;Some trackers fit into the “set it and forget it” category with long-lasting batteries that only need to be replaced once a year or so. The SyncUp is not one of these devices. Its 900mAh battery needs to be recharged about once every seven days, so it’ll either be something you use occasionally as needed, or one more gadget in your life that you have to remember to charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cifbMS"&gt;Since the SyncUp operates on T-Mobile’s data network, you’ll need one of their data plans to use it: specifically, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fplans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F28%2F22407716%2Ft-mobile-syncup-tracker-lte-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;postpaid Magenta plan&lt;/a&gt;, though the company says it plans to make the tracker available for Sprint and prepaid customers in the future. With autopay, T-Mobile says prices start at $5 per month per connected device, and it’s compatible with both Android and iOS phones. It goes on sale next Friday, May 7th, for $60 outright or $2.50 per month with financing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Messages gets One UI-inspired redesign on recent Samsung flagships</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ch1vt6_NLoK8sH3bBnc2aqFebW0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198083/vpavic_210118_4377_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2dXjib"&gt;Google’s Messages app is getting a redesign on Samsung’s Galaxy S21 devices, bringing its appearance into line with Samsung’s other One UI software, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-messages-galaxy-s21-one-ui-design/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Screenshots posted by &lt;em&gt;XDA &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS21/comments/mwav0k/google_messages_adopting_a_oneui_design_anyone/"&gt;users on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; show the app’s home screen has been divided into two sections: an upper information area with an unread messages counter and a lower section with links to each conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXN2Db"&gt;The redesign follows Samsung’s decision to use Google’s messaging app as the default for its S21 lineup in select markets. With the redesign the Messages app now looks like it belongs as a default, with a look that’s similar to other Samsung software like its Notes or Settings apps. However, in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s21-makes-google-messages-app-native/"&gt;Samsung Messages is still the default&lt;/a&gt; messaging app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/adJl93OB6F_tPCxPBjY-x8XS1IY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475098/Google_Messages_One_UI_Design_461x1024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-messages-galaxy-s21-one-ui-design/" target="_blank"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The home screen now features a large title area in the top half.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KKzb6F"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/27/google-messages-one-ui-galaxy-s21/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Google has been testing the redesign previously, but that it’s now getting a widespread rollout on S21 devices outside of the US. With the app’s appearance now more in line with Samsung’s design style, it will be interesting to see whether Samsung is tempted to make Google’s app its default within the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon confirms there are problems with phone calls in Southern California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b5uYohPrrW1XYNybYSJ5xRXQML0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195325/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o4yCkB"&gt;Many Verizon customers in Southern California are reporting difficulties making calls on Tuesday afternoon, and the company has confirmed to The Verge that there is a “network issue” affecting parts of the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pm9D8h"&gt;“We are experiencing a network issue impacting voice services for some customers in parts of Southern California,” a Verizon spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our engineers have identified the issue and are working to resolve it as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4u39G"&gt;If you are having trouble making calls, the spokesperson recommended putting your device in airplane mode or restarting your phone, which they said should fix the issues. And in response to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1387143438316064784"&gt;one person on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon’s support account recommended using Wi-Fi “if possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jrHKmG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We do apologize, Verizon is currently experiencing a wireless network issue in your area. Our technicians are aware of this issue and are working to resolve it quickly. It is best to use Wi-Fi if possible. Please also enable Data Roaming. *AOR&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Wireless CS (@VZWSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1387143438316064784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qx0gQT"&gt;I’ve found &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carlisleshelley/status/1387139550410010627"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeGoff20/status/1387140510335205377"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; of people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RickyJimenez/status/1387140515435466752"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tscarrithers/status/1387140551258951681"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; making phone calls in Southern California, but it’s not clear exactly how far the outage extends or exactly which areas might be affected. Downdetector’s &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;map of user reports&lt;/a&gt; strongly indicates that the outage is affecting Los Angeles, San Diego, and the surrounding areas. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CyZS7tN_0NfpXa4gKbvJbGVRV_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22474098/Screen_Shot_2021_04_27_at_2.09.59_PM.png"&gt;

&lt;p id="O4DHZM"&gt;As of 4:39PM ET, Downdetector counted &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/"&gt;more than 8,000 reports of problems with Verizon&lt;/a&gt;. Reports on Downdetector have since fallen, but I’m still seeing reports of issues &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TuurtleLover/status/1387164305431285760"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/that7x7/status/1387161888543240192"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSbVCq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 6:06PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Verizon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go Fest is back this July as a global event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KNf92PjhiT2Bf076B3GdZyXX_4Q=/128x0:896x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194356/Ez_vg5sWEAQ5F9D.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image for Pokémon Go Fest 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y8aulW"&gt;The annual &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; Fest is back again this summer, scheduled for July 17th and 18th. Last year’s event was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272334/pokemon-go-fest-2020-online-niantic"&gt;held online&lt;/a&gt; due to the COVID-19 pandemic, instead of taking place in person in select cities around the globe. It sounds like this year’s fest will once again happen virtually; developer Niantic describes the event as a “global event.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6Rc4S"&gt;Niantic didn’t share many other details, though it did tease that this year’s event could be particularly noteworthy. “2021 marks both the twenty-fifth anniversary of Pokémon and the fifth anniversary of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, so trust us when we say you won’t want to miss &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; Fest 2021!” &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/pokemongofest2021-save-the-date"&gt;Niantic said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qxExJA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Time to mark your calendars, Trainers!  ️ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonGOFest2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PokemonGOFest2021&lt;/a&gt; will be a two-day global event from July 17 to July 18!   We can’t wait to show you what’s in store. &lt;a href="https://t.co/L0fcETooMj"&gt;https://t.co/L0fcETooMj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jljTUQBE1h"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jljTUQBE1h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1387090560637456384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fF0EfE"&gt;Last year’s online-only &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; Fest was a huge success, with “a record number of millions of trainers” in 124 countries and regions catching nearly a billion pokémon in total, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344717/pokemon-go-fest-2020-stats-numbers-niantic"&gt;Niantic said&lt;/a&gt; after the 2020 fest. Niantic also said that players walked nearly 15 kilometers each on average.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE is selling a $200 phone with wireless charging through Visible and Yahoo Mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sjp5VRooId_eTJ7urb12esvpm5Y=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194294/Blade_11_Prime_Front_Left.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZTE Blade 11 Prime features a 6.5-inch display and also supports wired reverse charging.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cR9ydL"&gt;ZTE is offering a feature rarely seen in the budget class of phones: wireless charging. The Blade 11 Prime is on sale now in the US for $192 through Visible and Yahoo Mobile, two MVNOs that use Verizon’s network. It’s an otherwise fairly unremarkable budget device, with a 6.5-inch 720p display shipping with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdOn9x"&gt;In addition to wireless charging, the Blade 11 Prime supports reverse wired charging to provide some power to other devices in a pinch. However, the phone’s 4,000mAh battery is on the smaller side, so the feature is probably best reserved for emergencies. The 11 Prime uses a MediaTek 6762 chipset with 4GB of RAM and offers 64GB of built-in storage. It features 16-megapixel standard and 8-megapixel wide rear-facing cameras, plus an 8-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 11 Prime includes a 16-megapixel main camera in its rear triple-cam array.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DUlctz"&gt;There’s not a lot to get excited about here outside of wireless charging, but it is a nice feature to have available as an option in the budget class. More than a few phones around $200, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;OnePlus Nord N100&lt;/a&gt;, offer huge battery capacity as a differentiating feature, but the option to use a wireless charger that’s likely compatible with other gadgets you already own is another handy proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Backbone One is a stunning controller that turns your iPhone into a more capable gaming device</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Complete with software features that make it easy to join parties, record, and share video clips&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mbWWFf"&gt;As the high-profile disputes about what content you can play on your iPhone rage on between Apple, Epic Games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;Google, and Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, a company called Backbone is focusing instead on making sure you get the most out of the games that are currently available. Like Razer did with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431952/razer-kishi-controller-iphone-ios-review"&gt;Kishi controller for iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and as other companies have with snap-on controllers of their own, Backbone is introducing one for $100 that it calls the Backbone One. You can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplaybackbone.com%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone-one%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21525741%2Fbackbones-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy it from Backbone’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JltN1G"&gt;With the controller fully extended, it can fit any iPhone running iOS 13 or later, starting with the iPhone 6S and including the new iPhone 12 lineup. It’s great for Apple Arcade games that support controllers. &lt;em&gt;Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; play wonderfully with the One. And, for popular games like &lt;em&gt;COD: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; that don’t have controller support switched on from the start, Backbone curates visual tutorials that appear before it launches to walk you through the steps to turn it on in the game’s settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj5Dex"&gt;Since the Backbone One launched, it now works with &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393793/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-iphone-ipad-hands-on"&gt;the xCloud iOS beta&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22176273/google-stadia-ios-beta-live-now-mobile-safari-iphone-ipad-cloud-gaming"&gt;Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Even playing games like &lt;em&gt;Hades &lt;/em&gt;through the Steam Link app (with my PC connected via Wi-Fi) felt surprisingly natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1n-iRgtg4cNfJG9iV9Qy9fsR30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989942/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The analog stick is sized similarly to the ones built into the Joy-Con for Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DwtkqN-w96Qpe_ZU3kc0i5S13g4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989940/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The triggers are also similar to those on the Joy-Con, yet these have a more satisfying travel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RBU5X5"&gt;Unlike most controller accessories made thus far, the Backbone One is a hybrid of tightly integrated hardware and software. If we’re looking at the hardware, it’s arguably the best of its kind yet. Both sides of this controller have rounded edges that fit naturally in my hand. I praised the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;design of the Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt;, but this has a more subtle look that doesn’t cover up as much of your phone’s edges. Each button has a more responsive, tactile click, and the analog sticks feel roughly the same size as Nintendo’s Joy-Con for the Switch. Speaking of the Joy-Con, the One’s rear triggers actually feel &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="58jOQj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9545130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dT19br"&gt;The Backbone One features passthrough Lightning charging, with support for Lightning headphones if you have a set. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack, giving you another way to listen to audio — even if your iPhone doesn’t have the port itself. As for power consumption, Backbone says the One itself demands less power from your iPhone than many wired Lightning earbuds do. I didn’t notice more battery usage during gameplay with the controller attached than I normally would without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R4p9F_Zg3IM1_Vae-Y_dIeslxJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989938/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0008.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miraculously, the One adds a 3.5mm port, so bust out those wired headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RfRkKTciPYMa4kacwguTUQNRdnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989939/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0007.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lightning port supports passthrough charging, as well as audio for Lightning EarPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l1gqUO"&gt;The hardware alone might make it worth the purchase, but the software is what really makes it unique. The One doesn’t require its companion app to work with any iOS game that supports a controller, but using the app turns your iPhone into a game console of sorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jz4iFB"&gt;Pushing the controller’s orange Backbone button while the One is connected to your phone will open up the Backbone app, which looks like an operating system. There, you’ll find all of your installed games cleanly laid out in an almost tvOS-esque interface. The app also shows new games available for download in the App Store that support controllers. To add games to the Backbone interface, just tap the orange button when you first boot up each new game. This app takes advantage of the iPhone’s excellent haptics to buzz when you flip around the menu, and the company made its own satisfyingly subtle vibration effect that you’ll feel while quickly flying through a bunch of tiles in the interface with the L1 and R1 shoulder buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-efuXwQzJPeyAGX1M8hsh_zbU_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989937/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0009.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A full look at what you’ll see when you press the orange Backbone button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ru0rOB"&gt;Scroll down a little more in the app, and you’ll find photo and video clips you’ve saved and those from friends. This controller has a dedicated button to let you snap a screenshot in-game, or even record a video clip, which are features that should be familiar to anyone who’s used a modern gaming console. Notably here, though, is that you can press and hold that button for a moment to bookmark key moments on the fly. The Backbone button illuminates a red LED while you’re recording, so it’s easy to see at a glance when you’re live. Backbone handles recording and accessing clips much more elegantly than the Xbox One, PS4, PC, or Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmj6IX"&gt;After a video clip is saved, you can then trim and share the clip in the Backbone app, as well as via iMessage or any social media apps you use. One special thing to note is that Backbone says it can record 1080p clips at 30 frames per second in the HEVC / H.265 codec (supported on the iPhone 7 and newer), so you’ll have higher-quality video without sacrificing as much storage space as other codecs require. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDEF3SLBaPKkIkl_SrS9MuVoyhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989936/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0011.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Backbone button pulses red to indicate when you’re recording the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oSMZng"&gt;Yet another software feature you’ll get with the controller is the ability to create parties and voice chat with friends in the app. These parties operate independently of the game you’re each playing (you don’t even need to be playing a game), so it’s a good way to connect even if you aren’t all into &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, for example. If you’re into recording clips with your friends, the video recording feature will pick up your voice in the mix, along with everyone else’s in the party (indicated by the small orange light near the iPhone’s top bezel in iOS 14). Each participant can choose to mute their mic by double-pressing the left-most button that has three horizontal dots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kgmECWkKc--QQXEotbQMAmPsNHI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989935/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0012.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can start or join a party to voice chat through the Backbone app with other users for free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CHeiZ4"&gt;Snapshots, video recording, and organizing parties for voice chat are just a few ways in which Backbone takes the reins in iOS to create a more interesting experience than Apple itself offers to gamers. It also offers rich presence notifications, chiming in with a notification — whether you’re in the Backbone app or not — to tell you when a friend has logged on, or with an invite that you can click to join a party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxoO9S"&gt;On its face, the Backbone One is just a controller — and a very good one, at that. But with software enhancements that take advantage of iOS in some clever ways, Backbone makes the iPhone feel like a bona fide gaming platform that I want to remain a part of. When the hardware and software are all working together, with the ability to easily join up with friends and record clips, the One feels like a gaming experience that somehow beats Apple to the punch of fleshing out its own gaming ambitions. It is no longer just like a phone strapped into a few pieces of plastic but the start of something very special. And for $100, without monthly charges to use its software and party tools, it’s an appealing price if you do a lot of mobile gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IEqzM-niSipNq1wH_IfrUwzzutc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989945/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Backbone One controller supports all the way back to the iPhone 6S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bFdquo"&gt;As well as it works on iOS, the Backbone One seems perhaps better suited to launch on Android, given that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; isn’t available on Apple’s App Store. Though, since the One launched, Google Stadia and Microsoft’s xCloud game streaming services have come to iOS, giving you more content to play than before. Backbone wouldn’t comment when I asked about an Android-specific version of the One. But this iOS controller is already worth the cost of admission if you’re an Apple Arcade subscriber or just enjoy a few one-off games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIGiuB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHPQc6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 10:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Backbone confirmed that &lt;/em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;em&gt; is supported by the One. Also, I’ve updated this review to note that Google Stadia and xCloud are both accessible on iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_G4X8M_S6lSPjjJ01aHa2-DOPBw=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192532/app_tracking_transparency.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YSB2td"&gt;Apple’s latest iPhone update, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, brings a host of new features that customers will likely see and enjoy — better Face ID unlocking when wearing a mask (for Apple Watch users only), new emoji, support for PS5 and Xbox Series X controllers, and more. But the new update also adds a much more important and  controversial new feature: App Tracking Transparency. That’s Apple’s name for a privacy feature that’s shaping up to be the company’s next big fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nivnR1"&gt;The change has been a contentious one. Apple originally announced the feature alongside the rest of iOS 14 last June &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;but has delayed the release until now&lt;/a&gt; to give developers more time to adapt to the changes. It’s finally live, though, setting the stage for what could be a massive fight between the Cupertino tech giant and competitors like Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EygHYi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ddAD0r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did ad tracking work on iOS before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHQP3A"&gt;Before iOS 14.5, developers could use a host of tools to track user data from within an app. Advertisers could then use it in conjunction with similar data from around the rest of the web to broadly identify information about a user and use that profile to better target them with advertisements (and sell those advertisement opportunities to other companies and businesses that want to focus on their specific marketing segments). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDglwp"&gt;The main tool that’s been available to developers until now has been an Apple-controlled system that’s been around for almost a decade, Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), but developers could also use other third-party tools and methods to cobble together user data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8konp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does App Tracking Transparency change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFboTG"&gt;Technically, App Tracking Transparency alone doesn’t make any seismic changes to how iOS handles ad tracking. Users have been able to opt out of IDFA-based tracking before, but the new update puts the choice front and center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cA4LSg"&gt;It forces developers to give users a choice: once updated to iOS 14.5, every single company that wants to track users and their data across different apps and websites now have to ask permission first using a standardized prompt created by Apple, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rry80Qr7Mx3BYeP6skQNsVKCPmI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472867/Untitled.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vMoguF"&gt;If users say that they’re cool with being tracked (by clicking the “Allow” button) everything works just like it did before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQSOr0"&gt;If they click “Ask app not to track,” though, then that developer can’t track customers using their data in that app, or sell that data to other companies. Not with Apple’s IDFA system, and not with their own systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZzoxT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any exceptions or alternatives? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOPxXN"&gt;There are a few exceptions to Apple’s new app tracking rules. First, companies that own multiple apps can track users across those different apps — for example, Facebook can use data it gathers from Instagram to target ads in its main app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zz4j61"&gt;And Apple is offering new, in-house tools for developers to use instead. One tool, SKAdNetwork, can tell a company how many times its app was installed after an ad was seen. Another, Private Click Measurement, can tell them how many times users clicked on an ad for a product within an app. Apple says that both of those methods are designed to prevent companies from getting information about a specific user, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkeMqz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are people annoyed about this? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ijBDL"&gt;App Tracking Transparency has been praised by groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/facebooks-laughable-campaign-against-apple-really-against-users-and-small"&gt;which called the concept&lt;/a&gt; of making companies ask before they track users on the internet an “obvious baseline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0cwxe"&gt;But not everyone likes the system, and the strongest objections to App Tracking Transparency have been from Facebook. It says Apple’s new system will make it harder and more expensive for ad networks to easily target customers, which in turn will hurt small businesses that rely on highly targeted ad campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5HLD0"&gt;Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;taken out full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; contesting the changes and argued that Apple’s changes could also hurt websites that rely on lucrative targeted ads to make ends meet, forcing them to subscription services or paywalls for content that used to be free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqDODr"&gt;While Facebook’s main arguments appear altruistic, it’s also important to note that Facebook itself stands to lose out here. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Ffacebook-looks-to-take-its-fight-with-apple-to-court%3Firclickid%3D3NsQiH1XqxyLTgawUx0Mo38dUkB0YO0p3xAMRo0%26irgwc%3D1%26utm_source%3Daffiliate%26utm_medium%3Dcpa%26utm_campaign%3D10078-Skimbit%2BLtd.%26utm_term%3Dtheverge.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F27%2F22405474%2Fapple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; explains&lt;/a&gt;, the kinds of ads that Apple’s new rule impacts aren’t a huge part of Facebook’s business model — less than 5 percent of Facebook’s $84 billion annual ad revenue — but it’s still a noticeable chunk of change, especially considering that Facebook’s internal estimates reportedly expect around 80 percent of iOS users to opt out. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwQxjzz2i6KUlQ00H5M-q9f8O4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472878/Untitled_1.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qabc7d"&gt;Apple is also giving companies a chance to make their case for allowing ad tracking. Developers will have control over &lt;em&gt;when &lt;/em&gt;to show Apple’s prompt, specifically to give apps like Facebook, NBC News, or BBC a chance to make their case to users about why they should allow tracking. And Facebook is doing just that, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;letter to users&lt;/a&gt; that tries to sell them on the idea of getting more relevant advertisements and supporting small businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCw19r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can companies just track me anyway?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfLYzE"&gt;Apple’s prompt disables its own IFDA system on a system level, so if users turn down apps, developers can’t access it. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/"&gt;Apple says that companies&lt;/a&gt; are also “required to respect your choice beyond the advertising identifier” when it comes to other means of tracking user data, and companies that do try to sneak around the rules could be subject to the same consequences as any other developer violating App Store terms of service, up to and including having their app removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVgODg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about Apple’s apps?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwQjMA"&gt;Apple says that its apps will abide by the new rules, too — as a matter of policy, the company claims that its first-party apps already don’t track users across other apps and websites, which is why you won’t see it appear on Apple’s apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsLNuh"&gt;That said, Apple &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; still have some tracking that it uses to serve personalized ads within the App Store, Stocks, and Apple News apps. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223"&gt;As detailed here&lt;/a&gt;, Apple uses information like location, keyboard language settings, device type, OS version, mobile carrier, and more to serve customers more relevant ads within its apps. It also uses account information and past purchases to lump customers into market segments to better target ads within those apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svZ1Pm"&gt;The difference is that Apple only uses that information within its own apps, doesn’t link it to additional profiles from third-party sources, and doesn’t sell that data. Apple also has an &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074"&gt;additional toggle&lt;/a&gt;, located in “Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Apple Advertising,” to disable that tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l9VcBN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there antitrust concerns?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnhA1Q"&gt;It’s a major tech story in 2021; of course there are antitrust concerns. A group of German advertisers have &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0a48d9aa-244b-4945-b2a0-01c68683544a"&gt;already filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; about the new system, and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-scores-legal-win-in-france-over-app-privacy-changes-11615971737"&gt;French regulators&lt;/a&gt; shot down an initial antitrust complaint in March, noting that the system “doesn’t appear to be abusive” on Apple’s part.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjahJE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will I be spammed by these toggles forever? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZX2mQ"&gt;Nope. Apps can only request once, when you first open them after the update. Developers who don’t want to track you don’t have to show the prompt at all. There’s also a global setting switch that lets users just opt out of all apps by default in Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking, and toggling off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” That menu also allows users to grant (or revoke) permission from apps after the initial prompt has been shown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsBf0X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TOuZV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola is once again announcing a low-cost phone with a 90Hz screen and a huge battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVlxPPCbd814-L4_xh2OWW_TEoY=/1x0:1396x930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188600/moto_g20.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Motorola Moto G20 features a large 5,000mAh battery and a faster-than-standard 90Hz 6.5-inch display.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KnGKty"&gt;Motorola has announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286048/motorola-moto-g30-moto-g10-90hz-screen-price-launch"&gt;low-cost devices&lt;/a&gt; with big batteries and fast-refreshing displays this year, and now it’s offering its least expensive model yet: the Moto G20. Launching in Europe this week for €149 (about $180), it includes a 6.5-inch 720p LCD with a 90Hz refresh rate and a 5,000mAh battery. It’s the latest in a series of budget devices from Motorola targeting slightly different price points in the budget range, and it would likely have a place in the US market if the company chose to offer it in the States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2d7kDh"&gt;The G20 features a 48-megapixel main camera, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro and depth-sensing cameras, and a 13-megapixel selfie camera. Unlike other Moto G-series phones launched this year, the G20 does not use a Snapdragon chipset, offering instead a Unisoc T700 processor with 4GB of RAM. The device’s built-in storage of 64GB or 128GB can be expanded via microSD, and it will ship with Android 11. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HpnZsKY4IFjbz2eAxNzW51i6lR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471191/156439_1200_auto.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G20 includes a 48-megapixel main camera along with an ultrawide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i5vYLX"&gt;There’s no indication whether the G20 will be sold in the US — the G100, G50, and G30 introduced earlier this year haven’t been offered stateside as of yet either. Motorola’s current US offerings are largely situated above the $200 mark, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/three-motorola-edge-flagships-coming-one-with-108mp-camera_id131722"&gt;rumblings&lt;/a&gt; that high-end Edge devices may be coming next. But with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375938/lg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola"&gt;the void LG is leaving&lt;/a&gt; at the budget end of the market, Motorola certainly has a full portfolio of devices it could offer if it wanted to try to fill the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixel 5A camera sample leaks, hints at similar specs to the Pixel 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCACWXmndGxHJUKjB6Zv2lQ4b3o=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69185712/pixel_5a_ultrawide.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The since-removed photo, which appears to have been taken with the Pixel 5A.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ljHMMa"&gt;Google seems to have accidentally shared a photo sample from its upcoming Pixel 5A, giving us some hints about what to expect from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;barely announced&lt;/a&gt; device. The photo appeared in an album posted alongside a &lt;a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/04/hdr-with-bracketing-on-pixel-phones.html?m=1"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about Google’s HDR+ Bracketing technology, which aims to reduce noise in HDR photos (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/23/our-first-potential-pixel-5a-camera-sample-looks-like-it-comes-from-a-very-familiar-sensor/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The EXIF data for most of the photos said they were captured by existing Pixel phones including the Pixel 5, Pixel 4A 5G, Pixel 4, and Pixel 4 XL, but in among them was one image apparently taken with a Pixel 5A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2MvhN"&gt;Google recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;confirmed the existence of the Pixel 5A 5G&lt;/a&gt; in response to rumors that the device had been cancelled. However, beyond confirming that the device will be available later this year in the US and Japan, it didn’t offer any more details about the phone’s specs or cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSjVsi"&gt;The image labeled as coming from a Pixel 5A has since been removed from &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPILk1LAjCRKAx7mfmgr_QNQmJ4U6zqhiFTwL88eTsXic8tSeS7dfTiswq1C-nEjw?key=eHJpUFgxOVBNaHVjSFZDMFE3OE5aZmlUZ0d5R1lR"&gt;the album&lt;/a&gt;, but offered several details about the camera performance of the upcoming device while it was up. First is that it appears to have been taken with an ultrawide camera, which corroborates &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/22/google-pixel-5a-renders-leak/"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt; that the 5A will have two rear cameras — a main camera and an ultrawide. That’s similar to the Pixel 4A 5G, while the Pixel 4A had just the one rear camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AqA5mi221HihuIROcaTN3Qg-ank=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470037/image__6_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Google Photos&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the photo’s EXIF data before it was removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cFpbQk"&gt;Its resolution is also listed as 12.2 megapixels, which is similar to the photos we saw from the Pixel 5. Although the sensor in the Pixel 5’s ultrawide camera is technically 16 megapixels, it produces 12.2-megapixel shots by default. The 5A’s EXIF data also shows it has the same f/2.2 aperture as the 5. Given that the photo was attached to a blog post about HDR+ Bracketing, it seems likely that the 5A will also offer support for the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxe0qu"&gt;Combined with previous rumors, it looks like the Pixel 5A could be a very similar device to last year’s Pixel 5. Reports suggest it’ll use the &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/21/google-pixel-5a-5g-chip/"&gt;same Snapdragon 765G processor&lt;/a&gt;, and have &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/22/google-pixel-5a-renders-leak/"&gt;a similar design&lt;/a&gt; with a 6.2-inch OLED display with a hole-punch selfie camera. Like Google’s previous A-series devices, however, the rear panel is expected to be made of plastic rather than glass, and the phone will also reportedly feature a 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtQvBG"&gt;According to the leaked photo’s EXIF data, the photo itself was taken last October just before the Pixel 5 was released. Without official confirmation from Google there’s no guarantee it’s representative of the 5A’s final camera hardware, but the fact that the photo has now been removed suggests it wasn’t a simple labeling mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
