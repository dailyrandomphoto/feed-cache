    <title>TCL is bringing two new budget 5G phones to US carriers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DaVVvoLFzwZnegeDZgz5zizsXMI=/0x49:2480x1702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345550/TCL_30_V_5G_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NPQoRa"&gt;TCL will debut a total of eight new phones globally in 2022, but it’s kicking the year off by introducing two models coming exclusively to the US: the TCL 30 XE 5G and TCL 30 V 5G. The 30 XE 5G offers a 6.52-inch 90Hz display and will be sold initially at T-Mobile with other carrier availability later in the year. The 30 V 5G will be exclusive to Verizon, with sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G connectivity. With these new devices, TCL looks to be playing to its strengths in the budget market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfYUKd"&gt;The TCL 30 V 5G boasts a slightly bigger 6.67-inch 1080p display with a standard 60Hz refresh rate. It uses a Snapdragon 480 5G chipset with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The 30 V includes a 50-megapixel main rear camera and a 5-megapixel ultrawide, alongside 2-megapixel macro and 16-megapixel selfie cameras. It offers a 4,500mAh battery and comes with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fPmZW3aeJ9K2i3CK8Bra7xa8O1g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130731/TCL_30_V_5G_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 30 V 5G is a Verizon exclusive with all flavors of 5G connectivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L52BGC"&gt;The TCL 30 XE is positioned as an entry-level 5G device with a 720p display, MediaTek Dimensity 700 chipset, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of built-in storage. It offers a 13-megapixel rear main camera and an 8-megapixel selfie cam, plus rear depth and macro sensors. The 30 XE also includes a 4,500mAh battery and ships with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8KWHCw7s7t4hTixLDCFXFaUAVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130743/TCL_30_XE_5G_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 30 XE 5G includes a 90Hz display for smoother animations and scrolling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wbO3JT"&gt;The 30-series marks TCL’s third generation of devices bearing the display maker’s own branding — previously, it produced phones for other brands. While last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22560849/tcl-20-pro-5g-review-screen-battery-price-specs"&gt;upper midrange 20 Pro 5G&lt;/a&gt; didn’t quite hit the mark, we thought its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;sub-$300 devices&lt;/a&gt; were a great bargain with their big, vibrant screens and low price tags. TCL appears to be leaning into the US budget market with its devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41NjJh"&gt;TCL says both phones will launch “in the coming weeks.” There’s no pricing announced yet, but it’s a fair bet that the Verizon phone will cost more and require a premium unlimited plan to get the most out of it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Version two of TCL’s wearable display glasses are lighter and less dorky-looking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IFNxfk_TpazNRLm7mVLJt51Nf4U=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345514/__13.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NxtWear Air is a personal secondary display for your phone or laptop embedded in a pair of glasses frames.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEnFQD"&gt;TCL is preparing to launch a second iteration of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22221389/tcl-wearable-display-glasses-moveaudio-s600-pet-tracker-ces"&gt;wearable personal display&lt;/a&gt; it released in limited supply last year. Version two, called NxtWear Air, offers the same secondary-display-in-a-pair-of-glasses function as the original but has been made 30 percent lighter — down to 75g compared to 130g. TCL has made some adjustments for the style-conscious, too, tweaking the design to look more like a normal pair of sunglasses and less like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545583/tcl-nxtwear-g-wearable-display-glasses-availability-price"&gt;something you’d be embarrassed to wear in public&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvbDqj"&gt;NxtWear Air, like its NxtWear G predecessor, offers two 1080p Micro OLEDs embedded in a pair of glasses frames that should give the wearer the effect of viewing a 140-inch screen from about 13 feet away. Its lenses are opaque, and the glasses don’t offer AR or VR functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-HaUch8sOBSMyPS9eV8Qz6Rjeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131389/___11.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swappable plates attach to the front of the frames via magnets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tkE34P"&gt;Instead, it acts as a secondary display that you wear on your face, using USB-C to connect to a DisplayPort-compatible phone, tablet, or laptop. Stereo speakers are built in, but if you don’t want to annoy everyone in earshot, you should connect Bluetooth or wired headphones instead. This year’s model also comes with two magnetic interchangeable plates that attach to the front of the frames to change up the style of the glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoBjI2"&gt;TCL says NxtWear Air will launch in Q1 of 2022. There’s no word on which regions it will be available in, and TCL hasn’t revealed a price for them yet. NxtWear G went on sale in a limited run in Australia last year priced at $899 (about $680 US), so expect to spend a little money for the most private monitor you can use on a plane.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and AT&amp;T cut a deal with the FAA, will hit the brakes on 5G C-band rollouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuFRTAf0PHNydVwYcJ9mEWFLDsw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70344446/vzw-042.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WJ8yHk"&gt;In a standoff that’s pitting Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and the FCC versus the FAA and the airline industry over the two carrier’s plans to upgrade their 5G wireless services, the mobile companies now say they’ve reached an agreement with the Department of Transportation. For Verizon, delaying the launch of the “C-band” spectrum means canceling a celebration scheduled for 1PM ET on Tuesday, marking the beginning of its spectrum upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="4PKeGY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="13Jh1R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rMYxwM"&gt;We’ve agreed to a two-week delay which promises the certainty of bringing this nation our game-changing 5G network in January, delivered over America’s best and most reliable network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="IuoOgm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="S6Cpgi"&gt;At Secretary Buttigieg’s request, we have voluntarily agreed to one additional two-week delay of our deployment of C-Band 5G services. We also remain committed to the six-month protection zone mitigations we outlined in our letter. We know aviation safety and 5G can co-exist and we are confident further collaboration and technical assessment will allay any issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="e5TVMG"&gt;FAA Communications deputy assistant administrator Jeannie Shiffer provided a statement to The Verge saying, “Safety is the core of our mission and this guides all of our decisions. The FAA thanks AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon for agreeing to a voluntary delay and for their proposed mitigations. We look forward to using the additional time and space to reduce flight disruptions associated with this 5G deployment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFugOD"&gt;She also says that the agreement will see the companies use mitigations similar to those already in place in European countries. The deal will see those mitigations put in place around 50 airports for six months, and now the FAA says, “While U.S. standards and operating environments are unique, we believe this could substantially reduce the disruptions to air operations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F09yQ"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey and Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg wrote, “Agreeing to your proposal would not only be an unprecedented and unwarranted circumvention of the due process and checks and balances carefully crafted in the structure of our democracy, but an irresponsible abdication of the operating control required to deploy world-class and globally competitive communications networks that are every bit as essential to our country’s economic vitality, public safety and national interests as the airline industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1amsgq"&gt;The companies said they would not give in to the FAA and DOT’s request to delay their (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;already delayed by 30 days&lt;/a&gt;) C-band spectrum upgrades for an additional two weeks. The executives continued to propose mitigations like the ones used in France, creating a buffer zone around certain airports and lowering power levels nationwide.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh1Ukl"&gt;According to the FAA, the controversy exists because of “concerns that the 5G signal could interfere with the accuracy of an airplane’s radio altimeter, without other mitigations in place,” according to the FAA. Those altimeters are crucial for automated landings, and the FAA claims that rolling out the changes could disrupt air travel or impact safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXV9sV"&gt;Earlier this year, an FCC auction &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;sold the two carriers rights to use so-called “C-band” frequencies at a price of nearly $70 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are eager to roll it out so that in addition to offering ultra-fast 5G connectivity in specific areas using high-band millimeter-wave technology and much slower 5G over low-band frequencies, the new spectrum will provide in-between performance over much wider areas. T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;currently uses mid-band spectrum that isn’t in the C-band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMGE1k"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 3rd, 9:59PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added a statement from FAA, information about the agreement, and confirmation that Verizon has canceled its launch event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy S21 FE officially joins Samsung’s crowded midrange lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BwdK3tp4I1yjbLPPi9iSg7d79c4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70344380/ajohnson_220102_4951_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The less-expensive Fan Edition of the S21 includes a 6.4-inch 120Hz display.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yWTBNU"&gt;After a year of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;will-they-or-won’t-they speculation&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung has, at last, announced the Galaxy S21 FE. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;the 2020 Galaxy S20 FE&lt;/a&gt; (the FE stands for Fan Edition), this device features most of the flagship-level specs of the Galaxy S21, including a Snapdragon 888 chipset and 120Hz display, at a lower price: $699 for the 128GB base model. With the S21’s nearly midrange price tag and a compelling upper-midrange option in the Galaxy A52 5G, it’s yet another addition to an already crowded spot in Samsung’s lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3q4q6Q"&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE offers a 6.4-inch display, slightly larger than the S21’s 6.2-inch panel. Outside of that size difference, the S21 FE has a whole lot in common with the S21. Its screen is a 1080p OLED panel with 120Hz like the S21’s. Even the design language is consistent, with the camera bump blending into the phone’s side rails. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIOLTVTm2NWjrnGvIuBEYYNbNc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142239/ajohnson_220102_4951_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera bump is matte plastic rather than metal like the S21’s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OVfhHi"&gt;The FE includes a flagship-worthy 5nm chipset (Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 in the US, Samsung’s own Exynos elsewhere) and a 12-megapixel f/1.8 main camera with optical stabilization, same as the S21. It even does one better on battery capacity, with a 4,500mAh cell compared to the S21’s 4,000mAh (though its slightly bigger screen likely evens out battery performance). Fast 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, an IP68 weather-resistance rating, and both flavors of 5G (sub6-GHz and speedy mmWave) are all carried over from the S21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oA7eh"&gt;So what does paying more for the S21 get you? More RAM — 8GB in the base configuration versus the S21 FE’s 6GB — and a higher-res telephoto camera. Aside from the previously noted screen and battery size differences, that’s about it. The Galaxy S21 FE will sell for $699 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or $769 for 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It ships with Samsung’s Android 12-based One UI 4.0 installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="g4AI1u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S21 review: nice for the price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gmLQPC"&gt;I’ve had the S21 FE in my hands for a few days, and it feels to me like a device that rides the ever-muddled line between a flagship and a midrange phone. The back is composite plastic with a matte finish, which feels midrangey to me, but the screen is big and bright with all the buttery smoothness of its 120Hz refresh rate — flagship territory for sure. Overall performance feels flagship-worthy, too, with the exception of a little lag in the camera’s portrait mode live preview. Oh, and there’s no charger in the box, which is a flagship thing now, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Prj0nwwxLY04hOolUfQvKdyDKFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142237/ajohnson_220102_4951_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 FE ships with Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZE3LuI"&gt;Samsung introduced the S20 FE last year as a lower-cost, full-featured alternative to the S20. Also priced at $699, there was a bigger gap between it and the $999 base model S20, which made it a heck of a deal. Things are a little different this time around, with the S21 coming down in price to $799. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;the Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;, one of Samsung’s higher-end budget phones for $499. And don’t forget that Samsung lowered the price of admission for its foldables — with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; priced at $999, it’s part of the conversation, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0XIB8PEBtXEXQztEVE6Y4gfJVFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142241/ajohnson_220102_4951_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 FE features a gently curved metal rail. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ifze6E"&gt;It’s more than a little confusing, but it’s not a new strategy for Samsung. As &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G04G95B9fc"&gt;Dieter noted in his overview of the S20 lineup&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung takes this “a phone at every price point” approach because it can. It also happens to be really good at mixing and matching features for different price points, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;solid support policy&lt;/a&gt; backing most devices makes its budget and midrange phones tough to beat. With the S21 FE, Samsung is taking yet another cut into a market that it’s happily slicing thinner and thinner.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EFgjMU"&gt;The rear camera layout of OnePlus’s next flagship, the OnePlus 10 Pro, has been shown off in a teaser image for the smartphone. The handset is due to launch in China on January 11th before coming to the rest of the world later in the year. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau previously confirmed that the phone would be revealed in January in a &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1110411735/L72FWaAtT#comment"&gt;post on Weibo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g94BHg"&gt;Although the teaser image doesn’t show much more than the rear of the phone, it confirms the 10 Pro will have three rear cameras that will once again carry the Hasselblad branding. OnePlus’s partnership with the Swedish camera manufacturer began with last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;, where the two companies worked together on the color tuning of the phone’s photos, with generally good results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MkcZzl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A three-stage ringer switch is also visible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SCKlcq"&gt;The image also confirms the phone’s camera bump design, which has previously appeared in leaks from &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-10-pro-specifications-exclusive/"&gt;Twitter tipster @OnLeaks and &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Although the specs of these cameras are yet to be officially revealed, reports indicate the OnePlus 10 Pro will feature a 48-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel ultrawide, an 8-megapixel telephoto, and a 32-megapixel selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAWlKB"&gt;Internally, it’ll reportedly be powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor paired with 8GB or 12GB of RAM, 128GB or 256GB of storage, and a 5,000mAh battery. There’s also an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. In the official image released today, we can also see the trademark OnePlus three-stage ringer switch, which in the past has let you easily switch the phone into its vibration and silent modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AedmH"&gt;OnePlus hasn’t announced when the OnePlus 10 series might launch outside of China, but &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles &lt;/em&gt;previously reported that a global release could come by April.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T, Verizon CEOs reject FAA request to delay 5G expansions scheduled to start January 5th</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="27VCuY"&gt;In an ongoing battle pitting the FAA and airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834080/5g-rollout-delay-faa-fcc-letter"&gt;against the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T over their planned launch of mid-band 5G service, the mobile carriers are declining a request by the FAA for a two-week delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKG5X6"&gt;Earlier this year, an FCC auction &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;sold the two carriers rights to use so-called “C-band” frequencies at a price of nearly $70 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are eager to roll it out so that in addition to offering ultra-fast 5G connectivity in specific areas using high-band millimeter-wave technology and much slower 5G over low-band frequencies, the new spectrum will provide in-between performance over much wider areas. T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;currently uses mid-band spectrum that isn’t in the C-band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iYGP4g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="dqEUXt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank goodness: No more delays for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/5G?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#5G&lt;/a&gt; in C-Band! We can have safe wireless and safe flights. Reasoned people should accept US wireless industry not have more C-Band limitations than France.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon CEOs reject U.S. request for 5G deployment delay &lt;a href="https://t.co/AJVZoCofuq"&gt;https://t.co/AJVZoCofuq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike O’Rielly (@MPORielly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MPORielly/status/1477713404710244355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 2, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RLKcpu"&gt;On Friday, US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson sent a letter to AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey and Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/1/22862481/buttigieg-faa-request-two-week-5g-delay-aircraft-safety"&gt;asking them to push back plans to start commercial deployment on January 5th&lt;/a&gt;. The air travel regulators said they’d use that time to identify priority airports, notify flights, and line up alternate methods of compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcW0It"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-02/at-t-verizon-reject-u-s-request-for-delay-in-new-5g-service"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/att-verizon-ceos-reject-us-request-5g-deployment-delay-2022-01-02/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report that in a response letter today from the two CEOs, the companies, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;had already ceded to a 30-day delay request&lt;/a&gt; and agreed to reduce the power of their signals, said no. They propose to start using the C-band spectrum to expand their 5G services, but with a commitment to avoid deployment around certain airports for six months, saying a similar system is already in place in France. However, that commitment relies “on the condition that the FAA and the aviation industry are committed to doing the same without escalating their grievances, unfounded as they are, in other venues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSPJju"&gt;In the letter (included below), they say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HS7GC8"&gt;“Now, on the evening of New Year’s Eve, just five days before the C-Band spectrum will be deployed, we received your letter asking us to take still more voluntary steps - to the detriment of our millions of consumer, business and government customers - to once again assist the aviation industry and the FAA after failing to resolve issues in that costly 30-day delay period, which we never considered to be an initial one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXEdKr"&gt;“At its core, your proposed framework asks that we agree to transfer oversight of our companies’ multi-billion dollar investment in 50 unnamed metropolitan areas representing the lion’s share of the U.S. population to the FAA for an undetermined number of months or years. Even worse, the proposal is directed to only two companies, regardless of the terms of licenses auctioned and granted, and to the exception of every other company and industry within the purview of the FCC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9i3XL1"&gt;“...we will again volunteer, in the spirit of cooperation and good faith, to alter our use of the C-Band spectrum during the same six-month period (unless we and the FAA determine that these voluntary limits should be relaxed sooner). Specifically, for six months, until July 5, 2022, we will adopt the same C-Band radio exclusion zones that are already in use in France, with slight adaptation to reflect the modest technical differences in how C-band is being deployed in the two countries. That approach – which is one of the most conservative in the world – would include extensive exclusion zones around the runways at certain airports. The effect would be to further reduce C-band signal levels by at least 10 times on the runway or during the last mile of final approach and the first mile after takeoff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b4h9nS"&gt;FCC commissioner Mike O’Reilly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MPORielly/status/1477713404710244355"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about the letter, saying, “We can have safe wireless and safe flights. Reasoned people should accept US wireless industry not have more C-Band limitations than France.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWfiVb"&gt;At issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;is the idea&lt;/a&gt; that guided landing systems for aircraft “could be limited due to concerns that the 5G signal could interfere with the accuracy of an airplane’s radio altimeter, without other mitigations in place,” according to the FAA. C-band 5G and these radio altimeters don’t actually operate in the same band, but the bands are close enough that the fear exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcqWym"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; points out that the trade group &lt;a href="https://www.airlines.org/"&gt;Airlines for America&lt;/a&gt; that represents American Airlines, JetBlue, Delta, FedEx, and UPS, among others, has threatened to go to court on Monday if the FCC does not take action on the 5G rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2zopI"&gt;So far, the FAA’s response to the letter is that “We are reviewing the latest letter from the wireless companies on how to mitigate interference from 5G C-band transmissions. U.S. aviation safety standards will guide our next actions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T and Verizon may have to delay 5G deployments another two weeks over airline safety fears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQc0cfDVFbOQyriJ8meFsw6J9eQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70336748/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OOFwVV"&gt;US officials have asked AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon to further delay new 5G deployments so that the Federal Aviation Administration can have more time to determine where they might interfere with airlines. US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson sent a letter to the CEOs of the two telecoms on Friday requesting a delay of “no more than two weeks,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-officials-ask-att-verizon-delay-5g-wireless-over-aviation-safety-concerns-2021-12-31/"&gt;according to Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8V1bx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon had already delayed these deployments by a month over regulators’ concerns and planned to start the rollout on January 5th as a result. The two telecoms now &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buttigieg-delay-5g-service-airline-safety-concerns-verizon-wireless-att-2022-1"&gt;tell &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;they are reviewing the latest request for a further delay. Buttigieg and Dickson write that, even with an additional delay, they expect 5G deployment will still begin in January “with certain exceptions around priority airports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RXyjNT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Carriers are miffed about the delays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnAkNi"&gt;The two telecoms are eager to start deploying the new 5G spectrum that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;they bought in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the so-called C-band frequencies. Those frequencies of spectrum allow radio waves to hit a sweet spot between high speeds and long distances, allowing for higher-speed 5G deployments than traditional LTE spectrum can achieve, without the stifling distance limitations that come with millimeter wave 5G. Getting these deployments out is a critical step for AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon to make 5G a worthwhile upgrade and stay competitive with T-Mobile, which has &lt;a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/t-mobiles-mid-band-5g-network-surpasses-200m-people-covered/2021/11/"&gt;already started deploying&lt;/a&gt; its own similar spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNSRyV"&gt;Officials have been concerned that C-band frequencies could interfere with altimeters and prevent the use of guided landing systems meant for times of low-visibility, threatening the safety of aircraft. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;On December 7th&lt;/a&gt;, the FAA went so far as to tell pilots they wouldn’t be able to use those guided and automatic landing systems at airports where there’s deemed to be interference, which could theoretically lead to many flight delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXBwPU"&gt;Buttigieg and Dickson want to identify “priority airports” and mitigation strategies so that most large commercial aircraft can “operate safely in all conditions.” Some proposals revolve around placing 5G “buffer zones” around airports, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/airlines-brace-for-flight-restrictions-in-5g-standoff-11639929603"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOIwwt"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are pretty unhappy about the delays. On Friday, the companies accused the aerospace industry of holding deployment “hostage” unless they covered the cost of altimeter upgrades. Verizon also went in on the airline industry, telling &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, “This industry which got a $54 billion taxpayer-funded, government bail out over the past couple years clearly has much bigger issues to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BlackBerry will die on January 4th — for real this time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uO2QEwgyrYwSJhJP4Sz3r9yp07k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70333149/akrales_180531_2598_0178.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;QWERTY and quirky — Blackberry’s later Android incarnations retained the famous keyboard. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQex1z"&gt;Dear friends, we’re gathered here today to mourn the death of that once-beloved monarch of the mobile world: BlackBerry. And, yes, I realize that this is &lt;em&gt;not the first time&lt;/em&gt; we’ve announced the death of the company or its devices (and, for reasons I’ll explain below, it likely won’t be the last) but this is a very definite ending for legacy BlackBerry hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlXY5O"&gt;As of January 4th, any phones or tablets running BlackBerry’s own software — that’s BlackBerry 7.1 or earlier, BlackBerry 10, or its tablet operating system BlackBerry PlayBook — will “no longer reliably function,” &lt;a href="https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/support/devices/end-of-life"&gt;says the company&lt;/a&gt;. Whether on Wi-Fi or cellular, there’ll be no guarantee you can make phone calls, send text messages, use data, establish an SMS connection, or even call 9-1-1. That sounds pretty darned dead to us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9J1OsT"&gt;If, for whatever inexplicable reason, you or someone you love is still using an original BlackBerry, then we recommend you make it a New Year’s resolution to pry it gently but firmly from their hands. From January 4th onwards, it’ll be little more than a paperweight. (Though BlackBerry devices running Android will continue to work as normal.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="RIM BlackBerry 8310 beat up (1020)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03_rw04RGhfOq5A6Agczeuih_jw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/964696/blackberry-8310-att-busted_1020.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An elegant phone for a more civilized age: the BlackBerry 8310. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pbeXcJ"&gt;As alluded to above, though, this might not be the last BlackBerry death we announce. The company has experienced a slow and torturous decline since its dominant era in the late 2000s, when its QWERTY keyboards and reputation for security gave it a 50 percent market share in the US, but such a storied brand has to be wrung for its last dregs of value. (Its parent company, BlackBerry Limited, has pivoted to &lt;a href="https://marker.medium.com/how-blackberry-yes-that-blackberry-became-a-cybersecurity-company-efae02912751"&gt;selling cybersecurity software&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbDVFa"&gt;BlackBerry &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/30/3929760/blackberry-z10-review"&gt;tried to reboot itself&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 with a new OS, BlackBerry 10 (which failed), and in 2015 switched to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9694374/blackberry-priv-review-android-phone"&gt;making Android devices&lt;/a&gt; (which failed, too). Then, in 2016, it started licensing its brand to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/16/13979914/blackberry-global-branding-phone-rights-tcl"&gt;third-party manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; like TCL. This is still how the BlackBerry name lingers on, and in 2020, a Texas firm named OnwardMobility said it would be making a 5G Android-powered BlackBerry device with a full QWERTY keyboard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375026/5g-blackberry-phone-android-physical-keyboard-2021-release-date"&gt;to release in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1CVTX"&gt;Well, the clock is rather ticking on that one (OnwardMobility hasn’t shared any news or updates on its website since January 2021), but whether that particular effort lives or dies, it will at least give us a chance to gather again for another funeral. We really must get together some time under kinder circumstances. How are your aunt and uncle anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wRBqpn"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/exynos/playtime-is-over/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;started teasing its next flagship smartphone SoC&lt;/a&gt; — expected to be called the Exynos 2200 — ahead of a January 11th announcement with a tantalizing tidbit of information: the new chipset will feature a GPU powered by AMD’s RDNA 2 graphics architecture, better known for powering the next-gen graphics on the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and AMD’s RX 6000-series graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TNfkkr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s leaked Galaxy S22 Ultra is just straight up a Galaxy Note now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lLMoxs"&gt;Of course, given that the Exynos 2200 will be powering a smartphone, the new GPU won’t be magically enabling next-gen graphics on par with the most powerful consoles and gaming PCs. But it likely will enable some improvements in graphics, along with whatever other upgrade Samsung has up its sleeve for its latest flagship chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HjFMkm"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlaytimeIsOver?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PlaytimeIsOver&lt;/a&gt;. The gaming marketplace is about to get serious. Stay tuned for the next &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Exynos?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Exynos&lt;/a&gt; with the new GPU born from RDNA 2. January 11, 2022. &lt;a href="https://t.co/0H2MeVUbeS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0H2MeVUbeS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Samsung Exynos (@SamsungExynos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungExynos/status/1476538563235831810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bZz6Yi"&gt;As a successor to 2021’s Exynos 2100, the Exynos 2200 will likely power some of Samsung’s most powerful phones in 2022, including the presumed Galaxy S22 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;S22 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. As is usually the case, though, it’s likely that phones using Samsung’s in-house designs will be limited to international models of its upcoming flagships, with the US variants presumably set to use Qualcomm’s recently announced Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWTdkT"&gt;Fortunately, we won’t have to wait long to get more details on the Exynos 2200 (or whatever Samsung calls it), given that the company is promising a formal debut on January 11th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s leaked Galaxy S22 Ultra is just straight up a Galaxy Note now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbSEqAa5HvBi6XrDoYApqqsUvCE=/15x0:1065x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331734/s22U.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1476660792527306754" target="_blank"&gt;evleaks (Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZL2j1N"&gt;It looks like Samsung’s next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S22 Ultra, will borrow more heavily from the Galaxy Note’s DNA than ever before. In fact, a newly leaked official render &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1476660792527306754"&gt;published by Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; confirms that the phone is pretty much a Note in every way except for its name. Wider screen with more surface to write on? Check. S Pen silo? Check. Flat top and bottom? Yep. Around back is a camera array that sticks closely to the layout from the S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjmHlF"&gt;Personally, I think the S21 Ultra was one of the boldest, best-looking phones Samsung has ever produced — especially that sleek matte black version. It owned the large camera bump in a way that actually looked &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy S21 Ultra, in Phantom Black" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hqNHCbYQFfkdxl7hLhCT0VijTvk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248897/vpavic_210118_4377_0090.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra put a unique spin on the camera bump. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9xbO2A"&gt;While I’m glad to see Samsung has found room for the sensors in a way that keeps the back of the device uniform, there’s definitely something a little more bland about this design. It looks every bit like a Note 10 Plus or Note 20 Ultra with a revamped camera system, but maybe that’s exactly what some Samsung fans want. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s22-ultra-black-images-awesome/"&gt;Real-world shots of the S22 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; have also leaked out recently, and yet again, it’s looking pretty great in black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLi9Xg"&gt;Whatever can help boost sales of the company’s traditional phones is probably the right move. The company is happy to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22859804/samsung-foldable-phone-sales-shipments-2021-forecast"&gt;talk up the momentum of foldables&lt;/a&gt;, but the S21 lineup reportedly disappointed in its retail performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuSiwk"&gt;Based on past history, Samsung should announce the S22 family sometime in February. &lt;/p&gt;
