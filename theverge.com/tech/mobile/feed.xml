    <title>AT&amp;T says it will bring mmWave 5G to seven US airports this year</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RwlOut"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has announced a partnership with Boingo Wireless to bring its fast mmWave 5G — which it calls 5G Plus — to more US airports, with a goal of seven by the end of the year and 25 by the end of 2022. That’s counting its &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/5g_plus_airports.html"&gt;first deployment in Tampa International Airport&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. There’s a little bit of a catch, though; travelers will only find 5G Plus in certain areas of the airport, like major gates and concessions areas. Still, it’s one place where range-limited but powerful mmWave might actually make sense. When else do you need to download an entire movie while you wait for your latte?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iC9Gnh"&gt;Boingo is known for providing Wi-Fi to air travelers, but what AT&amp;amp;T is deploying isn’t 5G-branded Wi-Fi. Any AT&amp;amp;T subscriber with the right phone and a 5G plan will be able to connect automatically to the network. As a reminder, not all 5G phones include mmWave support; the iPhone 12 and Galaxy S21 series do, but it’s scarcer among midrange and budget devices. And AT&amp;amp;T isn’t the only one teaming up with Boingo on airport 5G: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20827985/verizon-5g-indoor-boingo-partnership-problem-solution-phoenix"&gt;Verizon announced its own partnership in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and it currently offers its fastest 5G flavor in a dozen airports, including Tampa International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3Puhk"&gt;Bringing mmWave 5G from the outside to indoor locations presents some unique challenges: the higher frequencies it uses provide huge capacity and speeds but don’t travel far and are easily stopped by walls, windows, and other obstacles. However, according to AT&amp;amp;T’s SVP of Network Infrastructure Mo Katibeh, focusing deployment &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; high-traffic indoor locations is in many ways easier than bringing mmWave to an open-air location like a city block. Working with one building owner tends to be easier than with many building and land owners to lease space for equipment, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sT2uAf"&gt;Katibeh sees strategic 5G Plus deployments like these as an important piece of its overall 5G strategy in the next few years. Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, he emphasized that the company has first focused on extending its 5G coverage nationwide, using mmWave for dense urban areas and venues, which he says are the places “where 5G plus really shines.” Verizon, on the other hand, put more emphasis on mmWave 5G early on, which &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/the-age-of-mmwave-5g-sputters-to-dusty-death/a/d-id/770838?"&gt;hasn’t panned out very well&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.opensignal.com/2021/07/13/quantifying-the-mmwave-5g-experience-in-the-us-july-update"&gt;according to Open Signal&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon users that it tracked over a recent 90-day period spent less than 1 percent of the time connected to mmWave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRIpGn"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T still has plenty to prove with its 5G network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;after a rocky start&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, the company made a bunch of other partnership announcements today, mostly centered on entertainment and augmented reality applications. The company has introduced interactive AR &lt;em&gt;Space Jam&lt;/em&gt; characters, thanks to &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/5g_facebook.html"&gt;a partnership with Facebook Reality Labs&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s working on &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/newsroom/2021/5g_nba_wnba.html"&gt;more AR features for the WNBA’s app&lt;/a&gt;, among other things. While potentially useful and sensible 5G developments are underway, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"&gt;the 5G hype machine&lt;/a&gt; sure hasn’t gone anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9QXXG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction July 14th, 3:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Mo Katibeh is the Senior Vice President of AT&amp;amp;T Network Infrastructure and Build. A previous version of this article misspelled his last name as Kabiteh; we regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s new filter blocks spoofed phone numbers that are too close to yours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zmeq82VnnfNfhyIc8T3ld_6wExA=/98x0:1133x690/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572851/Call_Filter_Hero_image_0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon rolls out new Neighborhood Filter tool to help curb spoofed calls.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Verizon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PDSTGH"&gt;Verizon wants to help curb those obnoxious “spoofing” calls from similar area codes to your own with a new tool called Neighborhood Filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtWjZ6"&gt;Spoofing is the method used by spammers to make a number appear similar to your own so you’re more likely to answer the call. Verizon’s new Neighborhood Filter will allow Verizon customers to send these calls directly to voicemail, as well as any other prefix and area code combinations that the company thinks might be suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOjJ2x"&gt;The tool is available to Call Filter Free and Call Filter Plus customers through the company’s separate &lt;a href="https://myvpostpay.verizon.com/ui/acct/secure/productApps/downloads/sfo120005"&gt;Call Filter&lt;/a&gt; app. Call Filter Free costs nothing to enroll and offers basic filtering from those dreaded and persistent spam calls. Call Filter Plus, which costs an additional $3 per month per line (or $8 per month for three or more lines), comes with additional tools like access to a database of over 100 million spam numbers, a personal block list, and a spam risk meter for real-time call assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eFCXkL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The tool should help make spam calls a little less painful&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qk1jOD"&gt;To activate the Neighborhood Filter for blocking spoofed calls, head to the Call Filter app on your mobile device. (If you’re on iOS, you’ll need to toggle on filtering from your Call Blocking and Identification in your Phone settings.) From the lower navigation menu on the main screen in the app, select Management. From this menu, select Other Filters. Here, you should see the Neighborhood Filter, which will prompt you to enter a six-digit prefix and area code similar to your number. Make sure to toggle it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwHfDi"&gt;Verizon launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/28/18285643/verizon-spam-calls-robocalls-blocking-identifying-service"&gt;free version&lt;/a&gt; of its call filtering tool in 2019. Prior to that, it charged $3 per month for its call filtering tools, even while those services were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/30/15906800/verizon-anti-spam-robocall-call-blocking-att-t-mobile"&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; through some of its competitors T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWFAlX"&gt;From your Spam Filter settings in the Call Filter app — whether you’re paying for it or not — you’ll be able to determine how you want spam calls to be filtered. Blocked calls can either be terminated or sent to voicemail based on your selection. This menu will also let you determine how you want calls flagged based on a perceived level of risk. The Call Filter &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/call-filter/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;app is available&lt;/a&gt; both on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Secretly throttling is never okay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oqj0MakQBtEkdeVeOgoGtaFWenI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572807/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wBrVTC"&gt;Last Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; caught OnePlus doing the previously unthinkable — throttling the performance of its new flagship smartphone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing “inexplicable” slowdown, &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16794/oneplus-9-performance-examination/"&gt;the publication discovered&lt;/a&gt; the phone was diverting a laundry list of popular apps &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from its Snapdragon 888’s high-performance cores. The company’s excuse? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568107/oneplus-9-pro-battery-life-app-throttling-benchmarks"&gt;It was all an attempt to save battery life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORRG0g"&gt;Today, OnePlus is doubling down on that earlier statement &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/insight-into-oneplus-9-series-processor-and-app-optimization.1467338/"&gt;with a longer forum post&lt;/a&gt;, where the company’s argument sounds downright reasonable. “In recent years, the performance of smartphone SoCs has reached a point where their power is often overkill in certain scenarios,” writes OnePlus, blaming Qualcomm for essentially being &lt;em&gt;too good at its job&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuAIgh"&gt;“With this in mind, our team has shifted its attention from simply providing sheer performance to providing the performance you expect from our devices while reducing power consumption and heat dissipation,” adds OnePlus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNk5S7"&gt;That sounds good! Now, here are three problems with that seemingly cogent argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PMaSz"&gt;First, OnePlus has sold devices based on raw speed for years now, and despite the OnePlus 9 Pro’s focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"&gt;Hasselblad-branded cameras&lt;/a&gt;, it’s no exception. The company’s entire tagline is “Never Settle,” and the company promised a “flawlessly ‘Fast and Smooth’ experience” from the OnePlus 9 Pro. “You’ll be one step ahead of the curve,” the company assured users during its launch presentation, calling the phone’s Snapdragon 888 “the best there is of all the dragons in the kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IC6-rrkCrnPY-qasvzsjznDRshQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713252/oneplus_888.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro promises “ultimate performance” from its new Snapdragon chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ktjxPR"&gt;Second, if &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; is right, you do appear to be settling here. The publication found the phone less responsive than a Galaxy S21 Ultra in side by side tests, despite having worse battery life, even though both use the same chips and same screen technology. The slowdown “applies to pretty much everything that has any level of popularity in the Play Store,” too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhN03b"&gt;Third and most importantly, OnePlus &lt;em&gt;didn’t tell anyone. &lt;/em&gt;And now, the company’s trying to make it sound like the practice of secretly throttling a device could somehow ever be okay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meuPOl"&gt;This is a dangerous idea. If we establish that a phonemaker can quietly throttle on a user’s behalf, what’s to keep them from doing that whenever they like? For years, conspiracy theories have swirled about how gadget makers slow down or otherwise cripple devices to force their users to upgrade, and many of them were dismissed as just that — conspiracy theories — until it was revealed that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16827248/apple-iphone-battery-replacement-price-slow-down-apology"&gt;actually did something of the sort&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUVfRp"&gt;Back then, Apple also had a good excuse about how its throttling was saving your phone’s battery, but it didn’t change the fact that the company hid it from users, causing an unknown number of them to upgrade their phones earlier than they might have needed to. The company settled twice (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161271/apple-settlement-500-million-throttling-batterygate-class-action-lawsuit"&gt;once for $500 million&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573710/apple-battery-gate-throttle-iphones-settlement-amount"&gt;once for $113 million&lt;/a&gt;) and added the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16984234/how-to-iphone-throttling-ios-11-3"&gt;turn off throttling&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple still largely normalized the idea that its actions were okay, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/31/18047174/iphone-x-8-plus-performance-throttling-battery-management-ios-12-1-update"&gt;brought the controversial processor throttling feature to later phones&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3p1zFV"&gt;When OnePlus realized that it wanted to shift its focus away from “simply providing sheer performance,” the time to tell us would have been on stage, before people purchased the phone, and it should have been packaged as a feature that you can turn on and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vo1rHt"&gt;That’s the kind of relationship the company’s power-user fans expect to have with OnePlus. That’s the brand OnePlus built. Now, it’s at risk of erosion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWjTA5"&gt;Let’s not pretend this is normal or acceptable for OnePlus, or any other manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy Z Fold 3 will support the S Pen Pro, according to FCC filings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NBcIorRIvoOCJq93AWxdQ-MK6HE=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572527/Screen_Shot_2021_07_12_at_11.56.01_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s S Pen and S Pen Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dj1Cqq"&gt;After many teases, it seems as if a Samsung foldable is finally going to get support for an S Pen stylus. &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;amp;application_id=PQFsmd5Fd6mroqLRXdITpA%3D%3D&amp;amp;fcc_id=A3LEJP5450"&gt;FCC filings for the S Pen Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a bigger version of the S Pen with Bluetooth connectivity that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22226594/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-stylus-support-price-unpacked-event"&gt;Samsung announced in January&lt;/a&gt;, have been made public, and &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=5331981"&gt;one document (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; reveals that the upcoming stylus will work with the unannounced Galaxy Z Fold 3 (which is presumably the next device in the Z Fold lineup). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfEzjv"&gt;And it’s not just the Z Fold 3 — the stylus, which doesn’t have a release date but is set to hit this year, will apparently support the S21 Ultra, the Note 20 lineup, and more. You can see the full list of devices that the S Pen Pro will support in this image from the filing:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ou0zA8U1fDyJWAS7ubIY3cv4br4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713180/Screen_Shot_2021_07_12_at_12.09.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=5331981" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The list of devices the S Pen Pro will support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8fgNuC"&gt;The S Pen Pro’s support for the Z Fold 3 isn’t a major surprise — the company has been hinting toward some sort of S Pen support for the foldable for some time. During last year’s Unpacked event, Samsung’s president of mobile TM Roh said in a Q&amp;amp;A that the company has been “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231677/samsung-s-pen-foldable-support-additional-device-categories"&gt;happy to hear&lt;/a&gt;” that people want the S Pen to work with the Fold. In a December blog, he said that the company was looking to bring some of the Galaxy Note’s “most well-loved features” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;to other devices&lt;/a&gt; — which seems likely to be a wink toward stylus support, one of the hallmarks of the Note line. And in January, Roh was even more explicit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231677/samsung-s-pen-foldable-support-additional-device-categories"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; the company plans to “expand the S Pen experience across additional device categories in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiKSNl"&gt;A detailed leak has already shown the unannounced phone with a stylus: a render shared by noted leaker Evan Blass depicts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;what appears to be the Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; with a new “Fold Edition” S Pen propped up next to it. Perhaps the Z Fold 3 will come with the Fold Edition stylus in the box while the S Pen Pro will be sold separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxbKF5"&gt;FCC documents becoming public can indicate that a product may be announced soon after they are published. In this case, an official announcement for the S Pen sometime soon would make sense, as Samsung has held summer Unpacked events in early August for the past few years. Blass has also already stated that this year’s event is scheduled for August 11th, alongside revealing a bunch of other devices that are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572858/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2021-leak-evan-blass-galaxy-z-fold-flip-3-s21-fe-watch-4-buds-2-date"&gt;expected to be revealed at the show&lt;/a&gt;, including the Z Fold 3, the Z Flip 3, two new Galaxy Watches, and new Galaxy Buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pbj0l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for the tip, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/smartvenkat95/status/1414632885521321986"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Venkatesh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2tf3k"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is adding a few more benefits to its $85-per-month top-tier unlimited plan at no added cost. Unlimited Elite subscribers will now truly have access to unlimited high-speed data and will no longer be subject to deprioritization after hitting 100GB of data per month. Customers will also get a bump from 30GB of monthly hotspot data up to 40GB as well as up to 4K video streaming — boosted from a maximum of 1080p. The new plan features will be added automatically for all current subscribers starting this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u12QBY"&gt;If this all sounds familiar, that’s because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;T-Mobile did more or less the same thing earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, AT&amp;amp;T’s Unlimited Elite now matches T-Mobile’s Magenta Max nearly feature-by-feature. Both start at $85 per line (including autopay discounts) and include the same 40GB hotspot data, 4K streaming, and (actually) unlimited high-speed data plan features. AT&amp;amp;T includes HBO Max on its plan whereas T-Mobile offers Netflix, but otherwise, they’re broadly similar. The “Un-carrier” T-Mobile is looking an awful lot like a regular carrier these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Abmx0D"&gt;Most unlimited phone plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"&gt;include data deprioritization in the fine print&lt;/a&gt;, meaning after a certain threshold of monthly data is reached, your account is subject to slowdowns when the network is busy. In this case, T-Mobile’s move to do away with this practice for its highest-paying customers appears to have put pressure on its competitors to do the same. There’s just the slight issue of providing high-speed 5G data that’s worth getting excited about, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has struggled to do&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple of years, but things will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;likely improve in the near future&lt;/a&gt;. Until then, it’s your move, Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s next Galaxy Unpacked device lineup may have been entirely spoiled in huge new leak</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3, from GIFs shared by leaker Evan Blass.&lt;/em&gt; | Images: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734346138300423" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fmaqzO"&gt;We might now know a lot of what’s coming at Samsung’s next Galaxy Unpacked event thanks to a series of tweets from noted leaker Evan Blass. It seems like the event could be a big one, as Blass tweeted a long thread with GIFs of two new Galaxy foldables, a new Galaxy FE phone, two new Galaxy Watches, and even a set of new Galaxy Buds. He also says the event is set to take place &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734346138300423"&gt;one month from now on August 11th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqej9"&gt;First up, the foldables. Blass has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;already leaked&lt;/a&gt; what appear to be official renders of the rumored Galaxy Z Fold 3 (which could support the S Pen stylus) and Galaxy Z Flip 3, but the new GIFs he shared give looks at both devices at all angles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLbvNC"&gt;Here’s the Z Fold 3, which Blass shared GIFs of in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734357328699396"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734368472932353"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734378996371456"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6izswb"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oBafbK"&gt;And here’s the Z Flip 3, which Blass tweeted in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734389691953152"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734400420896768"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734410827046913"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734420817891330"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/cLlE0ot4fO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cLlE0ot4fO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734400420896768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jp100o"&gt;Blass’ thread also includes GIFs of what look to be the rumored Samsung Galaxy S21 FE in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734430577938432"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734440250093570"&gt;a yellow-ish gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734449896992771"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734459933958145"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;. The phone, if released, will likely be a mid-range version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;the S21&lt;/a&gt; and looks to take a lot of design inspiration from the Samsung flagship (like how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;S20 FE&lt;/a&gt; looked similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21172039/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-review-camera-5g-screen-android"&gt;the S20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzXdQR"&gt;Whether or not this phone is actually in production has been something of an open question; in June, in response to a report claiming Samsung had stopped production of the phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;Samsung said that&lt;/a&gt; “nothing has been determined regarding the alleged production suspension.” These GIFs from Blass might be a sign that the phone is a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yPJmT8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/ovz5bzR8me"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ovz5bzR8me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734440250093570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mzQagF"&gt;But Blass didn’t just share GIFs of phones — he also tweeted GIFs of two new Samsung watches. One model seems to match closely with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;rumors of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic&lt;/a&gt;, with what appears to be a rotating bezel and two buttons on the right side. The watch, which Blass tweeted in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734469920509952"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734479907151873"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734490271322114"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt;, is also expected to run &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;Google and Samsung’s new smartwatch platform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TdDWiU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/A090015v7k"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A090015v7k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734479907151873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uSPP4H"&gt;The other watch shared by Blass appears to match &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;rumors of the Galaxy Watch Active 4&lt;/a&gt;. This watch doesn’t look to have a rotating bezel, and according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1407653639011905539"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.giznext.com/news/giznext-exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-5k-renders-details/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GizNext&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it might come in two different sizes: 44mm and 40mm. Blass shared GIFs of the watch in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734503168741380"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734516322144257"&gt;dark green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734530045915137"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734543111163906"&gt;peach&lt;/a&gt;, and two tweets of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734555039805443"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734567089950721"&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; (though I can’t tell the difference between them besides what’s shown on the screen). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z2PZ7z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/Ej15bzU6nE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ej15bzU6nE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734516322144257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3kBPt5"&gt;Blass’ GIF thread also reveals three colors of unannounced Galaxy Buds that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;match rumors about the Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, which, according to leaker Ice Universe, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1412399234419023875"&gt;will have active noice cancelation&lt;/a&gt;. Blass’ GIFs show the buds and the inside of the white case in gray, purple, and white, matching the style of a leaked render &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-official-renders-design-colours-exclusive/"&gt;shared by &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that showed green, black, and white bud / inner case combos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JpGAqU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/zt54JopQzc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zt54JopQzc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734590846492674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RmpeuP"&gt;Finally, let’s talk quickly about that rumored date, August 11th, which to me seems like the one you might want to circle on your calendar. When Samsung showed off its smartwatch platform developed with Google at the end of June, it said there would be an Unpacked event “&lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/mwc-2021-samsung-presents-new-watch-experience-with-a-sneak-peek-of-one-ui-watch"&gt;later this summer&lt;/a&gt;,” so August 11th would fall in that timeline. And the company has hosted summer Unpacked events in early August for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/9/17665284/samsung-galaxy-note-9-watch-bixby-home-speaker-news-unpacked-event-2018"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20754898/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-5g-book-s-pen-unpacked-event-2019-biggest-announcements-news-recap"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21350066/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-note-20-event-biggest-announcements-products-recap"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;, meaning August 11th wouldn’t be out of the usual pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuHLqO"&gt;Since Samsung hasn’t officially announced any of these products or the date of the event, there’s always the chance that what Blass leaked doesn’t actually come out. But given Blass’ past track record and the detail of the GIFs he shared, it seems possible he may well have revealed some of the biggest news from Samsung’s next Unpacked event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The search is over: smart trackers from Apple, Samsung, and Tile compared</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s never been easier to keep track of your keys&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Yn4hTB"&gt;This year will go down in history as the year we entered the golden age of Not Losing Your Stuff. Well, in addition to some other historic milestones, somewhere in the top 100 hits of the year will be the introduction of smart tracker tags from two major mobile device manufacturers: Samsung and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LL5zg"&gt;Tracking tags have been around for a while now, and Tile has been the best-known brand in the space. With new options from the two most popular US phone manufacturers entering the picture, tracking tags may be poised to go mainstream. If you’re thinking of picking one up but unsure where to start, then you’re in the right place. We tried out three top tracking tags — the Samsung SmartTag Plus, Apple AirTag, and Tile Pro — to see how they compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXXOP8"&gt;First, a word about the very real privacy concerns about these tracking devices. Since their introduction, critics have noted that they could all too easily be used as tools for stalkers, since they’re easy to hide in someone’s bag or car. These concerns were amplified when Apple’s AirTags arrived, given how ubiquitous Apple’s Find My network is. Apple built in certain anti-stalking safety measures at launch, but &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-thing-about-apples-airtags-is-also-the-scaries-1846786338"&gt;reporters quickly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/05/apple-airtags-stalking/"&gt;identified ways&lt;/a&gt; that these safeguards fell short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CXhCa4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With new options from the two most popular US phone manufacturers, tracking tags may be poised to go mainstream&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2AwmYL"&gt;The company has addressed some issues, like shortening the length of time before an AirTag will sound an alert when it’s separated from its owner, and is working on an app that will allow Android users to find unwanted AirTags near them. But some potential for misuse will remain even with more safety measures in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="au3ILG"&gt;Apple (justifiably) attracts more scrutiny for its safety practices given the size and effectiveness of its tracking network, but it’s hardly alone in its somewhat reactive attitude toward stalking concerns. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22392924/samsung-smartags-tracker-bixby-privacy-smartthings"&gt;Samsung introduced a SmartThings app feature&lt;/a&gt; that scans for unfamiliar SmartTags, and Tile says it’s working on a similar feature. It doesn’t help that these devices more or less live inside their own manufacturer’s walled garden — a unified, cross-platform approach is sorely needed. Anyway, it’s illegal (and highly immoral) to track someone without their knowledge, so don’t do it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayjCuN"&gt;Per usual, adding new tech to your life involves more terms and conditions to agree to. However, in this case you may have already accepted them when you set up your Apple or Samsung phone. Tile’s app, which you must download to use the Pro, presents its own separate set of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetileapp.com%2Fen-us%2Fterms-of-service&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pfRRvwHF0x2ZIq0H7G1fIytsSkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702210/ajohnson_210702_4659_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tile has been the best-known brand in the tracking tag space until now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vB8PcA"&gt;Personal trackers are nothing new — GPS and cellular options have been around for quite some time, and offer more precise, real-time location tracking. They also tend to come with a higher price tag, recurring subscription or wireless data fees, and require more battery power. This newer class of Bluetooth trackers are more practical for most people, with battery life measured in months rather than days and smaller, keyring-friendly form factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhiUx0"&gt;Essentially, the three tags compared here all do the same thing. Pair it to your phone, attach it to something you want to keep track of, and you’re ready to go. When the tracker is within Bluetooth range of your phone, you can have the tag play a sound to help locate it. All three devices support out-of-range finding with their own particular device user networks, and they all include the same kind of user-replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlEXn2"&gt;Their main difference is whether or not they include AR-assisted finding by way of Ultra Wideband (UWB) connectivity: the Samsung and Apple tags have this and the Tile Pro does not. To take advantage of the AR feature, you’ll need a phone with UWB; on the Apple side that’s an iPhone 11 or newer, and for Samsung it’s a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, Z Fold 2, S21 Plus, or S21 Ultra. There are also compatibility differences: Apple’s tracker only works with iOS devices and Samsung’s only works with Galaxy devices (no, you can’t register it through the SmartThings iOS app, I tried), whereas Tile works on both iOS and Android.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OMzWKLcxkNQ7oNoAy-D1TFh941U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702209/ajohnson_210702_4659_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTag is the least expensive of the bunch, but without a built-in keyring hole you may need to buy a holder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KkUjYi"&gt;Apple AirTag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="K8LyRt"&gt;The AirTag comes in just one flavor: a small, $29 disc shape. It’s the only one of the three to include an official IP67 rating, meaning it can survive a dunk in a bit of water. It also allows you to store your contact information so it can be read by any phone with NFC (near-field communication) — even Android phones. Setup is dead simple — just bring the tag near your iPhone and you’ll be prompted to pair the two. It’s also a little less expensive than the other two, but there’s no hole built in, so if you want to attach it to a set of keys you’ll need to pay a little more to add a holder. (We don’t really recommend drilling a hole into it, though &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FHow%2Bto%2BDrill%2Ba%2BKeyring%2BHole%2Bin%2Ban%2BAirTag%2F143068&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit has a guide&lt;/a&gt; if you insist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S0KD9T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644655"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OP3rsJ"&gt;When it’s outside the Bluetooth range of your phone, the AirTag taps into the massive network of iPhone devices using Find My to provide an approximate location. This is a huge benefit, especially in the US where iPhones abound. As long as your item is in a place with &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, it will likely be “seen” by an iPhone nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XmpgHp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As long as your item is in a place with &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, it will likely be “seen” by an iPhone nearby&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkECyk"&gt;In-range, AR-assisted finding does a good job of tracking down an object that’s out of sight. A big, easy-to-follow arrow appears on screen when the signal is strong enough (you’ll be prompted with a vague message to move around if you’re too far for a strong signal) and guides you in the right direction. I had no problem locating a tag under a couch cushion in my house. It would be helpful if the “weak signal” message indicated if the signal got stronger as you move around (Samsung’s AR finding does this) but that’s my only complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0q41aP"&gt;If you’d like to altogether avoid the headache of leaving something behind, Apple is adding a separation alert feature in iOS 15 that may help. Once set up, it will send a notification if it detects that your iPhone (and by extension, you) have gone out of range and left it behind. Tile also offers this feature with its Premium subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Zu4DCPNye2enQZo0XfHl_FbQL0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702211/ajohnson_210702_4659_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmartTag Plus includes AR-assisted finding for objects in close range.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="07bZ8a"&gt;Samsung SmartTag Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dHJGkw"&gt;The $39 SmartTag Plus is Samsung’s UWB-equipped tag; there’s also a non-UWB version for $10 less. The SmartTag Plus offers broadly similar Bluetooth-range finding and AR-assist as the AirTag, with a few differences. AR finding mode provides a view through the phone’s camera with guiding arrows that appear on the screen, which is a little more helpful than Apple’s arrow-only guide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="doXMn8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644672"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDi1au"&gt;You can also use the button on a SmartTag as a kind of remote starter for smart home automations if you’re invested in Samsung’s SmartThings ecosystem. On the downside, the SmartTag has the shortest battery life rating of the three trackers compared here: up to 165 days (less than six months) compared to about a year for the Tile and Apple options. SmartTags don’t offer separation alerts at the moment either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QZmIv6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the SmartTag gave me an accurate enough location that I could have driven up I-5 myself and located the tag&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yBoLCQ"&gt;Out-of-range, the SmartTag Plus relies on other Galaxy devices that have chosen to participate in Samsung’s Galaxy Find network — Galaxy phone users aren’t opted in by default, and need to give consent in the SmartThings app. Samsung says that as of April 2021, there were &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745743505176533597" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more than 70 million “helper devices” participating globally&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapples-find-my-network-now-offers-new-third-party-finding-experiences%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple counts hundreds of millions of users&lt;/a&gt; in its Find My network. There are simply fewer people in the US with Galaxy phones than iPhones, so it can’t quite compete with the AirTag, but that’s a moot point anyway since nobody is likely to be comparison shopping between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2tdm2"&gt;Experiences will vary — more so than with an AirTag — but at least in the northern suburbs of Seattle, there were enough Galaxy Find users out and about to track a tag on a cross-town journey with multiple stops. Knowing the actual location of the object, er, spouse who agreed to let me track him, the SmartTag did identify his position accurately at two of three stops. It only returned a location a couple of times when he was on the interstate getting to his destination, but in a fairly busy business park and at a restaurant, the SmartTag gave me an accurate enough location that I could have driven up I-5 myself and located the tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eNM85lo7N16YWsKU7QsiGNbEksk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702206/ajohnson_210702_4659_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tile’s tags work with both iOS and Android devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="quRzYe"&gt;Tile Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6mesvM"&gt;Tile has been the tracking tag category heavyweight of the last few years — at least until Samsung and Apple showed up. The Pro is the company’s highest-specced model at $34, with a bigger Bluetooth range (400 feet) and a louder maximum ring volume than other current Tile tags. There’s no Ultra Wideband here, and thus no AR-assisted finding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yAgNuq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="btTY78"&gt;Separation alerts are available as part of Tile’s $29/year Premium subscription, but all of the essential features are included with your Tile tag purchase, including out-of-range finding. This “community find” feature relies on other Tile users — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424837/tile-amazon-sidewalk-support-release-date-2021-bluetooth-tracking-airtags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as of June 14th, Amazon’s Sidewalk network&lt;/a&gt; — the way Samsung and Apple’s trackers rely on other Galaxy phones and iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WzYkQ"&gt;Even with help from Sidewalk, the Tile Pro’s peer-location network seems to lag behind Samsung and Apple’s. On the same journey up I-5 that the SmartTag Plus took, the Tile Pro returned a location ping less frequently, and only got one of the stops on the trip precisely right (it was close but across the street on another one) where the SmartTag was accurate on two locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mUmqjJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even with help from Sidewalk, the Tile Pro’s peer-location network seems to lag behind Samsung and Apple’s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8OJlei"&gt;This was honestly a better performance than I was expecting, though Seattle probably has more than its usual share of Sidewalk-supporting Amazon devices for obvious reasons. Even if it’s an atypical result, it’s fair to say that the community find feature would work well enough to tell you that you really &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; lose something, even if it’s less likely that you’ll be able to hunt down its exact location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbsdOV"&gt;I do have one minor complaint to lodge against the Tile app: the subscription upsell. A couple of app menus include features that are only available with the Premium plan, and tapping them brings up a page prompting you to start a free trial to access them. I expect to see those kinds of things during setup, or if I’m using a free app like Strava, but it’s a little annoying from something I’ve already paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlbF1T"&gt;Tile also offers its trackers in a couple of different form factors, including a wallet-friendly Slim version and a small adhesive-backed Sticker tag. There are plenty of third-party cases and holders for AirTags in particular if you want to adapt it for different objects, but you can’t buy an AirTag or a SmartTag in a fundamentally different shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="btAqHr"&gt;AirTag or Tile Pro?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XqsNHq"&gt;If you have an iPhone, there’s a very simple answer to this question: just get the AirTag. The Apple Find My network is so extensive (at least in the US) that you’ll have the best chance of tracking down something the tag is attached to. Maybe there’s an exception to this recommendation if you really want Tile’s subscription features or mix of form factors, but by and large this is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RWH2Kx"&gt;SmartTag Plus or Tile Pro?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pbD9SM"&gt;If you have a Samsung phone you’ll probably be better off with the SmartTag Plus. The Galaxy Find network isn’t as robust as Apple’s, but it’s still ahead of Tile’s. If you already use smart home devices in Samsung’s SmartThings network, then there’s even more reason to choose SmartTag since it can act as a remote control for automations. The shorter battery life is a shame and the lack of separation notifications stinks, so if those are sticking points you could consider the Tile Pro. Otherwise, the SmartTag Plus (or non-UWB version, depending on your phone) is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YS3j0F"&gt;Tile or… ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FHfboY"&gt;If you don’t have an iPhone or a Galaxy device, your choice is between the Tile Pro and… everything else. Tile’s out-of-range network can’t compete with the number of devices Samsung and Apple have in our pockets, but it seems to be getting a healthy boost from Sidewalk, and can only get better as more people add Echo and Ring devices to their homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="7nh3V8"&gt;If community finding features are less important, &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en/pages/products" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chipolo is worth a look&lt;/a&gt;. We didn’t test it in this batch, but it does include separation notifications without an annual fee. Overall, the Tile Pro feels like a good compromise between paying for something more expensive and power-intensive like a cellular tracker, or a more basic, Bluetooth-only tracker. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC listing suggests Google’s midrange Pixel 5A 5G could arrive soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pixel 4A 5G. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1vItYDZyWz3VU7JuzK7brdMDv_c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69560207/akrales_201013_4137_0244.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year’s Pixel 4A 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jhqppv"&gt;The Pixel 5A 5G, Google’s midrange counterpart to last year’s Pixel 5, has been spotted in the &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;amp;calledFromFrame=Y&amp;amp;application_id=oAxfJo9QrxqKKX41nUtsiA%3D%3D&amp;amp;fcc_id=A4RG1F8F"&gt;FCC’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;amp;calledFromFrame=Y&amp;amp;application_id=oAxfJo9QrxqKKX41nUtsiA%3D%3D&amp;amp;fcc_id=A4RG4S1M"&gt;database&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting a release might not be far away. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/08/pixel-5a-makes-a-stop-at-the-fcc-before-heading-to-your-pocket/#disqus_thread"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which first saw the two listings, reports that none specifically mention the name “Pixel 5A” but that at least one of the three model numbers (GR0M2) lines up with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1372276648784060426"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;barely announced&lt;/a&gt; phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwUsjO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; speculates that one of the models (G1F8F) is the version of the phone destined for release in the US based on its wireless frequency bands, but reports that this version doesn’t offer support for mmWave 5G networks. In contrast, the Pixel 4A 5G offered mmWave support when used with compatible carriers. The other two models could be the phone’s international versions&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Nh1UQI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s expected to be powered by a Snapdragon 765G&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PxxJmC"&gt;Otherwise the listings don’t offer many new details compared to what’s already been rumored about the phone. The Pixel 5a will reportedly be powered by a &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/21/google-pixel-5a-5g-chip/"&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G&lt;/a&gt; processor, will be equipped with a &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/22/google-pixel-5a-renders-leak/"&gt;6.2-inch OLED 1080p display&lt;/a&gt;, and will include a headphone jack like Google’s previous A-series Pixels. Two rear cameras are expected — a main camera and an ultrawide — based on the recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403350/pixel-5a-leaked-camera-sample-ultrawide-12-2-megapixel-f-2-2-exif-data"&gt;leak of an ultrawide camera shot&lt;/a&gt; apparently taken by the unreleased phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uTanV"&gt;The big question now is when we’ll see Google officially detail the phone beyond simply confirming it exists. When it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;pre-announced the phone earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; in response to rumors it had been cancelled, Google didn’t give an exact release date, and merely said it would be coming “later this year.” It would also only officially confirm a release in the US and Japan but, as &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; notes, it would be strange to produce two international versions of the handset if Japan is the only non-US market for the device. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s $1,500 smartphone is for its biggest fans with more money than sense</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XGI-NKPrdzpQ8oC1JiKE3Hhh9Jc=/159x0:1794x1090/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69558412/Screen_Shot_2021_07_08_at_4.32.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nHjlp0"&gt;Qualcomm — the company behind the Snapdragon processors and modems that power almost every major Android smartphone — is &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/snapdragoninsiders/news-forums/get-ready-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-designed-you-mind"&gt;making its own phone&lt;/a&gt;. Or rather, the company is partnering with Asus on a custom device officially called the “&lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/snapdragoninsiders/smartphone"&gt;Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders&lt;/a&gt;,” a $1,500 phone that’s designed to showcase the chip company’s technology. And, as the name suggests, Qualcomm will be selling the phone directly to members of its &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2021/03/01/welcome-snapdragon-insiders-our-new-community-tech-enthusiasts-who-deserve"&gt;Snapdragon Insider fan community&lt;/a&gt;, which Qualcomm launched earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iV2uV2"&gt;It’s an interesting idea, but unfortunately, the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders doesn’t look like it does anything different, when it comes to actually taking advantage of Qualcomm’s technology, than any other Android flagship — which is particularly disappointing given the $1,500 price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7lcXyO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A standard flagship spec sheet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wd5udE"&gt;The spec sheet here follows with what you’d expect from a flagship Android phone in 2021: the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders runs Android 11, has 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, a 6.78-inch, 144Hz Samsung OLED panel with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335252/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-drop-scratch-resistant-apple-samsung"&gt;Gorilla Glass Victus&lt;/a&gt;, and a rear fingerprint scanner (using Qualcomm’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223494/qualcomm-ultrasonic-fingerprint-reader-samsung-galaxy-s21-announcement"&gt;3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; technology, of course.) If any of that sounds familiar, it’s likely because the new Qualcomm-branded device seems to share a lot in common with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Asus’ ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piIxCu"&gt;The processor, naturally, is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888, which feels like a curious choice given that the company has already announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550723/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-cpu-ai-performance-mwc-2021"&gt;more powerful 888 Plus model&lt;/a&gt;. Given the mammoth price tag and the promise of being an ultimate Qualcomm phone, it’s an odd miss for the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UopcG9"&gt;The battery offers 4,000 mAh of power, and isn’t the biggest we’ve seen in a smartphone, but it does support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/27/21340587/qualcomm-quick-charge-5-standard-usb-c-pd-pps-battery-fast-phones"&gt;Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 5 standard&lt;/a&gt;, although not at its full potential, maxing out at 65W for charging, not the 100W-plus speeds the spec is theoretically capable of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsM1w1"&gt;The back of the phone features a triple camera setup, with familiar parts from other Asus phones. The main camera features a Sony IMX686 64-megapixel image sensor — the same found in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21408307/asus-zenfone-7-pro-review"&gt;last year’s Zenfone 7 Pro&lt;/a&gt; — while the ultrawide sensor uses an older 12-megapixel Sony IMX363 sensor (also used in previous Asus phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496686/pixel-5-camera-comparison-sensor-specs-features"&gt;as well as multiple Google Pixel phones&lt;/a&gt;.) Lastly, there’s an 8-megapixel telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom to round out the camera setup, and a 24-megapixel front-facing camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcLaBA"&gt;Qualcomm is promising that the triple camera array will offer a “professional-quality camera” experience, but it won’t push the Spectra 580’s triple ISP to its limit, either. While the phone can shoot 8K at 30 frames per second, and 4K at 30 or 60FPS, it can’t manage shooting three simultaneous 4K HDR video streams or shoot three 28-megapixel photos at once — two of the biggest claims Qualcomm made when it introduced the Snapdragon 888 last December. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yVZKo8hdlQ2E-9-aBJOKu3A62wY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706881/e_BF3KMUZWs_HD.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UJN7QL"&gt;The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders will be one of the first phones to offer Qualcomm’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313214/qualcomm-snapdragon-sound-announced-high-res-audio"&gt;new Snapdragon Sound classification&lt;/a&gt;, which promises hi-fi music playback at up to 24-bit 96kHz. Qualcomm is also including some Master &amp;amp; Dynamic earbuds in the box to help take advantage of that; what appears to be a pair of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2Fproducts%2Fmw08-active-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earphones&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F8%2F22568641%2Fqualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-technology" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MW08 earbuds&lt;/a&gt; with a Snapdragon logo on them. (Those headphones sell for $299 usually, which may help ease the sting of the $1,499 price tag here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpwYlp"&gt;Another area that the Snapdragon-branded phone might stand out is with 5G support. Qualcomm boasts that the phone will offer “the most comprehensive support for all key 5G sub-6 and mmWavebands and combinations in a single device.” There’s also support for Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IlymJ5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An expensive option for Qualcomm fans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M3jnUc"&gt;In addition to the phone and headphones, Qualcomm is also including a 65W Quick Charge 5.0 charge, USB-C to USB-C and USB-C to USB-A cables, and a rubber bumper for the phone. But even with all that, the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders looks like a tough sell — there are plenty of top-tier Android phones that offer the same (or better) specs for far less money, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="klyo7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra review: the real deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bmCphp"&gt;It’s not even particularly successful at its main job as a Qualcomm showcase: the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders doesn’t feature the company’s latest and greatest processor, and doesn’t push Qualcomm’s technology further than any other major Android phone. Sure, it does have a glowing Snapdragon logo on the back, but that hardly seems worth the premium Qualcomm is asking its most enthusiastic fans to pay here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pjg0mk"&gt;The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders will be available this August in the US, China, UK, and Germany to start, with launches for more regions in the works. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Startup Halo will bring driverless car service to Las Vegas later this year on T-Mobile 5G</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQ4bVX2CCwAEhHYpxBXBIULu4AQ=/0x23:3000x2023/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557369/21CM0192_05_060221_1040v2m_sm.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo says it will use remote drivers to operate its vehicles over T-Mobile 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GdySA9"&gt;Driverless car startup Halo has announced a new service coming to Las Vegas later this year: a fleet of remotely operated electric vehicles, using T-Mobile’s 5G network. It’s potentially a big step toward fulfilling the promise of 5G remote driver tech, with a significant catch: the cars don’t operate &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; on T-Mobile 5G. While it’s the primary network they’ll use (mid- and low-band 5G, specifically, with LTE as a fallback), they will also rely on other networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pWiKV"&gt;The idea is simple enough: Halo employs remote drivers to operate the vehicles, delivering them to waiting customers who then get behind the wheel and take the car to their destination. When the trip has ended, the car moves on to its next pick-up under remote control. Halo is also currently operating test drives with safety drivers in vehicles, which it says it won’t include when the service launches for paying customers. That’s easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xag8xZ"&gt;There’s no shortage of driverless and autonomous vehicle pilot programs in Las Vegas; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17718018/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-cars-las-vegas-5000-trips"&gt;Lyft has operated a driverless taxi service&lt;/a&gt; in the city, and more recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22291682/motional-fully-driverless-autonomous-cars-las-vegas"&gt;Motional has been testing autonomous rides&lt;/a&gt; without a backup driver behind the wheel. Halo’s service is a little different, using a remote driver, along with an “Advanced Safe Stop” mechanism to automatically bring the car to a halt if a hazard is detected. The company says that ultimately it hopes to achieve full autonomy, and that in the meantime its vehicles are designed to “learn” from their human operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UW4YRK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"I took a gamble by riding in a self-driving Lyft in Las Vegas","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16860590/self-driving-lyft-las-vegas-ces-2018"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="f66CMo"&gt;Fully remote driverless vehicles have been one of the promises of 5G, and it’s a use case that actually demands the speed and low latency that 5G connectivity is capable of delivering. But in the US, at least, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;our networks just haven’t met the bar yet&lt;/a&gt; to make it a reality. This new service is a step in the right direction, but it seems we’re not quite at full 5G remote operation yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zlq7l"&gt;It won’t exactly be a widespread service at first, either. Halo says that it will operate in “urban parts of the Las Vegas Valley” at launch and doesn’t disclose how large of an area it will cover, just that it plans to later expand to more parts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phRERG"&gt;Oh, and it’s probably a coincidence, but Las Vegas is also set to be the stage for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;Dish Network’s first 5G rollout&lt;/a&gt; this summer, a venture that T-Mobile is supposed to be helping to facilitate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134278/sprint-tmobile-merger-court-ruling-opinion-decision-explainer-carriers-antitrust"&gt;per its Sprint acquisition deal&lt;/a&gt;. If T-Mobile’s 5G network can indeed support a fleet of remotely operated vehicles, it’ll be thanks in part to the addition of Sprint’s spectrum. Before we get carried away by the possibilities of driverless cars, let’s spare a thought for the fourth wireless carrier we’re still missing.&lt;/p&gt;
