    <title>Here’s everything we know about the new OnePlus phones coming Tuesday</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3I8qce"&gt;OnePlus has an upcoming event on March 23rd, where it’ll be formally announcing the OnePlus 9, and OnePlus 9 Pro. As with any smartphone event these days, there’s a ton of information about what will be revealed at the event, thanks in no small part to OnePlus itself doling out pieces of news over the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VbxpkT"&gt;Confirmed by OnePlus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WmyBTC"&gt;OnePlus has been in the habit lately of trying to build up suspense for its events, which is why you see it and its executives just tweeting out information about the phones. Here’s what we’ve learned from them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8N3qvy"&gt;Chargers? In the box&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kgVwo9"&gt;OnePlus’s CEO, Pete Lau, has confirmed on a forum post that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319657/oneplus-9-charger-in-box-pete-lau-announcement"&gt;will be including a charger in the box&lt;/a&gt; with the 9-series phones, instead of going the route that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225930/samsung-galaxy-s21-no-charger-brick-headphones-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; have taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BKDz3r"&gt;The Pro will have 50W wireless charging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6LSMRg"&gt;OnePlus has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22099073"&gt;let &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;try the 9 Pro’s 50W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;, and it is indeed fast, charging the phone from 1 to 100% in 43 minutes. If you prefer charging with a cable, both the Pro and regular 9 will support 65W wired charging as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3IqcIH"&gt;OnePlus has already shown off the design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3qPDX1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/oneplus-says-screw-it-heres-the-oneplus-9-pro-photos-from-every-angle"&gt;Input has a collection&lt;/a&gt; of all the images that OnePlus has posted of the 9 Pro on Twitter, and there’s not a ton left to the imagination. It does, in fact, look like a smartphone, with USB-C port on the bottom, and a camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_J0Z-X41ti1g5WJVCjBt0YCtB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22377986/1_M00_22_12_rB8bwmBQEOWACzO_AAZ7LBXLBP0204.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hasselblad branding and a variety of lenses. The 9 is on the left, the 9 Pro on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Zo1q43"&gt;OnePlus is focusing on cameras&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9nfFNG"&gt;We know that the legendary camera company Hasselblad will be working on &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-9-exclusive-ceo-pete-lau-on-its-new-camera-and-whats-next"&gt;providing “color expertise” for the phones’ cameras&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus has been dropping subtle hints about the collaboration, like centering its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306934/oneplus-9-launch-event-date-moonshot-pete-lau"&gt;marketing material around the moon&lt;/a&gt; (when Apollo astronauts went to the moon, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise"&gt;they took Hasselblad cameras&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/oneplus-says-screw-it-heres-the-oneplus-9-pro-photos-from-every-angle"&gt;releasing pictures of the phones&lt;/a&gt;, which have the word “Hasselblad” written on the camera modules. And having a Hasselblad section on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Flaunch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F18%2F22334396%2Foneplus-9-march-23rd-event-rumor-announcement-roundup-smartwatch-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the phone’s launch page&lt;/a&gt;. Okay, maybe it’s not so subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2t2j5X"&gt;When it comes to the capabilities of those cameras, we can look at an &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-9-exclusive-ceo-pete-lau-on-its-new-camera-and-whats-next"&gt;interview Pete Lau did with &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He talks about the phones working with Sony to make a custom IMX789 sensor (something he’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369304680241762311"&gt;also tweeted about&lt;/a&gt;), and mentions that they will be capable of shooting 4K at 120FPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsIHrY"&gt;What the camera capabilities of the 9 Pro versus the regular 9 are will probably have to wait for the official announcement — but the pictures released by OnePlus show that the Pro seems to have four cameras, where the regular only has three. As with past OnePlus phones, at least one of the cameras &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369304680241762311"&gt;will be an ultra-wide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="T3LZsr"&gt;Of course, the phones will be 5G-capable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YLd2pZ"&gt;The OnePlus 8 series had 5G, and the 9 series will too, as indicated by the “5G” superscript on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1371400783950970881"&gt;OnePlus’s announcement images&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2vdq5B"&gt;There will be a smartwatch launched as well&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xYowLD"&gt;OnePlus has already released a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1372170855661330436?s=20"&gt;teaser video of the device&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/17/oneplus-watch-wear-os-confirmed/"&gt;confirmed that it won’t be running Google’s Wear OS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vXVuXF"&gt;The phones will use the Snapdragon 888&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VUJYho"&gt;OnePlus is continuing its tradition of including Qualcomm’s flagship-class processor, according to tweets &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1372193579674841090?s=20"&gt;from Pete Lau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1372140664868208643?s=20"&gt;the OnePlus account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hXzd1h"&gt;What we know about the displays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FqInCT"&gt;Pete Lau also tweeted out most of the details about the 9 Pro’s display:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jQovJ1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just the rundown: &lt;br&gt;LTPO&lt;br&gt;QHD+ &lt;br&gt;Smart 120Hz &lt;br&gt;Native 10-bit color depth (1.07 billion colors)&lt;br&gt;1300 nits&lt;br&gt;MEMC&lt;br&gt;HDR10+&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Lau (@PeteLau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1371817947694514176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aam7r6"&gt;LTPO displays &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;can run at different refresh rates&lt;/a&gt; depending on the content being displayed, meaning that the OnePlus 9 screens should be able to sip power when displaying static images, but still provide smooth animations &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1371830276926668801?s=20"&gt;at 120Hz when you’re actually using the phone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; has already seen &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/exclusive-first-test-results-of-the-radical-oneplus-9-pro-display"&gt;in-depth testing results&lt;/a&gt; from the Pro’s screen, showing its power usage, and 360Hz touch-polling rate, which should lead to improved responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71ix5v"&gt;Also new to the Pro is a 10-bit display which should, in theory, show colors more accurately. Otherwise, it’s packing many of the same features as the screen on the OnePlus 8 Pro, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"&gt;is not a complaint&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, unless you don’t like big screens — &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/exclusive-first-test-results-of-the-radical-oneplus-9-pro-display"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Pro’s display is 6.7 inches, the same size as an iPhone Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UOnjXq"&gt;Colors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="almzN5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1371400783950970881"&gt;We’ve officially seen&lt;/a&gt; the Pro’s Morning Mist (silver) and regular OnePlus 9’s Winter Mist (purple) colors, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="456Leu"&gt;Left to the Imagination (and leaks)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="u71pvB"&gt;... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323979/oneplus-9-pro-leak-images-hasselblad-camera"&gt;there have also been leaks showing off other colors&lt;/a&gt;, like a forest green on the Pro, and a blue for the regular OnePlus 9. And, of course, there are black versions of each phone as well (I anxiously await to see if OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230934/samsung-galaxy-s21-phantom-black-phone-color"&gt;makes a big deal about it in the presentation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IB9KKz"&gt;The Regular 9 will have a (slightly) smaller screen than the Pro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QE1Lvf"&gt;While OnePlus officially shared the Pro’s screen size with &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, the details of the regular 9 weren’t mentioned. &lt;a href="http://www.slashleaks.com/l/oneplus-9-key-specs-leaked-through-aida64"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slashleaks&lt;/em&gt; indicates&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be 6.55 inches, and have a slightly lower resolution of 1080 x 2400, as opposed to the 1440 x 3216 reported for the Pro by &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eF2bOf"&gt;A third phone?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5Vdj7q"&gt;There are also rumors of a third phone, which may be called the 9R or the 9 Lite. &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-lite-snapdragon-865-will-launch-alongside-oneplus-9-9-pro"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports that it may have a stepped-down, Snapdragon 865 processor, but apart from that not much else is known. Will it actually happen? We’ll have to see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tm7ffh"&gt;
&lt;p id="IkhucV"&gt;It seems that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau"&gt;its CEO&lt;/a&gt; are going to be posting more details on Twitter during the lead-up to the event, but at this point it seems like we’ve got a good outline of what the phones will be like. Now, it’s just waiting until the 23rd, at 10AM ET, to have the details filled in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS developer who drew attention to App Store scams is now suing Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8VOytbQjhwM4pNFyhhTl9_Tr0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986294/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Be9Nie"&gt;Mobile app developer Kosta Eleftheriou, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;publicly called out Apple earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for negligence with regard to policing iOS scams and copycat apps on the App Store, has filed a lawsuit against the iPhone maker in California. He’s accusing the company of exploiting its monopoly power over iOS apps “to make billions of dollars in profits at the expense of small application developers and consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6IHJA"&gt;Eleftheriou’s company KPAW LLC, which he co-owns with his partner Ashley Eleftheriou, filed its complaint in Santa Clara County on Wednesday. It details the development and release timeline of Eleftheriou’s Apple Watch keyboard app FlickType. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jIZ8V"&gt;At the time he began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;accusing Apple of abetting App Store scams&lt;/a&gt; early last month, Eleftheriou revealed that his FlickType app had been targeted by competing software he says either didn’t work well or didn’t work at all, and yet nonetheless chipped away at this sales and App Store rankings through false advertising and the purchase of fake reviews. After he complained, he said Apple did not do enough to combat the scams, though Apple did later remove some of the apps he called attention to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bTOuKZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The App Store has a big problem &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You: an honest developer, working hard to improve your IAP conversions.&lt;br&gt;Your competitor: a $2M/year scam running rampant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/ &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iCwzu7"&gt;Eleftheriou’s claims join a chorus of growing complaints against Apple and the App Store. Some developers, competing tech companies, regulators, and now state lawmakers have accused the mobile marketplace of being a monopoly in software distribution that harms competition and keeps consumers paying higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SngFHz"&gt;Epic Games, the maker of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;targeting both Apple and Google with antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; over the removal of the battle royale game last summer for use of an alternative in-app payment system. Meanwhile, a group of app makers, ranging from Epic to Spotify to Tinder parent company Match Group, have begun lobbying state lawmakers to take up the fight against the App Store and Google Play Store, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;surprising success so far in Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and numerous other bills around the country in the works, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mff1OQ"&gt;In the complaint, Eleftheriou goes further into detail about what he claims is wrongful behavior from Apple, including alleged false advertising, breach of its developer agreement, and fraud. One notable claim involves Apple trying to acquire FlickType, after which Eleftheriou says he faced “roadblock after roadblock” to selling his software on the App Store. The complaint suggests Apple chose not to take action on scam and copycat apps in an effort to force Eleftheriou to sell his app to Apple. “Evidently, Apple thought Plaintiff would simply give up and sell its application to Apple at a discount,” the complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cakQJk"&gt;At the heart of the dispute appears to be conversations Eleftheriou had with an Apple executive Randy Marsden, who led mobile keyboard technology at the company and later held the position of Text Input Special Projects Manager. Marsden is well known in the tech industry for co-founding the keyboard technology startup Swype, and for later co-founding the app Dryft, which was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/apple-quietly-bought-dryft-a-keyboard-app/"&gt;acquired by Apple in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The acquisition resulted in Marsden being put in charge of the iOS keyboard at Apple from 2014 to 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MGygaY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple systematically flexes its monopoly muscle against potential competition through the App Store”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G8H2CO"&gt;Eleftheriou says he was approached by Marsden, who expressed interest in having Apple acquire his software to improve typing on the Apple Watch. Yet, the negotiations went quiet, and afterward, Eleftheriou claims Apple removed his FlickType keyboard app and refused to approve future versions as well as a note-taking variant, on what he thinks are suspicious grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mu2UYd"&gt;Only later did Apple permit both apps after months of appeals and after Eleftheriou let countless other app makers integrate his technology. Those apps using the FlickType tech were approved without issue, the complaint says. Meanwhile, many other wearable and mobile keyboard apps Eleftheriou characterizes as scams were also approved and allowed on the App Store. “By this time, Apple’s wrongful rejections had already cost Plaintiff over a year of revenue,” the complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="462hBJ"&gt;Eleftheriou’s complaint says this is evidence of Apple “flexing its monopoly muscle against potential competition”: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="z21d1N"&gt;Apple entices software application developers like Plaintiff to develop innovative applications with the promise of a fair and secure App Store in which to sell them. In truth, Apple systematically flexes its monopoly muscle against potential competition through the App Store and profits from rampant fraudulent practices. If Apple cannot buy a desired application from a developer on the cheap, Apple attempts to crush that developer through exploitive fees and selective application of opaque and unreasonable constraints against the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXDx4A"&gt; At the same time, Apple permits other developers that Apple does not view as real competition, including scam competitors, to peddle similar, inferior products because Apple profits from their sales. Scammers oftentimes use screenshots and videos taken from legitimate developer’s applications and manipulate their ratings. Apple does little to police these practices because it profits from them. Apple then lies to its regulators by asserting that it must maintain its monopoly power over the sale of Apple-related applications to protect consumers, when, in fact, Apple lets them get ripped off and exploits the developers trying to deliver innovation to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="A9h9uq"&gt;Eleftheriou says even after his app became the No. 1 paid app on the App Store after it was approved, earning him $130,000 in its first month of release, he had to face down a wave of scam apps and copycat software that targeted FlickType after its visible success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oiHVGV"&gt;“Despite possessing massive resources and technological savvy, Apple intentionally fails to police these fraudsters, costing honest developers millions, and perhaps billions, while Apple continues to amass huge profits for itself,” the complaint reads. “Apple holds both its device users and developers hostage. Yet each time it faces antitrust claims, Apple justifies its monopoly by claiming it is necessary to protect its users and developers from unscrupulous conduct and ensure a fair competitive marketplace for the benefit of both. In truth, Apple turns a blind eye to rampant fraud and exploitation to make an easy profit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZuPiN"&gt;Eleftheriou is accusing Apple of false advertising, unfair competition in violation of California’s business and professions code, breach of good faith and fair dealing with regard to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, fraud, and negligence and negligent misrepresentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5H0Fr"&gt;Apple was not immediately available for comment.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 9 Pro supports seriously fast 50W wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dG01GnSbVB8Nosjmfthf-AFsIbo=/59x0:1942x1255/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986172/OP_charge_white.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With a new wireless charger, the OnePlus 9 Pro can charge in either portrait or landscape orientation.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OyFUhs"&gt;It’s not often that the actual spec is better than the rumor, but that’s the case here: the OnePlus 9 Pro supports 50W wireless charging — a little faster than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;45W rumor we reported on&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. We’ve been able to test drive this feature ahead of the phone’s official debut on March 23rd and can confirm: the 9 Pro offers really, really fast wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1udiA"&gt;OnePlus claims that the phone will charge wirelessly (with the new Warp Charge 50 charger) from 1 to 100 percent in 43 minutes, and our own testing confirmed this down to the minute. That’s a big boost over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;OnePlus 8 Pro’s 30W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;, which supplied a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes. The improvements aren’t limited to wireless charging, or the 9 Pro for that matter; the 9 and 9 Pro have 65W wired charging that takes the battery from empty to full in 29 minutes. While the base model OnePlus 9 doesn’t get those fast wireless speeds, it can be used with the new charger at up to 15W. Additionally, both the 9 and 9 Pro support standard Qi wireless charging at 15W.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6u9e5nAlDJmvfBFl4hiaOnAeuOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378643/OnePlus_9_Pro_Warp_Charge_50_Wireless_Dock_Dark.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Warp Charge 50 wireless charger now features a detachable cable based on user feedback.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2yw65a"&gt;Fast charging has definitely been OnePlus’ “thing” for a while, and according to Kinder Liu, COO and head of R&amp;amp;D, it’s been a hit with customers. “Since introducing our first fast-charging technology with the OnePlus 3, we have heard a lot of positive feedback, with many OnePlus users saying it has fundamentally changed the way they charge their devices. They can simply top up for a day’s charge while getting ready in the morning instead of charging overnight.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVgrX0"&gt;The OnePlus 9-series uses a twin-cell battery design first introduced in the 8T, which is part of the 9 Pro’s formula for achieving such fast wireless charging speeds: each cell is charged at 25W simultaneously. OnePlus uses higher voltage power, which produces less heat than using higher amps and avoids frying the phone by channeling the power through a proprietary charge pump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0CHA9M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The newly designed charger supports charging in either horizontal or vertical orientation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AyfXvH"&gt;The 9 Pro’s twin-cell battery design also helps mitigate the heat produced by wireless charging, along with some other design tweaks to help with heat dissipation, like thicker copper foil and a larger heatsink. There’s also a key feature on the charger itself that we were grateful for in our testing: a fan. The added fan noise isn’t ideal if the charger is on your nightstand, but for the Pro 9 owner who wants to keep their nighttime charging routine, there’s support for quieter charging during bedtime mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nG92w"&gt;The newly designed charger also includes two charging coils, making it possible to charge the phone in either horizontal or vertical orientation. That’s useful if you want to multitask your charging time and watch a video, too, which OnePlus says shouldn’t affect charging speed. We couldn’t confirm that in our initial testing, but it’s something we’ll be following up on. As for the cost of the charger, we don’t have pricing yet, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;last year’s Warp Charge 30 chargers&lt;/a&gt; didn’t come cheap — the pad version was introduced at $69.95 and the stand version for $79.95.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile customers will get access to a better version of Pandora, free of charge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPs-KlZv8vmGY_LhkP8zd7i44Qo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68982123/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The T-Mobile Tuesdays promotion is included on most of the company’s postpaid plans.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ppYOQC"&gt;T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Ffirst-of-its-kind-pandora-experience-gives-t-mobile-customers-exclusive-benefits&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F17%2F22335993%2Ft-mobile-tuesdays-pandora-ad-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new perk for its customers: a year of access to a version of Pandora with ad-free stations on weekends, along with a few other benefits, at no extra cost. This is not to be confused with &lt;a href="https://www.pandora.com/upgrade/premium"&gt;Pandora’s paid premium service&lt;/a&gt;, but rather a version of the free service with a handful of extras. It starts on March 23rd as part of the company’s T-Mobile Tuesdays promotion, which is included on most postpaid plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7JqNz"&gt;Beginning next Tuesday, customers can get access by logging into the T-Mobile Tuesdays app and redeeming the offer through their Pandora account. After — ironically — watching a short ad each week, they’ll have access to music stations without ads over the weekend. They’ll also get early access to SiriusXM podcast episodes, SiriusXM original podcasts, and special “top tracks” stations. All of the features included with the standard free version of Pandora are also available, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ksln3oXujTMMlg1RRsq5A-ZcuGU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22377499/T_Mobile_Deep_Page_PR_v2__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FPWPag"&gt;Access to this version of Pandora will last through March 2022, at which point T-Mobile’s users’ accounts will revert back to the standard free version. There are no current plans to offer this type of account to other customers, either during or after the promo period. It’s not exactly a promotion worth switching to T-Mobile for, but if you’re already a customer and you use a free Pandora account, it’s a nice bonus — so long as you don’t mind watching an ad to get it every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPD9Em"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s midrange phones now feature fast refresh rate screens, stabilized cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69CPj9-NiG1F8ABRAFuhYmI4OH4=/0x330:4000x2997/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980752/32_galaxya52_a72_white_black_210310001526.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 and A72 feature quad rear-camera arrays, though the A72 includes a telephoto rather than depth-sensing camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tJQJa4"&gt;At its second Unpacked event of the year, Samsung officially unveiled three of its next A-series phones: the Galaxy A52, A52 5G, and A72. While the company isn’t sharing US pricing or availability yet, it has confirmed European pricing: €349 for the A52 (about $415), €429 for the A52 5G (about $510), and €449 for the A72 ($534).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laK8jm"&gt;Key specs across the board include IP67 water and dust resistance, brighter screens with faster refresh rates, and a 64-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization. All three models include a microSD card slot for expandable storage and will ship with a charging brick in the box — features that you won’t find in the S21-series flagships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="24r4ZA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The A52’s display will offer a 90Hz refresh rate, while the A52 5G will have a 120Hz screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N4Lex2"&gt;Each is built on an unspecified octa-core (dual 2.3GHz + hexa 1.8GHz) processor and will ship with Android 11 and Samsung’s One UI 3.0. Storage variants of 128GB and 256GB will be offered for all models, with RAM configurations that will vary by region. The devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;meet the hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt; to receive three generations of Android OS platform updates, and, like all recent Galaxy phones, are guaranteed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;at least four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdPhNi"&gt;The Galaxy A52 and A52 5G will both feature 6.5-inch Super AMOLED screens. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;As rumored&lt;/a&gt;, the A52’s display will offer a 90Hz refresh rate, while the A52 5G will have a 120Hz screen. Each will feature a rear “quad” camera array, though one of those four cameras is a 5-megapixel depth sensor. The main 64-megapixel f/1.8 camera is accompanied by a 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide 5-megapixel macro and 32-megapixel f/2.2 selfie cam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tM8wo9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10396022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TFaxC9"&gt;Samsung says the A52 models feature brighter screens — up to 800 nits as compared to last year’s 600 — and 4,500mAh batteries capable of two days’ use on a single charge. And naturally, the A52 5G includes 5G connectivity, though Samsung hasn’t confirmed yet which frequencies it will support in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQP3P2"&gt;The Galaxy A72 offers a slightly larger 6.7-inch Super AMOLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate. It offers the same basic rear camera array but includes an 8-megapixel f/2.4 3x telephoto camera instead of the depth sensor. The A72 is an LTE-only model; a 5G version is likely to come but Samsung hasn’t confirmed this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oVmRRQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10396033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LhkerI"&gt;We should find out US pricing and availability for these devices — and potentially other A-series models — in the next few weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21212085/samsung-galaxy-a01-a11-a21-a51-a71-5g-mid-range-android-price-release-date"&gt;Last year’s&lt;/a&gt; A51 and A51 5G were introduced at $400 and $500, respectively, with the 5G version of the A71 coming in at $600. If this year’s models are priced similarly, these devices will be well-positioned to tempt midrange shoppers with features like fast refresh rate screens, stabilized main cameras, and IP ratings, which aren’t common in this class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvSpSx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 17th, 10:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Added information about Android platform OS updates.&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung says it might skip the Galaxy Note this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Note 20" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXUBlu67qThdoqzNvjiUniBOhqs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68979722/dbohn_201004_4226_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A1PW2J"&gt;Samsung has warned that it might not be able to ship a Galaxy Note phone in 2021 after all, citing difficulties in launching two flagship phones in one year, in comments at its annual shareholders meeting &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/samsung-warns-of-serious-imbalance-in-the-chips-industry"&gt;reported on by Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3IGzu"&gt;“[The] Note series is positioned as a high-end model in our business portfolio,” said mobile chief DJ Koh. “It could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year so it might be difficult to release [a] Note model in 2H. The timing of [the] Note model launch can be changed but we seek to release a Note model next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcbvgQ"&gt;The comments came as Samsung sounded the alarm about a global semiconductor shortage, saying that its business will likely be affected next quarter. The potential delay or cancellation of a 2021 Galaxy Note is apparently separate, however; Koh says it’s more about streamlining the lineup, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0euKFz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Note 20 review: stylus tax","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21506471/samsung-galaxy-note-20-review-price-stylus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C0ofMo"&gt;The release of a Galaxy Note this year was already far from a sure thing. Samsung had indicated plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;bring its key stylus feature to more phones&lt;/a&gt; in the Galaxy lineup, sparking speculation that the line may come to an end. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22177972/galaxy-note-21-still-happening-yonhap"&gt;A Yonhap report&lt;/a&gt;, however, said that Samsung was still preparing to release a new Note phone in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3kweW2"&gt;Samsung declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on the existence of this device at the time, reiterating its plans to “bring some of the most beloved features of the Galaxy Note to more device categories in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei has a plan to get a bigger cut of 5G, even with its phone sales limited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cglpkfAQTGNKIcIEEPlMzMCaB7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977880/acastro_190520_1777_huawei_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o1pAUQ"&gt;Huawei has a plan to compete in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;5G&lt;/a&gt; without being able to sell its 5G phones everywhere. Today, the technology company announced that &lt;a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/news/2021/3/huawei-releases-whitepaper-innovation-intellectual-property-2020"&gt;it intends to seek royalties&lt;/a&gt; from companies like Apple and Samsung in exchange for the use of its patents, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/huawei-to-start-demanding-5g-royalties-from-smartphone-giants"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Huawei believes it can strike licensing deals despite sanctions in the US, and it plans to use its earnings to invest even further into research and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVoDTZ"&gt;Huawei obtained patents on new technology during the development of the larger 5G standard — alongside companies like Qualcomm and Ericsson — that are needed for interoperability between different 5G networks, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/huawei-to-charge-royalties-to-smartphone-makers-using-its-5g-tech-.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. “Huawei has been the largest technical contributor to 5G standards,” Huawei’s head of intellectual property rights, Jason Ding, said in a statement.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The company intends to charge up to $2.50 per phone that uses its 5G patents. Huawei believes its patent business shouldn’t be impacted by ongoing sanctions, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3TXKw"&gt;The company’s patent earnings are already large. Ding estimates Huawei will earn between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion from patent licensing between 2019 and 2021. Huawei also plans to charge less than other manufacturers like Nokia and Ericsson for access to its 5G standard essential patents (SEPs), according to CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZH7mJ"&gt;Huawei is still banned from doing business in the US by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;Department of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133631/huawei-china-spying-claims-us-officials-blacklist-5g"&gt;concerns of spying&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s networking technology is also still required to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21422939/huawei-zte-us-phone-networks-fcc-congress-reimbursement-cost"&gt;removed and replaced&lt;/a&gt; in the US and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21322880/uk-bans-huawei-5g-network-infrastructure-trump-administration-pressure"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. Aggressively pursuing patent royalties seems like a way to profit off the 5G business Huawei was already building. And with no indication that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22273729/huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-biden-trump-us-sanctions"&gt;the Biden administration will renegotiate&lt;/a&gt; with the company or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274575/huawei-fcc-lawsuit-national-security-ban-broadband-rollout"&gt;reverse the ban&lt;/a&gt;, it might need it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will reduce Play Store cut to 15 percent for a developer’s first $1M in annual revenue</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xe9ZA4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/boosting-dev-success.html"&gt;Google is reducing&lt;/a&gt; its long-standing 30 percent cut, which it takes from each Play Store digital purchase for all Android developers around the world, on the first $1 million they make on the digital storefront each year, starting on July 1st. According to Google, that change means that 99 percent of Android developers that “that sell digital goods or services” will see a 50 percent reduction in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="al4tx8"&gt;Google’s news follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;Apple’s announcement of a reduced 15 percent fee&lt;/a&gt; last year as part of a new small business program, with one critical difference: &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;Apple’s fee reduction&lt;/a&gt; only applies to developers that make under $1 million per year. But if an app maker goes over the $1 million threshold at any point in the year, they’ll be booted from Apple’s program and subject to the standard 30 percent rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TGVgNE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple will reduce App Store cut to 15 percent for most developers starting January 1st","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Srf6VB"&gt;Google’s program is a flat cut to the first $1 million developers make each year. That means whether you’re a student making your first app or a multibillion-dollar company, the first $1 million you make on the Play Store each year will only get charged a 15 percent service fee by Google. Any money you make after that will then be subject to the usual 30 percent cut. A Google spokesperson says the company felt that applying the reduced fees equally to all companies was a fair approach in line with Google’s goals of helping developers of all sizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpyMF5"&gt;Google has charged a 30 percent cut for any purchases through the Google Play Store since it first launched as the “&lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2008/10/android-market-now-available-for-users.html"&gt;Android Market&lt;/a&gt;” — although originally, the company claimed that “Google does not take a percentage,” with the 30 percent cut going toward “carriers and billing settlement fees.” In its more modern incarnation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/6/2848223/google-play-store-rebranded-android-market"&gt;as the Play Store&lt;/a&gt;, Google now puts &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/112622?hl=en"&gt;that 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; toward its “distribution partner and operating fees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mGOg33"&gt;The 30 percent fee has been constant for the lifespan of Google’s storefront. The only exception is subscriptions: in 2018, Google (in another similar move to Apple) announced that it would reduce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16502152/google-play-store-android-apple-app-store-subscription-revenue-cut"&gt;its cut down to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for subscription products after users had been subscribed for a full year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ira93E"&gt;The number of developers that make more than $1 million each year — and will end up still being charged the full 30 percent — is proportionally tiny. Google notes that only about 3 percent of Android developers actually charge for either downloading their apps or for digital in-app purchases to begin with, and only 1 percent of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; developers make more than the $1 million threshold that would see the 30 percent cut kick in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ulioxr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite for Android has also been kicked off the Google Play Store","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368079/fortnite-epic-android-banned-google-play-app-store-rule-violation"},{"title":"Epic is suing Google over Fortnite’s removal from the Google Play Store","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RCZbld"&gt;The new policy also comes at a critical moment when Google (and Apple’s) app store policies are under intense public scrutiny, kicked off by the removal of Epic Games’ &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from both the App Store and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;Play Store&lt;/a&gt; and the game developer’s subsequent antitrust lawsuits against Apple and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2DBj5"&gt;The issue is also coming to a head in legislation, with states like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt; debating new laws that would force Apple and Google to offer more alternative software distribution methods and payment options on their platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAScal"&gt;Epic Games, however, still says that Google’s new measure isn’t nearly far enough, noting that it “does not address the root of the issue,” and arguing that “Android needs to be fully open to competition, with a genuinely level playing field among platform companies, app creators, and service providers. Competition in payment processing and app distribution is the only path to a fair app marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9YfGJP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's scary for the tech industry to that see Google and Apple aligning their monopolistic policies in near lock-step. In a free app market, rates would be much lower for all due to competition, and not subject to their divide-and-conquer tactics.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1371854312507330561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nMQfnT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 16th, 11:50am:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Epic Games statement, and clarified Android developer groups that will see a reduction of fees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will court independent writers to its Substack competitor with paid deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JB94WfARePpUrN2whCKy0ln10Ao=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68974589/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kDNMAO"&gt;Facebook wants to be a part of the newsletter business, and it’s willing to pay for it. &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-paying-writers-journalists-pages-0b96d3cd-e61b-4435-9f54-99aed136f932.html"&gt;reports today&lt;/a&gt; that the company will soon start testing its newsletter product, which will integrate with Pages. As part of that test, Facebook will also court writers, some of whom the company will pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Enshkz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t name any writers and says the product itself is still unnamed, but it also reports the initial user group will be composed of small and independent writers. This newsletter tool will also help writers set up a website outside Facebook. The idea is that writers can charge for subscriptions to their work and potentially create additional revenue streams while relying on Facebook to engage their community. Facebook will let them create Groups for their work as well, and it will also provide metrics on their newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mxeu4N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The product is still unnamed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2cV2A"&gt;The push from Facebook comes as the newsletter business is building significant momentum across the industry. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159571/substack-ceo-chris-best-interview-newsletter-subscription-model-journalism-decoder-podcast"&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt;, most notably, has paid advances to multiple writers in order to bring them over to its platform. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s former Silicon Valley editor Casey Newton now runs his newsletter, &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;Platformer&lt;/a&gt;, through Substack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DLrfxc"&gt;Seeing the success that writers are having on the platform, Twitter acquired newsletter platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;Revue in January&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to keep them in the Twitter ecosystem. The difference between Twitter’s efforts and Substack and Facebook’s is Twitter hasn’t yet specifically sought out writers to pay. Doing so could suggest an editorial slant, although Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie &lt;a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers"&gt;views them&lt;/a&gt; as “business decisions, not editorial ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7GskE"&gt;Facebook, which already receives criticism from both liberals and conservatives in the US for the way it moderates its platform, might face backlash to its newsletter product, particularly depending on which writers it seeks out for the program.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook strikes News Corp deal to license news from Australian media outlets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ISMtkvnt2MdvraASgbPRgaLmKiQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971020/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RCbuNr"&gt;Facebook last month shut off the ability for Australian users and media organizations to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;share news links in the country&lt;/a&gt;, and now it seems the company’s extraordinary measure has resulted in a compromise for the most interested parties as media giant News Corp has &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/03/15/news-corp-and-facebook-reach-agreement-in-australia/"&gt;struck a licensing deal with the social network&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jgd8HD"&gt;Financial terms were not disclosed, but the deal is a multi-year one that gives Facebook’s news platform access to major News Corp Australia properties, including news.com.au, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;. Google similarly struck a deal with News Corp last month, as the threat of a new Australia law regulating tech company payments to news organizations loomed overhead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEl2Rb"&gt;Facebook’s news shutdown in Australia wasn’t designed specifically to increase pressure on News Corp. Instead, Facebook wanted concessions from the Australian government about the then-forthcoming media bargaining law, which stipulated that major tech platforms like Facebook and Google would need to pay news publishers to access their content. Google also threatened to shut down its search engine in Australia, but it ended up &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/02/17/news-corp-and-google-agree-to-global-partnership-on-news/"&gt;striking its own deals instead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="U1Mt8t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook pushed back against Australian’s media bargaining law, and it won&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1cTyAd"&gt;In a predictable turn of events, Facebook received its desired concessions, the largest of which involved negating the forced arbitration portion of the bill that Silicon Valley reviled if prior commercial agreements were struck, and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296778/facebook-ends-australian-news-ban-bargaining-code-google"&gt;restored the ability to share news&lt;/a&gt;. Australia then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22283777/australia-new-media-bargaining-code-facebook-google-paying-news"&gt;passed the law&lt;/a&gt; and everyone more or less came out unscathed. Yet part of Facebook’s initial opposition to the law was that it gave the most powerful publishers too much negotiating power, and News Corp is &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/how-much-influence-does-the-murdoch-media-have-in-australia-20201015-p565dk.html#:~:text=A%202016%20study%20by%20academics,print%20newspaper%20readership%20across%20Australia."&gt;far and away the largest and most pervasive media conglomerate&lt;/a&gt; in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9nMYX"&gt;“Facebook would have been forced to pay potentially unlimited amounts of money to multi-national media conglomerates under an arbitration system that deliberately misdescribes the relationship between publishers and Facebook — without even so much as a guarantee that it is used to pay for journalism, let alone support smaller publishers,” Nick Clegg, Facebook’s global policy chief, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299229/facebook-one-billion-investment-news-industry-australia-google-regulation"&gt;argued at the time&lt;/a&gt; in a public blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0K52d"&gt;Following the Australia showdown, Facebook said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299229/facebook-one-billion-investment-news-industry-australia-google-regulation"&gt;commit $1 billion to news industry deals over the next three years&lt;/a&gt; to foster partnerships with media organizations, with the unspoken stipulation that it not have to face another media bargaining law like Australia’s. (Facebook said it reserves the right to shut down news in Australia again if it so chooses.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lb8fc"&gt;It appears Facebook and News Corp have made up, and this new deal will make News Corp-owned publishers accessible on the Facebook News platform in Australia. In addition to news.com.au and &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;, the latter of which has a separate deal as a broadcast organization, News Corp says it’s also licensing content from major newspapers like &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt; in Victoria, and &lt;em&gt;The Courier-Mail&lt;/em&gt;, as well as numerous regional publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVvao9"&gt;“The agreement with Facebook is a landmark in transforming the terms of trade for journalism, and will have a material and meaningful impact on our Australian news businesses,” said News Corp CEO Robert Thomson in a statement. “Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch led a global debate while others in our industry were silent or supine as digital dysfunctionality threatened to turn journalism into a mendicant order.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZvNLI"&gt;“We’re glad to have this deal in place and look forward to bringing Facebook News to Australia,” wrote Faceboo’s global news partnerships chief Campbell Brown. Andrew Hunter, Facebook’s head of news partnerships for Australia and New Zeland, said in a statement that “the agreements with News Corp Australia and Sky News Australia mean that people on Facebook will gain access to premium news articles and breaking news video from News Corp’s network of national, metropolitan, rural and suburban newsrooms.” &lt;/p&gt;
