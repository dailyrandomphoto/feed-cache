    <title>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 review: nearly normal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;As good as foldables get, but is that good enough?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xQB9CN"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the best possible case Samsung can make for a phone that unfolds into a small tablet. It’s the fourth iteration of the same basic idea, refined and repaired over the course of years following an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;embarrassing false-start failure&lt;/a&gt; on the first attempt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZNUhk"&gt;Because this is a story of refinement, the changes since the last model are minor. But added together, they make this the model that crosses that hard-to-define boundary between experimental and normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNu5wD"&gt;Although the Z Fold 3 feels like a refined, established product, it’s still not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; normal. It’s a marvel of material science that’s by turns wonderful and awkward. And its price is also still far from normal, too — even after a price drop, it starts a $1,799.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RcEeL"&gt;If you like the basic idea of the Z Fold but have been waiting for Samsung to fix its biggest issues, the steady and relentless refinement on display here is worth a look. If you think the whole idea is an extravagant and silly technical flex, none of these changes will change your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mc8Pwg"&gt;Even though those two opinions are almost diametrically opposed, I can’t really argue with either one. The Z Fold 3 is great &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YeDdPp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10715493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RRb1pC"&gt;When closed, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is still an extremely tall, narrow, and thick slab of a device that’s more akin to a remote control than a traditional phone. It’s awkward to fit into a pocket both because of its shape and its weight — although it’s slightly lighter than last year, fundamentally it’s still the size of two phones and it has the weight to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EvLSb"&gt;Samsung’s big addition to the hardware is IPX8 water resistance. I’ve dunked it in a vase and held it under a fountain without issue. I won’t speak to whether the durability improvements Samsung made this year will be enough to keep the phone intact long term, but at least initially it seems solid. I don’t feel like I need to baby this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVp6H0sYuZFLx34hLpwM1Vyynb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801025/dbohn_210820_4722_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There is still a gap between the two sides when closed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_SOyXM4kUAnemSG1_v1jplj080=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801028/dbohn_210820_4722_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is still a gap between the two sides when closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rzq5s"&gt;There’s still a gap at the hinge when it’s closed, but otherwise all the tolerances between the parts are tight. Samsung is still using tiny brushes inside the hinge to keep dust and debris out, but I’d still recommend keeping it away from any serious amount of grit or sand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRRJOd"&gt;The outer screen fills out the entire front of the display, and though it’s 6.2 inches diagonally, it feels much smaller because it’s so narrow. Samsung increased the refresh rate on the exterior display to 120Hz, so everything on it feels smooth; the main compromise when using it is that it’s just really hard to type on. Swipe-typing helps, but Samsung’s built-in keyboard still isn’t as good as Gboard at accuracy, and you’ll want to stick with Samsung’s keyboard since it has better options when in tablet mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtczAF"&gt;Open the phone up and you’re treated to the 7.6-inch display, which is bright, sharp, and has the same 120Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling with less of the “jelly effect” that plagued the earlier versions. It’s a great screen with one glaring problem: the interior selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i0qPO"&gt;Samsung opted for an under-display camera, one of the first to ship in the US. The camera itself is terrible, only 4 megapixels, and even those few are compromised by taking in light through a screen. Camera quality isn’t the problem, though — if I want to take a selfie, there are literally four other cameras I can use that are better. Think of it as a webcam for video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The under display selfie camera is more distracting and annoying than a hole punch." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jpVMUPRs-KkHsfU8l84P89IXTbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801091/dbohn_210820_4722_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The under-display selfie camera is more distracting and annoying than a hole punch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="btt3K1"&gt;Instead, the problem is how the screen looks when the camera is off. When there’s a brighter background over it — or text — it has a screen-door look that is both ugly and distracting. If I shift my head or the phone even a little, there’s a moire effect that instantly draws my eye — even after a week of use it’s still happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ehtMo"&gt;Samsung wants the Z Fold 3 to be a showcase of its technical prowess, but that desire has led it into putting a too-experimental feature on a premium device. The under-display camera literally mars the experience. Samsung needs to put a setting in to turn the screen over the camera off entirely and just revert this thing back to a hole punch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWYJuY"&gt;Surprisingly, that is my only real complaint about the interior screen. Which is saying something since it’s a giant, 7.6-inch display that folds in half. Samsung put a lot of emphasis on how it has made this screen stronger, thanks to how it re-layered the different internal components from the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The crease is still visible at an angle but not bothersome at all when you look straight on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aUwlAY86Tg80SJk418z7sH0zdOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801031/dbohn_210820_4722_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The crease is still visible at an angle but not bothersome at all when you look straight on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S Pen won’t work on the outer screen, but works fine on the main interior screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nVm5rOXMbsDkIDPjcicXaK2GEAc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801032/dbohn_210820_4722_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S Pen won’t work on the outer screen but works fine on the main interior screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T1mpI0"&gt;It still uses Samsung’s so-called “Ultra Thin Glass,” but that glass is still covered with layers of plastic. The top layer is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate"&gt;PET&lt;/a&gt; screen protector which feels much more like any other screen protector you’ve used on a phone. It radically changes the experience of the Z Fold 3 as it’s a lot more resistant to smudges and indentations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sz1Nxq"&gt;There is still a crease between the two halves, and I still am not too bothered by it. It’s mostly visible at an angle and largely goes away when you’re looking at the phone straight on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPPaLU"&gt;The other new layer on this screen is made up of a couple of Wacom digitizers so you can use a new kind of Samsung S Pen stylus with it. The Fold-specific S Pen is sold separately, and there’s no place to store it without a special case, which means you’ll be spending upward of $50 or even $80 more if you want to use stylus input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6Mkc0"&gt;Drawing and sketching with the S Pen on the large screen is nice — there’s not much lag, it seems accurate even across the crease (where algorithms detect position), and it glides cleanly across that new PET layer. Unfortunately, the Fold wobbles when you draw on a table, even with one of Samsung’s own cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcVgl6"&gt;You also can’t use the stylus on the outer display, which means it’s not as good at taking quick notes as the Galaxy Note. Hopefully Samsung won’t discontinue that line for people who really do depend on having quick and easy access to a stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Flex mode on the Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EAbQ9OfiFbggbG3dJGiF8tNPks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801034/dbohn_210820_4722_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flex mode on the Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="A8ga7P"&gt;Samsung has also refined the software that runs the Z Fold 3. Shockingly, One UI 3 has made the Android tablet experience halfway decent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch474o"&gt;That is a strange thing to type as I (and every reviewer I know) have been ragging on Android tablets for nearly a decade. But the subtle improvements Samsung made this year wrangle Android’s biggest tablet problems into flexible, usable little windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SN3N5i"&gt;Too many Android apps don’t re-form themselves to work better on tablet-size screens; they’re just stretched-out phone apps. That’s still the case this year, but some basics like getting multiple columns in Gmail or tabs in a browser work. Others, like Twitter or Slack, still look a little dopey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mbpn3W"&gt;However, Samsung’s multitasking system for windowing and managing apps has become adept at putting those recalcitrant apps in their place. You can drag and drop icons from a sidebar to put things into split screen or into a three-up layout. You can even pin that sidebar to be permanently visible for an even more tablet-like experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="SKr6Zb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Against all reason, Android on a tablet is good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The multitasking software on the Z Fold 3 is much more flexible than before." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S79WEKoUZ0TCUgJpSBFyqUC_56g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801132/Screenshot_20210823_123216_Twitter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The multitasking software on the Z Fold 3 is much more flexible than before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JDRRO3"&gt;Critically, you can more easily adjust the width and height of those various layouts now by simply dragging the dividers around. You can also tap those dividers to easily rearrange the various windows if you don’t want to deal with dragging them around. Saving those custom layouts to the sidebar is simple, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3aQ9C"&gt;Finally, there’s a “labs” feature that lets you strong-arm apps into playing nice with this new system if they haven’t been updated to resize properly on a modern Android device. You can set Instagram to fill the entire screen, for example, or resize TikTok into a little distracting-as-hell side rail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ht1jhh"&gt;Let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though. The iPadOS ecosystem of apps is still light-years ahead of Android when it comes to tablet options. But Samsung and Google have finally managed to push the Android tablet experience to the point where I am comfortable doing more advanced things than I can on a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXBhPn"&gt;But really, the thing about the big screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is that it is a &lt;em&gt;big screen&lt;/em&gt;. Big screens are great. They’re nicer for watching movies, playing games, reading books, and everything else. All the things that people like about outsized slabs like Samsung’s Ultra line or Apple’s Max phones are even better on this big screen. Hell: I can actually read and annotate PDFs on this device without having to tediously pan, pinch, and scroll around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zGMPW"&gt;It helps that the Z Fold 3 is excellent from a performance perspective. The Snapdragon 888 processor and 12GB of RAM keep up with multiple active windows at once. The 4,400mAh battery, however, isn’t quite what I would hope for in terms of longevity. I can get through a full day with four-ish hours of screentime, but getting more than that would require changing my usage in a way I wouldn’t want to. We’re used to tablets lasting forever, but this folding tablet is more akin to your average phone when it comes to battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f5OtsQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10715575"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fPBXJ4"&gt;The cameras are also more akin to what you’ll get on an average phone, not a flagship. The main selfie camera on the outside is 10MP and it’s perfectly serviceable. On the rear, you’ve got three 12-megapixel sensors for wide, ultrawide, and 2X telephoto. The only real change Samsung made since last year was adding optical image stabilization to the telephoto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zvu9kF"&gt;The results are classic Samsung: punchy, bright, sharp, and vivid — too often to a fault. Samsung tunes its camera to look great on Samsung screens, not to be true to what your eye might see in the moment. It’s a choice I don’t love, but at least on a technical level the images are good enough to work with. Similarly, the Z Fold 3 does a passable job with night photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JND4qs"&gt;For $1,800 I’d like something better, but that money is going toward the screen, the waterproofing, and all the rest. If camera quality is your top priority, this isn’t the phone for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 under a waterfall." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JbHY3hS0iqsnM6nfPEqyNoYIOUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801024/dbohn_210819_4722_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 under a waterfall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="21V3bb"&gt;Samsung’s big goal for its folding phones this year is to make them “mainstream.” For the Z Flip 3, Samsung hopes it can become a premium alternative for people who would otherwise buy a “normal” phone. For the Z Fold 3, the goal is to creating an entirely new class of flagship that its competitors can’t match. In both cases, Samsung’s putting all this effort in because its more traditional flagship phones are plummeting in popularity as Xiaomi and others undercut it on price while matching quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JKNd6"&gt;Samsung’s goals aren’t our problem, but they do lead to a benefit: folding phones that we can simply judge on their merits instead of simply gawking at tech demos. They’re still too spendy in my opinion, but I wouldn’t second-guess anybody who decides to spring for one of them. You know how you’ll be using your phone and at some point you have to walk over to your laptop to actually get something done? With the Z Fold 3, it takes me longer to get to that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5K2FRk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As good as it gets, but that might not be good enough&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3pxu3"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is as good as it gets when it comes to a phone that unfolds into a tablet. Until there’s another technological breakthrough that can change the flexibility of glass or the size of batteries, I don’t see anything fundamentally better than this coming along for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4gd00n"&gt;However, it’s still an awkward thing to carry around and use one-handed, and it’s still super expensive. The tradeoffs just don’t seem worth it. Then again, once upon a time we all said the same thing about the tradeoffs for big-screened phones like the Note. For a small sliver of tech-savvy people who know what they’re getting into, I could actually recommend the Z Fold 3. But for most people, as good as it gets is still not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi moves away from its ‘Mi’ product branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-h5HloF3s93W4qA5aaP7l2tgOTE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69767365/DSCF5652.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Mi Home store in Beijing. | Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c1gMiZ"&gt;Xiaomi is phasing out its “Mi” product branding, a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; Products including flagship smartphones like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;this year’s Mi 11&lt;/a&gt; will instead simply carry the Xiaomi name. The news was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-ditches-mi-branding/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XH8Z8C"&gt;“Starting in 2021 Q3, Xiaomi’s product series ‘Mi’ will be renamed to ‘Xiaomi,’” says the spokesperson. “This change will unify our global brand presence and close the perception gap between the brand and its products. This change may take some time to take effect in all regions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35KsqH"&gt;Xiaomi says that it’ll still keep the Redmi brand around, meaning that the higher-end Xiaomi products will form a distinct line alongside Redmi products. Xiaomi products “represent the pinnacle of technology and offer a premium experience,” according to the company, while Redmi products “bring big innovation at a more accessible price point and are aimed at a younger audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pRTAA1pDRtWYVHJNG5B6nOYjEtM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802188/WechatIMG118.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7Bog7E"&gt;This naming convention “will also be applied to our ecosystem and IoT products over time,” says the spokesperson, though the Mi brand logo will continue to be used in Xiaomi’s Mi Home stores for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlkLvs"&gt;This month’s announcement of the latest phone in the Mi Mix series served as a harbinger of the shift, since Xiaomi referred to it as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617979/xiaomi-mi-mix-4-announced-under-display-camera-cup-specs-price"&gt;Xiaomi Mix 4&lt;/a&gt;. The previous phones were called the Mi Mix, the Mi Mix 2, and the Mi Mix 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzmv7b"&gt;The Mi brand was largely used in Western markets, presumably for readability and pronunciation reasons — phones like the Mi 11 are already called the Xiaomi 11 in China, for example. But Xiaomi evidently believes its company name is now recognizable enough and better represents its products.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0n2u1d"&gt;T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Ft-mobile-apple-tv-on-us&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced a new promotional perk&lt;/a&gt; for its customers: starting on August 25th, both new and existing subscribers to its Magenta and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;Magenta Max&lt;/a&gt; plans can get a year’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscription to Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGx288"&gt;The deal applies to virtually any of T-Mobile’s post-paid customers that it classifies as part of those plans, including its Magenta 55 Plus, Magenta Military, Magenta First Responders, Sprint Unlimited Plus, Sprint Premium, and T-Mobile for Business plans. Better yet, the deal isn’t just for newcomers to T-Mobile; it seems that anyone subscribing to those plans can get the free year of Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tew1Ky"&gt;Customers under T-Mobile’s Magenta, Magenta Max, and T-Mobile for Business can find the offer listed under their rate plan details on T-Mobile’s website or app to get the free year, while customers who are still under Sprint’s umbrella will have to go to T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;promotional site&lt;/a&gt; and apply the code 2021APPLETVP1 to get the offer. (Regular T-Mobile customers can do that, too, should they prefer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nGr6x0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Watch ‘Foundation’ for free&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKhcRS"&gt;T-Mobile also notes that the free 12 months on offer here will seemingly apply even if you’ve had a subscription or trial to Apple TV Plus before, meaning that customers can stack the deal with other free trials, like the three months of service that come with the purchase of a new Apple device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96944Y"&gt;The freebie also comes as T-Mobile is reckoning with its recent massive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt;, which exposed data for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;millions of its customers&lt;/a&gt;, including first and last names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license / ID numbers, phone numbers, and IMEI / IMSI information for 7.8 million postpaid customers. Additionally, T-Mobile says that data on over 40 million “former or prospective customers” was compromised in the breach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6kuAz"&gt;And while it’s certainly a nice bonus for customers, it’s likely that a few months of &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;will not make up for having to deal with the ramifications of having that much personal data leaked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google has already discontinued the Pixel 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZFKZY6bXeGT0HV_l6DYodE_VOts=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755977/akrales_201012_4137_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5 (top) and 4A 5G (bottom) will likely sell out soon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LmNmf8"&gt;Amidst the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627253/google-pixel-5a-specs-price-screen-battery-availability"&gt;news of a new Pixel phone&lt;/a&gt; this week, Google quietly indicated that it’s the end of the road for two other Pixel devices: the Pixel 4A 5G and the Pixel 5. Both are currently listed on Google’s online store as sold out, and remaining stock at other retailers likely won’t last long. A company spokesperson offered the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aijLY1"&gt;With our current forecasts, we expect Google Store in the U.S. to sell out of Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 in the coming weeks following the launch of Pixel 5a (5G). These products will continue to be available through some partners while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vZ4hZ6"&gt;It’s not too surprising that the 4A 5G being discontinued given that the 5A 5G looks to be a fairly direct successor. However, it is a little unusual to see the Pixel 5 discontinued well in advance of the Pixel 6’s arrival this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqgLLT"&gt;Maybe that’s because the Pixel 5 bears more of a similarity to the budget-oriented A-series phones than it will to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Google appears to be pulling out all the stops for the 6-series, positioning them as true flagship competitors to Apple and Samsung’s heavy hitters. While the Pixel 5 offers step-up features like wireless charging and robust IP68 waterproofing not available in the A-series, it wasn’t quite specced out to compete with the iPhone 12 Pros and Galaxy S21s of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dtg2K6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gv7Azf"&gt;Or maybe this is just how Google does things now — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356745/google-pixel-4-xl-discontinued-out-of-stock"&gt;stopped selling the Pixel 4 and 4 XL&lt;/a&gt; less than a year after their introduction. But on the bright side, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;the LTE-only Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt; is still on sale for now, and it’s a steal for its $349 price tag. You’ll just need to like baby blue... er, &lt;em&gt;barely blue&lt;/em&gt;, since the “just black” model is sold out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s massive data breach leaked info for 5.3 million additional customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LJO03I3sABMpXk2L0YOJ51ERKuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69753137/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="srbZRz"&gt;The news about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;T-Mobile’s latest data breach&lt;/a&gt; is only getting worse, as the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fadditional-information-regarding-2021-cyberattack-investigation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F20%2F22633853%2Ftmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced new details&lt;/a&gt; from its investigation. While someone in possession of the leaked data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/15/22626270/t-mobile-investigating-report-customer-data-breach"&gt;said they had obtained information for as many as 100 million customers&lt;/a&gt;, including driver’s license info, IMEI numbers, and more, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;T-Mobile’s first statement&lt;/a&gt; put the figure at 47 million or so and did not mention the IMEI / IMSI data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K81kUx"&gt;Now, T-Mobile has confirmed that for the 7.8 million on-contract, or postpaid, customers it already counted in the breach, data stolen includes the information mentioned Thursday (first and last names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and driver’s license / ID numbers), as well as phone numbers and IMEI / IMSI information. IMEI stands for International Mobile Equipment Identity and is a number that’s assigned to every mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Eib8BJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More than 50 million people have been included in the breach&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7mfsT0"&gt;IMSI stands for International Mobile Subscriber Identity and is the identifier for the SIM card to which your mobile phone number is tied. That kind of data could be used to track mobile devices or assist in SIM swapping attacks where someone hijacks your phone number to intercept two-factor authentication codes or other information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDOsYC"&gt;Additionally, 5.3 million more postpaid customers have also been identified as part of the breach, but without revealing their driver’s license / ID or Social Security numbers. The same goes for an additional 667,000 accounts of former T-Mobile subscribers that are being added to the total. Former Sprint prepaid and Boost Mobile customers are still in the clear, however, 52,000 names tied to Metro by T-Mobile accounts were stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUKXCT"&gt;An unspecified number of files contained “phone numbers, IMEI, and IMSI numbers.” According to T-Mobile that did not include any personally identifiable information, which is a questionable claim since it could be easy to tie someone’s identity to their phone number based on other leaked data or simply browsing publicly available listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3FAsX"&gt;The FCC already announced it’s investigating the incident, and at least one class-action lawsuit has been filed against T-Mobile, calling its response and promised two years of identity protection services “inadequate.” The investigation is still ongoing, but T-Mobile customers (current, former, or just prospective ones who filled out an application) can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fbrand%2Fdata-breach-2021&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F20%2F22633853%2Ftmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme’s bulky magnetic wireless charger is almost as fast as promised</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sCHWRHeVVfHKxufRxvech5n-DSk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69751721/DSCF7747.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The MagDart charger has a hefty cooling fan.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6WaizF"&gt;Earlier this month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607214/realme-magdart-announced-magnetic-wireless-charger-devices"&gt;Realme launched MagDart&lt;/a&gt;, its MagSafe-a-like ecosystem of magnetic wireless charging products. The headline device is a 50W brick that Realme professes to be the fastest magnetic wireless charger in the world — it’s supposed to be able to charge a 4,500mAh battery from 0 to 100 percent in 54 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybi3Mj"&gt;Naturally I was interested in trying this for myself. Realme sent me a 50W MagDart charger, a 65W SuperDart wall charger to plug it into, and a Realme Flash “concept phone” with built-in MagDart compatibility. (The only other Realme phone to work with MagDart is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534618/realme-gt-hands-on-europe-launch-price-specs"&gt;new GT flagship&lt;/a&gt;, and even that requires a specialized case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IY5D6P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aWfnOh"&gt;The Flash isn’t a commercial device, but it’s a very nice phone nonetheless. That’s mostly because it’s very obviously a repurposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, made possible by the fact that the two companies share ownership and suppliers along with Oppo and Vivo. The camera configuration has been reshuffled a little — for little reason, since the onboard software doesn’t even include a camera app — but the hardware is otherwise identical. The Flash’s “About phone” screen even still lists the device name as the OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKvFybczN8yqodinvrfYCJQWedA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794463/DSCF7751.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Realme Flash is clearly a repurposed OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oOK2d9"&gt;The MagDart charger, meanwhile, is a chunky metal box with solid construction and a glossy top panel that makes contact with the phone. The magnetic force is fairly strong; you can attach the Flash and hold it facing the ground, though it’ll fall if you shake it around a little. Despite the charger’s bulky build, it’ll still stay attached if you try to pick the phone up, so you can’t really use it as a stationary wireless charger without securing it to a hard surface. There’s a cooling fan that varies in its noise output. At its loudest, I would say it’s comparable to an Intel-based MacBook Pro with a couple too many Chrome tabs open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIp7gv"&gt;When it came to testing the performance, I found that the charger wasn’t able to wake the phone at 0 percent power. For that reason, I used a USB-C cable to turn the phone on and get it to one percent, then took my measurements from there. I didn’t use the phone while charging other than to wake the screen to check the battery status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2iY7k"&gt;Basically, it turns out that this is indeed a very fast wireless charger, though not quite as fast as Realme claims. After 15 minutes the Flash was already at 35 percent, and reached 60 percent after half an hour. The 45-minute mark took it to 82 percent, but by the promised 54 minutes it was only at 95 percent. The Flash eventually hit 100 percent at a round 60 minutes. For comparison, an iPhone 12’s battery will only be around half full after that long.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oFiFE3Ax-iR29WxSuKDmFW8ytUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794466/DSCF7752.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The charger will stay attached if you pick your phone up from the desk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2TxnVL"&gt;So yeah, MagDart works. I’m not really convinced by the form factor, though — if speed was a priority, plugging in a cable wouldn’t be much less convenient than this, if at all. You can’t practically use the phone with this charger attached, either. (I’ll note here that Realme has also developed a thinner 15W MagDart charger that looks similar to Apple’s MagSafe charging puck).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZUdzu"&gt;Still, magnetic wireless charging is all about versatility, and the MagDart technology seems to work well for what it is. For readers in the US in particular, it’ll be worth keeping an eye on whether it shows up in actual shipping OnePlus devices any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how much it costs to fix a Z Fold 3 or Z Flip 3 with a broken screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OTDk2waIZmsFLjnEJEzqlkj8r94=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750869/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3KW8h2"&gt;Samsung’s new foldables are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;quite impressive&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;making them as durable as possible&lt;/a&gt; — but sometimes, accidents happen. We asked Samsung how much it would cost to replace a Z Flip or Z Fold 3’s screen should something happen to it, and here’s what the company told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eV8jmP"&gt;Samsung provides a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/warranty/?model=N0053854" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one year warranty&lt;/a&gt; with the phones, so if your screen breaks in a way that’s covered, you shouldn’t have to pay for a repair. Out of warranty, fixing the interior folding screen of a Z Fold 3 costs $479. Doing the same for a Z Flip 3 costs $369. Thankfully, the external displays are much less expensive — fixing a broken outer screen will set you back $149 for the Fold and $99 for the Flip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MngxoL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Out of warranty, the Fold’s folding screen costs $479 to replace, and the Flip’s costs $369&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wh3XmT"&gt;Samsung also offers its Samsung Care Plus subscription, which costs $12.99 a month for either phone (though Samsung is currently running a preorder deal where you don’t have to make Care Plus payments for 12 months). For Care Plus subscribers, Samsung says there’s a $249 charge for an out-of-warranty screen repair — though the company says that the “deductible covers up to three screen repairs per year.” Care Plus also extends your warranty for two more years after the original expires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2U2HC"&gt;For traditional, non-folding phones, there’s often the option to repair the screen yourself, which can end up costing less than having the manufacturer do it. However, for Samsung’s new foldables, this isn’t likely to be easy. Samsung’s aforementioned push for durability means &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;the phones are filled with a lot of sticky, hard to remove stuff&lt;/a&gt; like tape, glue, and goo. The company says the folding screens are made out of multiple layers, which are sealed with a “pressure-sensitive adhesive.” As someone who’s taken apart their share of devices, that sounds like an absolute nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qyTv7z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The repair prices for the new foldables are less than the ones for the older versions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5Dhxz"&gt;That said, this isn’t much of a change. It’s not like Samsung’s previous foldables were particularly easy to repair. And while the company’s prices are higher than those for more traditional phone repairs — a broken iPhone 12 screen &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement"&gt;costs $279 to replace&lt;/a&gt;; a Galaxy S21 5G’s costs $199 — Samsung is actually charging less than it used to. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/repair/pricing/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to Samsung’s site&lt;/a&gt;, the Z Fold 2’s inner screen costs $549 to replace out of warranty and the Z Flip 5G’s costs $499, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20881040/samsung-galaxy-fold-screen-replacemet-premier-service-cost-unboxing"&gt;depending on when you bought the phone&lt;/a&gt;, you may be eligible for a one-time replacement &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/repair/pricing/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for significantly less&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T TV will officially become DirecTV Stream next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OinA03PZVPpaBuocoQNiLrsiIA0=/154x0:1690x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750375/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_1.40.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DirecTV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x5jZBY"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV and its defunct AT&amp;amp;T TV Now sibling will officially become DirecTV Stream, a new unified service spun out of a deal between TPG Capital and AT&amp;amp;T for the telecommunication giant’s streaming properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d221R0"&gt;DirecTV began updating AT&amp;amp;T TV and AT&amp;amp;T TV Now customers of the change on August 14th. On the welcome screens of both services’ mobile apps, subscribers were informed that the change would officially take place on August 26th, a spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. DirectTV Stream rebrands AT&amp;amp;T’s services acquired in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608577/att-directv-tpg-deal-u-verse-att-tv-new-company"&gt;TPG Capital deal&lt;/a&gt;, which did not include HBO Max. (WarnerMedia, home to HBO Max, is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22448140/warner-bros-discovery-warnermedia-new-name-merger-att"&gt;merge with Discovery&lt;/a&gt; in mid-2022.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0NtNZ5iNptz861sh1Y1R-ioM2FM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793519/IMG_1845.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DirecTV&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AuFsLd"&gt;According to a company &lt;a href="https://www.directv.com/stream/"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;, “AT&amp;amp;T satellite, streaming or IP video customers will automatically keep their video service, any bundled wireless, internet or HBO Max services, and associated discounts with no action needed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPf9GG"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21160860/att-tv-now-available-android-tv-google-assistant-streaming"&gt;launched last year&lt;/a&gt; as the company’s premium TV streaming experience. AT&amp;amp;T TV Now, the company’s skinny streaming bundle, technically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226881/att-tv-now-streaming-skinny-bundle-cord-cutting-youtube-hulu-fubo"&gt;became AT&amp;amp;T TV&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, and new customers could no longer sign up for Now. (The company &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/at-t-tv-now-is-merging-with-at-t-tv-wait-what-1846043744"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that AT&amp;amp;T TV Now customers would still be able to access their accounts, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20dzAE"&gt;If all of this sounds needlessly confusing, it is. With any luck, this will be the last significant branding change that AT&amp;amp;T’s existing or future streaming customers see for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Motorola Edge gets a 108-megapixel camera but ditches the edge display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGvwBZN9FIO3y82ldrGugAWgMx4=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749378/edge.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9D1ly"&gt;Motorola has a new version of its $700 Edge smartphone, bringing better cameras, a more modern processor, and an updated design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUpRAK"&gt;As with last year’s Edge, the new model doesn’t quite offer the best hardware Android has to offer, with a Snapdragon 778 5G processor, 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, or 8GB RAM / 256GB storage, but those sacrifices might be worth it for the decidedly midrange price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNbqBS"&gt;Despite that, the new Edge does feature the 108-megapixel camera that was one of the marquee features on the Edge Plus, along with a larger 5,000mAh battery and mmWave 5G — both of which were also offered on the Edge Plus but were downgraded to a 4,500mAh battery and sub-6GHz-only specs on last year’s Edge. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPL4-EVXAsWWm3hWTNZ6aLNXNqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22791020/Motorola_edge__2021__design.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gkzgT1"&gt;The display is a 6.8-inch LCD display with a 144Hz refresh rate, but calling the new phone the Edge (with no numbering to help distinguish it from the 2020 model) is actually a bit of a misnomer, given that the 2021 model ditches the “endless edge” waterfall display that gave the original Edge and Edge Plus their names. That said, given that the curved screen was by and large a gimmick on last year’s models, it’s not much of a loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJSipX"&gt;Cameras are the aforementioned 108-megapixel main camera, along with an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide that offers Motorola’s “Macro Vision” feature, and a 2-megapixel depth camera. A 32-megapixel front-facing camera rounds out the proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlooYj"&gt;Still missing on the spec sheet is any form of wireless charging, although the new Edge does add some extremely basic IP52 water resistance (which, while better than nothing, is basically just enough to protect from the odd bit of rain). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2YQ4t2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Motorola debuts Edge 20 flagships globally with fast refresh screens and 108-megapixel cameras","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599860/motorola-edge-20-pro-lite-camera-5g-global-launch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kAPH4y"&gt;It’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the same hardware as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599860/motorola-edge-20-pro-lite-camera-5g-global-launch"&gt;trio of Edge 20 models&lt;/a&gt; that Motorola released internationally earlier this summer (which, among other differences, feature smaller 6.7-inch displays) although it most closely resembles the middle-of-the-road Edge 20 in specs. The Edge 20 does beat the North American model Edge in a few areas, however: it features an 16-megapixel ultrawide and an 8-megapixel 3x telephoto camera as its other two rear cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bytbmy"&gt;The latest version of the Edge is also definitively a successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21347201/motorola-edge-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;last year’s regular Edge model&lt;/a&gt; — not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241919/motorola-edge-plus-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;premium flagship Edge Plus hardware&lt;/a&gt; that aimed to challenge high-end phones from Samsung and OnePlus. For now, there’s no word on Motorola as to whether it’ll be trying again at competing in the crowded high-end Android market in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="veVCeb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another “limited time” discount&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GSXO30"&gt;Pricing for the 2021 Edge also matches last year: it’ll technically be sold for $699.99, but Motorola is once again offering a “limited-time” discount right from the start to drop the price down to a more wallet-friendly $499.99. The company isn’t saying how long that price will be offered at this time, although if it’s anything like last year, sales won’t be too hard to come by. It’ll be available in the US unlocked from sellers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola’s website, with carrier versions from Verizon and Spectrum mobile planned “in the coming months.” A release in Canada is also planned for the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 RT is reportedly on the way, but not for North America or Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRhACtAz2Fq9RI5-MNtmbh7OlKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749115/ajohnson_210623_4644_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus N200, a sub-$300 phone, is the kind of budget device the company is offering in the US.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOzJfA"&gt;OnePlus may be getting ready to launch another variant of its 9-series phones, the 9 RT, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-rt-october-oxygenos-12"&gt;according to an &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; source&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the report, it looks to be a slightly upgraded version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348430/oneplus-9r-specs-price-availability"&gt;the OnePlus 9R&lt;/a&gt;, which was launched earlier this year with more modest specs than the flagship 9 and 9 Pro. That model never made it to North America, and it seems this will also be the case for the 9 RT. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;the Nord 2&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577770/oneplus-base-9-pro-north-america-us-canada"&gt;the 9 Pro base model&lt;/a&gt;. But who’s keeping track?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqvGAG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;, the OnePlus 9 RT will launch in October with a Snapdragon 870 processor, 120Hz OLED, a 4,500mAh battery, and OxygenOS 12 out of the box. For its main rear-facing camera, it will reportedly use the 50-megapixel sensor behind the same (very good) ultrawide as in the 9 and 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7dodMO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OgEhY8"&gt;The OnePlus 9 RT will debut in China and India, according to &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;, and there are no plans to make it available in North American or European markets. That’s not too surprising, and it tracks with OnePlus’ recent strategy of limiting US releases to the high-end likes of the 9 and 9 Pro, along with the budget-oriented N200 and N10 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxyUYs"&gt;It’s possible that OnePlus sees an opportunity to gobble up some of the budget market share &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375938/lg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola"&gt;formerly occupied by LG&lt;/a&gt; and has focused its US strategy accordingly. In any case, it looks increasingly clear that bringing midrange devices like the Nord 2 and upper-midrangers like this rumored 9 RT to the US aren’t part of the company’s strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
