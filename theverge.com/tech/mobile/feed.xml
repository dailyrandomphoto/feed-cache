    <title>The Realme 8 Pro is a £279 phone with a 108-megapixel camera</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rG6WfA"&gt;Officially launching in the UK today, the Realme 8 Pro is a budget device that’s one of the first to use the new Samsung ISOCELL HM2 108-megapixel sensor in its main camera. While similar high-res sensors have been more common in pricier phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, this chip is designed for lower-cost devices like the 8 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpxx9s"&gt;This 108-megapixel chip isn’t the same one used in the S21 Ultra or even last year’s S20 Ultra. It’s a smaller sensor — 1/1.52-inch versus 1/1.33-inch — with slightly smaller 0.7μm pixels. However, it uses the same binning approach to improve light-gathering abilities by combining neighboring pixels into a less noisy 12-megapixel image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mtIclz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10409112"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k13i6x"&gt;The Realme 8 Pro offers a 6.4-inch OLED screen, a Snapdragon 720G processor with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 4,500mAh battery that supports 50W fast charging. The back of the device, which comes in blue and black variants, features some intense Realme branding with the company’s “Dare to Leap” slogan in large fluorescent lettering that — the company claims — glows in the dark. Realme also says the design will appeal to “a new generation of younger users,” which we’ll have to take its word for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1harqp"&gt;The 8 Pro will go on sale on March 31st in the UK for £279 (about $380).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvP5M2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nHpGB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is reportedly developing a Switch-like Android gaming device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikfFenLqMUTOEmShlBnyFzRdLUo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69015226/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9h9d2E"&gt;Qualcomm is reportedly working on an Android-powered, handheld gaming console that’s similar to a Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/23/exclusive-qualcomm-is-planning-an-android-powered-nintendo-switch-knockoff/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374447139921686528?s=20"&gt;editor-in-chief Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt;. The device would be powered by Qualcomm’s silicon, and could hit store shelves by next year — if it ends up being a real product at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWFYl7"&gt;According to the article, which cites images seen by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;, the device would feature detachable, Joy-Con-like controllers, an SD card slot, Android 12, and (of course) 5G. Also noted, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374448185377058821"&gt;corroborated by Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, is a huge 6,000mAh battery. While the physical dimensions aren’t clear, Rahman tweeted that the screen could be 6.65-inches, with a resolution of at least 1080p (the Switch’s screen is 6.2-inches and runs at 720p). He also indicated that it could have a fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueTznf"&gt;In other words, the device sounds like a big smartphone with attached controllers and active cooling, though that may not be a bad thing — the Switch kind of looks like a giant phone too. But it also has a library of great games that only it can play, which is its biggest draw. While there are plenty of good gaming experiences to be had on Android, from retro emulators to games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact, &lt;/em&gt;Qualcomm would have to give customers a reason why they should play those games on a separate device, rather than on their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered gaming phones&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346594/black-shark-4-pro-gaming-phone-shoulder-buttons-specs-price-release-date"&gt;built-in buttons&lt;/a&gt; or controller accessories (or on their regular phones).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/702SiKs875OMZ6GWr4U0CZDa5Us=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357713/aeroactivecooler.jpg"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; with a controller accessory.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SD5rUT"&gt;Or at least, it will if it’s trying to sell the device to people — the &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; article indicates that Qualcomm does want it to be commercially available, potentially at carrier retail stores. It also says that the price target for the device is $300, the same as a full-sized Switch. Currently, the cheapest phone I found with Qualcomm’s flagship 888 processor, the Realme GT 5G, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314043/realme-gt-5g-snapdragon-888-china-price-specs"&gt;costs roughly $430 (and is only sold in China).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0vi1Z"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374448185377058821?s=20"&gt;Rahman notes&lt;/a&gt; that his source believed the product was closer to a reference design than something that would ever see store shelves. Chipmakers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21147912/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-vr-ar-xr-platform-reference-design-announcement"&gt;including Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, often build sample devices to help other manufacturers design around their SOCs or radios. Sometimes, these reference products &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573577/intel-nuc-m15-laptop-news-specs-features-price"&gt;even end up being sold by other companies under different brands&lt;/a&gt;, known as whitelabeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="AfvwLA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s understandable why Qualcomm would be eying the handheld gaming market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cg2LZl"&gt;It is worth noting that the disagreement between the sources could be due to uncertainty from Qualcomm itself — &lt;em&gt;AP &lt;/em&gt;believes this project is almost a year from being finished, so the company may not yet know for sure what it wants this to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2F5l7"&gt;Whether the device ends up as a product or not (it could easily get canceled before it makes a public appearance), it seems like Qualcomm is actually designing and building a dedicated Android gaming device. It’s understandable why the company would be eying the handheld gaming market: it’s been heating up since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/31/4573596/nvidia-shield-review"&gt;Nvidia’s handheld Shield&lt;/a&gt; idea turned into the Nintendo Switch, with high-powered gaming phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;Windows PCs with Switch-like form factors&lt;/a&gt;, and a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/29/21406254/nintendo-modder-custom-wii-game-cube-game-boy"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/16/20906665/analogue-pocket-game-boy-handheld-release-date-price"&gt;classic handheld redesigns&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/1/18648304/playdate-hands-on-panic-keita-takahashi-bitsummit"&gt;novelty pocket gaming systems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You probably haven’t used Yahoo in a while, but what if it cost you money?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3heApRjmByH4d25O6ZmLDtcsO_o=/109x0:1729x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013874/1616443602945.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Verizon Media Group&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SbGYfH"&gt;Yahoo is the legacy Web 1.0 brand that just won’t get dragged and dropped into the trash bin of history, and that’s largely thanks to Verizon’s tireless efforts to keep it going after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/25/12269898/verizon-acquires-yahoo-4-billion-marissa-mayer"&gt;buying the company a few years ago for nearly $5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. This time around, the telecom giant actually wants to &lt;em&gt;expand&lt;/em&gt; the Yahoo brand to all of its consumer-facing web properties with a new series of subscription offerings organized around what it’s calling Yahoo Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-media-subscription-yahoo-plus-05a8abb3-d871-4870-8bba-161a394e8cf1.html"&gt;according to a new report from &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA85FF"&gt;It’s important to mention right now, before we go any further, that the official Verizon Media Group branding provided for Yahoo Plus stylizes it as “Yahoo!+,” with that deranged cousin of the interrobang slapped onto the end of it. Apparently “Oath,” which was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18064172/verizon-oath-media-group-rebrand"&gt;previous incarnation of Verizon Media Group&lt;/a&gt; and technically the division that swallowed Yahoo after the acquisition, was not the end of the company’s poor naming decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4dzrC"&gt;If Yahoo Plus (we’re going to drop the exclamation point and the plus sign) sounds like a streaming service, you’re right. It certainly does, but it’s not. Yahoo Plus will instead be a kind of hybrid media portfolio of various Yahoo products and services, including its finance platform; its very-much-still-alive email platform; its media properties, including &lt;em&gt;Engadget &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch;&lt;/em&gt; and its fantasy sports service, among others. But in all seriousness, there is a sizable business here: Verizon tells &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; it already has 3 million existing customers  of subscription products it offers across services like Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Fantasy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpkVOt"&gt;In some cases, customers of Yahoo Plus will pay for extra premium features, while in others — like the &lt;a href="https://payments.mail.yahoo.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwo-aCBhC-ARIsAAkNQivyRx3IKbEi-yYRii-RPxoqHMlTQXzQ6J8KlojcR5isdVyu98kUGH4aAsenEALw_wcB&amp;amp;ncid=dcm_271619786_465330143_130623920"&gt;existing subscription version of Yahoo Mail&lt;/a&gt; called Yahoo Mail Pro — you’ll pay to remove ads, &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reports. We don’t know how Verizon plans to bundle this as Yahoo Plus, or whether it will charge for each one separately and how much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lbemIq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is “Yahoo!+” better than “go90”? The jury is still out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KjfBQ3"&gt;The bigger picture here is that Verizon is acknowledging a hard reality after the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-takes-46-billion-write-down-for-media-unit-that-ncludes-aol-yahoo-1544556371-0c9f6649-7b9b-4d17-861e-4302ab6b477a.html"&gt;write-down of its entire media business&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018 (just a year after the Yahoo deal closed) and the unceremonious end of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17516266/verizon-shutting-down-go90-original-video-content-app"&gt;unsuccessful proto-Quibi streaming app go90&lt;/a&gt;. And that is that the whole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15180622/oath-aol-yahoo-verizon-ad-tracking-privacy"&gt;targeted advertising play it was hoping to pull off&lt;/a&gt; by combining its telecom analytics, AOL, Yahoo, and its various other corporate tentacles is simply not equipped to take on the Facebook-Google duopoly in online advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zu3k4V"&gt;So Verizon is now trying subscription models. Those are certainly all the rage in media these days. After all, collecting recurring direct payments from consumers is the only surefire way to inject any stability in an ad market largely dominated by Big Tech and susceptible to cataclysmic downturns, like &lt;a href="https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/global-ad-market-will-take-years-to-recover-from-covid-19/44417"&gt;what happened last year when the COVID-19 pandemic set in&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWYLmC"&gt;That brings us back to Yahoo Plus. While it may seem silly to continue leaning on the brand perhaps best known for signaling an email address that’s remained unchanged since high school, the Yahoo brand is admittedly resilient and about as close to a household name in websites as you can get outside the major Silicon Valley corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjG1rN"&gt;”Yahoo is the future of our consumer facing brand,” Joanna Lambert, Verizon Media’s consumer chief, told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;. “From a strategy perspective, we have enormous scale that is unlike most media companies in the world. The question becomes, ‘how do we take that audience and drive them from being free users to subscribers of really valuable paid offerings?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnJFx0"&gt;Lambert is right about the massive scale of Yahoo properties — they’re still among the biggest on the web. And if Verizon can somehow pull off a series of subscription services that actually complement its ad business, then it’ll have truly breathed new life into the Yahoo name. We’re just still a little unsure on the whole “Yahoo!+” thing. Let’s hope it rethinks that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Black Shark 4 is a high-end gaming phone that doesn’t look like one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Black Shark 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JGL_i_mPrY1EJJPr0AAesrtdPfg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013017/blackshark4lead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Black Shark&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b0JyVN"&gt;Xiaomi’s Black Shark brand has announced its fourth series of gaming phones, the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro. They improve on the previous series in most of the ways you’d expect them to. There’s a faster processor, moving up to the Snapdragon 870 in the standard Black Shark 4 and the Snapdragon 888 in the 4 Pro. Both phones also come with fast LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage, though each will come in different configurations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRMexn"&gt;The Black Shark 4 starts with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for 2,499 Chinese yuan (roughly $383), while the 4 Pro starts at 3,999 yuan (about $613) and has 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage. These will debut in China on Friday, March 26th, while the company says an overseas launch will happen “in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Black Shark 4" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_Mx00wD3oxIHN5IALpYcuXk53Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391953/blackshark4sidebyside.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ESP2tF"&gt;As is almost a given in the realm of gaming phones, Black Shark has leap-frogged Asus and RedMagic — some of its biggest competition in the niche gaming phone space — when it comes to touch sampling rate or how many times the display can register a touch. Both the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro have a 720Hz touch sampling rate with a 8.3ms touch delay, which it claims to be an industry best. This spec likely won’t make a difference in most people’s day-to-day usage of these phones, but some hardcore gamers might care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLrvVy"&gt;Both phones have the mechanical shoulder buttons introduced in the previous Black Shark phones, though the company claims it has improved their look and feel with “magnetic power lift” tech, making them feel more tactile to click, as well as fitting more seamlessly into the phone’s design. Speaking on the look of these new phones, they’re decidedly more attractive than the previous models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S6jLWEc3wGctuQNIizIKHw8NDRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16333859/jbareham_190611_3481_0177.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Black Shark 2, which introduced the pressure-sensitive display that lets you map two functions to one spot on the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tRWYlT"&gt;In addition to the shoulder buttons, these phones still have a pressure-sensitive display that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/15/18678066/black-shark-2-xiaomi-gaming-phone-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;I really liked in the Black Shark 2&lt;/a&gt;. With the shoulder buttons and a screen like this, you can re-map the controls of a mobile game to be a little more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWJFBm"&gt;Unlike last year’s model, the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro have displays that are the same size. They both have 6.67-inch OLED screens with a 144Hz refresh rate. Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; that I recently reviewed, these phones have dual front-facing speakers with claims that they have good spatial audio separation. Also like that Asus phone, Black Shark announced that a fan accessory called the FunCooler 2 Pro can be attached to keep it cooler. The price for that is 199 yuan (about $30).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z2apGE"&gt;OnePlus has released its new batch of phones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;9 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. As is the tradition with OnePlus, the phones are equipped with the latest high-end Snapdragon chips and are priced lower than most of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCTwOi"&gt;Both phones also include charging features that Apple and Samsung don’t match: they wirelessly charge at a super-fast 50W and can charge at 65W over wired charging. They also both have Hasselblad’s camera tuning and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL56px"&gt;The OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro are very similar, but there are a few differences to watch out for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wplcfE"&gt;The Pro has a bigger screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qFZmMi"&gt;The Pro includes a telephoto camera and mmWave 5G&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xo4nmt"&gt;The unlocked and T-Mobile versions of the Pro have IP68 certification — only the T-Mobile version of the regular phone is IP68 certified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DBUo47"&gt;The Pro includes “Hyper Touch” where it polls for finger input at 360Hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Both of those phones include mmWave and IP68 water resistance. But if those aren’t features you care about, it may be worth the savings to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C0bSQN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10408117"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u8R0H1"&gt;The 9 Pro can’t quite match the all-out specs and features of the Galaxy S21 Ultra, but it’s also priced well below it, too. For fun, we also threw in Oppo’s latest flagship phone, which isn’t available for purchase in the US but is pretty similar to the Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Fast charging and elegant software offset a so-so camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KqtAyf"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is a legitimate flagship phone that is genuinely competitive with the best Android phones on the market — at least from a features and quality perspective. Yet in terms of market and mind share, it’s still destined to be a niche device for a small group of enthusiasts looking for a specific kind of elegance in their Android device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAjS4O"&gt;And that’s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0Ns9M"&gt;If you live in the US and you’re buying an Android phone, chances are very high that you’ll end up with a Samsung Galaxy phone. Samsung has the carrier relationships, quality, and marketing that have led directly to market share. LG, Motorola, and even &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america"&gt;sell more phones here than OnePlus does&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4shcPS"&gt;But after nearly seven years and dozens of phones, OnePlus has established itself as a brand that can make great phones that are serious alternatives to the mainstream. The $969 OnePlus 9 Pro achieves that goal with only a handful of notable compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2jYBg"&gt;OnePlus’ flagship phones always come with a laundry list of top-of-the-line specs, but what makes the OnePlus 9 Pro good isn’t the numbers; it’s how well those specs translate into one of the best experiences you can get using Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AHu1Vy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi-pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"This $159 OnePlus Watch is OnePlus’ first smartwatch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22334322/oneplus-watch-smartwatch-features-price-specs-battery"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro announced with Hasselblad-branded cameras ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hpoEZD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10406462"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro has an elegant design, but won’t support 5G on all networks" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjdZe-bk4k4KgMTns8qChqCoZ-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388892/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0068.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has an elegant design but won’t support 5G on all networks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bQiCrq"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro hardware design and 5G support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rZIXVc"&gt;The hardware design on the OnePlus 9 Pro is the most seamless, elegant phone that the company has designed to date. It is, of course, big. It has a 6.7-inch screen that goes from edge to edge in a body that’s narrow enough to make it just barely usable for me in one hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MZ4NI"&gt;What I can’t help but notice is how far OnePlus has come in build quality. The glass on the front and back curves into the aluminum rail on the edges with no seams at all. It’s well-balanced, beautiful, and solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Top: OnePlus 9 Pro; bottom: Galaxy S20 Plus. Both phones have similarly curved glass and molded aluminum rails." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTvlAj6Darv2g-R9N0QJ9O44UZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389264/oneplus9progalaxys20plus.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top: OnePlus 9 Pro. Bottom: Galaxy S20 Plus. Both phones have similarly curved glass and molded aluminum rails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It has a three-stage ringer switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAp70uBpGGWtFpcHUizuZRTE4QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388880/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0054_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has a three-stage ringer switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYWqZR"&gt;It’s also the spitting image of a Galaxy S20 Plus. Shift a couple of buttons around, move the selfie camera to the middle, and swap out the logo, and it’s the same design. I get that there are only so many ways to sandwich curved glass and aluminum together, but it’s uncanny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSjJvc"&gt;To be fair, OnePlus does keep some of its identity in the three-stage ringer switch, which easily lets you toggle between a ringer, vibration, and fully silent. It may still be my favorite feature on OnePlus phones, and I remain baffled as to why more Android phone makers don’t adopt a physical ringer switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVSttu"&gt;Speaking of vibration, the haptics on the OnePlus 9 Pro aren’t sloppy at all, unlike many Android phones. Unfortunately, the trade-off is that they aren’t very strong; I often can’t feel it vibrate in my pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6vr0E"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has the top-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is paired with eight gigs of RAM on the 128GB model. You can’t get it in a smaller screen size, but you can spend $100 more to get 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. There’s no microSD card slot for storage expansion in either model. What you get is what you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMXoXr"&gt;It supports both Sub-6 and millimeter-wave (mmWave) styles of 5G, but there’s a significant caveat: the phone supports it, but OnePlus has only managed to land 5G certification from its carrier partner, T-Mobile. If you buy it unlocked, as of now, it will only work with T-Mobile’s 5G network. Everything else will be LTE. AT&amp;amp;T 5G support doesn’t appear to be in the cards at all, and as for Verizon, OnePlus says that it “continues to work with Verizon to certify both the 9 and 9 Pro on its 5G network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus’ wireless warp charger can fully charge the phone in under 45 minutes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyFkyRjI2k4qCPN085Bz4kQTDBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388875/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus’ wireless warp charger can fully charge the phone in under 45 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w5puLi"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro battery and charging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zfl3AK"&gt;For OnePlus, the standout spec is its proprietary charging technology. There’s a 65W charger included in the box, and it can charge up the phone ridiculously fast. The phone’s 4,500mAh battery is actually split in two, which helps further speed charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 65W charger comes in the box (pictured with the regular OnePlus 9)." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bYtldbablBg79ONjjiRExDVLu8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388874/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 65W charger comes in the box (pictured with the regular OnePlus 9).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJcrVY"&gt;If you like, you can spend an additional $69 on OnePlus’ new Warp Charge 50 wireless charger. It charges at 25W, but since the battery is split, it’s essentially the same as charging at 50W, wirelessly. It also works if you set the phone on the charger in landscape mode. With the phone fully dead, it charged completely in 45 minutes. With ambient mode in Google Assistant on, it took a bit longer — but it was still wicked fast compared to other wireless chargers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1P12A6"&gt;That 4,500mAh battery was enough to get me through a full day and a half of moderately heavy usage. However, OnePlus phones do tend to be a little more variable in their battery life depending on use. Spending a day shooting 4K video and pushing the processor with games meant I could kill it with less than four hours of screen-on time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fG6qV"&gt;So while the battery life might not be best in class, the way OnePlus has built its ecosystem for charging means I’m able to top off faster than I can with other phones — provided I use OnePlus’ proprietary chargers, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro has an LTPO OLED screen, which can help with battery life" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5cHhLu_Wn4xSxFlJ9pZp5KWWUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388890/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0066.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has an LTPO OLED screen, which can help with battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X8qQlG"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="OAFOOG"&gt;After wireless charging, the next standout spec on the OnePlus 9 Pro is that 6.7-inch screen. Like Samsung, OnePlus has switched over to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;an LTPO style of OLED&lt;/a&gt;, which can be more power efficient and allows the company to have more control over the refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ9Qor"&gt;The screen can go all the way from 120Hz on down to 1Hz, depending on what’s happening on the display. OnePlus has branded the touch response rate on the screen as “Hyper Touch,” clocked at 360Hz for certain games, and though I am dubious it makes that big a difference for gamers, OnePlus says it could. More consequential is the screen resolution: 1440 x 3216 at 525ppi. You can leave it at that high resolution and have the high refresh rate screen going at the same time. Doing so probably hits battery life, but to me, the point of this max-spec phone is to max the specs, so I didn’t turn down the resolution or the refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yI05D4"&gt;Those are the specs on the screen, but it’s the experience that matters. And again, I think OnePlus has done a remarkable job here. Something about the tuning of the animations in OxygenOS makes this phone feel just a little bit smoother than even Samsung phones. I also appreciate the color tuning — although it’s not as subdued as an iPhone or even a Pixel, it’s more restrained than Samsung’s default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBNXzq7K6YNBtQHo8bKFRoCNvZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388879/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid but has room to improve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0avD9X"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bt7aQC"&gt;Without delving into a lot of history, I will just point out that until very recently, camera quality has been the main downfall for OnePlus phones. It’s a particularly bad way to fall down, too, because often, the clearest and simplest way to compare phones that otherwise look and perform nearly equivalently is to look at the photos they take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95RI9o"&gt;OnePlus knows all of this and wants to position the OnePlus 9 Pro as a heads-up competitor — or at least a viable alternative — to the very best Samsung and even Apple have to offer. So it did a thing a lot of challenger brands do: called in a ringer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G9j19S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Hasselblad partnership is only about color tuning and interface design this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xt3br"&gt;That ringer is Hasselblad, which OnePlus is partnering with to improve its camera results. It will be a multiyear effort, and it’s far from guaranteed it’ll be a fruitful partnership. In fact, most of these sorts of deals don’t really do anything notable when it comes to the camera’s quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhWaA4"&gt;This year, Hasselblad’s participation with OnePlus’ development process amounted to helping the company tune the colors from the camera and lending a bit of its interface to the camera’s Pro mode. Oh, and most importantly for OnePlus, Hasselblad allowed its logo to be stamped next to the lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOkITZ"&gt;I do think there’s some credit due to this color-tuning influence. In the same way that other smartphone brands have a “look” to their photos, I think OnePlus is developing its own. iPhone photos are generally flat and neutral, tending to the warm side of color; Pixel photos contrasty and blue; and Samsung photos have the vibrancy slider set to max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus 9 Pro: indoor with mixed lighting handles color well" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AsREolMsK8SMr90RWIWvZnhRREM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389337/17_LE2125_IMG_20210313_111817.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro: indoor with mixed lighting handles color well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus tends to ramp up blue colors, which is usually fine but can sometimes get the camera into trouble" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6FOH5Nw3MjM6-pT0VtzW7ay7do8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389338/20_LE2125_IMG_20210313_113526.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus tends to ramp up blue colors, which is usually fine but can sometimes get the camera into trouble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus does a good job not adding too much vibrancy when it’s not there in the first place" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XaIF0PK3g-pGh0OMJy-SxrBH9XU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389336/15_LE2125_IMG_20210313_110553.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus does a good job of not adding too much vibrancy when it’s not there in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vFHBSJ"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro’s image output lands mostly in the middle. It tends toward blue, and it definitely lifts up shadows to create more even lighting. Its photos are more striking but less accurate than what you’ll get out of an iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yYysn"&gt;The camera system is good, but it can’t quite match the quality you get from an iPhone 12 Pro Max or Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra — both of which cost more than the OnePlus 9 Pro. It handles a variety of conditions quite well, but sometimes I just had to take an extra beat to compose my shot. It let me better judge what the viewfinder was showing and, honestly, gave me time to try the shot again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ps0XCc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10406526"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GnGiG3"&gt;As usual with smartphone cameras, I think the difference comes down to software. I like the colors the 9 Pro produces, but sometimes it just tries too hard and whiffs. Similarly, OnePlus seems to want to bring a little of that Pixel contrast magic to bear but instead just oversharpens. And lightening shadows is sometimes laudable, but not when it adds completely unnecessary and distracting image noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera can try too hard to brighten shadows, introducing noise" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CF7YOM7t6e5tB0A06yC8faoLao4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389355/18_LE2125_IMG_20210313_112304.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera can try too hard to brighten shadows, introducing noise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera oversharpens sometimes, too. Take a look at the fringing around the runners on the lake in this ultrawide shot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDooOLmKNWq0aQR0K3UtcKZlt6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389354/06_LE2125_IMG_20210311_160459.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera oversharpens sometimes, too. Take a look at the fringing around the runners on the lake in this ultrawide shot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jmns55"&gt;The main camera uses a new 48-megapixel Sony sensor with OIS, though when I pressed OnePlus to tell me what exactly that sensor brings to the table, I didn’t really get a clear answer. You can shoot 12-bit RAW images in the Pro mode (which is two bits more than last year, if you’re keeping count). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noaYb1"&gt;That’s all nice, but the interface on Pro mode is what gets me. You can clearly see what’s set to manual and what’s in auto mode. It’s simple and easy to use, too. Best of all is focus peaking, which draws little lines over the part of the image that’s in focus. It is a lot clearer and more fun to use than the tap-to-focus you need to use on other phones. (You can do that here, too, of course.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qMoum"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro’s other cameras include a big, 50-megapixel ultrawide with a sensor that’s quite a lot nicer than the usual step-down sensors ultrawides get stuck with. I loved using it right up until it went haywire with sharpening. OnePlus put in a custom lens to help with distortion at the edges, and it works as well or better than pure software fixes at keeping straight lines from bowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGBpJb"&gt;The telephoto camera is 3.3x, and it’s not anything special at that zoom level. Beyond it, digital zoom is kind of a mess. It gets pantsed by the S21 Ultra with its periscope-style lens. There’s also a monochrome camera that serves only as a helper for the rest of the system, but I suspect it’s not doing anything especially important. OnePlus did drop the gimmicky and pointless “color filter” camera from last year’s 8 Pro this time around. It will probably drop the monochrome camera next year, if I had to guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="exkR3H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10406545"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TReqrH"&gt;OnePlus’ software-focused Nightscape mode works really well for capturing nighttime shots, although to my tastes, it over-brightens the image. Portrait mode is a mixed bag; heads often look artificially cut out from the blurry background. Again, I can get good shots, but portrait mode was often one of those situations where I needed to try the shot a second time. The selfie camera is passable in good light but falls down fast in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkqOPE"&gt;Unfortunately, video is equally messy. The OnePlus 9 Pro will let you shoot up to 8K 30 or 4K 120, but neither looked good. In fact, regular old 4K 30 has that overprocessed and oversharpened look you see so often from smartphones. The big new feature is improved HDR for backlit subjects, but the effect is minimal at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uC8chD"&gt;That’s a whole pile of critical takes compared to phones that cost more than this phone. But despite the price difference, I think the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera should be held to as high a standard as possible — it’s a flagship phone. It can sometimes hang with the best of the best, and that’s a win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pLQs9q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10406554"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can put all your widgets in a drop-down menu instead of on your home screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZN4UWi"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro performance and OxygenOS 11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iYZu5Q"&gt;Even though the camera is often the main differentiator for an Android phone, it’s not necessarily everybody’s highest priority. When I’m not pixel-peeping photos, the OnePlus 9 Pro is the best Android phone I’ve used so far this year. The performance is great. I’m especially impressed with the optical in-screen fingerprint sensor, which is super fast and doesn’t seem to be thrown by weird lighting conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHyiSQ"&gt;OnePlus’ version of Android is called OxygenOS, and it’s now at version 11. The company has borrowed Samsung’s idea of shifting content down to meet your thumb and added in support for an always-on ambient display. The animations feel smooth, and OnePlus has learned its lesson about how annoying it can be to have apps close in the background too often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bWqNDM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OnePlus has a more elegant version of Android than Samsung&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOb2Eg"&gt;OnePlus has committed to two major OS updates and three years of bimonthly security updates, which puts it ahead of brands like LG but behind Samsung and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpxgUZ"&gt;You can customize a few things like the font and icons, too. My favorite customization is an ambient display mode that displays a colorful bar that shows how often you’ve been using your phone throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXAAvg"&gt;One feature borrowed from Apple and / or Microsoft is the ability to put your widgets into a separate panel so they’re not littering your main home screen, accessible via a quick swipe down. I love it, but I wish it wasn’t mapped to the same thing other Android phones use to quickly bring down notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIRq8d"&gt;Mostly, though, OxygenOS just feels &lt;em&gt;chill&lt;/em&gt;, especially compared to Samsung. OnePlus isn’t pushing its own ecosystem of apps and services (though with a new OnePlus Watch coming, perhaps that may change). It’s also not festooning its own apps with advertisements, unlike Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="waqTIv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10406439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="p8uB5Z"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is not a “flagship killer.” It’s a flagship. Although it still costs a little less than its top-tier competitors, it nevertheless is a pricey phone that makes a lot of promises. Mostly, it delivers on them. Even though a tiny fraction of customers buy OnePlus phones compared to Apple and Samsung, the company has built a track record long enough to deserve its status as an established brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GhSKH3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The regular OnePlus 9 is a fine choice for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NA5uRY"&gt;If you’re considering one of the new OnePlus phones, I am actually hard-pressed to make the case for the OnePlus 9 Pro over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;regular OnePlus 9, which Allison Johnson reviewed.&lt;/a&gt; The regular OnePlus 9 is $240 less, and the things you lose are mostly the nice-to-haves that justify the Pro’s existence: fast wireless charging, OIS, a telephoto lens, mmWave 5G, and the slightly larger screen. The cheaper OnePlus 9 lacks telephoto, but its other cameras take photos that are nearly equivalent to the pro. It has a high refresh rate screen, fast wired charging, wireless charging (though it’s not as fast), and most importantly, a nice OnePlus software experience with great performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mMX9ur"&gt;The reason to opt for the 9 Pro over the regular 9 is in some ways the same reason you’d opt for a OnePlus phone over a Samsung phone in the first place: it’s just a little nicer and a little different than what everybody else has in their pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XT0FQI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The OnePlus 9 gives up a few of the 9 Pro’s features but costs $240 less&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="IFjJBH"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a very good phone that holds its own against other (often more expensive) flagships. It has all the things that truly matter: a great screen, excellent performance, good battery life, and a capable camera. But for better or worse, it still doesn’t feel quite like a device that’s well-suited for the mainstream. It misses a couple of features present on the competition like a stabilized main camera and broad 5G support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9PITs"&gt;Instead, it offers some neat but arguably not as useful extras, like really fast charging and an excellent ultrawide camera. It leaves this device in somewhat unusual territory: it’s good and well-priced, but it’s not the Android flagship I’d recommend to just anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6QDFvf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10406322"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WeBHsj"&gt;What’s here is good; it’s what’s missing that gives me pause. For example, it’s a 5G phone that, at launch, won’t work on two of the three major US carriers’ 5G networks: Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T. OnePlus says it’s working with Verizon on 5G certification but wasn’t able to share any details about the situation with AT&amp;amp;T. (T-Mobile is selling the OnePlus 9 directly, and as a result, it has no problems with the carrier’s low and mid-band 5G service.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ge5BFF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HDWb3J"&gt;Likewise with the main camera’s lack of optical image stabilization, you may end up with photos that look a bit soft due to camera shake in moderate to dim light. Taking a few extra shots will usually ensure that there’s a tack-sharp one in the bunch, but that workaround doesn’t suit everybody or every situation. OIS would also be a big help with keeping video steady; the 9 offers decent electronic stabilization for this, but results aren’t as smooth as when both technologies are used together. You might know already if you can live with these quirks, but they’re too significant to make this a top all-around pick for the average smartphone buyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qLAqX"&gt;If you’re curious how the 9 stacks up against the higher specs of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;9 Pro sibling&lt;/a&gt;, I have better news: if you opt for this less expensive model, you give up very little. The 9 offers the same Snapdragon 888 processor, top 120Hz refresh rate, 50-megapixel ultrawide camera, and Gorilla Glass back panel as the 9 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0XHjwE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It adds up to a phone that feels like a small step forward, rather than a confident stride into mainstream flagship territory&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HIz4ke"&gt;Here’s what you don’t get versus the more expensive model: a newer 48-megapixel Sony IMX789 main camera sensor, a telephoto camera, main camera stabilization, fast wireless charging, a higher-res screen, millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G, and in some cases, an official IP water and dust resistance rating. Sure, some of those features would be nice to have, but for an additional $240? Personally, I’d save the extra cash and go with the 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oS8IAs"&gt;Compared to last year’s OnePlus 8, the 9 is a little more expensive but also a little better equipped. While you do gain some useful features including 15W Qi wireless charging, a refresh rate boost from 90Hz to 120Hz, Qualcomm’s latest processor, and a bit bigger battery, these feel like necessary evolutions. It adds up to a phone that feels like a small step forward, rather than a confident stride into mainstream flagship territory. That’s a shame because OnePlus had an opportunity to own this premium midrange category that it helped create with a clear standout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 has a slightly smaller screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7cetFjAfrRKtYErNsip_4ScK7t4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388898/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0077_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 (right) features a slightly smaller 6.55-inch screen compared to the 6.7-inch 9 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c4SfW0"&gt;OnePlus 9 screen and build quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="H9XEPs"&gt;OnePlus likes to make a big phone, and the 9 is no exception. It has a 6.55-inch screen with a 20.1:9 aspect ratio, giving it somewhat tall proportions that make it a little more comfortable to use one-handed. The 1080p OLED display is slightly lower-res than the 1440 screen on the 9 Pro, but it offers the same excellent 120Hz refresh rate. This makes animations and scrolling appear very smooth. If you’re coming from a phone with a standard 60Hz display, using the OnePlus 9 will feel a little more slick and polished. Fancy, even. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vEhMG3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a grownup-looking device with fit and finish well-suited to its $730-plus price&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2FmbMm"&gt;You’ll find Gorilla Glass on the front and back panels of the phone, meaning there’s no step down in build quality from the Pro in that sense — the frame is plastic rather than aluminum, but it’s not something I noticed or minded in my time using the device. The 9 does use a flat display rather than the slightly curved screen on the Pro, but that feels like a matter of aesthetics to me and I don’t find it to be a great loss. The flat design is also less prone to accidental touches at the edges of the screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"&gt;like we saw on the OnePlus 8 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. As on the 9 Pro, there’s an optical in-screen fingerprint reader that’s generally quick and reliable. I noticed some failures but not at a high enough rate to bother me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWi63x"&gt;Overall, it’s not a bold or groundbreaking design, but it’s a grownup-looking device with fit and finish well-suited to its $730-plus price. Glass on both the front and back make it feel suitably premium, and the branding on the black unit I tested is tasteful and understated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USYqcV"&gt;The OnePlus 9 sold through T-Mobile — the only US carrier that will offer it directly — will include an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, which is the standard in this flagship class right now. The unlocked version will not have that official rating, but OnePlus tells us that the hardware is all the same. I used the 9 in some of Seattle’s ever-present drizzle and nothing bad happened. So depending on how you buy it, the 9 may not have that stamp of approval, but you can rest assured it’s just as robust as its peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRMyA05Rd4BDDSKSx5GMGL4lo0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388897/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0073_Edit.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mAOYOJ"&gt;OnePlus 9 performance and UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="49bvOd"&gt;The OnePlus 9 uses a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 888 processor and either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. It’s as good as you’ll find in an Android phone at any price right now, so its presence in a $730 phone is a major pro for the 9. I tested the version with 12GB RAM, which is $830, so bear that in mind. But let me tell you — this thing is slick as all heck. Apps load quickly, and jumping from app to home screen and back is seamless. I couldn’t really throw anything at it to slow it down. This is a spot where the OnePlus 9 shines, and it’s an important one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSSAxH"&gt;The 9 turns in good battery performance, too. The 120Hz screen draws more power than last year’s 90Hz display, but this year’s battery is a tad bigger, too: 4,500mAh compared to 4,300mAh. I don’t have any battery complaints, though my typical use is on the moderate side. It’ll get most users through a day and then some, and for those whose use is heavier, OnePlus has another feature to help out: fast wired charging. The included fast charger will take the battery from 1 to 100 percent in a scant 29 minutes. That’s fast enough for you to leave it unplugged overnight and just charge it up during a typical morning routine. Wireless charging is supported, too, which is a nice addition over last year’s model. The 9 is compatible with standard Qi chargers for up to 15W speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="JlRkCs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Being confined to 4G on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon right now isn’t a big deal, but it would be a significant drawback when the carriers start deploying their C-band frequencies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KQENoy"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a 5G phone, as all 2021 flagships must be, but it has a complicated relationship with the technology. The phone supports the more widely used Sub-6GHz frequencies and is certified for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;C-band when it starts arriving in late 2021&lt;/a&gt; but not ultra-fast, super-scarce mmWave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I58Eem"&gt;Not having mmWave is no great loss, but there’s the aforementioned incompatibility with Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G networks. If you buy the phone unlocked, it’ll be LTE only on either of those networks, at least for now. OnePlus says it’s actively working with Verizon on 5G certification, but it couldn’t say if AT&amp;amp;T 5G compatibility would be added with a future software update. Being confined to 4G on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon right now isn’t a big deal — honestly, it’s probably for the best since their 5G networks aren’t very good yet — but it would be a significant drawback when the carriers start deploying their newly acquired C-band frequencies and 5G performance improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="On5Mzo"&gt;The OnePlus 9 ships with the company’s OxygenOS UI built on Android 11. It feels modern and clean, with a few pre-downloaded apps but otherwise not much bloatware. It’s a grownup UI that doesn’t make you look at an ad to check the weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajrcLl"&gt;OnePlus will supply the 9 and 9 Pro with two major Android upgrades and three years of security patches — a healthy life span, but not exactly best in class. Samsung’s flagships get a minimum of four years of security updates, though they slow down toward the end of the device’s life span, while Google provides three years of updates and security patches for Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vJcm5i8ToUvTwCsSFLeezfrkhok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388885/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0060.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 9 features main and ultrawide rear cameras, plus a monochrome sensor for additional black-and-white information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7P6B0H"&gt;OnePlus 9 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZTcSsk"&gt;The OnePlus’ rear camera array, relocated to the upper left of the back panel this year, includes a 48-megapixel main camera, 50-megapixel ultrawide, and 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. On the front is a 16-megapixel selfie camera. It’s a lot of cameras, but not outside the norm for phones in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXxeIG"&gt;The main camera sensor is the Sony IMX689 used by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"&gt;OnePlus 8 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. We liked its image quality in that device, and that’s still generally the case here. Combined with the new Hasselblad color tuning, the OnePlus 9 takes very nice images in good light, and I think does a particularly good job with landscapes. This much-touted “natural” color is fine but didn’t blow me away; it seems prone to occasional oversaturation and white balance misses just as much as any other smartphone’s image processing. It’s certainly not a reason on its own to run out and buy the 9 or 9 Pro, but it hasn’t hurt the output either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FHb2BJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not a reason on its own to buy the 9 or 9 Pro, but it hasn’t hurt the output either&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3fvxDK"&gt;For those who want to get hands-on with image processing rather than leaving it up to the camera, RAW shooting is available. The 9 and 9 Pro shoot 12-bit DNG files via the Pro mode in the camera app. These files contain more color information than the typical 10-bit RAW file you’ll get from most other phone cameras, which is helpful for post-processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYr2sw"&gt;But unlike with a traditional camera, shooting RAW on a phone misses out on the multi-frame image processing that it applies in its standard JPEG mode, which is often better for the final image than editing a single RAW file — even a 12-bit one. It’s a feature that sounds good on paper, and some dedicated mobile photographers might appreciate it, but not one that I can get excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VtOCBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10406484"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="opIP1R"&gt;The 50-megapixel ultrawide chip puts out very nice 12-megapixel images. This camera uses  a new freeform lens featuring a nontraditional design to provide a wide view with minimal distortion. It also uses a 1/1.56-inch sensor that is substantially bigger than what you’ll find on the iPhone 12 and Galaxy S21’s ultrawide cameras. Ultrawide cameras can sort of feel like an afterthought, and this one doesn’t, which I really appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNKmz0"&gt;Back to the main camera, though: it’s good in bright light, but darker conditions like dusk or dim interiors are a challenge. These are the kinds of conditions where optical image stabilization can be a big help keeping things sharp, but unlike the 9 Pro and virtually all of its competitors, the 9 only offers less robust electronic image stabilization. I saw this crop up in a set of portrait mode shots taken outside in dim light that came out a little soft. I got one sharp photo out of the bunch, but I suspect OIS would have helped improve my hit rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y5mU3i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What’s missing from that stack of cameras and sensors is a telephoto camera&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j6ifaR"&gt;On the video side, the 9 supports 8K recording at 30p for up to five minutes per clip. Recording at 4K and 1080 is also offered at 60p or 30p. At 30p in either 4K or 1080 mode, you can enable HDR, though I didn’t see a meaningful difference in dynamic range with it on or off. The OnePlus 9 Pro includes a newer DOL-HDR mode that combines frames of different exposures, which should give better performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNgY3g"&gt;What’s missing from that stack of cameras and sensors is a telephoto camera, which puts the OnePlus 9 on par with the iPhone 12, but behind what Samsung’s S21 and a lot of other phones offer now. There’s still a 2x digital zoom shortcut in the camera app interface. Photos taken this way work okay in a pinch, but there’s an obvious softness if you look closely at them — it really isn’t a great substitute for an actual telephoto camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtPUw9"&gt;Oh, and that 2-megapixel monochrome camera isn’t one you can shoot with directly. As in previous OnePlus phones, its job is to supply additional information when using the monochrome filter mode with the main camera. If it makes a difference, we can’t tell and would much rather just have a telephoto camera next year instead, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yBzo6LDD11ablHx1NwbHiWKMKXc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388873/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0041_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9’s included fast charger is one of its unique features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JtZil6"&gt;The OnePlus 9 checks all the boxes required of a 2021 flagship phone: Snapdragon 888 processor, great high-refresh screen, good battery performance, and cameras aplenty. You’ll get top-of-the-line performance for about $100 less than the other base model flagships. That in itself is a great reason to consider the OnePlus 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNkZBX"&gt;But it’s not the phone I would recommend to absolutely everyone. Its unique propositions feel a little niche to me. Fast charging is neat, with lots of appeal to heavy phone users and travelers, but I think a lot of people are just fine with their overnight charging routine. I love that there’s an above-average ultrawide camera, but I’m probably in the minority here. And the Hasselblad color tuning is fine but nothing remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F9UdGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll get top-of-the-line performance for about $100 less than the other base model flagships&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9of1pT"&gt;What should be easy to recommend — a well-priced phone with great performance — instead carries some significant ifs. &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; extremely fast charging or the bigger screen are especially appealing, then the 9 is a great option. But &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you’re on AT&amp;amp;T and you’d like to keep your phone for a few years, proceed with caution. &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; you want top-notch camera capabilities, or &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; fast charging feels more like a nice-to-have than a must, then you might want to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hzZKs1"&gt;I think with a little tuning, the OnePlus 9 could have been an absolutely killer premium midrange device. And I still think it’s a great device for a subset of the smartphone-buying population. There are just one too many ifs for it to earn the title of class-leader. The OnePlus 9 is very good, but it isn’t a runaway winner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="E25vZ9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10406439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J3SgkP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 23rd, 11:15AM PT: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added detail about the OnePlus 9’s use of plastic rather than metal in the device’s frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The $159 OnePlus Watch is OnePlus’ first smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02M8-WfRVVMf7V-xMkUDRjrTcOI=/197x0:2258x1374/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69011777/Screen_Shot_2021_03_23_at_10.49.38_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zlw2wM"&gt;It’s taken years, but OnePlus is finally getting in the smartwatch game with the newly announced OnePlus Watch, starting at $159. The new watch (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339768/oneplus-watch-image-reveal-design-leak-smartwatch-wearable"&gt;as was revealed last week&lt;/a&gt;) has a round design that looks similar to a regular wristwatch, instead of the oblong rectangle popularized by the Apple Watch and its imitators, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21167560/oppo-watch-apple-china-price-release-date-smartwatch"&gt;like the Oppo Watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XV7oM7"&gt;The case itself is stainless steel, measures 46mm, and features two buttons on the side (one of which features the OnePlus logo). It’ll be available in two colors: silver and black. The display is a 1.39-inch OLED panel at 326ppi, with sapphire glass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEpQRI"&gt;The watch will also feature a version of OnePlus’ Warp Charge system (promising a week of battery life off a 20-minute charge). OnePlus promises that the watch should last up to two weeks on a single charge or up to one week for heavier users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDD28W"&gt;Specs-wise, the OnePlus Watch features 1GB of RAM, 4GB of internal storage, and integrated speakers. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS are all built in, but there’s no cellular option. If you want connectivity on the watch, you’ll have to be connected to a nearby phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WX-LDQ9Qn6u5Ik0ZcJTDZSpbosQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391561/Screen_Shot_2021_03_23_at_10.59.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zdlcDu"&gt;Fitness is also a big part of the OnePlus Watch. It’ll offer over 110 workout modes, offer built-in GPS, and feature IP68 water and dust resistance. Additionally, the OnePlus Watch features internal storage for music, which allows users to store up to 500 songs to listen to over their Bluetooth headphones when out on a run, even if they don’t have their phone with them. The OnePlus Watch can also automatically detect and track workouts as well as monitor sleep, stress, blood oxygen saturation, and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOgJjd"&gt;OnePlus isn’t using Wear OS for the OnePlus Watch, though. As the company had announced before the event, it’ll use RTOS-style software setup (similar to companies like Fitbit), with a companion app that will allow it to connect to your phone to receive calls and notifications. (An iOS app for Apple users is promised for the future, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fs8et"&gt;That means things like app selection and custom watchfaces will be largely limited to whatever OnePlus can build in-house — so no third-party apps, at least for now. That said, to start, there’ll be dozens of watchface options to choose from (with additional customization choices to add more style options), so users will have some flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFJ2Qq"&gt;The OnePlus Watch can also be connected to a OnePlus TV (where available), allowing it to be used as a remote. And if you happen to fall asleep when you’re watching TV on OnePlus’ set, the watch can automatically turn off the TV after it detects that you’ve fallen asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tZfDzu-aaWuUmihXAlq9PJf5XDI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391527/image__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1hhO5E"&gt;The company also announced a limited edition model made out of a cobalt alloy, which it says is twice as hard as stainless steel. OnePlus says that the Cobalt Limited Edition will be “coming soon,” but the company isn’t providing a price yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7lpmW"&gt;The OnePlus Watch will start at $159 and will be available starting on April 14th from OnePlus’ website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro announced with Hasselblad-branded cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OeYXZgPJbIWfPECBK0-ELn27kws=/88x0:1048x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69011581/diEE3C19Xw.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xqNyHx"&gt;OnePlus has announced the first two phones in its OnePlus 9 series, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. As expected, the OnePlus 9 Pro is the flagship, designed to face off against the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra and the iPhone 12 Pro Max, while the OnePlus 9 is its lower-specced and slightly more affordable counterpart. The OnePlus 9 costs $729 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or $829 with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Meanwhile, the 9 Pro costs $969 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or $1,069 with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in the US. Both phones will go on sale on April 2nd, with preorders starting March 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3vSdN"&gt;OnePlus spent much of its announcement talking about the cameras on the new phones, which have been developed in partnership with Hasselblad. OnePlus says the colors have been tuned to look more natural and that the ultrawide sensor on the 9 Pro and 9 is one of the biggest to ever ship on a smartphone. The ultrawide uses a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor that’s 1/1.56” in size with an aperture of f/2.2. Meanwhile, the 9 Pro’s main Sony IMX789 sensor has a resolution of 48 megapixels and is 1/1.43” in size. (The regular 9 has a Sony IMX689 sensor, but it has the same resolution of 48 megapixels.) Both have a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor and 16-megapixel selfie camera, but only the 9 Pro has an 8-megapixel telephoto. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGFZPvoncqnr6gWodNU-3jAv-Sw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391436/8yiucZD2Zt.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3YEtKp"&gt;On the software side, OnePlus has added a Hasselblad Pro Mode that gives additional control over photography settings and includes a focus peaking feature. In terms of video, both can shoot at up to 8K at 30fps, while the 9 Pro can also do 4K at 120fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwoVDH"&gt;As previously announced, the 9 Pro has a 1440p 120Hz curved display that makes use of LPTO technology to adjust its refresh rate between 1 and 120Hz based on the content being displayed on-screen, reducing power consumption by “up to 50 percent.” OnePlus also claims it should feel more responsive to use in games that support its Hyper Touch technology. The screen has a maximum brightness of 1300 nits and supports HDR10+. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 9 has a flat rather than curved display. It’s not LTPO, it’s slightly less bright at 1,100 nits, and it’s also lower resolution at 1080p. It’s still got a refresh rate of 120Hz, however.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-0-yWe0YzK36MnHN7GAouPfwD50=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391520/HFAkFchdt7.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m7Mplv"&gt;Internally, the 9 Pro and 9 are powered by a Snapdragon 888 processor and have bigger vapor chambers to keep them running cooler for longer. They’re available with either 8 or 12GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of storage. They support Warp Charge 65T, which OnePlus claims should be able to charge the phones’ 4,500mAh batteries to 100 percent in under half an hour. The 9 Pro can also charge wirelessly at up to 50W and is designed to be able to wirelessly charge, regardless of whether it’s oriented in portrait or landscape. Meanwhile, the 9 can wirelessly charge at up to 15W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ljV9rx"&gt;In terms of colors, the OnePlus 9 Pro will be available in black, silver, and green, while the OnePlus 9 will be available in black, light purple, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pikmin is the next AR game from the makers of Pokémon Go</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qq-W4prKzzLKpAHXV4Nd-NaaLpU=/128x0:896x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69009287/Niantic_Nintendo_Pikmin_app.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AjIMq3"&gt;Niantic, developer of the smash hit &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, has announced a new partnership with Nintendo. The first new game from the collaboration will be a mobile augmented reality game based on Nintendo’s popular &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; franchise, and it will launch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyLthC"&gt;Details are thin right now, &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/nintendo-apps-partnership/?hl=en"&gt;but Niantic says that&lt;/a&gt; “the app will include gameplay activities to encourage walking and make walking more delightful.” If you want to receive more information about the new game as it’s available, &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/newappsignup/"&gt;you can sign up here&lt;/a&gt; to get updates. The new &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; AR game will be the first developed by Niantic’s Tokyo Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0mavJQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're overjoyed to make new memories with our partners at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; and YOU!    Imagine exploring the world through the wonder of AR and alongside all of your pals - including your new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pikmin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pikmin&lt;/a&gt; friends! Learn more about our partnership here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/TiQ10S8kMR"&gt;https://t.co/TiQ10S8kMR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/YUpp4P33NA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YUpp4P33NA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Niantic, Inc. (@NianticLabs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NianticLabs/status/1374148894028873729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="psSbcs"&gt;“Niantic’s AR technology has made it possible for us to experience the world as if &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; are secretly living all around us”, Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210323.html"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Based on the theme of making walking fun, our mission is to provide people a new experience that’s different from traditional games. We hope that the &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; and this app will become a partner in your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfadaI"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; franchise is all about exploring a very Earth-like planet with packs of the adorable Pikmin creatures, so a Niantic-made &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; game about walking and exploring the world around you makes a lot of sense. The latest game in the &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; series is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355506/pikmin-3-deluxe-nintendo-switch-release-date"&gt;Nintendo Switch’s &lt;em&gt;Pikmin 3 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an upgraded version of the 2013 game first released for the Wii U.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilQOxk"&gt;Niantic didn’t say what other games it will be making with Nintendo, but it sounds like the two companies have secured some kind of long-term partnership. “We’re honored that Nintendo has chosen Niantic to be its publisher of real-world AR applications,” Niantic said. More details about upcoming apps will be revealed “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5nAEJ"&gt;Niantic is best-known for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, the hugely popular mobile AR game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/6/12113802/pokemon-go-release-date-us-ios-android-app-available"&gt;released in July 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The game is still quite popular despite being nearly five years old, although Niantic has had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178230/pokemon-go-coronavirus-niantic-updates-temporary-discounts-inside"&gt;make some changes&lt;/a&gt; to the game while many have been staying inside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22189424/pokemon-go-covid-2020-safety"&gt;due to the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Those changes didn’t stop &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; from generating money hand over fist, however — 2020 was the game’s biggest year yet, surpassing $1 billion in revenue as of November, according to &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-one-billion-revenue-2020"&gt;app analytics firm Sensor Tower&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
