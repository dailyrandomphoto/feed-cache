    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 780G chipset promises more flagship features for less</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1rTouLyZH7-32uTWAeoRpmEiqqE=/0x44:2266x1555/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023942/Screen_Shot_2021_03_25_at_9.53.34_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TZbFC"&gt;Qualcomm has announced its latest 7-series processor, the Snapdragon 780G, which trickles down features from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;company’s flagship Snapdragon 888 chipset&lt;/a&gt;, while still offering manufacturers (and, by extension, consumers) a more affordable phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzR4xq"&gt;The 780G takes the new top slot in the 7-series lineup, replacing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995714/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-chip-affordable-5g-phones-processor-low-price"&gt;765G&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/11/21252114/qualcomm-snapdragon-768g-5g-processor-765g-improvements-cpu-gpu-update"&gt;768G&lt;/a&gt; (the latter being largely a frequency-boosted version of the former). Obviously, there’s the usual boost in performance: the 780G features Qualcomm’s Kryo 670 CPU, which the company says offers a 40 percent boost in performance, and a new Adreno 642 GPU for up to 50 percent faster graphics compared to the 765 model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="437hTs"&gt;But the 780G also enables some new functionality, like the Spectra 570 triple ISP (image signal processor), which, like the Snapdragon 888, allows for phones to capture three simultaneous photo or video feeds at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpoyQ6"&gt;And like the Snapdragon 888, the Snapdragon 780G features Qualcomm’s sixth-generation AI engine running on a new Hexagon 770 processor, which can perform 12 trillion operations per second (TOPS) — twice that of its predecessor, even if it still pales in comparison to the 26 TOPS that the Snapdragon 888 offers. It also features the second-gen Sensing Hub that Qualcomm debuted on its flagship chipset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2p74Z"&gt;Lastly, the 780G has improved connectivity features, with an integrated Snapdragon X53 5G modem that promises up to 3.3Gbps speeds on Sub-6 GHz 5G networks. And like its pricier sibling, the 780G adds support for Wi-Fi 6E, meaning phones with the new chip will be able to take advantage of the fastest Wi-Fi speeds around as well as Bluetooth 5.2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6TEYv"&gt;The first phones with the Snapdragon 780G are expected to release in the second quarter of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five-year-old Fairphone 2 getting updated to almost three-year-old Android 9</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxzWufzeiJ-OPelFEGoc64fl6XM=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023493/jvincent_160412_1017_8176.0.0.1484136509.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Farphone 2 was originally released five years ago.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by James Vincent / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0b6Xx"&gt;Sustainable smartphone manufacturer Fairphone has gotten Google’s certification for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fen%2F2021%2F03%2F25%2Fandroid9-fairphone2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22349953%2Ffairphone-2-android-9-update-sustainable-long-term-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its Android 9 update&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/13/11414936/fairphone-2-review"&gt;Fairphone 2&lt;/a&gt;. Getting certification for a nearly three-year-old version of Android doesn’t sound that impressive until you realize that it’s running on a phone originally released five years ago when it ran Android 5. The roll-out of the software starts today, and will continue until April 18th, Fairphone says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjzkIV"&gt;It’s a length of support that’s basically unheard of among Android phone manufacturers. Although Fairphone 2 owners aren’t going to be able to enjoy the latest Android 11 features, the more important thing is that they’re running a version of Android that’s still officially supported. Google’s &lt;a href="https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-03-01"&gt;latest Android security bulletin&lt;/a&gt; from this month includes multiple fixes for security issues in Android 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FB9yH0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In order to get certification, we had to pass approximately 477,000 Google tests”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jfQlPs"&gt;The Fairphone 2’s Android 9 update has been in the works for a while and was released in beta &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fen%2F2020%2F06%2F18%2Ffairphone-2-gets-android-9%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22349953%2Ffairphone-2-android-9-update-sustainable-long-term-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;way back in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Fairphone outlined the challenges it had in trying to support such an old phone, including the fact that Qualcomm no longer provides support for the processor inside the device, a Snapdragon 801, which originally announced back in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAK1pH"&gt;“To get Google certification for Android 9 for Fairphone 2 just as we hit five years of support for the smartphone is a huge achievement for Fairphone,” says CEO of Fairphone Eva Gouwens. “In order to get certification, we had to pass approximately 477,000 Google tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="824F4E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we’re celebrating a milestone. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fairphone?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Fairphone&lt;/a&gt; 2 gets a major software upgrade 5 years after launch. We started Fairphone with a mission to encourage smartphone longevity by disrupting the electronics industry and this signifies that commitment.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/jdpOxZKEHQ"&gt;https://t.co/jdpOxZKEHQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/bQGbj54CEi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bQGbj54CEi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fairphone (@Fairphone) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fairphone/status/1375048421971746818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SwZzZM"&gt;“We want to show the industry that this kind of thing is possible, that a smartphone doesn’t have to be discarded after 2-3 years, we can prolong it’s lifespan,” the CEO added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVEX66"&gt;The only other smartphone manufacturer that offers a similar length of support for its devices is Apple, which last year released iOS 14, its latest phone OS, for its 2015 iPhone 6S. Android manufacturers, while behind Apple, are improving. Samsung now offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security updates for its recent Galaxy devices&lt;/a&gt;, while Google offers three years of updates for its Pixel phones, and OnePlus says it &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/a-notice-about-oxygenos-11-for-our-previous-devices.1351579/"&gt;plans to release Android 11 for its 2018 OnePlus 6 and 6T&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByEc3U"&gt;The Fairphone 2’s update to Android 9 this long after release bodes well for the company’s long-term support of its more recent Fairphone 3 and 3 Plus phones. The company says the phones should be updated to Android 11 in the second half of this year, with “one more major Android upgrade” coming thereafter. Software support and spare parts availability is set to continue until 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arizona Senate skips vote on controversial bill that would regulate Apple and Google app stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12’s OLED screen is excellent." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uaxrmAOr0oIn5bVpoP3Zd_82UVA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69021754/vpavic_4243_20201018_0141.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Px9JIH"&gt;The Arizona State Senate was scheduled to vote on an unprecedented and controversial bill Wednesday that would have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;imposed far-reaching changes on how Apple and Google operate their respective mobile app stores&lt;/a&gt;, specifically by allowing alternative in-app payment systems. But the vote never happened, having been passed over on the schedule without explanation. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;watched every other bill on the schedule be debated and voted on over the senate’s live stream, but Arizona HB2005, listed first on the agenda, never came up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91sY1K"&gt;One notable Apple critic is now accusing the iPhone maker of stepping in to stop the vote, saying the company hired a former chief of staff to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey to broker a deal that prevented the bill from being heard in the Senate and ultimately voted on. This is after the legislation, an &lt;a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/proposed/H.2005COBB.pdf"&gt;amendment to the existing HB2005 law&lt;/a&gt;, passed the Arizona House of Representatives earlier this month in a &lt;a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview?SessionID=123"&gt;landmark 31-29 vote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZo6Kk"&gt;“The big show turned out to be a no show. The bill was killed in mid-air while on the agenda with a backroom deal. Apple has hired the governor’s former chief of staff, and word is that he brokered a deal to prevent this from even being heard,” said Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, a fierce Apple critic who submitted testimony in support of HB2005, on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1374842497000673289"&gt;Twitter this afternoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqFFBr"&gt;Apple declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kTduxV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The big show turned out to be a no show.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzgvhY"&gt;It was well-known prior to today’s scheduled vote that both Apple and Google had hired lobbyists to combat the bill, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/apple-google-lobbyists-arizona-bill"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;because it directly threatened the companies’ industry standard app store commission of 30 percent. If the Arizona bill passed the senate and was signed into law by Ducey, it would have made the state a haven for app makers looking to sidestep the App Store and the Google Play Store’s payment systems, which are the mechanisms the companies use to take their cuts of all app sales and in-app purchases of digital goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2x3kDh"&gt;It could have also caused all sorts of additional headaches for both companies by forcing them to either institute a patchwork system of state-specific enforcement, or by potentially forcing them to stop doing business in Arizona altogether while opening the door to lawsuits against the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV9P5i"&gt;In testimony in front of the Arizona House earlier this month, Apple’s chief compliance officer, Kyle Andeer, argued that the App Store provides enough value to developers to justify the 30 percent cut. “The commission has been described by some special interests as a ‘payment processing fee’—as if Apple is just swiping a credit card. That’s terribly misleading. Apple provides developers an enormous amount of value — both the store to distribute their apps around the world and the studio to create them. That is what the commission reflects,” Andeer said in written testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7QnRI"&gt;“Yet this bill tells Apple that it cannot use its own check-out lane (and collect a commission) in the store we built,” he added. “This would allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free — even if they’re selling digital goods, even if they’re making millions or even billions of dollars doing it. The bill is a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="p9yUEK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A number of Democrats publicly objected to the bill &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nV7sfp"&gt;It’s worth noting that the bill also faced considerable opposition in the Arizona House not by big business-loving Republicans, but instead by Democrats. A number of Democrats publicly objected to the bill and voted against it on the grounds it was potentially unconstitutional for interfering with interstate commerce and also that it interjected Arizona into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;California legal fight between game developer Epic Games and both Apple and Google&lt;/a&gt; over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the Android and iOS platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj59JQ"&gt;The bill, which was primarily sponsored by Rep. Regina Cobb (R-5), is one of many that have popped up in state legislatures around the country challenging Apple’s and Google’s longstanding policies around the mobile app economy. These bills can be traced back to growing antitrust pressure against Big Tech mounting in both Europe and Washington, DC, and they &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-next-big-tech-fights-are-in-state-capitals-11615714201"&gt;represents a new local and state front in the ongoing fight over the tech industry’s outsize power&lt;/a&gt; and whatever methods lawmakers may employ to try and reign it in. Other arenas include California, where Epic launched its own fight, and the European Union. which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;launched antitrust investigations into the App Store and Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt; over anticompetitive claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJ2Wes"&gt;Both Apple and Google operate the two most dominant app stores in the world, and while the Google Play Store allows alternative app stores and therefore alternative payments systems, Apple does not. That means all digital purchases on iOS are subject to Apple’s mandated 30 percent cut, or in some cases a reduced 15 percent cut, though Apple has been criticized for cutting secret deals, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;those it has made with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; over Prime Video subscriptions and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change"&gt;later in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;, to exempt certain types of purchases when it’s strategically convenient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zivmsg"&gt;Both companies in the last six months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;announced changes&lt;/a&gt; to the commission structure that allows for smaller developers, which represent the vast majority of app makers on both Android and iOS, to claim a reduced 15 percent cut, though that has done little assuage the app store critics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jZ1f51"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These state app store bills have become lobbying battlegrounds between Big Tech and its fiercest critics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5OCugI"&gt;These antitrust proposals, like HB2005, are largely the work of the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF). The CAF is an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453745/spotify-epic-tile-match-coalition-for-app-fairness-apple-app-store-policies-protest"&gt;industry group formed last year&lt;/a&gt; consisting of Epic, Spotify, Tinder parent company Match Group, and dozens of other companies that have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the status quo of the mobile app economy and the app store owners’ ironclad developer agreements. Some of these companies, like Spotify, have for years complained of unfair treatment from Apple and have accused the company of prioritizing its own software over competitors through its use of App Store rules and iOS requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORWNpa"&gt;The CAF began &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/technology/north-dakota-tech-apps.html"&gt;lobbying lawmakers earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, first in North Dakota and now in multiple states including Arizona, to instigate the introduction of bills like HB2005. While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;North Dakota bill failed&lt;/a&gt;, Arizona’s was seen as a more promising alternative because it focused solely on in-app payment systems, while the North Dakota one also mandated that operating system owners allow for alternative app stores, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOSu9z"&gt;“The legislative session is not over. We will continue to push for solutions that will increase choice, support app developers and small businesses and put a stop to monopolistic practices,” said Meghan DiMuzio, the CAF’s executive director, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="982M8k"&gt;Now, the bill’s fate is now in question, and it’s not immediately clear what happened. Rep. Cobb, the bill’s sponsor, did not respond to a request for comment. The Arizona governor’s office and the office of the Arizona State Senate Majority Leader Rick Gray (R-21) also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Er7bnR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 24th, 10:12PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from the Coalition for App Fairness. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple picked a truly embarrassing time to wrongly reject a simple app update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Yt7HYh4fyFtuk8YPRZj7Yd-hKg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69021141/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDnlbd"&gt;Apple has a rocky relationship with some iOS developers because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;its seemingly arbitrary decisions over what gets published and when&lt;/a&gt; — and now, because of a dumb miss, it’s being accused of putting profits ahead of human rights in Myanmar by the founder of ProtonMail and ProtonVPN, even though that’s probably not what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0d777E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fblog%2Fapple-blocks-app-updates%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22348961%2Fapple-protonvpn-app-security-update-rejection-myanmar-andy-yen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Proton founder Andy Yen writes&lt;/a&gt; that Apple blocked an important security update to the company’s privacy-protecting ProtonVPN software simply because Apple didn’t like the app’s description, specifically this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ifnRaK"&gt;Whether it is challenging governments, educating the public, or training journalists, we have a long history of helping bring online freedom to more people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="S7sR08"&gt;If you’re having a hard time finding anything objectionable there, you’re not alone — but Apple told Proton it wasn’t okay to encourage “users to bypass geo-restrictions or content limitations.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ic-9MFpvsv7azZgAvWDNllRo0bs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395261/apple_blocks_protonvpn_update.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uEVg5e"&gt;The context here is that VPNs have become a critical tool for protesters in Myanmar to sidestep an huge internet crackdown during the country’s ongoing, bloody military coup. One researcher &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/myanmar-citizens-find-ways-around-crackdown-on-internet?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that VPN use has increased 7,200 percent since early last month, when the government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266031/facebook-myanmar-blocked-instagram-whatsapp-military-coup-protest"&gt;blocked Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/6/22269831/myanmar-orders-block-twitter-facebook-instagram-military-coup"&gt;Twitter, and Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0U1f9I"&gt;I’m with &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/03/apple_protonvpn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;’s John Gruber on this&lt;/a&gt;: I highly doubt Apple made a conscious decision to deny ProtonVPN to Myanmar — the company’s smart enough to know how that would look, and it’s not like the &lt;em&gt;app&lt;/em&gt; was blocked, just a security update. Yen is an outspoken critic of the App Store now, having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;told Congress (and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) last year how he’d been strong-armed by Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6z9VyC"&gt;But the fact it’s just a security update makes the rejection &lt;em&gt;extra dumb&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;because Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299814/apple-app-store-policies-ios-bug-fixes-approval-dispute-appeal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;explicitly said&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; that it’d no longer hold up bug fixes because of these arbitrary guideline violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wKSyY"&gt;Regardless, Apple comes off looking a little like the bad guy here, especially now that ProtonVPN has taken the high road and ceded to Apple’s demands. “Due to the emergency situation in Myanmar, we removed the language about challenging governments which Apple found objectionable, and the app was finally approved,” Yen tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x31FBS"&gt;That perception seems like it’s going to be increasingly hard to fight, now that antitrust scrutiny of Apple’s App Store has been heating up in Congress and the courts, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341511/apple-epic-trial-tim-cook-tim-sweeney-craig-federighi-phil-schiller-mark-rein-testify"&gt;the Epic App Store trial set to begin May 3rd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bj9fA"&gt;It doesn’t help when Apple is seemingly caught breaking its own rules and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app"&gt;needing to apologize&lt;/a&gt;, particularly when it could be seen as retaliation against an app developer (Yen) who’d previously spoken out. Last year, many other developers weren’t willing to come forward and admit they’d been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;forced to add in-app purchases to their apps&lt;/a&gt;, specifically because they feared retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The lower-cost OnePlus 9R is official, and it sounds surprisingly strong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-zItN_GfnjTA-cyQGDGhjtf8Xho=/0x0:1203x802/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019938/colors_banners_color_1_banner0_pc_ae27cc_crop2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9R will be sold in black or blue color options.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Photo: OnePlus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kw3HcE"&gt;Yesterday’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"&gt;OnePlus event&lt;/a&gt; covered the high-end 9 and 9 Pro, but outside of that spotlight, the company has quietly revealed a smartly specced, less-expensive model: the OnePlus 9R. CEO Pete Lau &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338504/oneplus-9r-less-expensive-phone-confirmed-india-5g"&gt;confirmed last week&lt;/a&gt; that the 9R was on the way and would launch in India. It’s now &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2F9r&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22348430%2Foneplus-9r-specs-price-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;listed on the company’s Indian website&lt;/a&gt; starting at ₹39,999, which is about $550. That’s an attractive price indeed, especially considering you’ll get one useful camera feature here that the $729 OnePlus 9 doesn’t have: optical image stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYMf0E"&gt;The 9R doesn’t include the Hasselblad-branded cameras on the 9 and 9 Pro, which isn’t actually a big loss. The 9 and 9 Pro offer newer hardware with features like bigger pixels and a higher-res ultrawide, so you do miss out on some nice upgrades, but the Hasselblad-developed color tuning is nothing special. You do, however, get a stabilized 48-megapixel main camera, which helps reduce blur from camera shake in lower lighting conditions. It’s unfortunately missing from the 9, though it is included on the $969 OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r08mIl"&gt;Other cameras on the 9R include a 16-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. This system is borrowed from the OnePlus 8T, which is wholly capable of good image quality, even though its macro and monochrome cameras aren’t very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cPKPAX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uVsRpJ"&gt;There’s a 6.55-inch 1080p OLED with fast 120Hz refresh rate — same as the OnePlus 9 — and a Snapdragon 870 processor with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. It’s not quite as powerful as the top-notch 888 processor on the 9 and 9 Pro, but it should be more than adequate to keep day-to-day tasks running quickly and smoothly. The 9R is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery with 65W fast wired charging, a handy OnePlus signature feature that delivers a full charge in just under 40 minutes. Wireless charging, however, isn’t offered. Oh, and there’s 5G support, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhBHSr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10410330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4H9RQj"&gt;All told, it looks like a series of smart trade-offs for almost $200 less than the flagship model. Right now, the phone is only confirmed to launch in India, but we’re hopeful that it will make its way to European and North American markets. While OnePlus brought its good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; to the US earlier this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;midrange Nord&lt;/a&gt; never made it stateside. The 9R looks like an excellent candidate to fill in a wide gap between the budget N10 and the basic flagship model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VL2w2Z"&gt;In the meantime, customers in India can preorder the 8GB RAM / 128GB version for ₹39,999 (~$550) or the 12GB RAM / 256GB model for ₹43,999 (~$600).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack quickly removes message invites in its new DM feature over harassment concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeg1Ys5n0Mwhu89m-bhJ-uZBMts=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019365/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KM5YVb"&gt;Slack became a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348126/slack-connect-direct-messaging-dm-company-feature"&gt;public messaging platform this morning&lt;/a&gt; with the wider rollout of a new cross-organizational direct messaging feature, and now it’s already taking steps to mitigate the dangers of operating such a platform without well-thought-out moderation protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vExEfT"&gt;The company says in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348422/slack-connect-direct-message-abuse-harassment"&gt;concerns the feature could be used to send abusive messages or harassment with relative ease&lt;/a&gt;, it’s now disabling the option to send a message alongside an invite. That way, if someone knows your email address, they can’t spam your inbox with potentially abusive messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUEZct"&gt;“After rolling out Slack Connect DMs this morning, we received valuable feedback from our users about how email invitations to use the feature could potentially be used to send abusive or harassing messages. We are taking immediate steps to prevent this kind of abuse, beginning today with the removal of the ability to customize a message when a user invites someone to Slack Connect DMs,” Jonathan Prince, the company’s vice president of communications and policy, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hu7pTT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We made a mistake in this initial roll-out that is inconsistent with our goals for the product and the typical experience of Slack Connect usage.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="drBGDz"&gt;“Slack Connect’s security features and robust administrative controls are a core part of its value both for individual users and their organizations. We made a mistake in this initial roll-out that is inconsistent with our goals for the product and the typical experience of Slack Connect usage. As always, we are grateful to everyone who spoke up, and we are committed to fixing this issue.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Om0TA"&gt;The overall concern, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/44/status/1374737695444901891"&gt;first raised by Twitter employee Menotti Minutillo&lt;/a&gt;, was that the feature did not have robust opt-out protections for individual users and no way to easily prevent people from spamming you with email invites. That seems benign on the surface; if someone wants to harass you and they have your email address, surely they can just send you a harassing email. But Slack Connect bypasses any filters or inbox protections you may use by sending you an email from its feedback@slack.com address with the DM invite, with the email containing whatever message the sender decided to attach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8Gtbmd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;well that was easy as shit to abuse&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- send invite with nasty language&lt;br&gt;- slack emails you w/ the full content of the invite&lt;br&gt;- can't block the emails because they come from a generic slack address that informs you of invites&lt;br&gt;- abuser can keep inviting w/ abusive language &lt;a href="https://t.co/Mw9W5L251a"&gt;https://t.co/Mw9W5L251a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dWEAD7ccRO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dWEAD7ccRO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Menotti Minutillo (@44) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/44/status/1374737695444901891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOfNXU"&gt;That means if your organization uses this feature, you can’t filter it out without fear of missing important Slack emails and you also have no easy way to opt out. (It’s not even clear right now whether the feature can be turned off for individual accounts.) &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/slacks-new-dm-feature-connect-is-thankfully-opt-in/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reported this morning&lt;/a&gt; that the DM feature would be opt-in for a company’s or organization’s IT department to enable at its discretion, but that doesn’t mean it would give individual employee’s active control over who could DM them. And there was also no filtering or monitoring in place that would detect whether someone was sending a hateful message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KVnXV"&gt;While Slack Connect is generally designed for enterprise users whose companies pay for premium features, a Slack Standard plan with Connect enabled costs as little as $8 per month per user (or $6.67 per month per user when billed annually). That suggests someone could exploit these issues rather easily and on the cheap if they choose to, even in the absence of the invite message feature Slack just disabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oU5hVm"&gt;There have been new concerns popping up, too, such as being able to view whatever Slack groups individuals are a part of — either paid or free ones — if that person happens to accept an invite from someone using Slack Connect. A Slack spokesperson has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; these fears are unfounded, as that information is only displayed to the person accepting the invite as a method of determining what Slack workspace they’d like to accept the invitation from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RFLtRD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This has been retracted — turns out it was a mistake by the original tweeter.  However, the information leak around profile listings has been confirmed: &lt;a href="https://t.co/ky3qJYCcv8"&gt;https://t.co/ky3qJYCcv8&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ePoDQuU4En"&gt;https://t.co/ePoDQuU4En&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eleanor Saitta (@Dymaxion) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dymaxion/status/1374786160048898053?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B7FDY2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 24th, 4:12PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added clarification from Slack specifying that the profile information leak concerns regarding DM invites are unfounded, as the information is not made publicly available to the sender. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Realme 8 Pro is a £279 phone with a 108-megapixel camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ubo6dDC2rRLGJ6oq7Zg8yLLVzc8=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69017408/realme_8_Pro_i.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Realme says the slogan printed on the rear panel glows in the dark.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Realme&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rG6WfA"&gt;Officially launching in the UK today, the Realme 8 Pro is a budget device that’s one of the first to use the new Samsung ISOCELL HM2 108-megapixel sensor in its main camera. While similar high-res sensors have been more common in pricier phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, this chip is designed for lower-cost devices like the 8 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpxx9s"&gt;This 108-megapixel chip isn’t the same one used in the S21 Ultra or even last year’s S20 Ultra. It’s a smaller sensor — 1/1.52-inch versus 1/1.33-inch — with slightly smaller 0.7μm pixels. However, it uses the same binning approach to improve light-gathering abilities by combining neighboring pixels into a less noisy 12-megapixel image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mtIclz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10409112"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k13i6x"&gt;The Realme 8 Pro offers a 6.4-inch OLED screen, a Snapdragon 720G processor with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 4,500mAh battery that supports 50W fast charging. The back of the device, which comes in blue and black variants, features some intense Realme branding with the company’s “Dare to Leap” slogan in large fluorescent lettering that — the company claims — glows in the dark. Realme also says the design will appeal to “a new generation of younger users,” which we’ll have to take its word for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1harqp"&gt;The 8 Pro will go on sale on March 31st in the UK for £279 (about $380).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvP5M2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is reportedly developing a Switch-like Android gaming device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikfFenLqMUTOEmShlBnyFzRdLUo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69015226/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9h9d2E"&gt;Qualcomm is reportedly working on an Android-powered, handheld gaming console that’s similar to a Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/23/exclusive-qualcomm-is-planning-an-android-powered-nintendo-switch-knockoff/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374447139921686528?s=20"&gt;editor-in-chief Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt;. The device would be powered by Qualcomm’s silicon, and could hit store shelves by next year — if it ends up being a real product at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWFYl7"&gt;According to the article, which cites images seen by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;, the device would feature detachable, Joy-Con-like controllers, an SD card slot, Android 12, and (of course) 5G. Also noted, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374448185377058821"&gt;corroborated by Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, is a huge 6,000mAh battery. While the physical dimensions aren’t clear, Rahman tweeted that the screen could be 6.65-inches, with a resolution of at least 1080p (the Switch’s screen is 6.2-inches and runs at 720p). He also indicated that it could have a fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueTznf"&gt;In other words, the device sounds like a big smartphone with attached controllers and active cooling, though that may not be a bad thing — the Switch kind of looks like a giant phone too. But it also has a library of great games that only it can play, which is its biggest draw. While there are plenty of good gaming experiences to be had on Android, from retro emulators to games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact, &lt;/em&gt;Qualcomm would have to give customers a reason why they should play those games on a separate device, rather than on their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered gaming phones&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346594/black-shark-4-pro-gaming-phone-shoulder-buttons-specs-price-release-date"&gt;built-in buttons&lt;/a&gt; or controller accessories (or on their regular phones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; with a controller accessory.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SD5rUT"&gt;Or at least, it will if it’s trying to sell the device to people — the &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; article indicates that Qualcomm does want it to be commercially available, potentially at carrier retail stores. It also says that the price target for the device is $300, the same as a full-sized Switch. Currently, the cheapest phone I found with Qualcomm’s flagship 888 processor, the Realme GT 5G, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314043/realme-gt-5g-snapdragon-888-china-price-specs"&gt;costs roughly $430 (and is only sold in China).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0vi1Z"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374448185377058821?s=20"&gt;Rahman notes&lt;/a&gt; that his source believed the product was closer to a reference design than something that would ever see store shelves. Chipmakers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21147912/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-vr-ar-xr-platform-reference-design-announcement"&gt;including Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, often build sample devices to help other manufacturers design around their SOCs or radios. Sometimes, these reference products &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573577/intel-nuc-m15-laptop-news-specs-features-price"&gt;even end up being sold by other companies under different brands&lt;/a&gt;, known as whitelabeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="AfvwLA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s understandable why Qualcomm would be eying the handheld gaming market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cg2LZl"&gt;It is worth noting that the disagreement between the sources could be due to uncertainty from Qualcomm itself — &lt;em&gt;AP &lt;/em&gt;believes this project is almost a year from being finished, so the company may not yet know for sure what it wants this to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2F5l7"&gt;Whether the device ends up as a product or not (it could easily get canceled before it makes a public appearance), it seems like Qualcomm is actually designing and building a dedicated Android gaming device. It’s understandable why the company would be eying the handheld gaming market: it’s been heating up since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/31/4573596/nvidia-shield-review"&gt;Nvidia’s handheld Shield&lt;/a&gt; idea turned into the Nintendo Switch, with high-powered gaming phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;Windows PCs with Switch-like form factors&lt;/a&gt;, and a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/29/21406254/nintendo-modder-custom-wii-game-cube-game-boy"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/16/20906665/analogue-pocket-game-boy-handheld-release-date-price"&gt;classic handheld redesigns&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/1/18648304/playdate-hands-on-panic-keita-takahashi-bitsummit"&gt;novelty pocket gaming systems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You probably haven’t used Yahoo in a while, but what if it cost you money?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3heApRjmByH4d25O6ZmLDtcsO_o=/109x0:1729x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013874/1616443602945.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Verizon Media Group&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SbGYfH"&gt;Yahoo is the legacy Web 1.0 brand that just won’t get dragged and dropped into the trash bin of history, and that’s largely thanks to Verizon’s tireless efforts to keep it going after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/25/12269898/verizon-acquires-yahoo-4-billion-marissa-mayer"&gt;buying the company a few years ago for nearly $5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. This time around, the telecom giant actually wants to &lt;em&gt;expand&lt;/em&gt; the Yahoo brand to all of its consumer-facing web properties with a new series of subscription offerings organized around what it’s calling Yahoo Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-media-subscription-yahoo-plus-05a8abb3-d871-4870-8bba-161a394e8cf1.html"&gt;according to a new report from &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA85FF"&gt;It’s important to mention right now, before we go any further, that the official Verizon Media Group branding provided for Yahoo Plus stylizes it as “Yahoo!+,” with that deranged cousin of the interrobang slapped onto the end of it. Apparently “Oath,” which was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18064172/verizon-oath-media-group-rebrand"&gt;previous incarnation of Verizon Media Group&lt;/a&gt; and technically the division that swallowed Yahoo after the acquisition, was not the end of the company’s poor naming decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4dzrC"&gt;If Yahoo Plus (we’re going to drop the exclamation point and the plus sign) sounds like a streaming service, you’re right. It certainly does, but it’s not. Yahoo Plus will instead be a kind of hybrid media portfolio of various Yahoo products and services, including its finance platform; its very-much-still-alive email platform; its media properties, including &lt;em&gt;Engadget &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch;&lt;/em&gt; and its fantasy sports service, among others. But in all seriousness, there is a sizable business here: Verizon tells &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; it already has 3 million existing customers  of subscription products it offers across services like Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Fantasy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpkVOt"&gt;In some cases, customers of Yahoo Plus will pay for extra premium features, while in others — like the &lt;a href="https://payments.mail.yahoo.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwo-aCBhC-ARIsAAkNQivyRx3IKbEi-yYRii-RPxoqHMlTQXzQ6J8KlojcR5isdVyu98kUGH4aAsenEALw_wcB&amp;amp;ncid=dcm_271619786_465330143_130623920"&gt;existing subscription version of Yahoo Mail&lt;/a&gt; called Yahoo Mail Pro — you’ll pay to remove ads, &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reports. We don’t know how Verizon plans to bundle this as Yahoo Plus, or whether it will charge for each one separately and how much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lbemIq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is “Yahoo!+” better than “go90”? The jury is still out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KjfBQ3"&gt;The bigger picture here is that Verizon is acknowledging a hard reality after the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-takes-46-billion-write-down-for-media-unit-that-ncludes-aol-yahoo-1544556371-0c9f6649-7b9b-4d17-861e-4302ab6b477a.html"&gt;write-down of its entire media business&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018 (just a year after the Yahoo deal closed) and the unceremonious end of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17516266/verizon-shutting-down-go90-original-video-content-app"&gt;unsuccessful proto-Quibi streaming app go90&lt;/a&gt;. And that is that the whole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15180622/oath-aol-yahoo-verizon-ad-tracking-privacy"&gt;targeted advertising play it was hoping to pull off&lt;/a&gt; by combining its telecom analytics, AOL, Yahoo, and its various other corporate tentacles is simply not equipped to take on the Facebook-Google duopoly in online advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zu3k4V"&gt;So Verizon is now trying subscription models. Those are certainly all the rage in media these days. After all, collecting recurring direct payments from consumers is the only surefire way to inject any stability in an ad market largely dominated by Big Tech and susceptible to cataclysmic downturns, like &lt;a href="https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/global-ad-market-will-take-years-to-recover-from-covid-19/44417"&gt;what happened last year when the COVID-19 pandemic set in&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWYLmC"&gt;That brings us back to Yahoo Plus. While it may seem silly to continue leaning on the brand perhaps best known for signaling an email address that’s remained unchanged since high school, the Yahoo brand is admittedly resilient and about as close to a household name in websites as you can get outside the major Silicon Valley corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjG1rN"&gt;”Yahoo is the future of our consumer facing brand,” Joanna Lambert, Verizon Media’s consumer chief, told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;. “From a strategy perspective, we have enormous scale that is unlike most media companies in the world. The question becomes, ‘how do we take that audience and drive them from being free users to subscribers of really valuable paid offerings?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnJFx0"&gt;Lambert is right about the massive scale of Yahoo properties — they’re still among the biggest on the web. And if Verizon can somehow pull off a series of subscription services that actually complement its ad business, then it’ll have truly breathed new life into the Yahoo name. We’re just still a little unsure on the whole “Yahoo!+” thing. Let’s hope it rethinks that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Black Shark 4 is a high-end gaming phone that doesn’t look like one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Black Shark 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JGL_i_mPrY1EJJPr0AAesrtdPfg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013017/blackshark4lead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Black Shark&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b0JyVN"&gt;Xiaomi’s Black Shark brand has announced its fourth series of gaming phones, the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro. They improve on the previous series in most of the ways you’d expect them to. There’s a faster processor, moving up to the Snapdragon 870 in the standard Black Shark 4 and the Snapdragon 888 in the 4 Pro. Both phones also come with fast LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage, though each will come in different configurations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRMexn"&gt;The Black Shark 4 starts with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for 2,499 Chinese yuan (roughly $383), while the 4 Pro starts at 3,999 yuan (about $613) and has 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage. These will debut in China on Friday, March 26th, while the company says an overseas launch will happen “in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Black Shark 4" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_Mx00wD3oxIHN5IALpYcuXk53Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391953/blackshark4sidebyside.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ESP2tF"&gt;As is almost a given in the realm of gaming phones, Black Shark has leap-frogged Asus and RedMagic — some of its biggest competition in the niche gaming phone space — when it comes to touch sampling rate or how many times the display can register a touch. Both the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro have a 720Hz touch sampling rate with a 8.3ms touch delay, which it claims to be an industry best. This spec likely won’t make a difference in most people’s day-to-day usage of these phones, but some hardcore gamers might care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLrvVy"&gt;Both phones have the mechanical shoulder buttons introduced in the previous Black Shark phones, though the company claims it has improved their look and feel with “magnetic power lift” tech, making them feel more tactile to click, as well as fitting more seamlessly into the phone’s design. Speaking on the look of these new phones, they’re decidedly more attractive than the previous models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S6jLWEc3wGctuQNIizIKHw8NDRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16333859/jbareham_190611_3481_0177.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Black Shark 2, which introduced the pressure-sensitive display that lets you map two functions to one spot on the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tRWYlT"&gt;In addition to the shoulder buttons, these phones still have a pressure-sensitive display that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/15/18678066/black-shark-2-xiaomi-gaming-phone-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;I really liked in the Black Shark 2&lt;/a&gt;. With the shoulder buttons and a screen like this, you can re-map the controls of a mobile game to be a little more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWJFBm"&gt;Unlike last year’s model, the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro have displays that are the same size. They both have 6.67-inch OLED screens with a 144Hz refresh rate. Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; that I recently reviewed, these phones have dual front-facing speakers with claims that they have good spatial audio separation. Also like that Asus phone, Black Shark announced that a fan accessory called the FunCooler 2 Pro can be attached to keep it cooler. The price for that is 199 yuan (about $30).&lt;/p&gt;
