    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Come make bad decisions with us&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mWHafX"&gt;There are plenty of buying guides for figuring out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;best phone to buy&lt;/a&gt; at a given time, across a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;wide variety of prices&lt;/a&gt;. We have two of them, in fact. But if you’re a dyed-in-the-wool phone enthusiast, you don’t need a guide that’s going to give you the best rational recommendation. You need something that’s going to help you scratch your new gadget itch in the most satisfying way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwnkhO"&gt;I’m here for you because, well, I’m one of you. This is the internet’s premiere buying guide for phone enthusiasts. We’re not going to focus on practical, rational choices, nor are we going to concern ourselves with budgets. These are the dream phones, the ones you buy not as a utilitarian tool, but for the fun of playing with a new piece of tech that you’ll probably sell or trade in for a loss in six months. I’m not even going to single out a specific model that you should buy, because you’re likely buying a new phone every year (or maybe more!) anyway. This is all about throwing caution to the wind, diving deep into a hobby, and buying something you don’t need but absolutely want. Budgets be damned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEMlHI"&gt;Grab your cargo shorts, we’re going shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="mFCBHC"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HQWhbW"&gt;The best folding phone because you know you need one in your collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cyP7p8"&gt;Folding phones are the future, right? You can’t call yourself a Real Phone Enthusiast without one in your life. Hands down, the best folding phone you can buy right now is Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G. It’s got everything you might want from a modern smartphone, but it also opens up into a tablet-sized screen that lets you put more than one app side-by-side or look at a giant version of Google Maps. It’s easy to justify because you can tell yourself that you will get SO MUCH WORK done on it, right after you finish watching that YouTube video. Promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8bHVj"&gt;The Fold 2 costs more than most laptops, you have to baby it, and there’s a really good chance the screen will crack or break on you even if you are careful, but that’s just the price you have to pay to be on the bleeding edge.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="or8jqg"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jGK8Wn"&gt;The best iPhone for when you’re double-fisting an Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="odv92P"&gt;Look, I know that you know that everyone in the world has an iPhone and it’s the farthest thing from an “interesting” phone. But at the same time, it’s hard to ignore what Apple’s doing, and really, iMessage and the Apple Watch are pretty great. Lots of people carry an iPhone alongside an Android phone, and you could be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgHcF9"&gt;The best iPhone for doing this is the iPhone 12 Mini. It does everything its bigger siblings can do, but it can easily fit in a secondary pocket and isn’t a burden to carry around. The battery life is kinda lousy, but who cares, that’s why you have a second phone on you anyway, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QAq06D"&gt;The best phone for seeing what this “gaming phone” trend is all about&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DYsaub"&gt;Gaming phones are so hot right now (unless they’ve got a great cooling system) — it seems like a new model is released every three months. You can’t call yourself a true phone enthusiast without being up on this trend, and the best one to dip your toes into it with is the Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUdoj9"&gt;The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate has a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of features that can make any mobile accomplisher swoon. A massive battery. A ridiculously high refresh screen. An OLED screen on the back you can customize to show whatever you want. A bunch of accessories to make gaming better. 18GB of RAM! How could you not buy this phone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UxUeAC"&gt;The best phone for pretending you’re going to use a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="62OqLx"&gt;Writing on a phone screen with a pen is so cool! It &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; futuristic and is just so natural. At least, it is for the first week until you forget about it and it never leaves the little garage built into the side of the phone again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYMIss"&gt;If you’ve been telling yourself that little “I’m gonna be a stylus person” lie, you need a phone that supports one and it’s hard to see buying anything other than Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20. It’s got a low latency S Pen, a bunch of software features that can utilize the stylus, and all of the other bells and whistles of a modern smartphone, which means it works quite well long after you’ve forgotten about the stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ISjN0J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215736"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hZjFO7"&gt;The best phone for messing around with the Android 12 beta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oBnkTF"&gt;Okay, I said I wasn’t going to recommend anything rational in this guide, but this is perhaps the recommendation that makes the most sense: if you want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442051/android-12-beta-download-google-io-2021"&gt;mess around with the Android 12 beta&lt;/a&gt; but don’t want to install it on your main phone, you should just buy a Google Pixel 4A. It’s only $350 (that’s just $20 more than it costs to fix a broken screen on an iPhone 12 Pro Max) and can work with Google’s latest and greatest software even before it’s released to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QeuvA"&gt;You know the Android betas are going to be messy — battery life is going to be bad, there will be lots of bugs, certain apps might not work correctly — so you don’t want to put it on a device you actually need to rely on. Once the beta period is over, the Pixel 4A is a great device for experimenting with the aftermarket ROM world. Get a Pixel 4A and flash those ROMs to your heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U6dfGs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Microsoft Surface Duo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SrmHOI"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Microsoft Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eiZDop"&gt;The best phone for making people go “Whoa, is that a phone?”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zcDQoO"&gt;As a phone enthusiast, you already know this harsh truth: the Microsoft Surface Duo is not a good phone. It has an old processor. The camera is worse than any iPhone of the past five years. The battery life is decidedly Not Great. It gets hot doing simple tasks. There are SO MANY software bugs. It’s got a generation-old version of Android. It doesn’t even support wireless charging or NFC payments! Oh yeah, and there’s that questionable build quality to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J93WFK"&gt;But there’s something undeniably cool about the Surface Duo, like it’s a device from the future coming here to bless us in the early 21st century. It’s so thin, it has two screens, the hinge is incredibly neat. Open it up in public and you’re sure to get someone to ask “wow, is that a phone?” which we all know is the ultimate goal here. You can then show them all of its cool features, right after it’s done rebooting itself for the fifth time that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gxUq3F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10497909"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qGH04z"&gt;The best phone for telling yourself that you don’t need an actual camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rwPQXC"&gt;For years now we’ve been told that phone cameras are so good that you don’t need an actual camera. The iPhone 12 Pro Max might be the best example of that yet. It’s got a bigger sensor! It’s got three focal lengths! It can shoot video in Dolby Vision HDR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIhX55"&gt;At the end of the day, it’s still a phone camera and can’t really hold a candle to the image quality or creative control you get with a larger mirrorless camera. But hey, it’s fun to live in that lie and you can totally see the difference between the 12 Pro Max images and other phones. When you blow them up on a big screen. And zoom in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="537sxp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215756"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KwtDVn"&gt;The best phone for saying “you can’t get this in the US”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oAaPTd"&gt;Perhaps the ultimate phone flex is pulling a phone out of your pocket that nobody else is going to have. If you’re in the US, the Oppo Find X3 Pro is that phone. It’s got features you can’t get on any American phone and a design you won’t see everywhere, like a microscope camera and softly rounded camera bump. Sure, it won’t really work great on the cellular networks here, importing it is an expensive hassle, and you won’t have any warranty whatsoever. But just think of the envy on your friends’ faces when you tell them they can’t have this phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fsQZrc"&gt;The best phone for when you realize that Pixel phones aren’t great, but you don’t want a Samsung either&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7LwpXZ"&gt;Google’s Pixel phones have such great software and then… mediocre everything else. Samsung phones have incredible hardware but are laden with heavy software and actual ads inside of the stock apps. The OnePlus 9 Pro splits that difference — it has software that’s similar to Google’s on hardware that’s virtually a Samsung with a different logo on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMwn3Y"&gt;The 9 Pro is just what the phone enthusiast ordered: a high-end, bells-and-whistles device with All Of The Specs but none of the cruft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yVVHIu"&gt;The best weekend phone for when you’re “disconnecting”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4j7b9k"&gt;Here comes the weekend, with all of its promises of relaxation and enjoyment. You don’t need a phone that’s going to make you more productive, you need something that’s going to slip into your pocket and won’t distract you with a colorful display unless you absolutely need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhFwR6"&gt;The Z Flip 5G is this phone. You can flip it closed to ignore it and then pop it open and have a full smartphone inside, complete with every feature you get on non-flippy phones. You’re making a compromise without &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; making a compromise, because we all know that you had no intention of actually disconnecting for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Check if your Verizon or AT&amp;T phone will keep working after the networks’ 3G shutdowns</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;US wireless carriers plan to shutter their old 3G networks next year.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="93mvKT"&gt;Major US wireless carriers are gearing up to shut down their old 3G networks — a process that has been fraught with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215453/verizon-3g-shutdown-paused-delay-network-old-phones"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;miscommunication&lt;/a&gt; as companies alert customers with older phones that it’s time to upgrade. To that end, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have published guides to which devices will stop working after their 3G networks go offline next year. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qP1RJt"&gt;Verizon has delayed its CDMA 3G network shutdown several times but is now firmly committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358628/verizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022"&gt;shutting the network down by December 31st, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. All 3G basic phones and smartphones will lose service, but some 4G devices will be impacted as well — namely, those that don’t support VoLTE (Voice over LTE). A few connected devices are affected, too; take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/knowledge-base-218813/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s full guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7DbZk"&gt;Taking the opposite approach, AT&amp;amp;T has published a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/idpassets/images/support/wireless/Devices-Working-on-ATT-Network.pdf?source=ECAuAT10600aff12A&amp;amp;wtExtndSource=100122946&amp;amp;CI=CJ_AFFILIATE&amp;amp;RI=CJ1&amp;amp;RD=37922269&amp;amp;tfn=aff&amp;amp;cjevent=38f3c68bbf2911eb81ee1d8c0a1c0e0c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;complete list&lt;/a&gt; (spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/will-my-phone-work-on-att-after-3g-shutdown/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) of exactly which phones, tablets, and smartwatches &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; keep working after its 3G shutdown on February 22nd, 2022. (Separately, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/security/atandts-3g-shutdown-plans-are-harmful-even-deadly-warns-alarm-industry/d/d-id/769737"&gt;concern in the alarm industry&lt;/a&gt;: many home security devices use AT&amp;amp;T’s 3G and it’s possible that users won’t be able to replace them in time.) In any case, AT&amp;amp;T makes it easy to understand which mobile devices will keep functioning after the network shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnH2r5"&gt;T-Mobile’s 3G shutdown is a bit more complicated. It operates a UMTS 3G network, which the company will &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/02/t-mobile-shutting-down-3g-network-on-october-1st/"&gt;reportedly shut down in April 2022&lt;/a&gt;, and Sprint’s former CDMA 3G network, which the company says it will sunset on January 1st, 2022. T-Mobile hasn’t published a list of affected devices, but customers can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fresources%2Fbring-your-own-phone%23find-IMEI&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F27%2F22457255%2Fverizon-att-3g-shutdown-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check their device’s IMEI&lt;/a&gt; to see if it’s LTE and VoLTE compatible, which should indicate whether the device will keep working after the 3G networks are taken offline. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ Digital WellPaper visualizes your app usage as a funky live wallpaper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GpryvxeOLlUMS8rsTpF-lxjp4pg=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69349776/Comp_w_Frame.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apps are put into five categories, each represented by a color in the live wallpaper.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6uugzT"&gt;OnePlus’ new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fwellbeing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F27%2F22456248%2Foneplus-digital-wellpaper-app-usage-visualization-live-wallpaper" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Digital WellPaper app&lt;/a&gt; turns your app usage into one of three live wallpapers on Android. Apps are simplified into six categories — social, lifestyle and communication, entertainment, gaming, information and business, and tools — which translate to six colors within each wallpaper that become more or less prominent as you use the apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TndbK"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17870126/ios-12-screen-time-app-limits-downtime-features-how-to-use"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104987/google-digital-wellbeing-pixel-android-9-pie-exit-beta-features-now-available"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; already have the ability to track app usage at a system level, but generally you have to go into a dedicated menu to actually see the information. The advantage with Digital WellPaper is that it puts this usage information — albeit in an abstract form — front and center, so you’re aware of it every time you look at your home or lock screen. OnePlus says it hopes this will help Android users “visualize and better understand their day-to-day digital habits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3bUECgoZKWtlT76gDaJqRlwf1BQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542909/Glow_w_Frame.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The live wallpapers are also available as lock screens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mvr1pO"&gt;Google has experimented with similar initiatives in the past. In 2019 it released a series of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928613/google-digital-wellbeing-experiments-unlock-clock-we-flip-morph-post-box-desert-island"&gt;experimental Digital Wellbeing apps in the Play Store&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitalwellbeingexperiments.unlockclock"&gt;Unlock Clock&lt;/a&gt;, a live wallpaper that shows a tally of how many times you’ve unlocked your phone that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4BT52"&gt;OnePlus says the new app, which was “curated” by its internal experimental software team OneLab, should work without consuming too much of your phone’s battery. It’s just generating a new image once when you unlock your phone, rather than constantly updating in the background. More details on individual app usage can be found within the Digital WellPaper app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xcEQThvX5yHeDI3YK09_zb9697k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542908/Screen_Time_w_Frame.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;More detailed information is available in-app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gAePKc"&gt;Digital WellPaper is now available from the Google Play Store, and works on devices running Android 7.0 and above.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boost Mobile is offering customers an Android 11 phone for $35</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7a1_2zLWm3xpWkXsv4WjEKXFW2s=/0x1:2353x1570/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346801/WikoRide3_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wiko Ride 3 offers a 6.09-inch display and Android 11 out of the box.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wiko Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5umbsn"&gt;With T-Mobile’s older CDMA network shutdown looming and no sign of a delay in sight, Boost Mobile customers looking for a new 4G phone just got a very affordable new option: the Wiko Ride 3. It’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boostmobile.com%2Fphones%2Fwiko-ride-3.html%3Fid16%3Dwiki&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F26%2F22454954%2Fwiko-ride-3-boost-mobile-price-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently marked down to $34.99&lt;/a&gt; from a full retail price of $99.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OATL1x"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/boost-mobile-wiko-ride-3-affordable-android-11-phone-specs-features-price_id132374"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, that promotional pricing somewhat unusually applies to existing customers rather than new ones. It’s unusual but not unexpected: the CDMA network shutdown could leave many Boost customers in need of a new phone. These customers might also start shopping around for a new carrier, so Boost has some extra incentive to offer current customers a good deal. Meanwhile, anyone switching from another carrier can get the Wiko Ride 3 for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CP3Th"&gt;It’s not unheard of to find a phone at this price, especially through MVNOs, but they’re often refurbished devices or run a previous Android OS generation. The Ride 3 stands out by offering Android 11 right out of the box — the current generation, at least for a little while longer, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; arrives this fall. Other specs include a 6.09-inch 720p screen, 13-megapixel main camera, and a 3,400mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j9E1FV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Ride 3 stands out by offering Android 11 right out of the box&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XR6uB1"&gt;Boost Mobile was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquired by Dish Network&lt;/a&gt; as part of last year’s T-Mobile / Sprint merger deal, and it operates on T-Mobile’s networks — including an older 3G CDMA network that Dish says many Boost customers still rely on. T-Mobile plans to shut down this network at the beginning of 2022; Dish contends the shutdown is earlier than expected, calling it an anti-competitive move that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;could leave many of its customers without service&lt;/a&gt; and accusing T-Mobile of trying to poach those customers in the process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVJ582"&gt;Dish has called on federal and state governments to intervene and delay the shutdown, but in the meantime, it appears to be stocking up on low-cost options for customers who may soon need a new 4G device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZAQhH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The affordable Nokia G10 is coming to the US with a great support policy </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-oi9I7P-KVhAD_xvug49ZfCuhVc=/0x0:3242x2161/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340974/nokia_G10_DTC_DESIGN_desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia G10 offers big battery life and two years of Android OS platform updates.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BvUpmj"&gt;HMD’s Nokia G10 is coming to the US with a big battery, a low $149 price, and a surprisingly good security support schedule. &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/nokia-g10-price-release-date-availability-us_id132341"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the G10 — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Android-Unlocked-Smartphone-6-52-Inch/dp/B093QPTSK7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; now at Amazon — will go on sale directly through Nokia’s website later this week. The G10 was first announced in Europe last month alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22371937/hmd-nokia-x20-x10-g20-g10-c20-c10-android-phones-release-date-news-features"&gt;five other midrange devices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjuST1"&gt;Low-cost Android phones aren’t typically known for great software support. It’s common for manufacturers to offer only two years of security updates on an infrequent schedule and typically just one (or no) OS platform updates. HMD is breaking with that norm by offering two years of OS platform updates — Android 12 and 13 in this case — and three years of security updates, a policy that should see the G10 through a few years of use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bR8p2017Y-BtAPtfc8-gQQNjAqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539021/nokia_G10_emotional_range.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G10 is offered in the “dusk” color pictured here as well as a dark blue “night” flavor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jElELM"&gt;The Nokia G10’s other specs include a 6.5-inch 720p display, huge 5,050mAh battery, MediaTek G25 chipset with 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 13-megapixel rear camera accompanied by 2-megapixel macro and depth sensors. It’s expected to go on sale Thursday, May 27th at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_int%2Fnokia-g-10&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453332%2Fhmd-nokia-g10-price-availability-security-updates" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now buy Asus’ gaming-ready ROG Phone 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k21J-gQWk1woZxBGM5nLi9PVksc=/0x0:1875x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340185/Screen_Shot_2021_05_25_at_9.54.34_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3x5FZD"&gt;Asus’ ROG Phone 5 is now available in the US &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM210000001/ROG5-ASUS-ROG-Phone-5---6.78%E2%80%9D-FHD%2B-2448x1080-HDR-144Hz-Display---6000mAh-Dual-Cell-Battery---64MP%2F13MP%2F5MP-Triple-Camera-with-24MP-Front-Camera-%E2%80%9316GB-RAM---256GB-Storage-5G-LTE-Unlocked-Dual-SIM-Cell-Phone"&gt;from its official store&lt;/a&gt;, with a price tag of $999.99. It’s Asus’ latest maxed-out gaming phone, with all of the top-notch specifications: a Snapdragon 888 Plus, 144Hz display, front-facing speakers, and a massive 6,000mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpw3uf"&gt;Asus says the Ultimate and Pro versions of the phone will be available later this year. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;reviewed the Ultimate in March&lt;/a&gt; and found that it was a good phone that went a little — okay, maybe a lot — overboard with its specs. The vanilla version available for sale today, though, is perhaps a bit more reasonable: it “only” has 16GB of RAM (as opposed to the Ultimate’s 18GB), has half the storage (256GB instead of 512GB), and features an RGB logo on the back instead of an entire OLED screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpyEWY"&gt;The other thing the regular version is missing is the extra touch-sensitive buttons that provide an alternative to touchscreen controls (though it does still have two of the ultrasonic sensors). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csxmTC"&gt;For those who want more buttons, though, there’s always &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM250000006/ROG5-ASUS-ROG-Phone-5-and-Gamepad-Bundle"&gt;the gamepad bundle&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM220000003/ROG5-ASUS-ROG-AeroActive-Cooler-5"&gt;AeroActive Cooler 5 accessory&lt;/a&gt;, which has two buttons built in. They do cost extra — with the gamepad bundle coming in at $40 more than just the phone and the cooler costing $70 — but that’s still likely going to be way less than shelling out for the Ultimate version.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arm introduces its first Armv9 architecture CPUs and GPUs, previewing 2022’s Android flagships</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQtctN5cpbxAkLhtLsVhGMx5twU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338562/acastro_200804_1777_arm_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JV7M44"&gt;Arm has introduced its latest CPU and GPU designs, including its flagship Cortex-X2 and Cortex-A710 CPUs and Mali-G710 GPU. The new CPU and GPU designs aren’t just Arm’s latest chip blueprints, though; they’re also its first designs to utilize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357951/arm-armv9-architecture-security-artificial-intelligence-performance"&gt;its new Armv9 architecture&lt;/a&gt;, its first in a decade, which means big jumps in performance, along with new security and AI features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDVqss"&gt;Most consumers probably aren’t familiar with the exact Arm cores inside their phones or computers, but Arm’s designs — and particularly, &lt;a href="https://www.arm.com/why-arm/technologies/big-little"&gt;its big.LITTLE configuration&lt;/a&gt; of combining powerful high-performance cores and battery-saving high-efficiency cores — are common to virtually every Android phone. That means the designs introduced here are effectively a preview of what the best Android phones of 2022 will look like. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_-g5zLO6cvSlF-CBmAkGMeX0tGc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536988/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.33.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xxxyD1"&gt;Arm is introducing three new CPU designs this year. First, the Cortex-X2: it’s part of Arm’s Cortex-X custom program that lets partners help design specialized cores for their specific use cases. A successor to last year’s Cortex-X1, it’s also the most powerful design in the lineup, promising up to 16 percent improved performance compared to last year’s model. There’s also the Cortex-A710, the new “big” core, promising up to 30 percent better power efficiency and 10 percent better performance than last year’s Cortex-A78. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aABO4h"&gt;But Arm isn’t just upgrading the performance cores. For the first time in four years, it’s also introducing a new “LITTLE” high-efficiency core, the Cortex-A510, which replaces the Cortex-A55 design that’s been used for major phones since it was introduced in 2017. And it’s here that Arm’s promising the biggest jumps: up to 30 percent better performance, and 20 percent better power efficiency compared to the old model. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SLdqJ0xKZeRVkh1dwYpFy6XepIQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536990/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.33.28_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4FsJt4"&gt;The new Armv9 designs together should result in a big jump in performance once they make their way to chips, too. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt;, for example, uses partially customized versions of last year’s flagship Arm Cortex-X1 and Cortex-A78 as its four “big” cores and the roughly four-year-old Cortex-A55 design for its “LITTLE” cores. &lt;a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2021/01/arm-powerful-compute-and-graphics-platform-at-the-heart-of-the-new-samsung-exynos-2100#:~:text=The%20Cortex%2DX1%20is%20Arm's,relative%20to%20our%20standard%20CPUs."&gt;Samsung’s flagship Exynos 2100&lt;/a&gt; uses a similar configuration, too, along with Arm’s Mali-G78 GPU design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5YvR4"&gt;The new CPU core designs promise to blow both of those chips out of the water: Arm says that a CPU cluster made up of the Armv9 designs (a single Cortex-X2, three Cortex-A710 cores, and four Cortex-A510 cores) should offer up to 30 percent better peak performance (thanks to the Cortex-X2), 30 percent better overall efficiency (from the Cortex-A710), and 35 percent better “LITTLE” performance from the Cortex-A510 when compared to a comparable Armv8.2 cluster like the ones mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hNze8sR9HFrM864ia-uogQqaXdw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536991/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.33.45_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i2baXX"&gt;Arm is also introducing three new GPUs. There’s the flagship Mali-G710, which promises 20 percent better gaming performance and 20 percent better power efficiency; the Mali-G510, designed as a midrange option for more affordable devices; and the entry-level Mali-G310. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Iek8yO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A preview of the best Android phones of 2022 &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVaZIP"&gt;The overall goal is to provide a variety of designs for a wide range of use cases. A computer might rely more heavily on Arm’s Cortex-X2 CPUs and a discrete GPU solution for graphics; a leading smartphone, a CPU cluster of Arm’s range of CPU designs and Mali-G710 GPU; or a smartwatch with fewer demands that just uses a Cortex-A510 and Mali-G310. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00rexU"&gt;It’ll be some time before the new Arm designs show up in phones or devices: Arm still has to give the designs to its partners, who’ll then need to incorporate them into their own semiconductor products (typically announced toward the end of the year), and then those chips have to make their way to phone manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvVlS7"&gt;So it’ll likely be the beginning of 2022 before the new Arm CPU and GPU designs appear in any phones — and that’s assuming the global semiconductor shortage doesn’t push out next year’s products even further. But it’s still an exciting sneak peek at the potential of what might be coming next in the future of smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Evidence is piling up that Netflix wants to be the Netflix of games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gORAwq_MiM3G9uBXYL-m5ARGfHU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69337057/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DFgGfT"&gt;Netflix has dipped a toe in gaming on occasion, with perhaps the hugely-successful “choose your own adventure”-style film &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as the most prominent example. But the streaming giant may be expanding further into gaming with a new bundle for Netflix subscribers, according to several reports over the past few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDsDM0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; had the &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/netflix-seeks-executive-to-expand-game-efforts"&gt;first report on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, writing that Netflix wants to hire an executive to oversee new gaming efforts, and that the company is considering a bundle of games similar to Apple Arcade. (Hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/netflix-looking-hire-executive-gaming-expansion-information-2021-05-21/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; corroborated&lt;/a&gt; that a gaming exec is a planned hire at Netflix.) The company has also chosen not to include ads in the games, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. But &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; also said that Netflix’s plans are still “very much in flux.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsUhBQ"&gt;In a report published Monday, however, &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; shared more details from &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/netflix-gaming-expansion-cde0f3ae-15de-4378-b2b8-fd0aaf0e91f6.html"&gt;its own reporting.&lt;/a&gt; An &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; source said to think of the upcoming service, which would be offered to Netflix subscribers, as “a smaller Apple Arcade” bundle that would include both licensed Netflix IP and games commissioned from indie studios. The service could be a ways out, though, “possibly launching in 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWEmB4"&gt;While Netflix hasn’t publicly confirmed the potential expansion of its gaming efforts, in a statement published by both &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22447410/netflix-executive-games-expansion-the-information-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company left the door open to the idea that it is indeed planning to do more with gaming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="029bIB"&gt;Our members value the variety and quality of our content. It’s why we’ve continually expanded our offering — from series to documentaries, film, local language originals and reality TV. Members also enjoy engaging more directly with stories they love — through interactive shows like &lt;em&gt;Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;You v. Wild,&lt;/em&gt; or games based on &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;La&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Casa de Papel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;To All the Boys&lt;/em&gt;. So we’re excited to do more with interactive entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HLKHeC"&gt;Netflix has &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of titles based on popular video games that are out now or in the works, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;one of Netflix’s biggest shows&lt;/a&gt;), so the company clearly sees the value of video games as IP. It’s not outlandish to think that the company would want to market its series through new games, or, in the ultimate ouroboros, make a new game that eventually becomes a new &lt;em&gt;Netflix&lt;/em&gt; show in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqC2vE"&gt;Netflix seemed to be on its way in 2019 — it had partnered with Telltale Games on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18510849/stranger-things-secret-games-telltale-studio-closed"&gt;a secret &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; game that died before it was announced&lt;/a&gt;, with a source telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “Netflix was just getting into the space and didn’t really have a games group in place yet.” Telltale’s &lt;em&gt;Minecraft: Story Mode&lt;/em&gt; did survive, though, and is still at least partially playable &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80227995"&gt;on Netflix now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3ApuPF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The tragic end of Telltale Games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17934166/telltale-games-studio-closed-layoffs-end-the-walking-dead"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hovQyS"&gt;Many companies are trying to build a service that’s “Netflix, but for games.” Apple Arcade and Xbox Game Pass are just two that come to mind. But these reports and Netflix’s curious non-denial suggest Netflix might like to eat its own lunch this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey says it was ‘time to unleash’ WarnerMedia assets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/keerova78wvOEK4_45X2nqNjxwU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333921/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ng1etn"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey said Monday that the company’s focus on its connectivity business in the US meant it didn’t have the global reach to grow a global streaming business with WarnerMedia, and the company decided it was “time to unleash the media assets” of WarnerMedia to Discovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnvHOq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T announced on May 17th&lt;/a&gt; that it would spin off its WarnerMedia business to merge it with TV company Discovery. The resulting entity, which has yet to be named and is still awaiting regulatory approval, will be a competitor in the cable space and for streaming content giants like Netflix and Disney; WarnerMedia owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and the Warner Bros. movie studio, while Discovery has a number of channels that focus more on reality TV, including HGTV, Animal Planet, Food Network, and TLC. Each also has its own streaming platform in HBO Max and Discovery Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNqL7r"&gt;“What’s become clear is that the opportunity for direct relationships with customers is truly going to be a global opportunity,” Stankey said of the streaming sector. “As a result of that, when you look at the opportunity to grow a fantastic subscriber base we kind of looked at this and said, ‘it’s time to unleash the media assets to go and seize a multi-hundred-billion-dollar opportunity.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3T019"&gt;Streaming is “a little bit of a different shareholder base and management base than what we’d typically have” as part of AT&amp;amp;T’s more traditional lines of business, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osveBA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/business/dealbook/att-agrees-to-buy-time-warner-for-more-than-80-billion.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T acquired WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt; (which was known as TimeWarner at the time) in 2016 for $85.4 billion. The deal was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17466518/att-time-warner-acquisition-closes"&gt;approved in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJeOzq"&gt;Stankey made the comments during the JP Morgan Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference. He bristled slightly when interviewer John Cusick, a JP Morgan analyst, asked him about his vision for the future of AT&amp;amp;T, noting “you’ve reversed nearly six years of strategic change at AT&amp;amp;T in three months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5sgVR"&gt;Stankey said he would “contest the characterization that we did it in three months,” adding, “We don’t wake up one day and say ‘hey today’s the day I think we ought to go find a transaction.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkxV5p"&gt;But with less than three years from when the WarnerMedia deal was approved to the time AT&amp;amp;T decided to spin it off, the change in direction struck many as sudden, but it also seemed to make sense. Telecom companies have tried to run media businesses with limited success; earlier this month, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22416854/aol-yahoo-sale-apollo-venetian-hotel-verizon"&gt;Verizon sold AOL and Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; for less than half of what it paid a few years prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shdcxS"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post’&lt;/em&gt;s Steven Zeitchik noted in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/22/discovery-warner-media-att-spinoff/"&gt;his analysis of the deal&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T did little to court business in Hollywood during the time it owned WarnerMedia. The surprise announcement in December that WarnerMedia would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;release all of its 2021 theatrical movies on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; drew widespread &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; from the entertainment industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSpVQS"&gt;Still, Stankey claimed Monday that AT&amp;amp;T’s ownership of WarnerMedia helped to grow HBO Max and HBO’s linear channel to a combined &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/hbo-max-hbo-reaches-44-2-million-subscribers-4165569/"&gt;44 million US subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in the year since HBO Max launched. “I think realistically, HBO Max would not be where it is today if not for the strength of the two combined companies,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is offering customers free Apple Arcade or Google Play Pass for up to a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NbGxCieqwryDJ_uVp_c1udB_CF0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333468/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLwTrr"&gt;Verizon has a new deal for new and existing unlimited plan subscribers starting May 25th: up to &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-14068036?sid=Verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fplans%2Funlimited%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a year of Apple Arcade or Google Play Pass&lt;/a&gt;, free of charge. Specifically, customers who pay for the Play More Unlimited and Get More Unlimited plans get 12 months of either app subscription service for free, while all other unlimited plans get six months. It’s worth noting that both free options are longer than the ones Apple or Google offer themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pccJT7"&gt;The $80 per month Play More plan or $90 per month Get More plan (that’s the price for a single line) also come with other benefits to sweeten the deal. Play More comes with an “unlimited” mobile hotspot with up to 15GB of 5G data, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371902/verizon-unlimited-plans-free-disney-plus-espn-hulu-bundle"&gt;the Disney Bundle&lt;/a&gt; (Hulu, Disney Plus, ESPN Plus), six months of Apple Music, and 12 months of Discovery Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5MdnOH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not quite unlimited, but the add-ons are nice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E7CmXf"&gt;Meanwhile, Get More offers an “unlimited” mobile hotspot with up 30GB of 5G data, the Disney Bundle, a continuous subscription to Apple Music, and 12 months of Discovery Plus. Verizon frequently offers all sorts of other promotions so you can check &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/plans/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D39986104348088388961888296802413619485%7CMCAID%3D304EA1F622850B1E-40001414C26A22B2%7CMCORGID%3D843F02BE53271A1A0A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1621640023&amp;amp;mboxSession=4b9bd75675694d1c8939eaadd9212408" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt; for the most up-to-date deals. (Each plan only guarantees 50GB of 5G/4G data at most, so none of them are technically “unlimited.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGn63Y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20878843/google-play-pass-bundles-350-android-games-and-apps-for-4-99-per-month"&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18280589/apple-arcade-gaming-subscription-release-date-pricing-features"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt; are similar conceptually — pay monthly for access to a selection of the best apps from a platform without in-app purchases — but differ meaningfully in what they actually offer. Apple Arcade is focused on games and by far has some of the most interesting exclusives. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/26/21026128/apple-arcade-best-games-iphone-ipad"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grindstone &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Card of Darkness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were early favorites, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;the recent addition of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a JRPG from the creator of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, is also well worth subscribing for, even if you have to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxAtTn"&gt;Play Pass is a bit more holistic as an offering, but might be worth it if you’re new to Android. Google includes popular games &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; apps in the service, spanning everything from a farming sim like &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley &lt;/em&gt;(normally $4.99) to a utility app like AccuWeather (free, but includes in-app purchases). It also offers a larger selection than Apple Arcade, with &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/31/google-play-pass-800/#:~:text=Google%20Play%20Pass%20now%20offers%20more%20than%20800%20Android%20apps%20and%20games&amp;amp;text=Google%20introduced%20Play%20Pass%20in,of%20the%20%244.99%20monthly%20membership."&gt;now over 800 apps and games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8a0jgO"&gt;Neither Apple Arcade nor Google Play Pass are particularly expensive on their own at $4.99 per month each, but their free trials also aren’t as long as what Verizon is offering. Apple will toss in three months of Arcade for free if you purchase a new Apple device, but otherwise offers a one-month free trial. Google also only offers a one-month free trial for Play Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
