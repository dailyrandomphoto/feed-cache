    <title>Gazelle brings back its phone trade-in program two months after discontinuing it</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hj8AnD"&gt;Trade-in provider Gazelle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206779/gazelle-smartphone-used-trade-in-program-shut-down"&gt;exited the online trade-in business&lt;/a&gt; back in February, and now the company says it’s changing its mind. Gazelle is back to accepting online trade-ins of iPhones, Samsung phones, Google Pixel devices, and iPads and other tablets on its website, the company confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The program resumed accepting new offers on April 5th, a Gazelle representative clarified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDePCQ"&gt;“Earlier this year, we announced that we will no longer be offering our trade-in option on Gazelle. After careful consideration, including feedback from customers like you, we have decided to keep Gazelle Trade-In going. Today, we are happy to say, ‘We’re back, baby!’” reads an email Gazelle sent to prospective customers and shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Gazelle Trade-In is a pioneer of the electronics trade-in space and we are happy to continue building on our legacy by offering a simple process and immediate payouts for those unwanted devices.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk0Fcj"&gt;Gazelle emerged as one of the leading trade-in providers of the smartphone era. But its business model didn’t fare as well when the US mobile phone business underwent major shifts away from two-year contracts and outright device purchases and toward phone leasing and carrier and device maker trade-in programs like Apple’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8v5QVq"&gt;Gazelle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206779/gazelle-smartphone-used-trade-in-program-shut-down"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; back in December of last year it would end its online phone trade-in program on February 1st, 2021, though the company said at the time it would continue to operate its in-person trade-in kiosks through parent company ecoATM. Gazelle did confirm in the email sent to customers that it will not be bringing back its rewards program. “We will continue to evaluate the market conditions and will inform you if this changes,” the email reads. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this feature on how India’s digital revolution started with missed calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="INDIA-ECONOMY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ygzgFnXJjndxRvgNs35f9_Mc5E=/0x3:8367x5581/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085277/1231334394.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JEWEL SAMAD/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KREkbs"&gt;Leaving a missed call on someone’s phone usually signals that you should call them back — but at one point in India, it was communication in its own right. &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-rise-and-fall-of-missed-calls-in-india/"&gt;A new feature by Atul Bhattarai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; examines the Indian culture that grew up around missed calls — and the startups that took advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeXSb9"&gt;In basic terms, a “missed call” means dialing a person but hanging up before they can answer. Hanging up without talking let users send a basic message (“I called”) without getting charged for minutes or SMS messages — like paging someone without a pager. Bhattarai focuses on ZipDial, a company that turned missed calls into a robust advertising business and a way to experience some of the features of online life without paying for data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6V18Uz"&gt;As Bhattarai writes, using missed calls to communicate came about because of the high cost of cellphone data and limited access to high-speed internet. Calling long enough to connect to someone else’s phone and then hanging up or not picking up on the other end avoided being charged for the call. These missed calls could mean a variety of things, like letting a friend know you’re on your way or a loved one know that you miss them. “The fact that the missed call demanded only basic numeric literacy made them accessible to the third of India’s population that was illiterate,” Bhattarai explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu1ehq"&gt;ZipDial combined the missed call trend and preexisting SMS services into a kind of a one-stop shop for cellphone owners who wanted basic internet functionality. ZipDial would partner with a brand and set up a hotline that people could call for services like sports scores or celebrity tweets. All it took was “signing up” with a missed call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jINvf7"&gt;Bhattarai also highlights a proto-Spotify algorithmic playlist service called Kan Khajura, which delivered new music in 15-minute calls. “Kan Khajura’s central appeal was that it could be accessed anywhere and anytime, unlike the radio and TV,” Bhattarai writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkuUeq"&gt;Those businesses became unsustainable as mobile data became cheaper, and ZipDial ceased operations in 2016. But Bhattarai argues the services helped bridge the offline-online gap in a period before internet service providers and physical infrastructure caught up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWi18q"&gt;You can read the full feature on &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-rise-and-fall-of-missed-calls-in-india/"&gt;ZipDial’s missed call empire&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Rest of World.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal is testing a payments feature that lets you send cryptocurrency to friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7krYp4GTId4FksGKcsb8NJz0nNM=/48x0:2073x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084630/payments_hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Signal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bYv2gU"&gt;Signal &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; it’s now testing a new peer-to-peer payments system in the beta version of its apps. Appropriately called Signal Payments, the new feature right now supports only one protocol: the MobileCoin wallet and its companion cryptocurrency MOB. MobileCoin has a close relationship with Signal co-founder and CEO Moxie Marlinspike, who advised the company prior to its &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/mobilecoin-a-cryptocurrency-involving-signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-just-raised-venture-funding/"&gt;most recent round of funding announced last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uc7YcI"&gt;“The first payments protocol we’ve added support for is a privacy focused payments network called MobileCoin, which has its own currency, MOB,” wrote Jun Harada, Signal’s head of growth and communication, in a &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “As always, our goal is to keep your data in your hands rather than ours; MobileCoin’s design means Signal does not have access to your balance, full transaction history, or funds. You can also transfer your funds at any time if you want to switch to another app or service.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6_fQUckH7quKkzlE6YPQUuKLaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424615/payments_product.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signal&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7rOAFc"&gt;The company says those interested in trying out the feature must live in the UK for now, and those who qualify can sign up for MobileCoin and access the feature through the &lt;a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-"&gt;Signal beta&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a beta feature in a &lt;a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-"&gt;beta build&lt;/a&gt;, but for those in the United Kingdom living life on the edge, please help us test and give feedback,” Harada writes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yelp is making it easier for users to search for Asian-owned businesses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ft2OVyyY-AhCB_Gn11a9bZGioNg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69082326/akrales_180411_2467_0070.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vUROOt"&gt;Yelp is rolling out a new tool that will allow businesses the option to identify themselves as Asian-owned, chief diversity officer Miriam Warren announced today. The new optional attribute will make it easier for Yelp users to find and support Asian-owned businesses easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvq950"&gt;Business owners will be allowed to edit their existing listing on Yelp and select the attribute that notes they are an Asian-owned business. The feature will be available when a business owner logs in to their Yelp for Business account. Once enabled, users who filter by “Asian owned” restaurants will find a list of businesses near their location that have self-selected that attribute. Yelp previously rolled out similar attributes for businesses to display, such as the option to identify as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21281887/yelp-new-search-tool-black-owned-businesses-app-donation-matching"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;- or &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/michelle-cheng/yelp-search-women-owned-businesses.html"&gt;women-owned&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n5fwG_mN0EXySZAIBv1YUsKK77U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416771/Yelp_for_Business_App_Selecting_Asian_owned_Attribute.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Yelp&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yelp for Business will allow owners to enable the Asian-owned attribute. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vpnyd1"&gt;Yelp also confirmed in its &lt;a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/diverse-business-report"&gt;latest Economic Impact Report on diverse businesses&lt;/a&gt; that searches on Yelp for Asian-owned businesses increased by 130 percent in February. The company also said that, during the months of April and May, the Yelp Foundation will double match any donations a Yelp employee makes to selections that are Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving, such as &lt;a href="https://www.advancingjustice-atlanta.org/"&gt;Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://stopaapihate.org/"&gt;Stop AAPI Hate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixel 5 reportedly gets big GPU performance boost with new update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The body is made of aluminum but then encased in a “resin” coating." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kNrKvLLTxtv8RSnETwTEzgiDR-I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69082158/akrales_201012_4137_0152.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g6tbQ4"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/105130965?hl=en"&gt;started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; the April Android security update for Pixel phones, and it looks like it’s brought some performance improvements to the most recent devices. Google says the update includes “performance optimizations for certain graphics-intensive apps and games” on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;, and, as &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-5-massive-gpu-performance-gains-april-2021-update/"&gt;noted by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some testers are noticing substantially improved GPU performance on the Pixel 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl9kak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech &lt;/em&gt;previously &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16442/the-google-pixel-5-a-minireview/3"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the Pixel 5 turned in much worse GPU results than other phones using the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip. Now, the site’s reviewer Andrei Frumusanu &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andreif7/status/1379143336943058952"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that performance on his Pixel 5 has been “essentially doubled” from the review’s initial figures and is now “in line or better than other 765G phones.” Benchmarks don’t necessarily translate into real-world results, of course, but combined with Google’s reference to optimizations for graphics-intensive apps, it does sound like GPU performance should be better with the new release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJpZXV"&gt;In addition, Google says that the Pixel 5 and 4A 5G should receive “improvements to camera quality” in some third-party apps. There’s also a fix for a startup freezing bug on Pixel 4 and 5 devices, as well as one for missing home grid settings on the Pixel 3 and 4 generations of phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s latest budget phones ask: is refresh rate more important than resolution?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tuFrMXoqVwLqUN3dC0KTspxBkuU=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69080845/galaxy_f12.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="du4xVp"&gt;If you had to choose: would you choose a sharper screen on your smartphone, or a smoother-scrolling one? This year, budget phone buyers may be asking themselves that question: the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/oneplus-brings-a-90hz-smartphone-to-the-us-for-180/"&gt;OnePlus Nord N100&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;Moto G50,&lt;/a&gt; and the new Samsung &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/samsung-india-launches-fullonfab-galaxy-f12-with-true-48mp-quad-camera-and-90hz-display"&gt;Galaxy F12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/samsung-india-launches-monsterreloaded-galaxy-m12-with-8nm-exynos-processor-and-90hz-display"&gt;M12&lt;/a&gt; all refresh their screens 90 times per second (which is good!) but with a lower-than-optimal screen resolution of 720p. That’s the same resolution as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/17/2568348/galaxy-nexus-review"&gt;Galaxy Nexus from 2011&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Liz9"&gt;Compared to your average iPhone, that’s a paltry number of pixels. Since the iPhone 4 debuted in 2010, every Apple handset has offered at least 326 pixels per inch (PPI), enough so you can’t make out those individual pixels with the naked eye at typical viewing distances. (The marketing term is “retina display.”) Here, the PPI would be more like 270. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i9AjxE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yj1go6OuZ4A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7rxfEv"&gt;And yet Apple has never offered an iPhone with a high-refresh-rate screen, which we’ve often found to be one of the most desirable features on high-end and mid-range smartphones since it makes everything you do (not just games) feel much smoother. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;Apple might make it happen later this year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jk7ygU"&gt;But the Galaxy F12 and M12, the OnePlus and Moto all show that high-refresh doesn’t need to be a high-end feature at all, or even a $300 one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;like we recently saw with the OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;. The Samsung phones in particular cost under $150 each, as long as you’re willing to sacrifice pixels to get there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jlaiw"&gt;In other ways, the 9,999-rupee handsets seem like they might be decent picks too: they’re based on the same basic platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21628573/samsung-a12-a02s-phones-budget-price-specs-2021"&gt;as the Galaxy A12 and its four-camera array&lt;/a&gt;, but with a larger 6,000mAh battery that dwarfs many others on the market. You get a sidemounted fingerprint sensor. Just note while its 8nm Exynos 850 processor might sound shiny and new, it’s not comparable with Qualcomm’s recent 800-series Snapdragon chips. It’s closer to 2019’s Snapdragon 665 in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xibs7b"&gt;It’s not clear whether either of these phones will come to the US quite yet. The OnePlus Nord N100 already has, and the G50 launched in Europe late last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAN6mD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ev6jux"&gt;Epic is further stitching together its various platforms with a new &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; integration for its social video app Houseparty that &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/stream-your-fortnite-gameplay-to-friends-inside-houseparty?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;lets you stream your gameplay to friends&lt;/a&gt;. The integration builds on an existing one that uses Houseparty’s video chatting capabilities to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572069/fortnite-houseparty-video-chat-pc-ps4-ps5"&gt;bring live video chat into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now this essentially does the reverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZg3qL"&gt;That way, your friends can see you live both through your mobile phone camera and also the feed of your active &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;game. Think of it a bit like Twitch streaming without all the fuss and just for your friends instead of the broader public. Epic says the feature supports streaming from a PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, or PC right now. “We will let everyone know if we’re able to support more platforms in the future,” Epic says in its blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kyjnh5"&gt;Epic owns Houseparty, which streamlines fast and easy group video chat, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662708/epic-games-houseparty-acquisition-fortnite-video-chat"&gt;2019 acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, and the game maker has used the app to boost the social feature sets of its various gaming platforms. A few months following the acquisition, Epic began using Houseparty for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871464/fortnite-voice-chat-party-hub-houseparty"&gt;improved &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;cross-platform audio chat&lt;/a&gt;, and now a full bridge between the game and the app exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOJafX"&gt;For a breakdown of how to enable Houseparty gameplay streaming and video chat, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/stream-your-fortnite-gameplay-to-friends-inside-houseparty?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;check out Epic’s FAQ here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG says some phones will get Android 12 updates, but we’re skeptical</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG V60 — launched in early 2020 — could be on the list for an Android 12 update.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eYfu7t"&gt;LG says it will continue to offer Android OS updates — including an upgrade to Android 12 — for some of its devices after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;exits the smartphone business&lt;/a&gt;, but the company’s poor track record has us feeling skeptical it’ll follow through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0SUJg"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fpress-release%2Flg-to-close-mobile-phone-business-worldwide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F5%2F22368129%2Flg-phones-android-12-update-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; and on a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fnotice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F5%2F22368129%2Flg-phones-android-12-update-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;, LG says only that it will continue to provide some security and OS updates, but a page on LG’s Korean website &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-android-12-update/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; specifically mentions that an “Android 12 OS upgrade will also be provided for selected models.” This page also notes that this is subject to change based on product performance, and that update availability may vary by region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8c6v05"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LG wasn’t very reliable with updates even prior to its decision to get out of the phone business&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N0YSS5"&gt;LG US didn’t share anything more specific when contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying only that “LG may offer certain OS upgrades for select models,” and that “additional details will be provided in the near future on software updates.” An Android 11 update schedule hasn’t yet been confirmed for the US either, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327144/lg-android-11-software-update-wing-phones-mobile-q4-2021"&gt;details posted on LG’s German website&lt;/a&gt; could give a rough idea of what that might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDoIPb"&gt;Unfortunately, LG wasn’t very reliable with updates even prior to its decision to get out of the phone business; OS upgrades came slowly, even for flagship devices. In 2018, the company attempted to remedy this by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/12/17228306/lg-android-software-upgrade-center-research-development"&gt;setting up a Software Upgrade division&lt;/a&gt;, but when it came time to offer Android 9 Pie updates in early 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/1/18164265/lg-android-pie-update-g7-v40-q1-2019"&gt;not much had actually changed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOA9Cw"&gt;If the company does make good on its Android 12 promise, we expect that it would only come to a few high-profile devices, like the Wing and V60. And with Android 11 only scheduled to come to many of the company’s phones much later this year, even if that 12 update does come it’ll likely be a long ways off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG had few smartphone hits, but it’ll still be missed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The US smartphone market just got more boring&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Y5UJKG"&gt;If you’re reading this on a phone, chances are, LG didn’t make it. The Korean tech giant has been losing money and market share with its smartphone division for years, so it wasn’t a surprise when it finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;announced plans to pull the plug&lt;/a&gt; today. You could be forgiven for shrugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmkhG2"&gt;But LG deserves to be remembered as more than just an also-ran. Its phones were rarely big hits, much less often the kind of polished product we’d ever recommend to most over its competitors. Despite this, LG did introduce several features and innovations that the phone world would be worse off without. The company was the first to put ultrawide cameras on its phones, for example, and it pioneered the kind of all-screen, no-button smartphone designs that dominate the market today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2q0XAn"&gt;And particularly in the US, where Android competition is extremely low, the loss of LG will only further entrench the Apple-Samsung duopoly at the high end. LG is the third-biggest phone vendor in the US, with roughly 10 percent of market share, although much of that was midrange prepaid devices sold through carrier stores. LG might not have been at the top of your smartphone shopping list, but if you live in the US, that list just got a lot more boring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EM9ZNj"&gt;LG did have some claim to being a tastemaker in the pre-smartphone world. Its Chocolate and enV phones were stylish devices that helped LG expand its brand recognition around the world. But after the iPhone and Android changed everything, LG struggled to adapt. I’m duty-bound here to mention the original LG Prada, which had a capacitive touchscreen and was technically announced just before the iPhone, but its true legacy is mostly people pointing that out in online comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYXO5w"&gt;LG’s early Android phones weren’t impressive. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/7/2613319/lg-nitro-hd-review"&gt;2011 Nitro HD&lt;/a&gt;, for example, was its first splashy flagship device in a long time, but it was saddled with outdated, clunky software and poor battery life. Its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/15/3506326/lg-optimus-g-review-att-sprint"&gt;Optimus G&lt;/a&gt;, represented a degree of refinement, and by the time the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/19/4749116/lg-g2-review"&gt;G2&lt;/a&gt; came along in 2012, LG’s new G-series was a fairly credible alternative to the likes of Samsung or HTC. The G2 was one of the first flagship smartphones to attempt to cut down on bezel size, for example, and LG made on-screen buttons a core part of its design long before most others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1SuOX"&gt;It was also around this time that LG found a new partner in Google, releasing two Nexus phones in a row. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/2/3589280/google-nexus-4-review"&gt;2012 Nexus 4&lt;/a&gt; was built around the guts of the Optimus G, and it had its fans despite its crippling lack of LTE, weak battery life, and unimpressive camera. The next year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5062724/google-nexus-5-review"&gt;Nexus 5&lt;/a&gt; found an even stronger cult following despite it too having a poor camera and bad battery life. (The red version did look great, and the $349 price didn’t hurt.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The modular LG G5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qnZFVc"&gt;LG’s mobile division kept on ticking on, turning out respectable phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/4/5778556/lg-g3-review"&gt;G3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8559275/lg-g4-review"&gt;G4&lt;/a&gt; without ever really challenging Samsung. The software was still a heavy-handed customization of Android, and LG continued to lag behind peers with its pace of updates, but the hardware was solid. It was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;2016 G5&lt;/a&gt; where things really started to fall apart. Designed around a series of swappable modular accessories called “Friends,” the phone flopped, and LG quickly pretended it never happened. Suffice it to say that if you bought a camera grip or a DAC Hi-Fi audio accessory for your G5, it wouldn’t be able to make Friends with 2017’s G6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8fON0"&gt;It’s unfortunate that LG focused on gimmicks with the G5 because that phone did introduce one new feature that would become ubiquitous in the smartphone market years later: the ultrawide camera. Ultrawides on smartphones let people capture pictures that were previously restricted to camera gearheads, and it’s hard to imagine buying a new phone without one today. But it took a long time for other phone makers to figure out the utility; Apple introduced its first in 2019, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Woc3q"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/31/13462608/lg-v20-review-price-specs-android"&gt;V20&lt;/a&gt;, released the same year as the G5, had another unique feature that would become a hallmark of the company’s phones for years: an honest-to-God headphone jack in the year that Apple decided to ditch it. And not just any headphone jack — one that worked with a built-in quad DAC designed to boost sound quality and appeal to audiophiles. Did this sell many phones? Well, no. But it became a hallmark of LG’s high-end devices ever since, providing an option for wired headphone enthusiasts who despaired as other phone makers followed Apple’s lead one by one. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG G6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VLvRLb"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15188830/lg-g6-2017-review-phone-specs"&gt;2017 G6&lt;/a&gt; got the G-series back on track. It was the first major smartphone released with a now-familiar taller aspect ratio, with an even stronger focus on eliminating bezels than ever before. Of course, not many people noticed as Samsung followed immediately with the similar but sleeker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus"&gt;Galaxy S8&lt;/a&gt; and its “Infinity Display.” Later that year, LG released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/16/16457544/lg-v30-review-design"&gt;V30&lt;/a&gt;, which had a completely new (and very nice) design, but it’s always going to be a hard sell when your most differentiated feature is your (also very nice) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/29/17175466/android-haptic-feedback-is-bad-why"&gt;haptics system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6m3Wv"&gt;From here on out, LG’s flagship phones mostly blurred into one. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/22/17363182/lg-g7-thinq-review-android-phone-price-specs"&gt;G7&lt;/a&gt; was a pretty good facsimile of an iPhone X, even winning an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17591130/editors-choice-lg-g7-thinq-phone-review"&gt;Editor’s Choice designation&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Dan Seifert. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17933558/lg-v40-thinq-review-cameras-5-features-battery-screen-photo-quality"&gt;V40&lt;/a&gt; pioneered the now-common triple-camera setup. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939655/lg-g8x-thinq-dual-screen-review"&gt;G8X&lt;/a&gt; came with a dual-screen case that, in hindsight, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; really didn’t improve much upon a year later. But all of these phones looked basically identical to each other, and none of their key features were viewed as much more than gimmicks at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3a22s"&gt;For every good idea LG had, there’d be something pointless like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18301982/lg-g8-thinq-review-android-phone-snapdragon-855-6-gb-ram-z-camera-sensor"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt;’s vein-sensing “Hand ID” unlock. Despite the company making a big &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/12/17228306/lg-android-software-upgrade-center-research-development"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; about a new Software Upgrade Center to increase the pace of Android updates, nothing changed. And in the face of Samsung’s unstoppable marketing machine, LG’s best attempt at a brand identity was to add “ThinQ” to the name of each flagship phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JHoh1o_5HPFW71nrvu716UduAJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990610/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0007.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Wing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9esvuM"&gt;In its final year, LG’s mobile division did move to address its problems. The Explorer Project was intended to produce more innovative designs, like the beautiful but underpowered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304097/lg-velvet-phone-review-price-us-specs-camera"&gt;Velvet&lt;/a&gt; and the oddball dual-screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;Wing&lt;/a&gt;. At CES this year, the company announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;Rollable&lt;/a&gt; concept phone that it said it planned to take to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky42vU"&gt;That’ll never happen now, and it’s hard to say it’s a huge loss with companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/23/22296817/oppo-mid-air-wireless-charging-x-2021-concept-phone-xiaomi-motorola"&gt;Oppo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;TCL&lt;/a&gt; likely to pick up the slack with their own versions. But in the context of the US phone market, there’s going to be fewer choices, and whoever ends up accounting for LG’s lost market share is unlikely to be as creative a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="AZzaNR"&gt;LG’s phones were rarely, if ever, the best available, but the company did make a significant impact on the smartphone world at large. With its mobile division’s demise, the US market becomes even more homogenous.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG is quitting the smartphone business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wxQw9UvVgTlqt6MyuZMD5HGOn7E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69075601/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Wing was a uniquely designed device released last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6TTSk0"&gt;LG is exiting the smartphone business, the company confirmed today. The decision will “enable the company to focus resources in growth areas such as electric vehicle components, connected devices, smart homes, robotics, artificial intelligence and business-to-business solutions, as well as platforms and services,” LG said in a &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/04/lg-to-close-mobile-phone-business-worldwide/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Xy9US"&gt;Existing phones will remain on sale, and LG says it’ll continue to support its products “for a period of time which will vary by region.” The company hasn’t said anything about possible layoffs except that “details related to employment will be determined at the local level.” LG says it expects to have completed the business’ closure by the end of July this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ueOwC"&gt;The move has been rumored for several months, following the division’s huge losses over the past five years. Once considered a rival to fellow South Korean manufacturer Samsung, LG’s recent high-end smartphones have struggled to compete, while its more affordable handsets have faced stiff competition from Chinese rivals. The company had previously said it hoped to make its smartphone division &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058238/lg-smartphone-profitable-2021-apple-samsung-ces-mwc"&gt;profitable in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moPpjV"&gt;Today’s news means LG’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436954/lg-extendable-sliding-phone-teaser-explorer-project-wing-mobile"&gt;long-teased rollable phone&lt;/a&gt; is unlikely to ever see the light of day. The last time the company showed off the device was back at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;this year’s virtual CES&lt;/a&gt; when the company insisted that the device was real and would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;launching later this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UbwMax"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An attempt to sell the division reportedly failed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bt7zVh"&gt;Reports that LG has been considering exiting smartphones have been around since at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240282/lg-smartphone-business-exit-2021-internal-memo"&gt;the beginning of this year&lt;/a&gt;. Although a company spokesperson branded an earlier report about the company’s potential exit from the smartphone business “&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/15/no-lg-isnt-exiting-the-smartphone-business/"&gt;completely false and without merit,&lt;/a&gt;” an LG official later &lt;a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210120000992"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Korea Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;company had to make “a cold judgment” about the division. Potential measures could include “sale, withdrawal and downsizing of the smartphone business,” the official said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7TzZp"&gt;In March, reports emerged that the company had tried to find a buyer for its smartphone business, but that talks had stalled and it could instead shut down the division. &lt;a href="https://www.donga.com/news/article/all/20210321/106003359/1"&gt;Korean outlet &lt;em&gt;DongA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said the company had ceased development of its upcoming phones with rollable displays, and that it had shelved its planned smartphones for the first half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdnmaa"&gt;As it lost share to rivals, LG released a series of eye-catching devices with unusual form-factors. There was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt;, whose main display rotated to reveal a smaller secondary screen beneath it, or its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939655/lg-g8x-thinq-dual-screen-review"&gt;dual screen&lt;/a&gt; devices. LG also tried its hand at a modular smartphone with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;LG G5&lt;/a&gt;, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;abandon the initiative a year later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VG07jS"&gt;Unfortunately for LG, none of these features were useful enough to turn the phones into mainstream hits, and meanwhile the company’s more traditional handsets fell behind their rivals in core areas like camera performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEkq67"&gt;LG joins a long list of high-profile device makers to give up on smartphones over the years, although many of the brand names have stuck around on devices made by third-party manufacturers. Nokia’s consumer-facing brand lives on atop handsets made by HMD, while Blackberry’s branding was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21120107/tcl-blackberry-ends-phone-global-rights-date-2020"&gt;initially used by TCL&lt;/a&gt; and is set to return this year on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375026/5g-blackberry-phone-android-physical-keyboard-2021-release-date"&gt;device made by OnwardMobility&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also HTC, which still sells a few oddball handsets but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16340108/google-htc-smartphone-team-acquisition-announced"&gt;sold most of its IP to Google in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Who’s next?&lt;/p&gt;
