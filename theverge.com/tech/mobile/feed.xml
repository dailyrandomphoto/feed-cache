    <title>Asus’ pocket-sized Zenfone 8 arrives in the US for $629</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="putYtw"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt;, Asus’ well-specced and compact competitor to the iPhone 12 mini, has launched in the US. The company is currently selling two versions of the phone on &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/category/ZF8"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a model with 128GB of storage which will eventually sell for $629 once its early bird pricing of $599 expires on July 13th, while the other has 256GB of storage and costs $699. Both are equipped with 8GB of RAM and are compatible with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s networks, but not Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jrkGR"&gt;We liked the Zenfone 8 when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;reviewed it last month&lt;/a&gt;. Its 5.9-inch display makes it a relatively compact device in comparison to the rest of the Android market, and its 120Hz refresh rate and Snapdragon 888 processor mean it feels snappy and responsive to use. Its smaller size means its battery life is only okay, and its camera performance could be better, but those might be acceptable compromises if a compact phone is your priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="att6JM"&gt;Unfortunately, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430948/asus-zenfone-8-flip-price-specs-availability"&gt;larger Zenfone 8 Flip&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with a flipping camera mechanism that turns its three rear cameras into selfie shooters, isn’t currently planned for a US release. In Europe, the 8 Flip costs €799, compared to €599 for the regular Zenfone 8.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Palm Pre home button was the first to be the last</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3zOV8whYGjc86JbBpmaliPhGlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518062/dbohn_210622_4651_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The original Palm Pre.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naZwsh"&gt;Physical home buttons are all but extinct on modern smartphones, and the Palm Pre ended them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwC9oK"&gt;It’s not hard to notice that smartphones have steadily shed their buttons throughout the years: keyboards, numpads, call and hang up buttons, directional navigation keys, and more have all fallen to the wayside in favor of more versatile touchscreens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vucRL"&gt;In 2007, the iPhone — with its then-revolutionary 3.5-inch multitouch display — helped to push that trend along by reducing navigation down to a single home button. But even as touchscreen sizes grew and buttons fell away, the humble home button stubbornly stuck around. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/28/18244645/apple-home-button-user-interface-iphone-7-fake"&gt;Apple wouldn’t ditch the button&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade, when the iPhone X arrived in 2017.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSuMvH"&gt;But it was the Palm Pre, and its largely unnecessary center button, that showed home buttons could be removed for good.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8Hu0k23dB3Ulpv_sx22hS6AC3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687394/dbohn_210622_4651_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pre’s home button (left) and the button-less Pre 2 (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XSwpP4"&gt;The original Pre, launched in 2009, may not have seemed like the harbinger of home button doom. After all, the Pre &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a home button, at least for its first iteration. But crucially, the Pre’s home button was effectively a vestigial organ — an appendix that evolution hadn’t quite managed to weed out just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tOma6B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first device to prove that gesture-based navigation could work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ptp40g"&gt;Pressing the Pre’s home button did exactly one thing: brought up webOS’s “Card” app switcher, something that could also be accomplished with a swipe gesture. Everything else about the Pre’s navigation was focused instead on the touch-sensitive area around the button. Gestures were used to return home, go back a screen, pull up a dock of favorite apps, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODSrpW"&gt;The home button itself served more as training wheels for users used to seeing one on other touchscreen devices, rather than a necessary part of the user experience, one that was wholly optional to the actual function of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmxlaN"&gt;It’s no wonder that just a year later the Pre 2 would go on to skip the nearly useless button entirely in favor of an illuminated LED strip for gestures. That familiar-looking white pillbox has been aped by the modern iterations of both iOS and Android for multitasking gestures. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1BGztDEjtgjW8jLrUt6LGbni7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687393/dbohn_210622_4651_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T5dhxV"&gt;There were, of course, issues with Palm’s implementation: some of the gestures were unintuitive, and for users making the jump from a more traditional Palm device, there were a lot of new concepts that had to be learned from scratch. Conversely, more modern smartphones benefit from the advantage of users who are far more familiar with touchscreen interfaces, along with far more real estate to make those gestures work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iG3NY"&gt;But while the Pre would ultimately fail, it still stands out in history as arguably the device with the ultimate home button in the history of smartphones — and as the first device to prove that gesture-based navigation could actually succeed in replacing home buttons. And taking a look at any popular smartphone in 2021, it’s clear that at least in that regard, Palm was way ahead of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSUc2W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNF1f5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked OnePlus Nord 2 renders reveal OnePlus 9-like design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n7ashGDofx1Rz6ONLmrxn6Dfh20=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513991/OnePlus_Nord2_5K2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: 91mobiles and OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6wZqVK"&gt;In 2020, OnePlus expanded its product lineup with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;the midrange OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;, and new leaked renders from &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt; have given us a good look at what the rumored next phone in the Nord line might look like. You can see the renders &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/IpzuSFBc5EM"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt; (which I’ve also embedded at the top of this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xpjOD"&gt;The phone, which I will call the Nord 2 (though we don’t know if that might be the official name) looks to take a lot of design cues from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;the OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;, particularly with the similar-looking rounded rectangle rear camera module and the hole-punch selfie camera. That rear camera module houses 50-megapixel, 8-megapixel, and 2-megapixel cameras, while the selfie camera is 32 megapixels, according to &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d1PxXb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And here comes your very first look at the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnePlusNord2?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OnePlusNord2&lt;/a&gt;! (stunning 5K renders and 360° video)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On behalf of my Friends over &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/91mobiles?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@91mobiles&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/E7QFLTs8f9"&gt;https://t.co/E7QFLTs8f9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/BdxNecaYlh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BdxNecaYlh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1409474091590033411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DVromJ"&gt;As for the screen,&lt;em&gt; 91mobiles&lt;/em&gt; reports that the Nord 2 will have a 6.43-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate and will “probably” have an in-screen fingerprint sensor. The phone will also have a MediaTek Dimensity 1200 system on a chip, up to 12GB of RAM, and as much as 256GB of storage — though that storage “may not be expandable,” according to &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;. The Nord 2 is also rumored to have a 4,500mAh battery and support for 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJWDx5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt; expects that the Nord 2 will be released on July 9th, but we don’t know which markets it could be available in just yet. The original OnePlus Nord didn’t launch in the US, but the product line came stateside with the OnePlus Nord N10 5G and OnePlus Nord N100 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1SNhmt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Nord N10 5G and N100 are coming to the US on January 15th","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"},{"title":"OnePlus Nord review: the right compromises","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>How to watch Samsung’s Galaxy MWC 2021 virtual event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0yK9yhvUblKVEv9BDYwKEe_8oQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513053/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXAYcC"&gt;Samsung is hosting a virtual event for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;Mobile World Congress 2021&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, June 28th, where it promises to share how it’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544257/samsung-google-wear-os-smartwatch-mwc-2021-announcement-preview"&gt;reimagining smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;.” Along with wearables, the company is also supposed to share news on the latest additions to the Galaxy ecosystem and the work it's doing to enhance mobile security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0C0GI"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjfkIL2lrHxAhWFNX0KHVi_BYsQFnoECAYQAw&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22432922%2Fgoogle-io-2021-rumors-news-announcements&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw27o53hsjV_iPz1xRvsOq89"&gt;I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Google announced that Samsung’s Tizen operating system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;would be merging with Wear OS&lt;/a&gt; to serve as the future software powering smartwatches for Android phones (tentatively called “Wear”). There are no rumors to suggest Samsung will offer an in-depth look at those efforts, but recent leaks show that the company does have &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJj52Wl7HxAhUiIDQIHQBqBU0QFnoECAQQAw&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F23%2F22546997%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2xU6T9qVmgE9WrJJYzUSoR"&gt;a new Galaxy Active Smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; in the works it might announce. There’s also a chance Samsung will show off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZjqhH"&gt;The event is set to run for exactly one hour, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/agenda/session/galaxy-ecosystem-new-watch-experience-mobile-security"&gt;Samsung’s MWC event page&lt;/a&gt;, which should hopefully give the company plenty of time to get into all of the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="UFySNo"&gt;When does Samsung’s MWC 2021 virtual event start?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="HlZgDu"&gt;It starts at 10:15AM PT / 1:15PM ET / 7:15PM CET on Monday, June 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Zs0EhM"&gt;How do I watch Samsung’s MWC 2021 virtual event?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="CTAXMG"&gt;We’ll embed Samsung’s livestream above as soon as it’s available. You can also follow along with us at the links below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UHCZUC"&gt;Samsung is streaming the event live on its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfSZvIqYDSM"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/"&gt;Newsroom site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>TCL’s 20 Pro 5G will offer a big screen and wireless charging for $499</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dR9vu_vbJ0aXrin7M11RmOEtP0M=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69512897/TCL_20_Pro_5G_design_14.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s 20 Pro 5G is priced to compete with established midrangers like the Galaxy A52 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E7YSI"&gt;TCL is bringing three of its 20-series phones to the US today, with the $499 20 Pro 5G leading the way. It’s joined by the $249 TCL 20S with a trimmed-down feature set and the $189 TCL 20 SE equipped with a massive display and 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWd228"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382312/tcl-20-series-pro-5g-20l-plus-price-specs-features"&gt;First announced in April&lt;/a&gt;, the 20 Pro 5G is positioned to take on midrange devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;. It features a large curved 6.67-inch 1080p OLED screen, a 48-megapixel main camera with OIS, wireless charging, and sub-6GHz 5G connectivity. The device comes standard with 256GB of built-in storage and 6GB of RAM coupled with a Snapdragon 750G processor. There’s even a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TpQoVsWJ2NLsO5i0_gwDsyPBx5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677990/TCL_20_Pro_5G_Moondust_Gray_Front.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 20 Pro 5G’s screen is slightly curved for a higher-end look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UHbn82"&gt;Qi wireless charging at up to 15W is supported, and the 20 Pro 5G is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery. It ships with Android 11, and TCL says it will get at least two OS platform updates. At launch, it will work on T-Mobile’s 4G and 5G networks and AT&amp;amp;T’s 4G, and will gain compatibility with Verizon’s 4G and low-band 5G networks “in the coming weeks.” Spec-for-spec, it looks like a worthy midrange competitor. Wireless charging is still somewhat scarce in the $500-and-below class, and the 20 Pro offers more built-in storage than the A52 5G or the Pixel 4A 5G for the same price. Throw in a big, 1080p OLED screen, and it’s an intriguing proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="M10LIX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10621344"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gxOUES"&gt;A step down on the price scale, the 20S and 20 SE are equipped to compete with the Moto G and lower-tier Samsung Galaxy A-series devices of the world, with bigger-than-average screens and more generous built-in storage than is typical. The TCL 20S offers a 6.67-inch 1080p screen without the curve on the 20 Pro 5G — and misses out on a few of the higher-tier model’s features like wireless charging and an optically stabilized main camera. It uses a Snapdragon 665 processor with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and offers a bigger 5,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RquAs3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219101/tcl-20-5g-20-se-android-phone-price-specs"&gt;The 20 SE&lt;/a&gt;, as the least expensive of the three, gets a huge 6.82-inch 720p display, Snapdragon 460 processor with 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 5,000mAh battery. It also looks the part of a budget device, with a more prominent chin compared to the 20S and its slimmer bezels as well as a notch for the front-facing camera. Both will work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile; the 20 SE won’t be compatible with Verizon, while the 20S will.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 Plus ups the CPU and AI performance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GKYET1A-HGn2YHS5UAlyHS5yQhs=/0x4:5300x3537/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69512467/Snapdragon_888_Plus_QRD___AI.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nCWu9Y"&gt;Qualcomm’s best mobile processor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21672519/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-cpu-gpu-details-performance-ai-isp-photography-specs-release-date"&gt;the Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt;, is getting even more powerful at MWC 2021 with the announcement of the Snapdragon 888 Plus. The upgraded model boasts a boosted clock speed, bumping the Kryo 680 CPU from 2.84GHz up to 2.995GHz (which Qualcomm is optimistically rounding up to 3GHz in its marketing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KV5XWs"&gt;Also getting upgraded is Qualcomm’s sixth-gen AI Engine. Where the base Snapdragon 888 could perform 26 trillion operations per second (TOPS) for AI tasks, the 888 Plus is approximately 20 percent more powerful, capable of 32 TOPS. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c4q637sBl_x4VGCGdK5BRRajoJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22682096/Snapdragon_888_Plus_Logo.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UyGo46"&gt;Midyear refreshes for its top chips are nothing new for Qualcomm, which took similar approaches with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/15/20694498/qualcomm-855-plus-processor-announced-features-specs"&gt;Snapdragon 855 Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/8/21312035/qualcomm-new-snapdragon-865-plus-gaming-performance-faster-cpu-gpu-wifi"&gt;865 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, each serving as more powerful mid-cycle updates for the standard 855 and 865 models. The company also did an additional refresh on the 865 at the beginning of 2021 with the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22233584/qualcomm-snapdragon-870-865-plus-refresh-processor-smartphones-2021"&gt;Snapdragon 870&lt;/a&gt;, a sort of Snapdragon 865 Plus-plus that offered additional improvements and a higher clock speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04r6AE"&gt;It likely won’t be long before the Snapdragon 888 Plus starts to show up, either. Qualcomm says that the first phones with the chip should be announced in Q3 2021. Honor has already said that it’ll be using the new chip in its upcoming Magic 3 flagship, with Motorola, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Asus also planning devices featuring the Snapdragon 888 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC filing shows Verizon has built a smart display powered by Amazon’s Alexa </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWjuB7hdClKKJ9M-IahFNqXbg5I=/126x0:1248x748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69508856/verizon_display_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An image of a smart display device from a patent application Verizon filed with the FCC | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://fccid.io/NKR-LVD1-IDU" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mzMYwW"&gt;According to a Friday filing with the Federal Communications Commission (first &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/verizon-smart-display-alexa"&gt;discovered by &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), Verizon is preparing to launch a smart display device based on the Alexa voice assistant. &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/NKR-LVD1-IDU"&gt;The FCC filing shows&lt;/a&gt; a basic-looking device that resembles an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;, with an 8-inch display and front-facing camera, and the specs show it has 4GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, Bluetooth, wi-fi and 4G connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAXnhT"&gt;It’s not clear from the filing what the user interface will look like on its screen but the device, referred to as LVD1, will “wake” when users speak the phrase “Hi Verizon” to it. That would seem to confirm, as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; notes, that the device is part of Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231336/amazon-alexa-auto-ai-custom-digital-assistants-car-makers"&gt;Alexa Custom Assistant program&lt;/a&gt;, which allows companies to build their own versions of Alexa for their branded devices. building Alexa skills specific to certain devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3Zvd4"&gt;A user manual included in the FCC filing indicates the device supports the BlueJeans videoconferencing platform that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223454/verizon-bluejeans-video-zoom-conferencing-rivals"&gt;Verizon acquired last April&lt;/a&gt;, which would be a logical use for it. At the time of the acquisition, Verizon said in a statement that “BlueJeans will be deeply integrated into Verizon’s 5G product roadmap, providing secure and real-time engagement solutions for high growth areas such as telemedicine, distance learning and field service work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pe3mo"&gt;Verizon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbHHE2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord N200 5G review: T-Mobile’s best phone under $250</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re on the Un-carrier, the N200 offers 5G and a high-quality screen for the right price.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6BOFeg"&gt;The answer to whether you should buy the $239 OnePlus Nord N200 5G depends a lot on who your wireless carrier is. If you’re on T-Mobile — and thanks to a generous trade-in offer and a carrier exclusive, you probably are if you’re considering the N200 — then this is a fine, basic device that will allow you to take advantage of the company’s good 5G network at a very low price. The N200 5G will only work on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 4G networks, however, so if you’re with either of those carriers, it’s not your best option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Z2160"&gt;Why does your carrier make such a difference? Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G networks aren’t great at the moment, so using the N200 as a 4G-only device isn’t actually a big deal right now. But they’ll start getting much better over the next couple of years thanks to some newly acquired spectrum, and when that happens, being stuck on LTE could become a real drawback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIgNgq"&gt;The N200 5G has a few things going for it aside from 5G connectivity, starting with a big 5,000mAh battery. It has a large 6.5-inch display with a faster refresh rate that’s one of the best available in this class. You’ll also get three years of security updates, which isn’t &lt;em&gt;stellar&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but is an improvement over the two years more common among sub-$300 phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZaQMw8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10620908"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OQOFEo"&gt;On the downside, the camera system is basic. While overall phone performance is fine for day-to-day email and browsing, it’s a little slow with more processing-intensive tasks. And while you can get by on the 64GB of built-in storage, most people will need to add in the cost of a MicroSD card to their purchase for expanded storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OHbxB"&gt;The N200 is an acceptable, inexpensive 5G device, and it’s even a relatively good deal as a 4G device at the moment. But your mobile carrier and your inclination toward keeping your phone for more than one or two years makes recommending the N200 5G complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hF4edUedso0aYhx715Y3XtHFSZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677496/ajohnson_210623_4644_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N200 5G is one of few devices in its class to offer a screen with 90Hz refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cwU1sh"&gt;OnePlus N200 5G screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sMDXOX"&gt;As far as screens on budget devices go, the N200 5G has one of the nicest out there. It’s a big 6.5-inch LCD panel with 1080p resolution, which is an upgrade from 720p that’s more typical in this class. It also stands out with a faster 90Hz refresh rate, making scrolling and animations look just a little smoother than usual. The screen is usable even in very bright, direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pP5DfO"&gt;The N200’s battery life is very good, thanks to a big 5,000mAh cell. It also supports 18W charging with the included wired charger — not &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; fast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;like OnePlus’ pricier devices&lt;/a&gt;, but good enough to take it from 12 percent to a full charge in about two hours. With moderate use I got two days out of the N200 before I dipped into low battery territory; a full day of heavy use should be no problem, and many will see it last well into the second day, if not longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oBPkla"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most people will need to add a MicroSD card for more space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5gxBHT"&gt;The N200 uses a Snapdragon 480 5G processor, which is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;relatively new chipset designed for budget 5G phones&lt;/a&gt; like this one. It’s coupled with 4GB of RAM and keeps up well in day-to-day use switching apps and scrolling social media. It doesn’t take a lot to push it outside of its comfort zone where you’ll notice slight hesitations and stuttering, especially with intensive tasks like zooming in and out of Google Maps and starting navigation. But considering the price, it feels appropriately equipped to provide usable daily performance over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwKCyE"&gt;While you might be able to get by on the N200’s 64GB of built-in storage, it’s on the lower side and a healthy chunk of that is occupied by system files. Most people will need to add a MicroSD card for more space, so consider that extra $20 or so part of the overall cost of the phone unless you’re really frugal with your storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yjFr7J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the N200’s 5G connectivity works on T-Mobile, but on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon the phone is 4G-only&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8OAKrz"&gt;As noted above, the N200’s 5G connectivity works on T-Mobile, but on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon the phone is 4G-only. It supports sub-6GHz 5G only — no super-fast mmWave, but that’s not a big deal since it’s hard to find and T-Mobile doesn’t offer much of it. There’s also no support for the C-band spectrum that will be put to use for 5G starting early next year, but that would be a bigger deal if the phone could use AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon 5G. It can’t, so it’s not. What you do get access to is T-Mobile’s 5G sub-6 5G network, which is good and has broad coverage, even if it’s not mind-bogglingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTYZKp"&gt;Android 11 is loaded on the N200 out of the box, and OnePlus says it will provide one more major OS platform update during the phone’s life span. It will also get the aforementioned three years of security update support, which is a better-than-average policy for a budget Android phone. OnePlus’ implementation of Android is less fussy than most and is mercifully low on clutter and pre-downloaded apps. It’s a grown-up-looking interface that’s about as close as you’ll get to a “pure” Android experience outside of Google’s own Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHgFURqjsIIuX5f-FJa0V9wrf6M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677497/ajohnson_210623_4644_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N200’s main rear-facing camera uses a 13-megapixel sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vhpB9d"&gt;OnePlus N200 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="m4NjF8"&gt;The N200’s camera performance is acceptable, if a bit disappointing even considering the phone’s price. Included are a 13-megapixel f/2.2 main camera, 2-megapixel f/2.4 macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Around front there’s a 13-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3weoTJ"&gt;That 13-megapixel main camera will do fine for snapshots in good lighting, but it quickly reaches its limits with high-contrast scenes, like landscapes with deep shadows and bright highlights. Noise starts to creep into shots taken in moderate lighting conditions, like interiors, and dark scenes show a lot of smeared details and noise. Night mode works well enough to preserve a little more detail, but it’s only suitable for scenes without moving subjects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cnALW6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10621086"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DWs5CO"&gt;The N200’s camera system may be more of a disappointment considering that the higher-tier Nord N10 5G’s 64-megapixel camera is surprisingly good. The N10 costs $60 more than the N200 (a full 25 percent higher) so it’s not a totally fair comparison, but I can’t help feeling that the N200 could have been a little better equipped. Pixel count isn’t everything, but in this case, a newer, higher-resolution sensor would probably have made a significant difference in detail retention and its handling of high-contrast scenes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xsuqtRm9MA0ww26SXO3QNUW-LRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677495/ajohnson_210623_4644_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re on T-Mobile, the N200 is a good pick for a nice screen and 5G at a low price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XqudbD"&gt;If you’re considering the OnePlus N200 5G because T-Mobile is offering you a good deal on one, then I think there’s a good argument for this phone. It doesn’t offer a lot in the way of nice extras and features, but you will get a good screen, long battery life, and a 5G device that should last a few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHGDJZ"&gt;If you live in an area with poor T-Mobile 5G coverage, or you’re with another wireless carrier, then you’ll be better served by another option. You could save some money and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;go with the $179 4G-only N100&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a lot of the same features. The screen isn’t quite as detailed (720p vs. 1080p) but you still get that 90Hz refresh rate, big battery, and nice OnePlus user interface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NRBOsJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you’ll get a good screen, long battery life, and a 5G device that should last a few years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ABv6hi"&gt;On the other hand, if you can spend a little more, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$279 Samsung A32 5G is worth considering&lt;/a&gt;. The interface is more cluttered and its screen isn’t as nice with its 720p resolution and standard 60Hz refresh rate, but almost every other aspect of the device is meaningfully upgraded, from the camera to wider 5G compatibility to a stronger four-year security support policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2h8CDU"&gt;All of that said, if you’re comfortable with the N200’s shortcomings and you’re tempted by a sweet deal from T-Mobile, I won’t be the one to stand in your way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 revealed in new leak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J5sOxxbmLf5fp1AedV2sW4qIxb4=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499738/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4y0Cej"&gt;Samsung’s 2021 foldable phones have been revealed in a new leak that shows off the design of the both the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3, which are rumored to be released sometime over the summer. The picture comes from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1408107239903223808?s=21"&gt;noted phone leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;, who posted the image to Twitter with the additional information that the Z Fold 3 is “definitely S-Pen compatible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6OFitp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not always. &lt;a href="https://t.co/SzBFpRKF5s"&gt;https://t.co/SzBFpRKF5s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/uf6rJAQhli"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uf6rJAQhli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1408107239903223808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aXPRs1"&gt;Blass’ first image doesn’t reveal too much about the design of the larger foldable, given that it shows the interior of the device (which appears similar to last year’s Z Fold 2). A second image posted shows off a slimmed down camera bump and a new “Fold Edition” S Pen stylus that will help the new foldable stand out — and potentially replace Samsung’s Galaxy Note phone in the company’s increasingly crowded smartphone line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1NCfLs"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3, on the other hand, has a more substantial redesign visible, with a larger external display and a two-tone color scheme for the now-vertically stacked cameras that are reminiscent of the Galaxy S21’s revamped design from earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ktbd6u"&gt;The leak also reveals that Samsung appears to be counting the Z Flip and its 5G variant, the Z Flip 5G, as separate iterations of the phone, allowing it to name the latest model of the vertical foldable the Z Flip 3 — nicely matching the Z Fold 3’s numbering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0HfnR"&gt;It’s not entirely clear when Samsung will be officially announcing the Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3, although the company does have an event scheduled for MWC 2021 on June 28th, where it’s promised to showcase the “Galaxy ecosystem” as well as its new watch experience that Samsung is collaborating with Google with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pokfvh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2:00pm EST: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional image of Z Fold 3 and its new S-Pen stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK carrier EE introduces EU roaming charges following Brexit</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4h0YM0"&gt;UK carrier EE is introducing roaming charges for customers traveling to almost all EU countries from January next year, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57595913"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The change applies to any customers who sign up or upgrade their plans after July 7th. From next year, these customers will be charged a flat fee of £2 (around $2.78) a day while in 47 “European destinations,” to get access to their plan’s existing data, minutes, and text allowances. The BT-owned carrier is also selling a 30-day Roam Abroad Pass, which is included with certain plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aJvPy"&gt;Roaming charges for UK customers visiting mainland Europe used to be commonplace until the European Union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15418776/eu-mobile-roaming-charges-date-june-15"&gt;outlawed the practice in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. However, following the UK’s departure from the EU, which involved a transition period that ended on December 31st 2020, UK carriers no longer have to abide by these rules. The UK’s trade deal with the EU encourages them to have “transparent and reasonable rates” for roaming, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45064268"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the charges aren’t specifically prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wp67b3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fees cover 47 European destinations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="16oFbv"&gt;The 47 European destinations include EU member states, plus other locations like the Canary Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, and Vatican City. Customers will not be charged an extra fee to use their phones in the Republic of Ireland, EE says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3h00Zj"&gt;EE’s decision makes it the first UK carrier to introduce roaming charges post-Brexit. It’s a marked shift from what it told &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45064268"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; in January&lt;/a&gt;, when it said that its customers “enjoy inclusive roaming in Europe and beyond” and that it didn’t “have any plans to change this based on the Brexit outcome.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Eqfl0"&gt;Competitors Three and O2 have also made changes to how much data their customers can use while in Europe, but have stopped short of introducing blanket charges for all usage. &lt;a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2021/06/clarifying-o2-uks-tougher-excess-data-charges-for-eu-roaming.html"&gt;O2 is adding a fair use cap&lt;/a&gt; of 25GB a month for users in the EU, while Three is reducing its existing cap from 20GB to 12GB, &lt;em&gt;BBC News &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5t4lQ"&gt;In a statement, an EE spokesperson said the charges “will support investment into our UK based customer service and leading UK network.” &lt;/p&gt;
