    <title>Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra is getting an ultra-limited release in India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ixpGO5NDQgFFdSFUavpoihg_A3w=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541768/DSCF7720_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LbPe5P"&gt;Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra is finally going on sale in India in limited quantities. The company had announced its latest flagship smartphone all the way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;back in March&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s been near-impossible to buy one outside of China ever since. The phone sold out instantly in the UK in May, suggesting very limited stock, and last month Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XiaomiIndia/status/1400042494792921089"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the Indian launch would be delayed “due to circumstances beyond our control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgoLQA"&gt;Now, Xiaomi has announced details of how people in India will actually be able to buy one, as long as they’re willing to jump through a few hoops. Customers will need to buy an “ultra gift card” for Rs. 1,999 (~$27) &lt;a href="https://in.event.mi.com/in/mi-11-ultra-register"&gt;on the Mi.com website&lt;/a&gt;, which can later be redeemed against the price of the Mi 11 Ultra and includes some bonuses like two free screen replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0QVgbI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;⚡️&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mi11Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Mi11Ultra&lt;/a&gt;⚡️&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Register for the first sale by purchasing the ultra gift card, get guaranteed access to sale &amp;amp; other benefits  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  2 Free Screen Replacements&lt;br&gt;  Ultra Merchandise Superfan Box&lt;br&gt;  Times Prime Annual Membership&lt;br&gt;  Extra F-code&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Know more: &lt;a href="https://t.co/GGbHaZvU2d"&gt;https://t.co/GGbHaZvU2d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/61x4jYCREP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/61x4jYCREP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mi India (@XiaomiIndia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XiaomiIndia/status/1411280371396669440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="18WscM"&gt;The Mi 11 Ultra itself starts at Rs. 69,999 (~$940) in India. Xiaomi hasn’t said how long the gift cards will be available for, how many phones it’ll make available for purchase, or when they’ll ship, but it’s describing the release as a “limited-quantity sale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3ELbM"&gt;Xiaomi’s key selling point for the Mi 11 Ultra over its (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;very good&lt;/a&gt;) non-ultra sibling is an all-new camera system. The main camera has a large 1/1.12-inch 50-megapixel sensor, and there are also 48-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto modules. All of this is housed in a gigantic camera bump complete with a secondary OLED screen that can serve as a viewfinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eco7pE"&gt;I’ve been using the Mi 11 Ultra for a while now — stay tuned for our review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL 20 Pro 5G review: good looks aren’t everything</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The 20 Pro 5G includes premium features you’d be hard-pressed to find in another $500 phone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jSGHyq"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G is a good-looking budget phone that works out some of the first-gen kinks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257398/tcl-10-pro-review-release-date-specs-features-camera-screen"&gt;we encountered in the 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but it isn’t quite ready to take on the category heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMAQQq"&gt;Much like its predecessor, the 20 Pro 5G combines a high-end look with a budget price tag — $499 for 6GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in this case. That’s $50 higher than the 10 Pro’s starting price, but this time you get more storage and 5G, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6klsf"&gt;It’s worth stating again: this is a very good-looking phone for just $500. Its huge curved-edge display boasts very slim bezels, and build quality is top-notch with an aluminum frame and glass on the front and back. The rear-facing cameras are neatly arranged under a vertical strip that sits flush with the rear panel. It’s tidy, and kind of retro cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eWAn76"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10634905"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nudokf"&gt;Good looks aside, I wouldn’t recommend the 20 Pro 5G to most people. There are a few usability quirks that make it feel like the second-gen device that it is. But more importantly, the 20 Pro 5G’s network compatibility and security support policy just aren’t as strong as the Pixels and Galaxy A-series phones in the category. It’s slated for two OS upgrades (decent for a midrange phone) but only two years of security patches (less good). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jINwzQ"&gt;It also lacks compatibility with AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network and isn’t certified to use C-band frequencies that will likely make Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G networks much better over the next couple of years. It’s yet another device that may be best suited for T-Mobile customers who will get full 4G and 5G connectivity and don’t need to worry about C-band as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxxRtx"&gt;There’s a lot to like about the 20 Pro 5G, and TCL has made some steps in the right direction with this device, but it still comes up short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ma3dxXAld7tygbzrq0GE5sXHAZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693979/ajohnson_210630_4655_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rather than offering a faster refresh rate, TCL has opted to include its second-gen Nxtvision display technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FEU2ls"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G screen, performance, and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CDOuhY"&gt;A lot of the credit for the 20 Pro 5G’s premium look goes to its curved 6.67-inch 1080p OLED screen with slim bezels — you just won’t find another screen like it in this class. It offers a standard 60Hz refresh rate, bucking the trend toward faster 90Hz and 120Hz displays, so you won’t get that smooth-scrolling goodness here. I noticed a little bugginess in the screen’s color temperature jumping between warm and cool, particularly after leaving the camera app, but overall it’s a pleasure to look at. And thankfully, it seems much less prone to registering touches accidentally on the curved sides than in the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leyDBH"&gt;TCL has included its second-generation Nxtvision 2 technology here, which aims to make standard images and video look more like high dynamic range content, with deeper blacks and brighter whites. You can choose from a few different profiles, with “vivid” as the default, or turn it off entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjQ7ch"&gt;We thought the first generation of this tech was a little heavy-handed, and I can’t say I’m impressed this time around either. The effect is often so subtle that I’m sure I wouldn’t notice it if I didn’t know it was there. When I could see a noticeable difference with it turned on versus off, it made images look too unnaturally processed for my taste. That said, I don’t think it will negatively impact anyone’s experience using this phone, it’s just not the impressive feature that TCL makes it out to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xa93z0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TCL seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2mQ5WZ"&gt;The company seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates, and it’s starting to feel like a weird choice. A faster refresh rate screen is an obvious benefit that many more users will see and appreciate. The advantages of viewing HDR content on an HDR screen are real, but the effect is hard to mimic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlygzZ"&gt;TCL has equipped the 20 Pro 5G with a Snapdragon 750G 5G processor and 6GB of RAM. It’s certainly up to day-to-day tasks, and stutters only occasionally with heavier tasks. The customizable smart key from last year’s model makes an appearance again here, and there are a ton of functions you can map it to, from opening a particular app to launching the camera in a specific mode, like night or portrait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zoKYr"&gt;It’s really useful, but unfortunately, it’s still easy to bump unintentionally. It’s positioned out of the way so that I don’t hit it while I’m using the phone; it’s just when I pick up the device or my hand brushes against it that I press it by accident. This is how you end up with multiple photos of your couch cushions in your camera roll, which nobody needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DMLv2y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s another premium feature on board here, too: wireless charging at up to 15W&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4HAibz"&gt;Moving along to the top edge of the device, there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is great! The phone’s mono speaker isn’t very good, but I wouldn’t expect it to be at this price, and anyway: headphone jack! The optical in-display fingerprint sensor is also good — one of the faster and more accurate I’ve encountered in the midrange class. I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate this after struggling with some finicky fingerprint sensors in lower-end devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOVzUo"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery. It will get you through a day of moderate use, but overall battery life doesn’t seem quite as robust as it could be. If you’re a heavy user, you may be pushing your luck by the end of a long day of use. There’s another premium feature on board here, too: wireless charging at up to 15W. That’s something that’s still hard to come by in the $500-and-under class, and it’s only a little slower than the phone’s 18W wired charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1910Q"&gt;On the software side, the 20 Pro 5G ships with Android 11 and TCL has promised it two OS upgrades. One (or god forbid, none) is common in this class, so that’s great to see. However, it will get just two years of security updates, which lags behind Samsung and Google’s four- and three-year policies, respectively. You should get more than a couple of years of support out of a $500 phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JH6614"&gt;Otherwise, TCL’s take on Android is a good one. It’s highly customizable but doesn’t feel overly busy, with handy features like a tray for frequently used apps tucked away on the right-hand side of the screen, and the option to rearrange the order of system navigation buttons during setup. It’s a lot, but it feels like useful stuff rather than customization overkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pc-uvEmcDX2EsQ0JR-ebB7ndNm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693982/ajohnson_210630_4655_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are four camera sensors on the rear of the device, including a stabilized 48-megapixel main camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CF7tGL"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oDC2iD"&gt;The 20 Pro 5G includes a 48-megapixel f/1.8 main camera with optical image stabilization, which isn’t guaranteed at this price and is a real benefit in dim lighting conditions. There’s also a 16-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, and 2-megapixel depth sensor as well as a 32-megapixel selfie camera around front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40vSfH"&gt;The camera hardware is clearly capable of good things. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail in photos I took outside in good light — there’s some aggressive sharpening going on, but it’s not too distracting. However, there’s still room for improvement. Colors like greens and blues look a little unnatural and bright. Photos can look flat and washed out, and I spotted more lens flare in my images than I’d expect to see. It’s possible that this is an effect from the cameras’ recessed position rather than on a protruding bump, which would be a real shame — I’ll gladly take an uglier camera bump than flare in my photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D94MRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10634994"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="66E3QV"&gt;Portrait mode does a convincing enough job of separating subjects from a blurred background, though a disappointing number of my photos showed a little subject blur even with OIS assisting. “Super Night” mode is a bit of a miss. It seems to retain more detail in very low-light images compared to standard auto mode, but it also employs some heavy noise-reduction. Images show some unnatural smoothing and can skew a little too warm — personally I’d stick to auto mode for low-light shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDA8fP"&gt;All in all, the 20 Pro 5G’s camera capabilities are underwhelming. There are some real positives — OIS helps you get more steady shots and detail retention is good — but as a total package it’s not quite on par with the likes of the Pixel 4A 5G and Galaxy A52 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwa5VdasTJagR-lQ2UjV1gCvLJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693981/ajohnson_210630_4655_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While it offers some premium features for its price, the 20 Pro 5G is hard to recommend to just anyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YaZVgv"&gt;There’s a whole lot to like about the TCL 20 Pro 5G, but it still feels like a device that’s still shaking off some early-generation quirks. While it does offer some features and hardware you’d be hard-pressed to find on any other $500 phone, it’s not quite the total package that it should be for that price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBQNV5"&gt;There have been some important improvements over the first generation. The curved sides of the screen are less prone to accidental touches, and there have been some nice additions like the inclusion of wireless charging. Yet some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device: the Smart Key is still easy to press accidentally, the camera is basic, and Nxtvision is underwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jdEFyR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3c8nC"&gt;And then there’s network compatibility — in the US, it’s kind of a jigsaw puzzle to which only the established players have all of the pieces. Thanks to some of these missing pieces, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers won’t get the most out of this device and its 5G capabilities. And with only two years of security updates promised, it lags behind the competition in terms of longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CwH3IS"&gt;If you’re on T-Mobile and you’d really like a budget device with a flagship look and feel, then the 20 Pro 5G is a good option, with a strong caveat that you’ll be putting up with some issues that competitors have already figured out. Most others would do best to consider one of those $500 midrange heavyweights. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; offers a fast refresh rate screen, better network compatibility, and a solid four-year security support policy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;The Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt; is a good option, too, with a better camera — if you can find it still in stock. You won’t get a fancy curved display or the high-end build quality with either of those alternatives, but depending on your priorities, they may serve you better in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Qualcomm CEO sees former Apple execs as key to beating M1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0mltVZY3kM-rUP2rOcALXXWqBM=/26x0:455x286/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535459/ca_mwc.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7p0LX3"&gt;Qualcomm’s new CEO, Cristiano Amon, has big plans for competing with Apple when it comes to laptop performance, thanks to the ex-Apple employees Qualcomm brought on when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;it acquired Nuvia earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-ceo-focus-idUSKCN2E75QY"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he believes Qualcomm could make the world’s best processor, which would require designing a chip better than Apple’s M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvbyn8"&gt;Before assuming his new role as CEO, Amon was head of Qualcomm’s semiconductor division and was in charge of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;acquisition of Nuvia for $1.4 billion&lt;/a&gt;. The startup was founded by three former Apple engineers who specialized in chip design and worked on Apple’s A-series SOCs. Those founders joined Qualcomm, and it’s apparent now that they’ll be focusing on making chips for consumer computers (though the company wouldn’t turn down the chance to license its tech to data centers, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;). Qualcomm hopes to start selling Arm laptop chips, powered by Nuvia’s designs, next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jm3rlX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple hasn’t added 5G, or any cellular compatibility at all, to its M1 Macs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="soFLVj"&gt;Amon also hopes to use the company’s experience in making 5G chips and smartphone processors to help provide a better laptop experience, by building 5G connectivity into its laptop-focused CPUs. Adding 5G, or any cellular compatibility at all, is something that Apple hasn’t done yet for its M1 Macs, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/macbook-air-and-pro-with-m1-opens-the-door-to-5g-it-cant-come-soon-enough/"&gt;despite demand from some&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;M1-powered iPad Pro has a 5G option&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NehvPD"&gt;It’s safe to say that if Qualcomm wants to become a dominant player in powering laptops like it is in the smartphone market, it has a lot of work to do. While Microsoft does use Qualcomm-designed chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496677/microsoft-surface-pro-x-refresh-sq2-processor-new-platinum-color-option"&gt;in its Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; (which made an appearance at the Windows 11 event), the list of &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile-computing/mobile-pcs"&gt;Windows PCs with Qualcomm inside&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a long one. It’s also unlikely that Intel is planning on just letting Arm take over the laptop space without a fight — the &lt;a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313803-intel-makes-it-official-hybrid-cpu-cores-arrive-with-alder-lake"&gt;company is working on hybrid CPUs&lt;/a&gt; that, like Arm, mix high-power and efficiency-focused cores to provide better battery life, but using an x86 architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxBCE8"&gt;Amon &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-ceo-focus-idUSKCN2E75QY"&gt;also talked to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about challenges and opportunities the company faces due to sanctions in China and about the company’s struggles to become a household name like Intel or AMD.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="sxGtmt"&gt;Following last month’s announcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;that OnePlus was integrating with Oppo&lt;/a&gt;, effectively becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543184/oppo-oneplus-merger-brand-pete-lau-bbk-memo"&gt;a sub-brand of the phone manufacturer&lt;/a&gt;, the company &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/update-to-the-oxygenos-codebase-and-software-maintenance-schedule.1462181/"&gt;announced on Friday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s also merging OxygenOS with Oppo’s ColorOS operating system (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/02/oneplus-android-update-schedule-years-oxygenos-coloros/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuNLqJ"&gt;Both companies’ software will remain separate and continue to serve their individual regions (OxygenOS for OnePlus phones globally, ColorOS on OnePlus and Oppo devices in China) but share a common codebase, which OnePlus says should standardize its software experience and streamline the development process for future OxygenOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14iqGm"&gt;OnePlus says the change will also allow the company to guarantee better Android update  support going forward, something Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;has also tried to improve on&lt;/a&gt; in the last few years. OnePlus lays out the life span for updates as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="exG21w"&gt;Flagship phones including the T and R models get three major Android updates and four years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dpAw7u"&gt;Nord and Nord CE phones get two major Android updates and three years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FOtNuJ"&gt;Nord N phones will get one major Android update and three years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jIYDoF"&gt;OnePlus does limit those update commitments to the OnePlus 8 and up, so older OnePlus devices will be out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsAxF6"&gt;As the next step in whatever is going on with OnePlus, Oppo, and the wider BBK Electronics umbrella, merging the companies’ software on the backend seems like a net positive for OnePlus users. How independent OnePlus is now that it’s “integrated” seems about as unclear as when it was independent, owned by BBK, and seemingly sharing some parts with Oppo, but as long as phones are supported, it hopefully shouldn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ex8yvg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Monster Slayer&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go-like&lt;/em&gt; augmented reality game for mobile devices set in &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe, will be released on July 21st, &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/the-witcher-monster-slayer-launches-globally-on-july-21st/"&gt;CD Projekt Red announced on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. It will be available for free on both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHTN79"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Monster Slayer&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll explore the world around you and fight menacing virtual monsters in AR. You’ll also go on “story-driven quests that propel you through epic adventures inspired by the &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; series, taking you deep into the heart of what it means to be an elite monster slayer,” &lt;a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/monster-slayer"&gt;according to the game’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The game was first announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402495/the-witcher-monster-slayer-ar-game-iphone-android-pokemon-go"&gt;in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mJgj5P"&gt;If you’re on Android, you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa3ZaOVk4RF8zVGZEc01RU3RPZXRVV08zYTVkQXxBQ3Jtc0ttaHVqWjdXUE82cEJ3VnZHZnlyNGJfV1l0bEJCMUg1VkR3OHUwdC1mSEFYMC13ME1uTEpuelBXOXlqUDF5VlFlSHNzWFBBNXk0YjlJTXo5QTQxX2dHUC1Uckxfd3k3aHZfZWhjTURaVGFWWEExdTE3VQ&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.spokko.witchermonsterslayer"&gt;pre-register for the game on Google Play right now&lt;/a&gt;. If you do, you’ll be able to play the game as soon as it launches and you’ll get access to a special sword that gives you extra experience for each monster kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESt0ht"&gt;The announcement comes a week before &lt;a href="https://www.witchercon.com/en"&gt;WitcherCon&lt;/a&gt;, a celebration of the franchise hosted by CD Projekt Red and Netflix, which streams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;the hit TV series&lt;/a&gt;. There could be some exciting news from the event as it seems likely we’ll hear more details about the second season of the show (which Netflix has already shared a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22462967/the-witcher-season-2-trailer-netflix-geeked-week"&gt;very brief teaser of&lt;/a&gt;), and CD Projekt Red has already promised that a next-gen update for &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-witcher-3s-next-gen-update-will-be-released-in-the-second-half-of-2021/"&gt;set to release this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s camera-centric Xperia 1 III to ship on August 19th for $1,299</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/51YwlW54zMbn6cAuknjyqSuLwAk=/547x0:6454x3938/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530326/Xperia_1_IIIcameraZeiss_frostedBlack.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia 1 III puts an emphasis on advanced camera features and high-end display specs.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Go4M5"&gt;Sony’s next flagship phone, the Xperia 1 III, will ship on August 19th in the US — for a whopping $1,299.99. It’s available to preorder today, the company announced. The new photography-focused phone is designed as a complement to Sony’s Alpha camera range, and it introduces a variable periscope-style telephoto lens. It’s also equipped with just about everything you’d expect from a flagship Android phone in 2021, including a Snapdragon 888 processor, 5G, and a 6.5-inch display with 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQSJmb"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/24/21268097/sonys-xperia-1-ii-ships-july-24th-1199-us-united-states"&gt;Xperia 1 II launched at $1,200&lt;/a&gt; — pricey even for a top-of-the-line device — and Sony isn’t backing off by pricing this one at an extra $100. In this case at least, users in the US will be able to utilize its 5G connectivity; last year’s model had the right hardware but couldn’t use US 5G networks. The 6.5-inch 4K display has also been upgraded to a faster 120Hz refresh rate compared to last year’s model (which had a standard 60Hz rate), and you’ll get a bigger 4,500mAh battery, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j6bena"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony Xperia 1 II review: it’s a stretch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21322518/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-smartphone-new-camera-photo-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fDWEEb"&gt;If the Xperia 1 III sounds appealing but paying $1,300 does not, the Xperia 5 III is a smaller-screen variant that will likely cost a bit less, though US price and shipping are still unannounced. In the meantime, if you are willing to shell out top dollar for the 1 III, Sony’s offering a healthy preorder incentive by throwing in a pair of WF-1000XM3 noise-canceling earbuds for free on orders placed by September 26th. The Xperia 1 III will be sold &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/"&gt;directly from Sony&lt;/a&gt; and other third-party retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is building support for digital COVID vaccine cards into Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2NdixgkE_2rijXpFkTiMdbzV9ag=/0x27:1600x1094/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69527264/_GD_BLOG__Covid_cards_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A digital COVID vaccine card in Android.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a1e3j5"&gt;Google is opening up Android’s built-in passes system to &lt;a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/google-updates-passes-api-to-save-covid-testing-and-vaccination-information-on-Android-devices.html"&gt;let Android users store a digital vaccine card&lt;/a&gt;, which it calls a COVID Card, on their phone. The feature will initially roll out in the US, and it will rely on support from healthcare providers, local governments, or other organizations authorized to distribute COVID vaccines. The feature will also support storing COVID test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKcq4t"&gt;For vaccinations, your COVID Card will show info on when you were vaccinated and which vaccine you received, according to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pay/answer/10890261"&gt;a Google support page&lt;/a&gt;. The card can be saved from your healthcare provider’s app or website as well as from texts or emails sent to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnhL79"&gt;Google recommends that you add a shortcut to the card on your home screen and will offer the option when you save your card to your device. Google says that the card won’t be saved the cloud and that it won’t use the information you provide for advertising purposes, but &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pay/answer/10890261#zippy=%2Cwhat-information-is-provided-to-google-when-i-save-my-covid-card%2Chow-your-information-is-used%2Cwhat-information-is-provided-to-google-when-i-use-my-covid-card"&gt;it does say&lt;/a&gt; that it will collect some information, like how many times you use your card and on which days. And you won’t have to have the Google Pay app downloaded to save and access cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJfDvs"&gt;It’s good to see that Google is making it easier for people to save their vaccination status digitally on their phones, though whether you’re actually able to use the feature or not will still depend on your healthcare provider or government. Some states, like &lt;a href="https://epass.ny.gov/home"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/vaccine/vaccinationrecords/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, have implemented their own digital vaccine cards, but Google’s version could streamline the process for other authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The three major US carriers have implemented the FCC’s anti-spoofing system</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ktub7U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fpress%2Ft-mobile-calls-are-100-stir-shaken-compliant&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557539%2Ft-mobile-verizon-carriers-fcc-stir-shaken-certification-deadline-spam-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile announced&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that it is fully compliant with the FCC’s new anti-spoofing protocol, telling the FCC that its now certifying that calls from its network are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;protected against impersonation by scam callers&lt;/a&gt; using the STIR/SHAKEN protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5kh04"&gt;Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/over-78-million-verizon-customers-protected-over-13-billion-unwanted-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s verifying that the number that shows up on your caller ID is actually the number that’s calling you using the same STIR/SHAKEN protocol. The two major carriers announcing their progress on the same day isn’t a coincidence — Wednesday, June 30th, is the deadline the FCC set for major carriers to implement STIR/SHAKEN. An AT&amp;amp;T spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the carrier also met the deadline, as it filed on the 29th, and said that “all LTE and 5G calls originating on [its] wireless network are STIR/SHAKEN compliant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wo2aX0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The protocol works to prevent scam and spam callers from spoofing their number&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="31Lb2O"&gt;The protocol, with its James Bond-themed name, works to prevent scam and spam callers from spoofing their number and showing up on your caller ID as a local caller. The FCC hopes that carriers implementing it will help stem the tide of robocalls that have made many of us scared of our phones’ actual phone function. &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-373714A1.pdf"&gt;In a press release put out on Wednesday (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;, the commission stated that over 1,500 voice providers have filed to be included in its Robocall Mitigation Database, with over 200 of those providers being fully certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4obFxo"&gt;The Wednesday deadline set by the FCC is only for major carriers — smaller carriers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers will be exempt until June 30th, 2023, though the FCC &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-373714A1.pdf"&gt;is considering shortening that timespan (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;. The major carriers that haven’t certified themselves as compliant may face an unspecified “appropriate enforcement action” from the FCC and will run into even more trouble come September. Beginning September 28th, &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/062199369474/DA-21-727A1.pdf"&gt;according to the FCC (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;, carriers will have to stop accepting traffic from providers that aren’t in the robocall database — it’s hard to imagine customers being too happy that they’re not able to reach their friends or family who are on T-Mobile or Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pxxocJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;While this may mean a significant drop in spam calls, it’s not bulletproof&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sl16xb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fpress%2Ft-mobile-calls-are-100-stir-shaken-compliant&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557539%2Ft-mobile-verizon-carriers-fcc-stir-shaken-certification-deadline-spam-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In its press release&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile says that its STIR/SHAKEN network covers calls from 98 percent of US wireless customers, including those using carriers like AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, Google Fi, and Comcast. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/over-78-million-verizon-customers-protected-over-13-billion-unwanted-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon says&lt;/a&gt; that its validation network covers 80 percent of the US wireless industry, and &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/robocalls.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said in a recent press release&lt;/a&gt; that it blocks or labels over a billion robocalls a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oH7IG"&gt;The STIR/SHAKEN protocol &lt;a href="https://blog.hiya.com/stir/shaken-does-it-reduce-illegal-call-spoofing"&gt;isn’t a total solution&lt;/a&gt; to the robocall problem, and it won’t keep your phone from ringing when a scammer calls you unless your carrier is doing additional blocking using the data from it. &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/fcc-deadline-for-stir-shaken-caller-id-authentication-nears"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fierce Wireless&lt;/em&gt; also points out&lt;/a&gt; that carriers still have to contend with international calls, which is no small task, and legacy phone systems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;are exempt from the requirements&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the next time you get a phone call, you may be able to see whether the number that’s calling you is actually who it claims to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2tGPU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, June 30th, 6:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added more info about AT&amp;amp;T’s compliance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRsWgk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, June 30th, 5:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with information about AT&amp;amp;T’s rollout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ken1yu"&gt;The year of cheap 5G phones is upon us, and T-Mobile is offering its customers yet another low-cost 5G phone with today’s announcement of the Revvl V Plus 5G. The T-Mobile-branded device will cost $199, with a huge 6.8-inch 1600 x 900 display and 5,000mAh battery. It’ll go on sale first through &lt;a href="https://www.metrobyt-mobile.com/revvl-best-budget-smartphones"&gt;Metro by T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; starting on July 12th, with sales through T-Mobile starting on July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsBwsY"&gt;The Revvl V Plus 5G comes with Android 11 and uses a MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor designed with inexpensive 5G phones in mind. It’s paired with 4GB of RAM plus 64GB of built-in storage, which is expandable via microSD. It offers a main 16-megapixel rear-facing camera along with two more unspecified 5-megapixel and 2-megapixel sensors on the back as well as a 16-megapixel selfie camera. There is, of course, 5G connectivity available, and while you won’t get the ultra-fast mmWave flavor (no big loss; it’s hard to find), you do get access to T-Mobile’s more widespread and relatively strong sub-6GHz 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NzrWNz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Nord N200 5G review: T-Mobile’s best phone under $250","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2PXtdy"&gt;The V Plus 5G undercuts the OnePlus N200 5G — another inexpensive big-screen-big-battery 5G phone — by about $15 to $40, depending on where you buy it. (It’s $216 through T-Mobile and $239 unlocked from OnePlus.) The N200 5G is actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;our current top pick&lt;/a&gt; for T-Mobile customers looking for 5G on the cheap. And while the Revvl offers some similar features at a lower price, it will be hard pressed to match the N200’s very good 1080p 90Hz display. What we can say for sure is that the 5G price of entry continues to drop, and it likely won’t be long before we see 5G devices priced well under $200.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T joins T-Mobile in switching all Android phones to Google’s Messages app for RCS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E5OHuj"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Google have announced that all Android phones on the network will use Google’s Android Messages app for SMS and RCS services. T-Mobile made the exact same partnership deal with Google in March, which leaves Verizon as the only US carrier who hasn’t committed to switching its customers to Android Messages by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxk7X0"&gt;Along with the switch to Messages comes another important shift: real interoperability with RCS on other networks. AT&amp;amp;T has supported RCS for awhile now, but that support has been as haphazard as it was half-hearted. The new deal also means that AT&amp;amp;T customers will benefit from the rollout of end-to-end encryption for RCS that Google is rolling out to all customers this year (that rollout has already begun, in fact).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U49JPZ"&gt;Google has been pushing RCS as its default texting solution for Android for some time now, touting it as an open standard that any carrier can easily adopt as the next generation of SMS. RCS has a lot of advantages over SMS: there are no character limits, it can send larger files, it can show typing indicators, offer better group chats, Wi-Fi support, and offer end-to-end encryption for one-on-one chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NwciLa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yes, it’s confusing — blame Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YJUsec"&gt;When Android Messages detects that you’re texting with another phone that supports RCS, your text entry window will switch to say that you are sending a “Chat” and that you have “Chat features” enabled. This is not the same thing as Google Chat, the company’s other messaging service. Yes, it’s confusing — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;blame Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jv8BwT"&gt;In any case, despite Google’s best efforts, carriers were slow to adopt RCS. In fact, in October 2019 they announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;doomed attempt to form an RCS consortium&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382715/us-carriers-ccmi-rcs-abandoned-sms-messages-texts"&gt;went nowhere&lt;/a&gt;. Google eventually had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271186/google-rcs-t-mobile-encryption-ccmi-universal-profile"&gt;take matters into its own hands&lt;/a&gt;, years into an overlong transition by offering RCS services directly to any Android user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NBVjq"&gt;In all, the RCS Chat rollout has been a huge mess because of politics, corporate fights, and plain old confusing Google messaging app strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2entOW"&gt;Now, with these carrier deals, Google has gone one step further to make it a true default. Unfortunately, it’s just a step. Verizon will need to get on board, too, as will another big company: Apple. The iPhone does not support RCS and Apple has yet to make a peep about whether it will. &lt;/p&gt;
