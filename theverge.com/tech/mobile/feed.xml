    <title>Vuzix’s new microLED smart glasses look like something you’d actually want to wear on your face</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0S-Oi3F3Kd66zBBoPvBM2ey5mc=/151x0:1747x1064/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652338/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_4.24.00_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vuzix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mj8mck"&gt;Wearable tech and augmented reality provider Vuzix is back at CES 2021 with another pair of its smart glasses, this time with a new advancement. The latest pair is powered by microLED technology, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://ir.vuzix.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1853/vuzix-confirms-that-it-has-entered-into-a-joint"&gt;partnership with the Chinese firm Jade Bird Display&lt;/a&gt;. MicroLED displays have emerged in recent years as viable alternatives to OLED screens, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166062/samsung-110-inch-microled-4k-tv-announced-features"&gt;driving advancements mostly in the television space&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9Rj02"&gt;Yet, the tech in this context allows for ultra small but powerful display projectors to be fitted into both sides of the smart glasses, which, to Vuzix’s credit, look pretty close to something you’d be comfortable wearing out in public on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWfkrX"&gt;Combined with Vuzix’s waveguide tech and its display engine optics for mapping the image onto the inside of the glass, the result is an impressive-looking gadget that can project a stereoscopic monochrome or color image onto both lenses at a variety of pixel densities and resolutions, depending on the software requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EvkMiKMeC_db5ukM9dcrR5tTlNM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228701/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_4.32.18_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vuzix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Similar to Google Glass, Vuzix’s smart glasses are more heads-up displays than true augmented reality devices and are designed to mirror information from a paired smartphone. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vSf9DD"&gt;There are a few other bells and whistles with this device. Vuzix says the device will support Wi-Fi and optional LTE as well as stereo speakers and noise-canceling microphones. There will also be Android and iOS-supported gesture-based touch controls, presumably for controlling companion mobile apps using just the sides of the smart glasses. Unlike Vuzix’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166018/vuzix-blade-ar-consumer-version-available-pricing-release-date-features-ces-2019"&gt;previous $1,000 Blade model&lt;/a&gt;, this new version doesn’t have an official product name or a price yet, though the company is aiming for a summer release date, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/vuzixs-new-microled-powered-smart-glasses-will-arrive-this-summer/"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwUgTK"&gt;Of course, given the nature of the virtual CES this year, we haven’t been able to try these smart glasses as we normally would on the show floor, so we can’t say much about the quality of the image, the comfort or design of the frames, or any of the software support. But Vuzix isn’t really targeting the consumer market with a Google Glass-style device, which would necessarily warrant getting an early, hands-on impression of how well they work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dlGSmJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vuzix’s glasses look impressive, but we’re unable to try them out for ourselves right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6VnqY4"&gt;Vuzix’s smart glasses, which are more in the realm of heads-up displays than true AR, are aimed more toward the enterprise, especially after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7493439/intel-buys-stake-in-google-glass-rival-vuzix"&gt;Intel acquired a 30 percent stake in the Rochester, New York-based company&lt;/a&gt; back in 2015. The shift toward workplace-focused AR and VR products has been accelerated by slow adoption of consumer-geared headsets and glasses as well as an overall lack of breakthrough advancements in the fundamental tech that would facilitate an iPhone-style moment for the field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk7Bw4"&gt;That’s why we’ve seen and heard so little about Microsoft’s HoloLens, the second-generation Google Glass, and Magic Leap’s AR goggles in the years since those gadgets made their splashy debuts, all while Facebook quietly continues pumping money into Oculus and remaining one of the very few large tech companies still actively engaged in VR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZk5if"&gt;The tepid consumer reception to AR and VR products hasn’t stopped some bigger names from trying their hand at consumer smart glasses. Amazon has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;entered the smart glasses market with its Echo Frames&lt;/a&gt;, and Facebook is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;working on its first pair&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with Ray-Ban. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296674/apple-vr-ar-headset-glasses-external-hub-jony-ive-bloomberg-go-read-this"&gt;rumors continue to percolate&lt;/a&gt; around Apple’s plans to release an AR headset or a pair of smart glasses (or both) sometime in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Samsung’s Galaxy S21 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y0LQEtKWhLDkKqCyM37jlAATz2M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651597/41821.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rumored Galaxy S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pddNHN"&gt;Samsung’s next Unpacked event will kick off on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;January 14th at 10AM ET&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to copious leaks, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect from the big day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbAnaA"&gt;Samsung is widely expected to announce its next lineup of flagship phones, which will likely be called the S21, S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra. The S21 Ultra is rumored to have top-of-the-line specs, cameras, and, in a first for an S-model Galaxy phone, support for Samsung’s S Pen stylus. The S21 and S21 Plus are expected to have similar specs but differentiate in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jF9FUl"&gt;A new set of true wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds Pro, and a Tile-like item tracker, the Galaxy SmartTag, also seem like a lock. Rumors about both products have hit the web recently, and they each showed up in a leaked preorder ad for the S21 Ultra. And of course, Samsung may surprise us with things that we don’t know about yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJz7gG"&gt;Here’s the rundown of what we think we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TqiJEm"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra will support the S Pen stylus&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mkXzfavWpoqmOlrYslGSJLU78-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226167/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_1608287647_0_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J6U8SR"&gt;Let’s talk about the Ultra flagship first. The big new feature for the S21 Ultra is support for the S Pen stylus, as confirmed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;Federal Communications Commission filings&lt;/a&gt;. However, the stylus is rumored to be an optional accessory, and the phone isn’t rumored to have a dedicated slot to store it, unlike the company’s Note series of phones. &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture &lt;/em&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; images of an optional case that allows you to store the S Pen, though, so that might be a useful accessory to pick up to help you not lose the stylus. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the S Pen will cost just under €40, which translates to just under $49. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1dLQd"&gt;As for cameras, the Ultra will apparently have four back cameras, including 3X &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 10X telephoto cameras, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those telephoto cameras are also expected to have optical image stabilization and a 10-megapixel resolution. The phone may also have Samsung’s 100X “Space Zoom” feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132870/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-zoom-100x-space-optical-hybrid-digital-periscope"&gt;first debuted in the Galaxy S20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcHFUh"&gt;The other two back cameras are rumored to be a 108-megapixel wide-angle camera and a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and the selfie camera may be 40 megapixels. The phone could also have laser-assisted autofocus, something that was included with last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79T64A"&gt;You can get a closer look at the rumored camera setup for the Ultra in this leaked marketing image from &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143"&gt;leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sbIgPT9D6CoctREkRbWIPbYY-W4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226069/bc3f842f7c28229dc0a4f3c0a3ee56515a329ca4c584263619b42029192c67a1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra’s rumored cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BDMfVq"&gt;The Ultra is also expected to have a 6.8-inch WQHD+ (3200 x 1440) resolution display, according to &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also expected to support a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1346342403792273413"&gt;leaker Ice Universe&lt;/a&gt; says the S21 Ultra may be able to run at that full WQHD+ resolution with the 120Hz refresh rate, something that the S20 Ultra couldn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWM6E3"&gt;The S21 Ultra is also rumored to support 5G networks, be IP68 certified for water and dust resistance, have a 5,000mAh battery, and come with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a7lbvG"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus will offer similar specs at different sizes&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CSMaghhXENSxKlIePS1XTqEfCNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226095/42240.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120248.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rumored Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y14BTZ"&gt;Samsung also plans to announce the Samsung S21 and S21 Plus, which won’t have quite as powerful specs as the Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SIeKj"&gt;The most obvious difference between the S21 and S21 Plus is a smaller camera module. The two phones are expected to have a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 64-megapixel telephoto lens, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120248.html"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And both phones will reportedly have a 10-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43jhke"&gt;Here’s a better look at the cameras on the S21, thanks to another leaked marketing render &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143"&gt;from Blass&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7yhor9DKX7P2whgS81d6AC-kqP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226116/e621085f8ae9e2b7f52b30e774a0648f163650b16b9f84df9afe07c77759bbd3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus’ rumored camera setups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ddghEu"&gt;As for screens, the standard S21 is expected to have a 6.2-inch display with an FHD+ (2400 x 1080) resolution, while the S21 Plus is rumored to have a 6.7-inch screen with an FHD+ (2400 x 1080) resolution. Both are expected to support a 120Hz refresh rate screen as well, though it apparently won’t be an adaptive refresh rate, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="117x1F"&gt;Like the Ultra, both the S21 and S21 Plus are expected to support 5G networks and be IP68-certified. They’re also expected to be offered with either 128GB or 256GB of storage. And depending on which model you buy, they’ll have different battery sizes: the smaller S21 is rumored to have a 4,000mAh battery, while the S21 Plus is expected to have a 4,800mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="py3yCA"&gt;Each phone is also rumored to have a different back cover material. The S21 could have a plastic back, while the S21 Plus may have a glass back, according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OG7VjD"&gt;The S21 lineup may not include a power charger in the box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q72Bf7"&gt;Samsung’s newest phones may take a cue from Apple by not including a charger in the box, according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s reports about the &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120248.html"&gt;S21, S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. And the company recently deleted ads &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197394/samsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger"&gt;mocking Apple&lt;/a&gt; for not including a charger with the iPhone 12 lineup, lending credence to rumors that Samsung will be making a similar move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meFNfx"&gt;While the decision could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307463/apple-iphone-12-power-adapter-charger-rumor-usb-c"&gt;a good one for the environment&lt;/a&gt;, keep in mind that if you’re thinking about picking up an S21, you may also need to consider purchasing a separate charging brick to go along with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CCf341"&gt;The new phones may run Samsung’s One UI 3.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj3VlO"&gt;Samsung’s S21 lineup may run One UI 3.1, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aD3a6gHZeQ"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; from YouTuber Jimmy is Promo reveals some of the features that could be coming in the new update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TBEzw3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aD3a6gHZeQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sRol9y"&gt;The video, which apparently demonstrates One UI 3.1 running on the S21 Ultra, shows off a way to record from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, some of the S Pen features that work on the S21 Ultra, backgrounds for the call screen, the ability to select video resolution from the video recording screen, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pvS9V2"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds Pro true wireless earbuds could compete with the AirPods Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-amUOc2hMjU11V5IlVrzpQ14fis=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226131/e31b969143b271229f5243aae0fc864fd5f050c10f701deba1a172fab2d354f7.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-group-shot-1607627400-1" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s rumored Galaxy Buds Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Det9wn"&gt;In addition to its S21 slate of phones, Samsung is also heavily rumored to announce a new set of true wireless earbuds called the Galaxy Buds Pro. Not only have they been revealed as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221020/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-smarttags-s21-ultra-pre-order-january-14th"&gt;preorder freebie&lt;/a&gt; for the S21 Ultra in a leaked marketing render &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;shared by Blass&lt;/a&gt;, but YouTuber Digital Slang has already posted a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAGUMP0xsio"&gt;hands-on video&lt;/a&gt; and comparisons with the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GDIfgKm0Zeg"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and Samsung’s bean-shaped &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9cJJVFJkFgU"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NtfL99"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAGUMP0xsio?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3prOX"&gt;The new earbuds are rumored to have active noise cancelation, an eight-hour battery life (up to 28 hours with the charging case), and an IPX7 water / sweat rating. You can see how the Galaxy Buds Pro compare to some of Samsung’s other true wireless earbuds in this leaked spec sheet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1341767829926768643"&gt;from WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt;. The Galaxy Buds Pro may cost $199, making them a more affordable alternative to $249 Apple’s AirPods Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1hLHE2"&gt;Samsung may launch its Tile-like item tracker called the Galaxy SmartTag&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-live-images-ncc/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9flwoY"&gt;Samsung’s rumored new Tile-like Galaxy SmartTag will apparently use Bluetooth to connect with devices and share its location. The tag itself looks to be a small square with rounded corners and a loop at the top to make it easier to attach to things, as shown in photos posted on the website of Taiwan’s telecom regulator &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-live-images-ncc/"&gt;and shared by &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The design in the photos also matches an image of the SmartTag in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;leaked ad&lt;/a&gt; of preorder bonuses for the S21 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izd5pO"&gt;It seems likely that the SmartTags will work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541567/samsung-find-my-smartthings-find-service-locate-missing-smartphone-tablet-smartwatch-earbud-galaxy"&gt;Samsung’s new SmartThings Find app&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you track the locations of your Galaxy devices, similar to Apple’s Find My app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OtterBox’s new gaming accessories include a clip designed for Xbox controllers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bjj6gz0ttAnLK7Z-8tLCZpSjeV0=/1x0:1617x1077/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650759/otterbox_gaming_clip_mobile.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OtterBox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RxKIZ6"&gt;As part of OtterBox’s CES 2021 announcements, the consumer electronics company announced the first line of products under its gaming portfolio, releasing in mid-February with preorders beginning on January 25th. As part of a partnership with Xbox, OtterBox has created a new gaming accessories line aimed at mobile gamers. This includes a mobile gaming clip designed for the Xbox One, Series X / S, and the Elite wireless controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YN0s8z"&gt;OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip costs $30 and includes an admittedly tough-looking phone clip that extends if you are trying to place a bigger phone or a phone with a bulky case securely into it. Now, there are other options for gaming clips like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Moga-Mobile-Gaming-Wireless-Controllers/dp/B081C7TLVS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?hvadid=385546071587&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=16157155547006757556&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9008008&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-847144215573&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;adgrpid=78881076375&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvadid=385546071587&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=16157155547006757556&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9008008&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-847144215573&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b225dc010f615994fa66ed8d4a530b77&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PowerA’s $15 gaming clip&lt;/a&gt;, but what makes OtterBox’s product interesting is the clip can detach from the controller and be used as a tabletop stand, providing a bit of flexibility for people who want to game on the go or are playing at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGeVKD"&gt;As noted previously, the clip is designed strictly for Xbox wireless controllers. If you plan to buy other products in the OtterBox gaming line, the clip is compatible with the company’s other products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-FjSa9CuxiIrHOChppmnJ33aGiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22222492/otterbox_gaming_clip_mobile_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OtterBox&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OtterBox Mobile Gaming Clip can be detached and used for tabletop gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YpoPoO"&gt;OtterBox is also releasing a Gaming Carry Case, which looks strikingly similar on the outside to the controller cases available for the Razer Wolverine Ultimate and Xbox Elite Series 2 controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KycxpY"&gt;For $45, Otterbox’s Gaming Carry Case includes a quick flip screen stand on the top, which you can place your phone on and use as a command center while playing titles on cloud services like xCloud or other mobile games like those offered through Apple Arcade. The case also includes a cable pass-through, so you can keep your Xbox controller juiced up via USB when you are not using it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S7Ul1e0Wra1VqGtjSdRACYNljhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22222588/otterbox_controller_case.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OtterBox’s Gaming Carry Case can charge your controller, and it offers a flip screen, which can be used as a mobile command center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EBtuKu"&gt;Priced at $40, OtterBox’s new Easy Grip Controller Shell features an antimicrobial material that the company says will keep your hands comfy from sweat and offers a no-slip grip performance. The shell also includes swappable grip pads for more comfortability, and it comes in three colors (“dark web,” “dreamscape,” and “galactic dream”). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VEN-SzAM4r6iQGaTpJoxWOHPirQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22222647/otterbox_controller_shell.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OtterBox&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OtterBox’s Easy Grip Controller Shell is ideal for gamers who worry about losing their grip while gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MIJ8ho"&gt;OtterBox is known for durable phone cases and accessories, and alongside the previously mentioned products, the gaming line also includes a $55 Easy Grip Gaming Case, which offers durability and an anti-slip grip that’s compatible with the iPhone 12 line, iPhone 11 and 11 Pro Max, iPhone SE (second-gen), and the iPhone 7 and 8. OtterBox says the case will also be available “soon” for select Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>LG teases its Rollable phone again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="LG’s Rollable phone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wW0c4C4hWnVMj6rqgLPTWQQknyI=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68649195/lgrollable.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tvwTzY"&gt;LG is once again teasing its rollable phone. While we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436954/lg-extendable-sliding-phone-teaser-explorer-project-wing-mobile"&gt;brief hints in the past&lt;/a&gt;, at CES today, LG provided the best look at the device so far. Named LG Rollable, the device has what the company calls a “unique resizable screen” that transforms from a phone into a small tablet. The screen slides in and out of place to extend its surface area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seTZI8"&gt;It’s merely a concept right now, as part of LG’s “Explorer Project” experiments, and we still don’t know exactly what technology LG is using or the size of the expandable display. LG has previously used its Explorer Project to introduce its LG Wing smartphone, with a wild rotating design and two OLED displays. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LG’s Rollable phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bVOdgojsRWxtCMpNnkxZin3zFqg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227271/3NXKq5k.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG Rollable is the name for the expandable device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H5vgLG"&gt;It’s still not clear whether LG’s Rollable phone will ever make it to market, but the company has now branded this experiment so it seems more likely we’ll see an LG Rollable in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rxazo2"&gt;Other companies are also investigating rollable phone displays. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/5/21165069/tcl-foldable-trifold-phone-hands-on-rollable-concept-prototype-display-tablet"&gt;TCL showed off&lt;/a&gt; a number of future phone concepts last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;Oppo also demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; a concept device with an expandable OLED display. Phone manufacturers have yet to move beyond the concept and experiment phase with their rollable phones, though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John Legere is considering becoming the Un-Candidate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xg6u0TRkhDWfxnBQf1GFY7rWTSs=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640329/JohnLegere_batman.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: John Legere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U6Gzx8"&gt;John Legere, former T-Mobile CEO and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/7/10729714/john-legere-carrier-bullshit"&gt;aspiring Batman&lt;/a&gt;, has reacted to the mob that attacked the Capitol like many other political and business leaders by calling for President Donald Trump to step down. But he’s also going a step further by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1347374021495681024?s=19"&gt;considering a run for political office himself&lt;/a&gt;. Legere left his post as CEO and member of T-Mobile’s board after successfully negotiating the merger between the company and Sprint, so he very well could be looking far and wide for his next gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzfrsy"&gt;Legere’s time as T-Mobile’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/mobile/2013/3/26/4149204/tmobile-new-direction-no-contracts-lte-uncarrier"&gt;turned the company into the “Un-Carrier,”&lt;/a&gt; a plan that came with an end to contracts, revamped mobile plans, and a variety of freebies and perks for customers designed to set T-Mobile apart from its longtime rivals AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon. But what would political candidacy — or un-candidacy — look like for Legere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sPHao7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For the first time in my life I am actually considering the possibility of running for office. It’s clear somebody needs to help real Americans find change. I’m not sure I’m capable, but I can’t stand by simply watching this craziness.&lt;/p&gt;— John Legere (@JohnLegere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1347374021495681024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8XygjM"&gt;Well, if it’s anything like his Un-Carrier moves, it could be a mixed bag. Legere &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/6/3/11852870/t-mobile-legere-montage"&gt;was brash and unafraid to roast the competition&lt;/a&gt;, and his attitude and leather jackets lean more un-presidential (or Cool) than anything else. But given the last four years we’ve had, we’re probably all used to the unconventional at this point. Tone matters less than not attempting to dissolve democracy, so the bar is low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFWyyr"&gt;In terms of policy, popular proposals like &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/24/21151143/bernie-sanders-2020-polls-medicare-for-all"&gt;Medicare-for-all&lt;/a&gt; fit nicely within the logic of Legere’s Un-Carrier programs. A large part of Un-Carrier’s offering was zero-rating data from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/18/5822996/t-mobile-music-freedom-net-neutrality"&gt;certain music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9704482/t-mobile-uncarrier-binge-on-netflix-hbo-streaming"&gt;video streaming services&lt;/a&gt; so it wouldn’t count against T-Mobile customers’ bills. Why not do the same thing with costly medical expenses? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Vj3ug"&gt;Of course, this opens up another can of worms. Legere was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/10/7190109/do-you-want-net-neutrality-or-not-john-legere"&gt;publicly in support of net neutrality&lt;/a&gt; while he was CEO but pushed programs that flouted it. Those zero-rating schemes, like Binge On and T-Mobile’s other perks, actively favored the services that struck a deal with the company. A healthy internet and a strong Federal Communications Commission might not be at the top of Legere’s priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBl3s7"&gt;There’s no telling how serious Legere actually is or if a run would involve him appearing as the heightened version of himself that made him the unofficial mascot of T-Mobile, but there is a precedent. Executives from the wider world of the tech industry, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-feb-10-me-whitman10-story.html"&gt;like former HP CEO Meg Whitman&lt;/a&gt;, have made attempts to hold a political office, and a businessperson thinking they could fix the country or a state in the same way they juice quarterly revenue is a common theme in modern US politics. I’m not holding my breath for a T-Mobile magenta paint job for the White House or press briefings styled as keynotes, but god it would make a good story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XG0wAK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 10th, 12:52 AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legere has responded to our story in a roundabout way on his Instagram page, see below — does this suggest he’s serious, or just enjoying the continued meme? You be the judge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z2CXI3"&gt;

    <title>Twitter permanently bans Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Donald J. Trump..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UtfFFpp7jfX6inoUrkzkGj_tSM=/0x0:5505x3670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68641193/1223057457.10.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9BWTi"&gt;Twitter permanently banned President Donald Trump on Friday, days after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol leaving five dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uXIs8"&gt;“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?s=20"&gt;in a statement Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="au8oLY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;After close review of recent Tweets from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@realDonaldTrump&lt;/a&gt; account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.&lt;a href="https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y"&gt;https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkSCC2"&gt;The ban comes after the president incited a mob that broke into the US Capitol building, disrupting Congress’ certification of Joe Biden as the President Elect. Twitter initially put a 12-hour ban on Trump’s account for “repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy” after he posted messages repeating lies that the election was stolen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygTtKY"&gt;At the time, Twitter said Trump would be banned permanently if he continued to violate its rules, including those around civic integrity or violent threats. Twitter said in a statement Friday that two new tweets posted since Trump’s initial suspension violated the platform’s rules, prompting the permanent suspension. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAzEDjOtMBq8lFfqzrh2uLiV0Mo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223529/Screen_Shot_2021_01_08_at_3.22.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter permanently suspending President Donald Trump’s Twitter account Friday evening.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OBmP9k"&gt;“Due to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html"&gt;in its Friday blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYjq67"&gt;Twitter decided the new tweets were “highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts” at the Capitol, and shared its reasoning in five parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UOHV0r"&gt;President Trump’s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103015493361664"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103016311259136"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an “orderly transition” on January 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A91mvh"&gt;The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a “safe” target, as he will not be attending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtqrZ8"&gt;The use of the words “American Patriots” to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXDAjH"&gt;The mention of his supporters having a “GIANT VOICE long into the future” and that “They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an “orderly transition” and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VbraO"&gt;Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jFrZa1"&gt;Twitter declined to comment on other Trump-related accounts like @POTUS when questioned by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. If Trump attempted to circumvent this ban by using a separate account, that account would be permanently suspended “at first detection,” according to Twitter. If a government account, like @POTUS, was used to evade @realDonaldTrump’s ban, Twitter said that it would try to limit the account’s use but would not suspend it unless it was necessary to curb real-world violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffehIo"&gt;Earlier Friday, more than 300 Twitter employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221386/twitter-employees-trump-ban-internal-letter-capitol-attack"&gt;signed onto an internal petition&lt;/a&gt; calling for Trump to be permanently banned following the January 6th Capitol riots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVBVy8"&gt;“We must examine Twitter’s complicity in what President-Elect Biden has rightly termed insurrection. Those acts jeopardize the wellbeing of the United States, our company, and our employees,” the employees wrote in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltCwtD"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook put an “indefinite” ban on Trump&lt;/a&gt; that it said would last at least through Inauguration Day. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the risks “are simply too great” to allow Trump continued access after he used the platform to “incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwGgn6"&gt;The suspension has been a long time coming. For years, Twitter has faced pressure to remove Trump from its platform due to the large megaphone it’s offered him to spread hateful language and lies. The company justified his continued presence on the platform as being in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxq2GB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 1/8/20 at 7:22PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included new context on ban circumvention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poBSC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 1/8/20 at 7:39PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included additional context from Twitter on ban evasions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Looks like Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro and SmartTags are a lock for January 14th</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="liR6Ii"&gt;Samsung is widely expected to announce its Galaxy S21 lineup of phones at its upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;January 14th event&lt;/a&gt;, and now it looks like we can safely assume that Samsung will launch its next true wireless headphones and its Tile competitor at the event as well. A leaked marketing render of a promotion offering either the unannounced Galaxy Buds Pro or a Galaxy SmartTag alongside a preorder of the Galaxy S21 Ultra was shared by leaker Evan Blass &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JncsUe"&gt;A lot of information about both the Galaxy Buds Pro and the Galaxy SmartTags have hit the web recently, so it’s not a big surprise that we can expect to see them announced on January 14th. Details about the Galaxy Buds Pro have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/24/22198622/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-price-specs-active-noise-cancelation"&gt;leaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193235/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-3d-spatial-audio-leak"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;weeks&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212894/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-leak-hands-on-video-specs-features-battery-life-sound-quality"&gt;YouTuber even posted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/VAGUMP0xsio"&gt;a hands-on&lt;/a&gt; with the true wireless headphones on January 3rd. We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/1/22209216/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-tile-item-tracker-leak"&gt;also seen photos&lt;/a&gt; of the SmartTag tracker, which is rumored to be a Tile-like tracker that uses Bluetooth to connect with nearby devices, thanks to filings spotted on Taiwan’s telecom regulator’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPw2uc"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro may be a preorder gift that’s exclusive to the (presumably more expensive) Galaxy S21 Ultra, though. If you opt to preorder the Galaxy S21 or S21 Plus, you’ll be able to get a free pair of Samsung’s bean-shaped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; instead, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1347506216596086785"&gt;Twitter user @TheGalox_&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zdujsb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In most countries, Samsung will also have the same pre-order gifts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Galaxy Buds Live &amp;amp; Smart Tags when you pre-order the S21 or S21+&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro &amp;amp; Smart Tags when you pre-order the Galaxy S21 Ultra &lt;a href="https://t.co/vnbucTbmPQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vnbucTbmPQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Anthony (@TheGalox_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1347506216596086785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPoa6V"&gt;We’re just under a week away from Samsung’s January 14th event, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering everything from the big day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Successor to HMD’s Nokia 6.2 leaks with side-mounted fingerprint sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/afb8Zcj6DtxEHhoztues6VpTWFo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639112/d3288e72a4fef4453a86cd253218179b1b80e192eb9c16d05a402079e57cb971.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new phone has an extra rear camera compared to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-the-new-and-affordable-nokia-63-64—1610066614-289532428" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Hemmerstoffer / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="abYfuu"&gt;Renders of what’s believed to be the Nokia 6.3 or 6.4 have leaked online, giving us our best look yet at HMD Global’s upcoming affordable handset. The renders come to us via Steve Hemmerstoffer &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-the-new-and-affordable-nokia-63-64--1610066614-289532428"&gt;over on Voice&lt;/a&gt;. New for this model is a side-mounted fingerprint sensor embedded in the power button, which replaces the rear-mounted sensor on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/5/20850871/nokia-6-2-7-2-phones-revamp-hmd-midrange-lineup-camera-features-specs-ifa-2019"&gt;2019’s Nokia 6.2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zENob4"&gt;Beyond this, there’s not a lot separating the Nokia 6.3 / 6.4 from the 6.2, which &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XW1G6NB?tag=gsmarena093-20&amp;amp;linkCode=osi&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently retails for $249 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still got a screen with a small teardrop-shaped notch, a headphone jack, and a circular camera array on its rear. However, Hemmerstoffer reports that the screen could be bigger at 6.45 inches rather than 6.3 inches, and it has four cameras on its rear, up from three last time. &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_6_3_6_4_renders-news-47095.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; the fourth sensor is likely to be for macro shots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MxCQCU5dmtOGtEyiaMbs7ySeQBE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22222482/b0d4d9df850430313741c41b1bf3886db650a9f8912d944983c523399d12371b.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Otherwise, it’s a very similar phone to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2ldJ8S"&gt;There isn’t any indication of how much the phone is likely to cost as part of this latest leak, but &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; reports that it was previously rumored to be priced at €249 (around $306). Hemmerstoffer notes that we should see an announcement before April.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 2021 Moto G Stylus, Power, and Play focus on big batteries, bigger screens, and low prices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HhVmEsZiIWiYSTFvxd9za-92OnQ=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68637858/moto_phones.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Left to right) The Moto G Play, G Stylus, and G Power.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aYxogU"&gt;Motorola is kicking off 2021 with refreshes for its midrange Moto G lineup of phones with new versions of the Moto G Power, Moto G Stylus, and Moto G Play that promise low prices and days of battery life across the board. There’s also a new member of the Motorola One family called the Motorola One 5G Ace, which, at $399, takes the crown as Motorola’s cheapest 5G phone yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcDY5p"&gt;Once again, Motorola is set on offering an almost dizzying amount of low-priced phones that differ in price by just $30 to $50. The new Moto G Play will cost $169.99; the Moto G Power will offer $199.99 (for a 3GB of RAM / 32GB of storage model) $249.99 (for 4GB / 64GB) configurations; the Moto G Stylus will cost $299.99; and the Motorola One 5G Ace will cost $399.99. It’s a strategy that ensures there’s a phone at nearly every price point you could imagine, although it does make it slightly harder to choose between similar devices at such similar prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxL49Q"&gt;Motorola is sticking with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;same names&lt;/a&gt; for its new 2021 lineup — sadly, the days of the numerically differentiated Moto G models appear to have ended for good with 2019’s Moto G7 lineup. But the new phones do offer improvements big and small compared to their 2020 predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0FZt5Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10271765"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uDNUTA"&gt;The Moto G Play seems like the toughest sell of the bunch. While the $169 price tag is intriguing, the paltry 720p resolution — stretched across a comparatively huge 6.5-inch panel — raises concerns, as does the year-old Snapdragon 460 processor that’s markedly less powerful than either of the other two new 2021 Moto G phones. That’s especially true given that Qualcomm has already announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Snapdragon 480&lt;/a&gt;, which promises to be twice as fast and adds more premium features like 5G to the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fC1P55"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A midrange phone at every price point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PLMt53"&gt;There are some bright spots, too. The 2021 G Play has 3GB of RAM (putting it in a better position performance-wise than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286687/motorola-moto-e-2020-g-fast-review-price-specs-features"&gt;last year’s $149 Moto E&lt;/a&gt;) and a massive 5,000mAh battery that Motorola says should be good for up to three days on a charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bgeixj"&gt;The new G Power and G Stylus aren’t as similar as last year’s models. Where the 2020 models offered the same processor, screen, and design, the new models are distinctly different phones. The G Power offers a 5,000mAh battery, a 720p 6.6-inch display, and weaker Snapdragon 662, but the G Stylus makes an argument for its higher price tag with a stylus, a larger and higher-resolution 1080p 6.8-inch panel, and a more powerful Snapdragon 678 processor. (It does go down a notch in battery, only offering a 4,000mAh battery that’s good for up to two days off a charge.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVKMcD"&gt;The larger G Stylus also offers 4GB of RAM by default (unlike the G Power, which has both 3GB and 4GB models) and has more storage (128GB versus the G Power’s choice of either 32GB or 64GB). You also get some camera improvements on the G Stylus — while both phones feature a 48-megapixel main sensor (which shoots quad-pixel 12-megapixel shots), a 2-megapixel macro camera, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, the G Stylus also adds an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a better selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5yCvpYhyX9jjiomXuamGFMUeLMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220797/moto_one_5g_ace.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LGWjIi"&gt;Lastly, there’s the Motorola One 5G Ace, which (as the name indicates) isn’t quite in the same category as the other phones here. At $399, it’s Motorola’s cheapest 5G phone yet. And the weaker Snapdragon 750G 5G, downgraded cameras, and slower refresh rate display leave the One 5G Ace as more of a lower-priced version of the $499 Motorola One 5G that the company released last year than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k83wLD"&gt;All four new phones will be available unlocked through direct retailers on January 14th, with preorders starting today. Additionally, several of the new phones will also be released through major carriers in the future: the Moto G Play and Motorola One 5G Ace through AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, while the G Power will be sold by just Verizon. The G Stylus, meanwhile, will skip the major US carriers entirely, although Boost Mobile, Cricket, Consumer Cellular, and Republic Wireless will offer it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump returns to Twitter and promises a smooth transition of power</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Holds Campaign Rally For GOP Senate Candidates Ahead Of Runoff Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bn1-0MmJnhaEsmo-vqdcVGpaOew=/0x0:8192x5461/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635509/1294537766.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRutCc"&gt;Twitter has lifted its ban on President Donald Trump, and his latest tweet is very different than the ones we’ve seen for many months. Though he does not say he lost, his latest video feels like a concession speech. “Now that Congress has certified the results, a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th,” he says. “My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.” Trump had issued a similar statement about “an orderly transition” this morning &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103015493361664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1347103015493361664%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2021%2F01%2F07%2Ftrump-says-there-will-be-an-orderly-transition-of-power.html"&gt;through a surrogate account&lt;/a&gt; — that of White House social media director Dan Scavino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ5NaA"&gt;The president’s own account was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;locked on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; after a mob of his supporters broke into the US Capitol, and Twitter said it would stay that way until he deleted several tweets and then waited 12 hours. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed Thursday morning that the tweets in question had been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pgnNgK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/csX07ZVWGe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/csX07ZVWGe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1347334804052844550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xI8MDi"&gt;Trump returns to Twitter in a more tenuous position than ever before. The company said he’s now at risk of a permanent ban if he continues to violate Twitter rules around misinformation and incitement of violence. Once Trump leaves the White House on January 20th, he’ll also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21552606/trump-twitter-world-leader-public-interest-exception-ends-january-loss"&gt;lose special “public interest” protections&lt;/a&gt; that applied to his account while he was in office, which could make it easier for the company to enforce its rules over Trump tweets that cross the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMVCua"&gt;Twitter banned Trump on Wednesday over a series of tweets spreading lies about the election outcome and a video the company said posed a “risk of violence.” In that video, Trump reiterated his false claims that the election was stolen, praised the mob that broke into the US Capitol, and told them it was time to “go home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cG88Ns"&gt;Facebook and YouTube removed the same video from Trump. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook later “indefinitely” banned Trump&lt;/a&gt; due to his use of the platform to “incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government,” saying the risks are “are simply too great” of allowing him to remain. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the ban would remain in place at least through Inauguration Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IbUNaU"&gt;Trump’s new video still includes misinformation, specifically a lie that he “immediately” deployed the National Guard to the Capitol. However, Twitter says that it won’t be placing a label on the tweet due to that, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1347339743940419584"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;’ Ryan Mac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XeTwZ"&gt;Five people died during the Capitol riot, according to reports.&lt;/p&gt;
