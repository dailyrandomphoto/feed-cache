    <title>Nokia’s XR20 is a rugged 5G phone with three years of OS updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EWk9zLOuML5RGakjFRGFx3rkU9Q=/0x70:1646x1167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636026/Nokia_XR20_Workshop__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XR20 includes a 6.67-inch screen and dual rear-facing cameras.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD Global&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OMNx1D"&gt;HMD Global’s newest Nokia device is the XR20, a rugged phone with 5G connectivity that goes on sale in late August for $549. In addition to robust physical protection, the XR20 is well supported on the software side — a big focus for Nokia’s latest devices — as it ships with Android 11 and comes with three years of OS upgrades alongside four years of monthly security updates. Even considering that the first of those updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, is due for release very soon, it’s a policy that’s far stronger than that of most midrange Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUPJRp"&gt;The XR20 has a long list of rugged specs. It’s IP68 rated and can withstand submersion in 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) of water for up to an hour. It also meets other criteria of the MIL-STD 810H standard, like the ability to withstand temperatures from 131° F (55° C) down to -7.6° F (-22° C) and protection against drops from up to 5.9 feet (1.8 meters). Its screen uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335252/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-drop-scratch-resistant-apple-samsung"&gt;Gorilla Glass Victus&lt;/a&gt;, which Nokia boasts is the “toughest screen yet” on one of its smartphones. You can also take comfort in the fact that the phone comes with a two-year extended warranty in the US (three years in the UK). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_F_Ou9mvWc9EIhWZI49TtryylQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22737064/Nokia_XR20_Hero_Image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XR20 meets rugged specifications for water submersion, drops, and extreme temperatures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I7Mdl4"&gt;Beyond its rugged credentials, the Nokia XR20 bears many similarities with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;the non-rugged X20&lt;/a&gt;, starting with its 6.67-inch 1080p screen. It skips the X20’s macro and depth sensors, offering just two rear-facing cameras: a 48-megapixel f/1.79 main and a 13-megapixel f/2.4 ultrawide. Internally, it’s equipped with a Snapdragon 480 processor along with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a combination we found to be adequate with some occasional hiccups in the X20. There’s a 4,630mAh battery and Qi wireless charging is supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vZ3ag"&gt;In terms of raw hardware specs, it’s not positioned to challenge the very best midrange phones like the Samsung A52 5G or the Pixel 4A 5G (making way for the 5A soon), which tracks with Nokia’s recent emphasis on value-driven devices. The X20’s camera didn’t impress us, and the Snapdragon 480 chipset likely won’t provide best-in-class performance, but the XR20 could potentially fill a gap in the market for an affordable, mainstream rugged device with healthy software support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxnldw"&gt;The 6GB RAM / 128GB storage variant will be the only one sold in the US, with availability starting August 24th. That version will sell for £449 in the UK, where a 4GB RAM / 64GB storage option will also be available for £399. Both will be available in the UK from July 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AIZ8HznVWT8VZaeJIACzXGi8NCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741417/Nokia_C30___Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia C30 includes a huge 6,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dt6AkU"&gt;Nokia C30, Nokia 6310 feature phone, and Clarity Earbuds Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="x6p5hg"&gt;HMD is also announcing a couple of other devices for global release: the Nokia C30 and Nokia 6310. The C30 is a big-screen, big-battery affair, with a huge 6.82-inch panel — Nokia’s largest to date — and a 6,000mAh battery. A version with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage will go on sale in the UK in September for £99. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3tLxLATVgQFcA_SNbugAPyHjBNQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741432/TWS_841W_BKGY_A01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia Clarity Earbuds Pro include active noise cancellation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ruxRR1"&gt;The Clarity Earbuds Pro include active noise cancellation, are IPX5 sweat and water-resistant, and offer up to nine hours of use on a single charge (seven with ANC enabled). The included case supplies an additional 36 hours of use without ANC or 28 hours with it enabled. They’ll go on sale in the UK in September for £99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rosKMgq11gQKIA412LQLXCgxv_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741425/Nokia_6310___Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia 6310 features basic 2G connectivity and emphasizes accessibility. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a2pzKM"&gt;Finally, the Nokia 6310 is a 2G-only phone designed with accessibility in mind, including larger buttons and fonts, and users can have texts read aloud. It goes on sale in the UK in August for £49.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung confirms Z Fold 3 S Pen support as Note line is in limbo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Unpacked invitation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mD9JkOpc9idzrzfST51xY0Zj__o=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636009/unpacked.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung Unpacked invitation | Samsunng&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lcbyYm"&gt;Samsung isn’t looking to have many surprises at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;August 11th Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;. Leaks have already revealed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572858/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2021-leak-evan-blass-galaxy-z-fold-flip-3-s21-fe-watch-4-buds-2-date"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;Galaxy smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;new Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Samsung mobile president TM Roh is continuing a recent tradition of &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/unfold-next-era-of-smartphone-innovation/"&gt;publishing a pre-event blog post&lt;/a&gt; that confirms some news, sets expectations, and hints at some additional details. Roh promises improved durability for folding screens, stylus support, and that Samsung will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; release a new Note phone this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rqEbz"&gt;Although the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Unpacked invitation pictured above&lt;/a&gt; didn’t leave much to the imagination, Roh simply comes out and says there will be new foldables this year: “Our third generation of foldable devices will open up amazing new multitasking capabilities and enhanced durability,” he writes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPq2rq"&gt;The key phrase to pay attention to there is “enhanced durability,” a theme Roh hits on again when he touches on the Z Flip 3, writing that it will have “an even more refined style, armed with more durable, stronger materials.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rwygvz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung promises “more durable, stronger materials”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6HrLzz"&gt;Each successive iteration of Samsung’s folding phones has improved screen durability — starting from the total debacle of the first canceled product on through a refined plastic screen and finally “Ultra Thin Glass.” It’s as yet unclear what exactly Samsung will do to improve durability further, but there’s absolutely still &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mgAKSnMH0s&amp;amp;t=621s"&gt;room to improve&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSh29p"&gt;A recent leak shows that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594727/samsung-z-flip-3-fold-water-resistant-ipx8-pen-case"&gt;two folding phones may have IPX8 water resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which could be part of this durability story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rMl0V"&gt;Durability is a vital spec for folding phones, but it will be doubly important for the upcoming Z Fold 3, which Roh confirms will have stylus support. It may not work with the existing S Pens that are designed for the Galaxy S21 Ultra, however, as Roh indicates that Samsung will announce “the first-ever S Pen designed specifically for foldable phones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2GJ3V"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders-exclusive/"&gt;recent leak at &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that there will be a case for the Galaxy Z Fold 3 that will have a place to store the new S Pen, slotted directly in the middle behind the hinge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Df-Rb3lQUoCWfx8LGvHu7TVAxSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741284/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Fold3_Samsung_S_Pen_case_render_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;91mobiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gXEKFS"&gt;Roh is also setting another expectation: there won’t be a Galaxy Note announced this year, writing: “instead of unveiling a new Galaxy Note this time around, we will further broaden beloved Note features to more Samsung Galaxy devices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTCuzn"&gt;Samsung hinted that it might skip making a Note this year in March, when, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;an earnings call, it said&lt;/a&gt; that “it could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year.” That’s likely a reference to the ongoing chip shortage, but there are other question marks around the Note line in general. Now that the regular Samsung Galaxy S21 line has stylus support, it seems the main benefit of getting a Note is having a place to store the stylus. It’s an open question whether Samsung actually intends to continue making Galaxy Note devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oGCSV"&gt;Finally, Roh’s post makes some vague references to “collaborations with trusted industry leaders like Google and Microsoft,” with a hint that it could mean better support for multitasking on the Z Fold 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3jsoD"&gt;Hopefully, it also means that Samsung, Google, and Microsoft are working together to normalize how multitasking works on Android. Ever since folding phones started appearing, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21417432/foldable-phones-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-flip-5g-microsoft-duo"&gt;specter of fragmentation has haunted them&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung and Microsoft each offer different experiences for how to organize and manage different windows on their screens. Although Google has regularly added support for folding features to Android, it hasn’t taken a strong hand in ensuring phones from different manufacturers work in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="txFEyr"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Fold, Flip, or Duo: why fold a phone?|95266" data-volume-uuid="df76ea051" data-volume-id="95266" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-131" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JGhPOe"&gt;Finally, Roh gestures to Samsung’s collaboration with Google on the new Wear OS 3 smartwatch platform. He confirms that Samsung will continue to integrate its watches with its Galaxy software ecosystem, pointing out that both Samsung health and SmartThings will continue to be on the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DDAnd"&gt;Samsung’s fall 2020 Unpacked event will be online only on August 11th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT. You can expect full coverage that day — and likely more leaks before then. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Samsung Flip and Fold leaks show water resistance, renders, and an S Pen case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s91v6aTK9pHTIzOY64XmeW_Nqj4=/151x0:1050x599/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635852/E7Ow9IyXsAAEUyS.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uSyQ2S"&gt;New leaks suggest Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3 will both have IPX8 water resistance, which would put them more on par with Samsung’s non-folding phones. The information was posted earlier by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1417721222054481922"&gt;Max Weinbach&lt;/a&gt; and now corroborated by Evan Blass, who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370"&gt;tweeted the rating &lt;/a&gt;along with what appears to be an image from Samsung showing the phones getting splashed. The water resistance tidbit adds to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;pile of leaks and images&lt;/a&gt; that we’ve seen leading up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Samsung’s August 11th Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;, where the phones are expected to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2X8ud"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-and-z-flip-3-water-resistance-rating-has-a-catch-22683600/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SlashGear &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, the rumored IPX8 rating for the phones doesn’t cover dust resistance, something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498773/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-durability-test-jerryrigeverything-dust-dirt-hinge"&gt;that’s been a bit of a concern&lt;/a&gt; since Samsung started making folding phones. (&lt;a href="https://www.enclosurecompany.com/ip-ratings-explained.php"&gt;This explainer&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of going over how IP ratings work.) However, an official water resistance rating would likely be a relief for those worried about the durability of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;historically expensive&lt;/a&gt; handsets. It also lets the phones fit in better with the rest of Samsung’s flagships, which have &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00077679/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;had water resistance for years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zIjgaI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Few upcoming foldable details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Z Flip3&lt;br&gt;- 6.7" internal / 1.9" cover displays&lt;br&gt;- 12MP x2 (rear) / 10MP (selfie)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Z Fold3&lt;br&gt;- 7.6" internal / 6.2" external displays&lt;br&gt;- 12MP x3 (rear) / 10MP (cover selfie) / 4MP (main selfie)&lt;br&gt;- 2 optional S-Pens (Pro and Fold Edition)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both phones IPX8 &lt;a href="https://t.co/lPm60yCzvt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/lPm60yCzvt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T4y9KH"&gt;Blass’ tweet also mentions the camera and screen specs for the phones, as well as the S Pen options that will reportedly be available for the Z Fold 3. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders/"&gt;a separate leak&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve also got an idea how Samsung wants us to attach the stylus to the phone: using a case that fits it in right over the hinge. It’s a similar approach to how Samsung handled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22226594/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-stylus-support-price-unpacked-event"&gt;the inclusion of pen support on the Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, though maybe a touch more elegant. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pen slides in right over the Z Fold 3’s hinge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/73oSViiAydEQ3gIywXVZpbLJMmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741487/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Fold3_Samsung_S_Pen_case_render_06.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It kind of looks like the world’s coolest PDA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V0Ymkk"&gt;We’ve also seen what are reportedly &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124267.html"&gt;leaked official marketing renders of the Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;, giving us a good look at the bigger outside screen and re-oriented dual cameras (though they unfortunately don’t show the fun two-tone color scheme we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;seen in previous leaks&lt;/a&gt;). The outside screen on the original Z Flip and Z Flip 5G was tiny, relegating the notifications and clock to a corner of the phone’s cover. The next generation seems to be making it easier for those trying to see their notifications, or take selfies with the main cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The inside of the phone looks mostly familiar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9rkik0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Steps towards making foldables less of an extravagant purchase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NFnlLS"&gt;The rumors of water resistance and the Z Fold’s S Pen compatibility point towards Samsung’s foldable phones receiving features that its more traditional phones have already gotten. It would be a step towards making them less of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;an extravagant purchase&lt;/a&gt; and more of a practical one, but there’s still a ways to go — even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260357/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-price-drop-1200"&gt;when discounted&lt;/a&gt;, the Z Flip 5G and Z Fold 2 come at a price premium, and can be worse in some ways (looking at you, Z Flip camera).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad could not resist draping the Apple MagSafe Battery Pack in leather </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eR8Yv5PA_p3D1OzappSnyxCJIVM=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619953/nomad_magsafe_battery_pack_leather_case.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hYIuno"&gt;Frankly, now that we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/7/7/22563631/nomad-magsafe-leather-cover-charger-price"&gt;a leather case for your MagSafe charging puck&lt;/a&gt;, it’s all uphill from here. At least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/7/19/22583859/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-thickness-size-shape-plastic"&gt;Apple’s new $99 MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; is something you’ll actually be carrying around and touching on a regular basis, where leather might make it nicer to hold. Perhaps you already have a matching leather case for your iPhone, too? It looks like a nice combo in photos. If you agree, Nomad is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://nomadgoods.com/products/leather-cover-for-magsafe-battery-black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently taking preorders for $30 each&lt;/a&gt;, shipping this November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6ofoO"&gt;(I blame Apple for only releasing the battery in white.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/shkPUKFfkxBYxDHpPmak3RWgBkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734484/nomad_leather_case_magsafe_battery.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8yOFGK"&gt;While you can’t see it in pictures or the description, Nomad tells us it will actually have a hole for the battery’s charging port. One more note: while microsuction tape is much better (reusable, no sticky residue) compared to your traditional Scotch, you should probably know tape is what’s keeping this piece of leather on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbYpln"&gt;I think I’ll wait and see how strong the MagSafe Battery Pack’s magnets are, period, before I put any more leather on a phone. Stay tuned: Dieter’s currently working on that review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0zI4G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Nomad’s confirmation that it will have a cut-out for the MagSafe Battery Pack’s charging port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola’s G100 midrange battery champ is now available in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z_32l8T3w0dnMhLeTfkXSnc6SLY=/0x53:1250x886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619427/motog100.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G100 offers respectable midrange specs like 5G and a Snapdragon 870 processor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWa3Uk"&gt;Motorola is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-moto-g100%2Fp%3FskuId%3D627&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F22%2F22589232%2Fmotorola-moto-g100-price-specs-screen-battery" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now selling the Moto G100 in the US&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;introducing it earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for Latin American and European markets. It comes with midrange specs like a big 5,000mAh battery, 5G, and a 90Hz screen for a $599 MSRP. From now until August 5th, Motorola is offering a $100 discount off the full retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9wLWt"&gt;There are two important footnotes on the G100’s US carrier compatibility: it’s a GSM-only phone, so will work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile but not Verizon, and its 5G connectivity is only compatible with T-Mobile’s 5G network. Outside of that, it appears to be a respectable midrange device, if priced a little on the high end. It uses a Snapdragon 870 processor with 8GB of RAM, sub-6GHz 5G, and a 6.7-inch 1080p display with 90Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui1Wz7"&gt;Motorola’s US phone releases this year have been concentrated around the $200-400 range, making G100 one of the pricier devices the company has introduced stateside recently. While a big battery, faster-refreshing screen, and a higher-tier processor feel fitting of its $599 price tag, its lack of IP-rating and broad carrier / 5G support could set it back against similarly priced peers like the Samsung A52 5G or the Pixel 4A 5G (if you can still find one).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Corning’s new Gorilla Glass protects smartphone camera lenses and lets in more light</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xah9S1vZYGRDEGm9CqBSMH5FeeM=/128x0:1223x730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619421/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_1.03.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Corning&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XZGMF2"&gt;Corning &lt;a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/news/news-releases/2021/07/corning-expands-corning-gorilla-glass-composite-products-to-optimize-performance-of-mobile-device-cameras.html"&gt;has announced a new set of glass composites&lt;/a&gt; to protect the ever-growing number of camera lenses on the back of smartphones and capture more ambient light in the process. The new composites, called Gorilla Glass with DX and Gorilla Glass with DX+, offer “advanced optical performance, superior scratch resistance, and durability” according to Corning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsdd4e"&gt;Technically, this DX variety of composite isn’t entirely new, Corning offered a version of &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/07/19/corning-gorilla-glass-dx-smartwatch/"&gt;Gorilla Glass with DX / DX+ for smartwatches&lt;/a&gt; as early as 2018. But Corning says making the switch to smartphone camera lens covers added additional challenges because the glass needed to be more scratch-resistant and somehow let in more light, two qualities that can be at odds. Corning breaks down how it achieved both improvements in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="45Ltmf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/olO8scCNMu0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mor20n"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/corning-gorilla-glass-dx-for-phone-camera-lenses/"&gt;Corning tells &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Gorilla Glass with DX and Gorilla Glass with DX+ let in 98 percent of ambient light while still being just as scratch resistant as typical Gorilla Glass. In comparison, Corning claims lens covers with traditional anti-reflective coatings only let in about 95 percent of light. Maximizing the amount of light smartphones can gather while cutting down on reflections and glare is helpful for squeezing better performance out of smartphone cameras. It might also provide more information for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18203363/ai-artificial-intelligence-photography-google-photos-apple-huawei"&gt;the variety of computational processes&lt;/a&gt; that are now the norm in smartphone photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAhjZe"&gt;The company hasn’t announced what phones will feature the new glass composites, but Corning does say that Samsung is signed on as the first company to use the new Gorilla Glass camera lens covers. Given the Unpacked event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Samsung has scheduled for August 11th&lt;/a&gt; quickly approaching on the horizon, maybe we’ll see the glass in action sooner than we expect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s Smart Display is real and it’s just as pointless as we suspected</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2IZO507inYUFf5uJ1_7AS9-1OwI=/236x0:2600x1576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618624/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_9.04.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t appear that Verizon’s Smart Assistant can do a whole lot.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEtNSY"&gt;We got our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22552037/fcc-filing-shows-verizon-amazon-alexa-smart-display"&gt;first look at Verizon’s Smart Display&lt;/a&gt; last month thanks to an FCC filing. Yesterday, Amazon confirmed the device’s existence &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"&gt;as part of its Alexa Live presentation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s being introduced as part of the Alexa Custom Assistant program that allows third-party device manufacturers to add custom assistants built on top of Alexa technology to their products, and we regret to inform you that it looks just as useless as we first suspected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpVTyh"&gt;Here’s what it offers: standard smart display stuff, like an eight-inch screen, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi connectivity, and of course, Alexa. It also comes with LTE, a spec included in the FCC filing and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/verizons-smart-display-is-real-and-responds-to-hi-verizon/"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; following the announcement. But the purpose of 4G appears to be limited to providing connectivity while setting up or troubleshooting Verizon home internet. Amazon says this will reduce the need to “send service technicians to a customer’s house or have a customer call the Verizon Call Center for help.” So that’s kind of a narrow use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RU8gvM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4v4o9L6A2M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wo4LJA"&gt;There are also Verizon-service-specific commands that can be accessed by saying “Hi, Verizon,” like checking your bill or running a speed test. You know, things you can easily do on your phone or computer. You can ask Verizon smart assistant-type questions, like the current weather, but based on a promotional video published by Amazon it looks like Verizon will... just ask Alexa for you. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HavCIk"&gt;If you ever thought to yourself, “Self, wouldn’t it be great to have a way to check my phone bill hands-free while I eat a sandwich in the kitchen?” then maybe you’ve just found your match. Otherwise, this doesn’t exactly look like the smartest of smart displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgAwlr"&gt;Verizon hasn’t revealed a price or firm release date yet; &lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports that the display will be available later this year in limited beta testing with Verizon home internet customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ capable Nord 2 made better by midrange price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2W5lNlzw3BMBuy6VTfnQgOJ3hQ=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617009/Many_OnePlus_Nord_2s_having_fun.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qwsZhO"&gt;OnePlus has officially announced the Nord 2, a successor to last year’s excellent midrange debut. Like the original, the Nord 2 is releasing in Europe and India, and there are no plans for a US release. In Europe and the UK, prices start at £399 / €399 for its 8GB RAM / 128GB storage model, rising to £469 / €499 for a 12GB RAM / 256GB version (about $550 and $645, respectively). In the UK, preorders open on July 22nd from OnePlus.com and Amazon, and the phone goes on general sale on July 28th. You can read my first-hand impressions of the phone over in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22350856"&gt;full review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="doHCw5"&gt;OnePlus being OnePlus means we already had a good idea of what to expect from the Nord 2 before today. But now we know that in addition to its 50-megapixel main camera, the phone also has an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor on its rear. Round the front, there’s a 32-megapixel selfie camera, although there’s no secondary ultrawide selfie camera like last year’s Nord. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jI19GFzBN9gvbX1OxAD4l8E1w2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731129/Nord_2_Haze_Blue_07.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord 2 in blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hC6Eax"&gt;Like the original Nord, the Nord 2 has a 1080p 90Hz OLED display, but on this year’s model it’s ever so slightly smaller at 6.43-inches (compared to 6.44-inches). In Europe, the phone is available in blue and gray, while an additional green color will be available in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukdGY2"&gt;Internally, alongside the &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/nord-2-and-its-mediatek-dimensity-1200-ai-chipset-your-questions-answered.1464619/"&gt;MediaTek 1200-AI processor&lt;/a&gt; that OnePlus revealed earlier this month, in Europe the Nord 2 will be available with either 8 or 12GB of RAM, paired with 128 or 256GB of storage, respectively. There’s also a (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnePlus_IN/status/1417490218521964552"&gt;pre-announced)&lt;/a&gt; 4,500mAh battery with Warp Charge 65 fast charging, which OnePlus claims should be able to charge the phone to 100 percent in under 35 minutes. It’s 5G-compatible (sub-6GHz only) and includes dual-SIM support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGUOFV"&gt;The Nord 2 runs OxygenOS 11.3 out of the box, which &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-2-oliver-zhang-interaction/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt; is the first version of the software to reflect the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;merger with Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus is promising two years of Android updates and three years of security updates for the Nord 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FU1goy"&gt;As well as the Nord 2, OnePlus also used its event today to announce a new pair of true wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22351408"&gt;OnePlus Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which go on sale next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1d7lX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qihfpj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From its screen to its fast-charging, the Nord 2 has it where it counts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QP7RPd"&gt;From the start, OnePlus has positioned its midrange lineup of Nord phones as a less expensive, entirely separate lineup to its flagship devices. But with the Nord 2, which comes as a direct successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;original Nord&lt;/a&gt; released last year, the line between the two seems blurrier than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd6ENN"&gt;While the original Nord had its own character, such as a unique design and exclusive features like an ultrawide selfie camera, the Nord 2 feels more like a stripped down flagship. It’s got a very similar camera bump to the OnePlus 9, for example, and although the specific sensors are different, its cameras fill the same functions. But all the core essentials are still there: a vibrant high refresh rate screen, good battery life, and easy-to-use software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdYBz8"&gt;A more affordable, non-flagship starting price means it’s hard to argue with these tradeoffs. The OnePlus Nord 2 costs £399 / €399 for its 8GB RAM / 128GB storage model, rising to £469 / €499 for a 12GB RAM / 256GB storage version. (OnePlus isn’t selling the Nord 2 in the US, but those prices roughly convert to $470 and $588, respectively.) For this review, I’ve been using the 12GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kczner"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10662161"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uOChn3"&gt;With its 6.43-inch display, the OnePlus Nord 2 is a hair smaller than the OnePlus 9 (which has a 6.55-inch display), but otherwise this is a very similar-looking device. There’s a rectangular camera bump on the back containing three cameras, a hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera on the top left on the front, and a USB-C port on the bottom (but sadly, no headphone jack). Biometrics are handled via a snappy in-display fingerprint sensor, and there’s a physical slider to switch between silent and vibrate on the right of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmod5R"&gt;You’ll find Gorilla Glass on the front and back of the phone, but since its frame is plastic you might want to use a case if you’re particularly worried about the frame’s finish wearing off. Otherwise I didn’t notice the phone flexing any more than a typical aluminum framed phone. Like the original Nord, the Nord 2 doesn’t have an official IP rating for dust or water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2F0vrl"&gt;Oh, and this is also a 5G phone: you get sub-6GHz support, but no mmWave. Given the latter high-speed, low-range network type has &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/5G-mmWave-connectivity-is-finally-making-its-way-Europe-wide-with-promises-of-Gigabit-speeds.548139.0.html"&gt;barely started to roll out&lt;/a&gt; in the Nord 2’s release markets, it’s not something many people are likely to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neMCas"&gt;The most notable sign that this isn’t a flagship OnePlus device is its processor, which is a MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI rather than one of Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 888 chips. Considering MediaTek is a brand more commonly associated with budget devices, I was apprehensive about its inclusion on the OnePlus Nord 2, but I came away pleasantly surprised by performance overall. Yes, you miss out on Qualcomm-exclusive features like high quality AptX Bluetooth audio, but otherwise switching between apps was hitch-free, and the processors’ GPU happily made the most of the phone’s smooth 90Hz display while scrolling through even a relatively graphically intensive Twitter feed (which, in comparison, stuttered on the original Nord). I noticed the phone being slightly slow to wake up on a couple of occasions, however, but overall performance was on a par with, if not slightly better than the original Nord in everyday usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ipx1ZhE-EHjm4X0xIzPN5Ol4yPA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726845/jporter_210719_4669_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squint, and you could believe the Nord 2 is a OnePlus 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v1w9x3"&gt;The Nord 2’s 1080p screen is generally hard to fault. It does everything well that you’d expect from an OLED display. Whites are crisp and bright, colors are punchy, and blacks are, well, black. Its 90Hz refresh rate is technically a step down from the 120Hz panel that you’ll find on phones like the OnePlus 9, but in practice I didn’t notice a downgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xztwe"&gt;As a bonus, this time around the Nord 2’s screen is actually flanked by stereo speakers (one downward-firing and one from the phone’s earpiece), as opposed to the original Nord, which only ever played media audio out of its downward-facing speaker. You’ll still want to use headphones for proper listening, but the speakers’ volume meant I had no trouble hearing podcasts played out of the phone’s speakers while cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOcGqr"&gt;I got a little under five hours of screen-on time out of the Nord 2’s 4,500mAh battery, easily enough to last through a full day with a little to spare. But I was more impressed by the inclusion of Warp Charge 65 fast-charging here. When charging from zero, I hit 89 percent after a half hour, and 99 percent after 35 minutes, which felt remarkably quick. You have to use one of OnePlus’ proprietary chargers and the cable it comes with to get these speeds, but at least you get both in the box. The Nord 2 doesn’t support wireless charging, which isn’t entirely surprising at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kjLKKz7Xz8c1jP-lSq8gSOGTn9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726843/jporter_210719_4669_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a small hole-punch for the 32MP selfie camera on the top left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rSF9yoYjvHTO6az1G4XJDEhrq0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726846/jporter_210719_4669_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A physical slider lets you put the phone into silent mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SLy64y"&gt;The Nord 2 runs on OxygenOS 11.3 out of the box, which is notable for being the first version of OnePlus’ software to reflect its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;integration with Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-2-oliver-zhang-interaction/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. But despite the under-the-hood changes, the phone didn’t feel radically different in everyday usage. I found a few changes in the Settings menu, though, where several controls have been renamed and shifted positions slightly. It meant I struggled initially to find OnePlus’ standard screen calibration options, for example, but they’re still there in a slightly different sub-menu. It bodes well for the future of OxygenOS, which continues to be an uncluttered take on Android that I mostly appreciate for its ability to keep out of my way. In terms of ongoing support, the company promises you get two major Android updates and three years of security updates with the Nord 2, though it declined to say how regular these security updates would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GZmTk"&gt;Around the back of the Nord 2, you’ll find three rear cameras. Its main camera uses a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor (which OnePlus previously used for the ultrawide cameras on the 9 and the 9 Pro), which is flanked by a much lower-resolution pair of cameras: an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor of questionable utility. On its front there’s a 32-megapixel selfie camera, but it’s not paired with an ultrawide camera this time around, which makes me, personally, a little sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmRMZC"&gt;I generally liked the shots I got out of the Nord 2, and OIS on the main sensor means it’s easy to get consistently sharp shots every time you hit the shutter button. That said, they definitely have OnePlus’ typically punchy look, which prioritizes vibrancy over accuracy. It’s most obvious when you look at landscape photograph shots: I can promise you the grass in the photographs below was much less green and much more yellow in reality. Edges also tend to have a slightly over-sharpened look to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A9Uh0epNtadAvXUQRGIFHtFOFqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726847/jporter_210719_4669_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord 2 includes three rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eL8cN1"&gt;At night, the Nord 2’s standard photography mode automatically takes photos that are almost as bright as the Google Pixel’s Night Sight mode, and if you head into the phone’s dedicated Nightscape Ultra mode you get photos that almost look like they were taken in daylight were it not for how washed out they appear. In its standard photography mode, this brightness hides the fact that low-light shots aren’t particularly detailed, like in the photo below of an apartment block where the dividing lines between wooden slats have been smoothed out of existence. You’ll be able to make out your friends if you photograph them in a dimly lit bar, but their skin might come out looking a little smooth and plasticine-y in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GtA5eV"&gt;Oddly, this vibrancy doesn’t carry over to the ultrawide camera, where shots seem much more muted and arguably more color-accurate in comparison. There’s also less detail thanks to the lower resolution sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fvkvFT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10662184"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XTa70A"&gt;When it comes to people, the OnePlus Nord 2 can’t seem to resist the temptation to brighten skin tones, raise shadows, and make everything look a little flat. Even with its beautification mode turned off, I still got the impression the Nord 2 was avoiding showing me every last wrinkle and pore in my face. To its credit, the effect means you can barely tell I took the shots below while sweating my way through a horrid UK heatwave, but I think the overall photographs end up looking blander as a result. It’s a similar story with the phone’s selfie camera, although this is partially offset by the extra detail from defaulting to 32-megapixel shots, while the main camera on the rear defaults to around 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWQLwq"&gt;OnePlus’ continued insistence on including low-resolution monochrome sensors on the backs of its phones is baffling. The black and white photography option that makes use of it is still buried all the way at the end of the camera’s list of filters, and even once you go to the trouble of using it, I’ve yet to notice any difference it makes compared to a software-based filter. You can even cover up the monochrome sensor on the Nord 2 while you take a black and white shot, and the phone seemingly continues on unperturbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obmHyO"&gt;But complaints about the easily ignorable monochrome sensor aside, I think the Nord 2’s cameras get a lot of things right if you share its preference for bright, colorful shots. OIS on the main camera means it’s relatively easy to get crisp photographs, and you could do a lot worse at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HCghE_7NJ6ZU06bqzumd_Y2P1eM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726844/jporter_210719_4669_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An in-display fingerprint scanner handles biometric security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00TZ0XJP6DMvIZ2zXNIBGbc-8j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726848/jporter_210719_4669_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-C, but no headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Q86Vsv"&gt;A month ago, OnePlus announced the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22543244/oneplus-nord-ce-5g-review"&gt;Nord CE&lt;/a&gt; or “Core Edition,” an affordable phone which was pitched as offering the essential features of a OnePlus smartphone without any extra bloat. But the more I use the OnePlus Nord 2, the more I think that this is the phone that fits that description much more accurately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCZ2uz"&gt;From its screen, to its cameras, its processor, and its software, the Nord 2 feels like a flagship phone stripped of any unnecessary features. There’s no Hasselblad-branded cameras, just a reasonably specced set of sensors. There’s no flagship Qualcomm chipset, but instead you get a processor that has no trouble handling the day-to-day duties of a modern smartphone. No wireless charging, but fast wired charging that more than makes up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="dIZhB2"&gt;All of this adds up to a compelling device if you’re looking to spend between £400 and £500 and you’re in a market when OnePlus is actually selling the Nord 2. A stripped down flagship it may be, but it’s hard to argue with what’s been left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="KaXPyQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10662155"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Predictably, T-Mobile’s merger promises weren’t enough to make a carrier out of Dish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c7Sxbus-lHW2cjZyGTaBgjHD3FA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69615817/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Sprint acquisition deal included too few requirements and put too much trust in a big corporation to do the right thing. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w4r1In"&gt;When T-Mobile acquired Sprint in April 2020, it brought our major wireless carrier choices from four down to three. Recognizing that this would indeed be a bad thing for US wireless customers (aka all of us), T-Mobile agreed to a set of conditions with the FCC’s blessing that would theoretically position Dish Network to fill the Sprint-shaped hole in our wireless landscape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZdDcv"&gt;In other words, one wireless competitor was allowed to reduce competition only if it agreed to help set up another competitor in its place. Sounds a little suspect, right? Surely a deal like that would include a lot of conditions, requirements, and oversight to make sure it would actually work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cq1jlv"&gt;But looking back, these were the major requirements imposed on T-Mobile to prop up Dish as a competitor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CfeG9G"&gt;Sell Sprint’s prepaid business, including Boost Mobile, to Dish within 120 days after the close of the merger, and maintain Boost’s competitiveness before the divestiture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rw0lgm"&gt;Provide Dish’s wireless customers with access to the T-Mobile network for at least six years through a wholesale MVNO agreement while Dish builds its own network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jgbqcS"&gt;Provide transition services for up to three years afterward to ensure Boost customers are transferred smoothly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kB3OaQ"&gt;Not do anything anti-competitive toward Boost, like throttling or limiting access to new network technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TLnpY1"&gt;Sell Sprint’s 800MHz spectrum to Dish three years after the closing of the merger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z7SbSn"&gt;Give Dish the option to acquire old Sprint cell sites and retail stores that T-Mobile opts to  decommission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NM9THA"&gt;Provide Dish with reasonable advance notice of network transition plans that could affect Boost customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="eTekCm"&gt;What’s missing there is any definition of success. The burden for the success of the plan lay on Dish’s shoulders, not T-Mobile’s, with Dish being the one legally required to cover 70 percent of the US population with 5G by 2023 (or now &lt;a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20200914/5g/dish-officially-gets-more-time-to-build-out-its-licenses-and-only-5g-will-do"&gt;possibly 2025&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxOBcZ"&gt;Here we are roughly a year later and so far, T-Mobile appears to have technically done everything it said it would do for Dish by now. But is the scheme to prop up our fourth wireless carrier working? It sure doesn’t seem so. The fact that Dish has now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;fled into the arms of AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; shows how insufficient T-Mobile’s support has been: instead of relying on the partner mandated by the $26 billion mega merger, Dish now has to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;spend $5 billion on a competitor&lt;/a&gt; to get where it wants to go. While not the final proof, it’s the latest reminder that the deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585761/dish-t-mobile-att-sprint-competition-editorial"&gt;was built on a shaky premise to start with&lt;/a&gt;, and regulators largely took it on faith &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962739/t-mobile-sprint-nextel-merger-prices-rural-coverage-promises"&gt;that big corporations would keep their promises&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LmnTgu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is the scheme to prop up our fourth wireless carrier working? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0G42tr"&gt;From the beginning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908539/t-mobile-sprint-merger-dish-network-failure-stopped-antitrust-experts-doj"&gt;critics of the merger deal&lt;/a&gt; suggested that it depended too much on T-Mobile and Dish doing the right thing and was so vague that it left the door open for funny business that could seriously hamper the effort to prop up Dish. The new T-Mobile wasted little time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429587/t-mobile-sprint-merge-jobs-promise-pandemic"&gt;breaking its promise of being “jobs-positive from day one”&lt;/a&gt; and it didn’t take long after the Boost sale for it to mess with Dish, too. In October 2020, T-Mobile told Dish it would be shutting down Sprint’s old CDMA network — which many of Dish’s Boost customers rely on — on January 1st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4heND"&gt;T-Mobile says it went above and beyond its obligations set out in the merger deal, and that may be technically true: regulators only required six months’ notice, and the company gave 14. T-Mobile’s filings with the FCC related to the merger don’t state exactly when it anticipated shutting down the CDMA network, just that it wouldn’t do so before January 1st, 2021. But T-Mobile also publicly promised it would “&lt;a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/t-mobile-sprint-merger-doj-clearance"&gt;ensure continued and seamless operation of Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; […] following transition to Dish’s ownership,” and yet its CDMA shutdown is on an even more aggressive timeline than rivals AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2PuKA3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving Dish a bit more than a year’s notice of a major service upheaval for many of its new customers is bullshit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOqW8Y"&gt;Getting the word out to customers that they’ll need to buy a new device and acquiring enough phones for them takes time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T started notifying its customers&lt;/a&gt; of its February 2022 3G shutdown in July of last year, and as Dish has pointed out repeatedly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358628/verizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022"&gt;Verizon has delayed closing down its CDMA network&lt;/a&gt; by several years to give itself enough time to migrate customers still using 3G phones. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;a recent letter to the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, Dish also pointed to other statements T-Mobile made that led it to believe that it would have a three-year period to migrate customers off the old network. T-Mobile’s response to the partner it was supposed to prop up? It more or less says that &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10411042233063/Letter%20to%20Acting%20Chairwoman%20Rosenworcel%20-%20Final.pdf"&gt;Dish wasn’t paying close enough attention&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwvJGB"&gt;Giving Dish a bit more than a year’s notice of a major service upheaval for many of its new customers is, to use the technical term, bullshit. (We’re not even counting the global health crisis and the chip shortage which might have made this task harder.) And while T-Mobile may be right when it claims to have played by the rules, it certainly qualifies as funny business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdYdnn"&gt;Clearly, the deal didn’t require enough from T-Mobile, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134278/sprint-tmobile-merger-court-ruling-opinion-decision-explainer-carriers-antitrust"&gt;relied too heavily on then-CEO John Legere and Dish’s Charlie Ergen seeming like pretty cool guys&lt;/a&gt; to the judge, Victor Marrero. Putting the onus on Dish to pay up if it missed its 2025 deadline predictably did nothing to encourage T-Mobile to play nice and help Dish along. Unless Dish can pull off something incredible, it looks like we’ll be living without that fourth major wireless carrier for a long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;
