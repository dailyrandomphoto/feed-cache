    <title>The Surface Duo gets better TikTok support and availability outside the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hrg3xi3gfzvPDZjbGqBk-xV4hfQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518392/akrales_191002_3704_0376.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="igSwLe"&gt;Microsoft announced &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2020/12/15/the-year-ahead-for-surface-duo/"&gt;in a blog today&lt;/a&gt; that its dual screen phone, the Surface Duo, will be getting an “enhanced” TikTok app that takes advantage of its design. The company also announced the Duo will be available outside the US in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O169FZ"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;reviewed the Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;, we liked the hardware of the device, but had concerns with its modified Android software. The Duo was buggy at release and didn’t feature many non-Microsoft apps that took advantage of the dual screen setup. The Surface Duo can run normal Android phone apps on either screen, but using the split-screen features Microsoft designed requires specific tailoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koHI8P"&gt;The group of apps that use Microsoft’s “postures” and multitasking features remains small, but TikTok is a major social media addition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e8DhKXvfdOYJVSv6qqJse-0t8NA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22172811/TikTok_SurfaceDuo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new TikTok experience on the Surface Duo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rbiNaO"&gt;The company says that TikTok will use both of the Duo’s screens, allowing you to watch the “For You” feed on one screen, while browsing hashtags and searching for videos on the other. Microsoft highlighted the Spotify and Kindle apps when the Duo launched, but TikTok is one of the biggest apps to add full support since then. (Microsoft itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21360130/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-bid-rejection-bytedance"&gt;attempted to purchase the company from ByteDance&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALJOne"&gt;In addition to the new app, Microsoft says the Surface Duo will be available for purchase in Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom in early 2021. The company says they’ll have more to share “at the beginning of 2021,” so expect a more specific release date or maybe even an update on the Duo’s larger sibling, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date"&gt;the Surface Neo&lt;/a&gt;, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgDrwC"&gt;The “enhanced” TikTok app should be available now for Duo owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQeo1k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will resume political ads just for Georgia’s Senate runoff election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wtg78bP9CC-Pfp2_WEBmsVcLBo8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518179/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0581_1stills.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DHcdwL"&gt;Facebook on Tuesday said it would make an exception to its political ad ban to let campaigns and other political organizations run advertising for the upcoming Georgia runoff elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXrTNX"&gt;The Senate races, which will determine which US political party controls that chamber of Congress under President-elect Joe Biden, take place on January 5th. Facebook says advertisers authorized to run ads on social issues, elections, or politics will be allowed to run those ads starting tomorrow, December 16th at 12PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgZ1dY"&gt;Facebook initially faced pushback over the political ad ban and its implications for races as vital as the Georgia runoffs. Democratic campaign officials &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/11/10/social-media-ad-ban-hampers-georgia-senate-runoff-efforts/"&gt;criticized the platform&lt;/a&gt; for hampering its efforts to fight misinformation about the election and voting fraud, while Republicans expressed concern that a lack of advertising would leave them flat-footed in efforts to register voters and combat their own brand of online misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/06/georgia-republican-election-official-says-trumps-false-voter-fraud-claims-undermine-democracy.html"&gt;encouraging Republicans to abstain from voting in protest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="liwYqd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We agree that our ad tools are an important way for people to get information about these elections.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iq8hj2"&gt;“In recent weeks we’ve heard feedback from experts and advertisers across the political spectrum about the importance of expressing voice and using our tools to reach voters ahead of Georgia’s runoff elections,” writes Facebook product manager Sarah Schiff, in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/update-on-the-georgia-runoff-elections/"&gt;blog post announcing the exemption&lt;/a&gt;. “We agree that our ad tools are an important way for people to get information about these elections. So we have developed a process to allow advertisers to run ads with the purpose of reaching voters in Georgia about Georgia’s runoff elections.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCa7AE"&gt;Facebook’s ad ban, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506798/facebook-ban-political-ads-after-us-presidential-election-trump-biden-results-notification"&gt;announced back in October&lt;/a&gt;, is only a temporary measure the social media giant implemented “to reduce opportunities for confusion or abuse.” It was a prescient approach, given how President Donald Trump has spent nearly every day since the election spreading false or misleading information about the results of the race. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560969/facebook-political-ad-ban-extended-trump-2020-election-concede-misinformation"&gt;said last month&lt;/a&gt; after Election Day it would extend the ban for about a month, in response to Trump’s refusal to concede and rampant online misinformation from the president, right-wing media, and other conservative sources about unsubstantiated election fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3qHS1"&gt;It’s not clear how long Facebook intends to keep the ad ban in place, as it’s been more than a month since its last extension. But the company says it is taking measures so that its exemption for the runoff elections doesn’t result in any unintended consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLAMZH"&gt;For instance, Facebook says it will outright reject any ads targeting locations outside Georgia, or that try to address other political issues outside the scope of the runoff races. It’s also keeping in place its ban on ads with any claims or other content that includes information debunked by its partner fact-checkers, or that “delegitimizes” the races. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj89g1"&gt;Facebook also plans to label any content that “tries to delegitimize voting in these elections” with false claims about fraud and other conspiratorial misinformation. “And, if someone goes to share the content we have labeled, they will first see a message directing them to our Voting Information Center, which provides reliable election information,” says Schiff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5siDc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos will soon be able to add a 3D effect to 2D photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Blxfa-J7pTGf92NpYiKwv5lFVoo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516599/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0hwFDQ"&gt;Google Photos will soon be able to take your 2D images and make them appear as if they’re 3D, the company announced in a blog post on Tuesday. Google is calling these types of images “Cinematic photos,” and they’re a new type of image the app can show as part of its Memories feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpYDO0"&gt;Here’s a GIF from Google comparing a 2D image to a Cinematic photo. I think the feature looks pretty impressive:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UqlpIT2NQMLsH7n-Z-9iyZTrYas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171944/ezgif_2_b86c3878385a.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WIOWAI"&gt;To make Cinematic photos, “we use machine learning to predict an image’s depth and produce a 3D representation of the scene—even if the original image doesn’t include depth information from the camera,” Jamie Aspinall, a Google Photos product manager, writes in Tuesday’s blog. “Then we animate a virtual camera for a smooth panning effect—just like out of the movies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGf0qt"&gt;Google says Google Photos will automatically make Cinematic photos, and they’ll appear in the recent highlights section above your photo grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUNcNm"&gt;The company is also adding new themes for Memories. Now, you’ll be able to see Memories about important people in your life, and soon, Google Photos will show you Memories about your favorite things (Google gave the example of sunsets) and activities (such as baking or hiking). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCmtUO"&gt;These new features in Memories will be rolling out to users over the next month, according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.3 has arrived with ProRAW for iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 Pro camera app in use" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2qMsMMZNsBnOi0Z23G2uJ_9sEo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510836/akrales_201017_4238_0016.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TnaGT5"&gt;Apple’s iOS 14.3 has arrived, giving iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max owners the ProRAW feature that was promised when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21504764/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-screen-size-5g-features-price-release-date"&gt;devices were announced&lt;/a&gt;. Other features in this update include search improvements for the Apple TV app, support for Fitness Plus  — Apple’s new subscription-based workout service — and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;recently announced AirPods Max headphones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iIXoU"&gt;iPhones have long been able to capture RAW images, but doing so has meant giving up the benefits of all the computational magic that happens when shooting a standard image with the native camera app. ProRAW is designed to address that: it’s a format that combines the computational benefits of Apple’s image processing with the post-processing flexibility of a RAW file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqPupH"&gt;In iOS 14.3, Apple is flipping the ProRAW “on” switch for iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max — and those two devices only. With the update installed, ProRAW image capture and editing will be enabled in the native camera and photos apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Y0fbua"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro review: ahead of its time","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"},{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max review: the best smartphone camera you can get","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oth5QR"&gt;This update also addresses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169881/apple-iphone-ios-14-text-messages-no-notifications-bug"&gt;an irritating bug&lt;/a&gt; where some users weren’t getting notifications for new incoming messages. And on the lighter side, Siri gets an update with hundreds of animal, instruments, and vehicle sounds. The new feature works on HomePod, iPhones and iPads; just ask Siri what sound a humpback whale makes and you’ll get a demonstration. If you’re on an iPhone or iPad, you’ll also get a visual to go along with the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLTutb"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/08/ios-14-3-release-candidate-features/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, 14.3 also makes it easier to customize app icons since home screen shortcuts no longer need to open the Shortcuts app. Other iOS 14.3 highlights include the ability to record video at 25fps, updates to Apple TV app search and a new Apple TV Plus tab, front-facing camera mirroring in still photos for devices from the iPhone 6S and newer, and new Cycle Tracking features in the Health app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches new App Store privacy labels so you can see how iOS apps use your data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foLTsv1S9sSgbk_TvqGmKOS1qiA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510737/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nyix9w"&gt;Apple is making good on its promise to provide more transparency around iOS app data collection with the launch of new privacy labels on the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzS8jj"&gt;The company first announced its intention to provide these so-called “nutrition label” privacy disclosures &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299407/apple-ios-14-new-privacy-features-data-location-tracking-premissions-wwdc-2020"&gt;back in June during WWDC&lt;/a&gt;, and last month Apple disclosed that developers would have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551926/apple-privacy-developers-nutrition-labels-app-store-ios-14"&gt;provide this information by December 8th&lt;/a&gt; or risk losing the ability to update their apps. Now, following that deadline, Apple is launching the feature officially for all iOS device owners running the latest version of iOS 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Q6tEa"&gt;Apple says the new labels will be required for apps on all of its platforms — that includes iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — and they will have to be up to date and accurate every time a developer submits a new update. Apple is also holding itself to the same standard, something the company clarified last week when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165152/whatsapp-privacy-apple-first-third-party-app-store-nutrition-labels"&gt;Facebook-owned WhatsApp criticized the company&lt;/a&gt; for an apparent inconsistency in its requirements, before Apple said it, too, will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165959/apple-privacy-nutrition-labels-all-apps-preinstalled-messages-web"&gt;provide labels for all its own software&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cszf52"&gt;The company’s own first-party apps will all have the same disclosures on their App Store product pages. In the event an app doesn’t have an App Store product page because it cannot be removed, like the Messages app, Apple says it will be providing privacy label information on the web. Every piece of software on the App Store will also have its privacy label viewable on the web, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p6KlEhLz0kQr5rC5lJ6tl5cQVTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168998/Screen_Shot_2020_12_14_at_10.33.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R49pJY"&gt;As for how the labels are structured, Apple has broken down data collection into three categories: “data used to track you,” “data linked to you,” and “data not linked to you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Mg0q"&gt;Tracking in this context means the app developer is linking data from the app — like personal information, or data collected from your device, such as location data — with other data from other companies’ apps or websites for the purpose of targeted advertising or some other ad-related metric. Apple says it’s also using the term tracking here to mean sharing user or device information with companies that sell it, like data brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7m37s"&gt;The “data linked to you” portion of the label is any data that can be used to identify you. That means data gleaned from using the app or having an account with the service or platform, and any data pulled from the device itself that could be used to create a profile for advertising purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKBRDn"&gt;“Data not linked to you” is the portion of the privacy label that clarifies when certain data types, like location data or browsing history, are not being linked to you in any identifiable fashion. Apple has specific, developer-focused information on the new labels &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/"&gt;at its developer portal page&lt;/a&gt;, with more general information available on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapple.com%2Fprivacy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174017%2Fapple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the consumer-facing page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFjT8f"&gt;This isn’t the last of Apple’s major privacy changes coming with iOS 14. The company intends to release a new privacy feature requiring developers to ask for explicit permission to track iOS device users across apps and websites using a unique device identifier, called an IDFA (or Identification for Advertisers) code. The plan was to require this with the launch of iOS 14, but Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;announced in September&lt;/a&gt; that it would delay the feature until some time next year, to give developers more time to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dune director Denis Villeneuve blasts AT&amp;T and Warner Bros. for ‘hijacking’ films </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/24T0kqh-vtUldXEfLqa6C8eENXU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494669/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O1ndOe"&gt;Denis Villeneuve’s &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;is going to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;coming to HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; on the same date as its theater release, and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-blasts-warner-bros-1234851270/#article-comments"&gt;the director is not happy&lt;/a&gt;. He’s written an article for &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; blasting Warner Brothers and AT&amp;amp;T, saying that the the move to release movies on streaming on the same day as in theaters is “a desperate attempt to grab the audience’s attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cB6i7"&gt;“With this decision AT&amp;amp;T has hijacked one of the most respectable and important studios in film history,” he writes. “There is absolutely no love for cinema, nor for the audience here. It is all about the survival of a telecom mammoth, one that is currently bearing an astronomical debt of more than $150 billion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDcQ59"&gt;He's not alone in his anger at WB and HBO Max — last week Christopher Nolan, director of &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;complained about the move&lt;/a&gt;, repeating his frequently raised belief that movies “are meant to be big-screen experiences.” Villeneuve echoed this sentiment in his piece, saying that &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;’s “image and sound were meticulously designed to be seen in theaters.” Villeneuve says the original plan was to delay Dune to October 2021, and he supported that decision for public safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="We9jvR"&gt;Executives for AT&amp;amp;T, NBCUniversal, and ViacomCBS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22163583/streaming-theaters-hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-shows"&gt;have defended the release strategy&lt;/a&gt;, but with directors of the blockbusters starting to voice their disapproval, it’ll be interesting to see how Warner Bros. responds, if it does at all. It will also be interesting to see how audiences respond; whether they agree with the filmmakers that movies need to be seen on the big screen to be truly appreciated, or if they’re happy watching them from the comfort of their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ur3I5d"&gt;You can read Villenueve’s full editorial &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-blasts-warner-bros-1234851270/#article-comments"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65ht1Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 10th, 9:32PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Corrected the spelling of Christopher Nolan’s movie Tenet. It was previously misspelled as Tenant. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile introduces its first 5G hotspot and a 100GB standalone plan for $50 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inseego 5G MiFi M2000" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eii8RH05Dwh2GCU0S5eWBi21LWY=/0x1:1832x1222/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492516/Moretti_generic_top_006.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile will start selling the Inseego 5G MiFi M2000 today. | Image: Inseego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3nfzJ"&gt;T-Mobile might look as thought it’s late to the game by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2F5g-just-got-better&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167745%2Ftmobile-5g-hotspot-100gb-standalone-plan#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;unveiling its first 5G hotspot today&lt;/a&gt;, along with a variety of 5G standalone hotspot plans. After all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/18/20699111/verizon-5g-mifi-m1000-hotspot-650-expensive-data"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18303494/att-5g-service-19-cities-verizon-samsung-s10-exclusivity-tmobile-hot-spot"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; have offered 5G hotspots for a while now (although they began with significantly limited coverage). But T-Mobile’s particular blend of wide 5G coverage and better-than-LTE speeds means the device should be more accessible to more people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JaXk2X"&gt;Plus, the carrier’s standalone 5G hotspot plan is priced to compete, starting at $30 for 10GB and $40 for 30GB, and topping out at 100GB for $50. In comparison, AT&amp;amp;T’s standalone hotspot plans start at $60 per month for 15GB; Verizon’s offerings start at $80 for 15GB of 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SGbE23"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile’s standalone 5G hotspot plan is priced to compete&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rgcgrj"&gt;T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftablet%2Finseego-5g-mifi-m2000&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167745%2Ftmobile-5g-hotspot-100gb-standalone-plan#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Inseego 5G MiFi M2000&lt;/a&gt; hotspot is available now through T-Mobile and costs $336 to purchase outright. For now, the carrier is offering to knock that down to $168 if you add a new line and spread the payment across 24 months. The M2000 has more than 24 hours of battery life and is capable of connecting up to 30 devices at once, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1UE9h"&gt;A reminder: 5G comes in several flavors, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;not all are created equal&lt;/a&gt;. T-Mobile has taken a multi-layered approach with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538604/t-mobile-5g-network-midband-coverage-expanded-cities"&gt;aggressive expansion schedule&lt;/a&gt;, working to grow overall coverage quickly as well as bolstering its midband offerings, thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202726/tmobile-sprint-acquisition-ceo-finished-john-legere-steps-down"&gt;acquisition of Sprint’s network&lt;/a&gt; last spring. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now add tweets to your snaps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B0pNjIRRZYqM2q4oBx9KDOxnypY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68491764/acastro_170726_1777_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="13RGce"&gt;Twitter is making it even easier to spread your tweets far and wide to every social media platform imaginable. Starting today on iOS (support is coming “soon” for Android), you’ll be able to add tweets into a snap as a sticker. Before, if you wanted to share a tweet on Snapchat, you would have to take a screenshot of it and share that, without having access to any of Snapchat’s camera or editing features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVS3Rs"&gt;If you want to share a tweet to Snapchat, press the share button on a public tweet (private tweets aren’t supported, for obvious reasons) and select the Snapchat icon from the share carousel. You can then create a snap as usual, except you’ll have your selected tweet as a sticker that you can manipulate. You can then share the snap as you would any other — sending it to people, or adding it to your story, and whoever sees it can go to the tweet by swiping up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shows the process of sharing a tweet to Snapchat" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LosgzVI-mjpOf4uia5YI6a3QiM8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158880/JN9n1a0kXdN4WiHcn1HmXwjLGtQj9ym64p9Ee3Fe8PqM1khSpD4thVG9HhoqF4qx1hI_Am5Avqq1pSpNNXoFFHvcIw5OS1r9gol9REwmrtiIwa4CgkUDYwaIF5SHRQPjc9rE_ppC.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S2Qran"&gt;I have to say, the example snap looks way better than the (often crunchy) screenshots of tweets do, and it’s nice that it’s a format that lets you easily find the source. If you’ve abandoned Snapchat for Instagram Stories, don’t worry: Twitter also says that a small group of iOS users will be able to test sharing tweets to Instagram Stories soon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="Wq9xZk"&gt;This is a feature built for social media apps as they are today: places to repost tweets. As I’m writing this, two out of the top 10 posts on Reddit are tweets. Instagram is filled with pages that post screenshots of tweets, and Facebook, I’m told, is mostly people posting tweets (Twitter, of course, is full of old Tumblr posts). Now, Snapchat can also be Twitter, and Instagram Stories’ time is coming. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teaser videos of the upcoming phones recently leaked online.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SBin3R"&gt;Samsung’s next flagship smartphone lineup, the Galaxy S21 series, will launch globally on January 14th, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-launch-date-india-availability-1184543/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority &lt;/em&gt;is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The date was revealed by Samsung’s largest mobile experience store in India, and &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-surprise-preorders-launch-date-confirmed-india"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;subsequently confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the date with a company official at Samsung’s local offices. Although &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; reports this as the global launch date, Samsung HQ has yet to confirm it, and in response to questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; said that it does not comment on rumor or speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MZSEn"&gt;Although a January launch is earlier than the February Unpacked events we’ve become accustomed to in recent years, this isn’t the first time this date has been rumored. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a January 14th launch based on its own sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAnyB9"&gt;The phones will reportedly go on sale on January 29th in India, according to employees at Samsung’s Opera House outlet in Bengaluru, &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; reports. The store is taking preorders for three upcoming handsets, the Galaxy S21, the S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra, with a Rs 2,000 (around $27) deposit. Full pricing for the lineup is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0zZc6u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sales will reportedly start later that month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G4nOBU"&gt;Along with confirming the launch plans, the new report from &lt;em&gt;Android Authority &lt;/em&gt;has also revealed some of the upcoming handsets’ specs. They’ll apparently be powered by Samsung’s Exynos 2100 processor in India, and the three models will be available in the following colors: gray, pink, purple, and white for the S21; pink, purple, silver and black for the S21 Plus; and black and silver for the S21 Ultra. &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; says the S21 Ultra will have a 108-megapixel main sensor, alongside two additional 10-megapixel sensors, one of which will have a 10x optical zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umdeJt"&gt;The latest report adds to a host of leaked details about the new handsets. Earlier this week we got an early look at the phones through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;series of leaked teaser trailers&lt;/a&gt;, which show off their redesigned camera bumps. The trailers appear to confirm that the S21 Ultra will have a total of five cameras, compared to three on the S21 and S21 Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="na3432"&gt;The trailers &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;followed a report in November&lt;/a&gt; which said that each of the phones will come with 120Hz displays, and will have screens ranging from 6.2 to 6.8-inches in size. Internally, they’ll reportedly have batteries ranging in size from 4,000 mAh to 5,000 mAh, and will be powered by Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor in regions that don’t use Samsung’s own processors. The S21 Ultra is also expected to be compatible with Samsung’s S-Pen, which is important considering the rumors that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;stylus-equipped Note lineup is being discontinued&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWvtgK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 10th, 12:34PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Samsung’s no comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
