  &lt;p id="SXQV1t"&gt;With two and a half weeks until 2020 concludes, time is running out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168049/shipping-deadlines-free-delivery-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target"&gt;to get your items shipped before the holiday&lt;/a&gt; season ends. So if you are looking to have some gifts shipped to your home before the end of the month, it’s best to get that squared away within the next few days. Today’s best deals include a historically low price on Sony’s excellent WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds and $30 in savings on the Razer Kishi and the Apple Watch SE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tkxN2M"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds are down to their lowest price yet &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id="MnsTPM"&gt;Grab the Apple Watch SE for $30 off at Target&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aJnKjj"&gt;Smartwatches are always a good gift idea for most people during the holiday season. The Apple Watch SE is a great gift, especially for an Apple user in your life. Right now, Target has the wearable for &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-40mm-gold-aluminum-case-with-pink-sand-sport-band%2F-%2FA-80606291%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000012807845%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Local%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-778931623817%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiA2uH-BRCCARIsAEeef3kUpnvIjyCbauGKhxzwU5H0qWXgAPlk1PvW4DL9EBy_ICHnVSp5lqMaAtKtEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$250 in the 40mm size&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-aluminum%2F-%2FA-81498739%3Fpreselect%3D80606314%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;44mm size for $280&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>iOS 14.3 has arrived with ProRAW for iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 Pro camera app in use" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2qMsMMZNsBnOi0Z23G2uJ_9sEo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510836/akrales_201017_4238_0016.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;With iOS 14.3, the iPhone 12 Pro camera app will support a new kind of RAW image capture | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TnaGT5"&gt;Apple’s iOS 14.3 has arrived, giving iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max owners the ProRAW feature that was promised when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21504764/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-screen-size-5g-features-price-release-date"&gt;devices were announced&lt;/a&gt;. Other features in this update include search improvements for the Apple TV app, support for Fitness Plus  — Apple’s new subscription-based workout service — and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;recently announced AirPods Max headphones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iIXoU"&gt;iPhones have long been able to capture RAW images, but doing so has meant giving up the benefits of all the computational magic that happens when shooting a standard image with the native camera app. ProRAW is designed to address that: it’s a format that combines the computational benefits of Apple’s image processing with the post-processing flexibility of a RAW file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqPupH"&gt;In iOS 14.3, Apple is flipping the ProRAW “on” switch for iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max — and those two devices only. With the update installed, ProRAW image capture and editing will be enabled in the native camera and photos apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Y0fbua"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro review: ahead of its time","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"},{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max review: the best smartphone camera you can get","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oth5QR"&gt;This update also addresses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169881/apple-iphone-ios-14-text-messages-no-notifications-bug"&gt;an irritating bug&lt;/a&gt; where some users weren’t getting notifications for new incoming messages. And on the lighter side, Siri gets an update with hundreds of animal, instruments, and vehicle sounds. The new feature works on HomePod, iPhones and iPads; just ask Siri what sound a humpback whale makes and you’ll get a demonstration. If you’re on an iPhone or iPad, you’ll also get a visual to go along with the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLTutb"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/08/ios-14-3-release-candidate-features/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, 14.3 also makes it easier to customize app icons since home screen shortcuts no longer need to open the Shortcuts app. Other iOS 14.3 highlights include the ability to record video at 25fps, updates to Apple TV app search and a new Apple TV Plus tab, front-facing camera mirroring in still photos for devices from the iPhone 6S and newer, and new Cycle Tracking features in the Health app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches new App Store privacy labels so you can see how iOS apps use your data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foLTsv1S9sSgbk_TvqGmKOS1qiA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510737/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nyix9w"&gt;Apple is making good on its promise to provide more transparency around iOS app data collection with the launch of new privacy labels on the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzS8jj"&gt;The company first announced its intention to provide these so-called “nutrition label” privacy disclosures &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299407/apple-ios-14-new-privacy-features-data-location-tracking-premissions-wwdc-2020"&gt;back in June during WWDC&lt;/a&gt;, and last month Apple disclosed that developers would have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551926/apple-privacy-developers-nutrition-labels-app-store-ios-14"&gt;provide this information by December 8th&lt;/a&gt; or risk losing the ability to update their apps. Now, following that deadline, Apple is launching the feature officially for all iOS device owners running the latest version of iOS 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Q6tEa"&gt;Apple says the new labels will be required for apps on all of its platforms — that includes iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — and they will have to be up to date and accurate every time a developer submits a new update. Apple is also holding itself to the same standard, something the company clarified last week when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165152/whatsapp-privacy-apple-first-third-party-app-store-nutrition-labels"&gt;Facebook-owned WhatsApp criticized the company&lt;/a&gt; for an apparent inconsistency in its requirements, before Apple said it, too, will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165959/apple-privacy-nutrition-labels-all-apps-preinstalled-messages-web"&gt;provide labels for all its own software&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cszf52"&gt;The company’s own first-party apps will all have the same disclosures on their App Store product pages. In the event an app doesn’t have an App Store product page because it cannot be removed, like the Messages app, Apple says it will be providing privacy label information on the web. Every piece of software on the App Store will also have its privacy label viewable on the web, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p6KlEhLz0kQr5rC5lJ6tl5cQVTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168998/Screen_Shot_2020_12_14_at_10.33.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R49pJY"&gt;As for how the labels are structured, Apple has broken down data collection into three categories: “data used to track you,” “data linked to you,” and “data not linked to you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Mg0q"&gt;Tracking in this context means the app developer is linking data from the app — like personal information, or data collected from your device, such as location data — with other data from other companies’ apps or websites for the purpose of targeted advertising or some other ad-related metric. Apple says it’s also using the term tracking here to mean sharing user or device information with companies that sell it, like data brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7m37s"&gt;The “data linked to you” portion of the label is any data that can be used to identify you. That means data gleaned from using the app or having an account with the service or platform, and any data pulled from the device itself that could be used to create a profile for advertising purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKBRDn"&gt;“Data not linked to you” is the portion of the privacy label that clarifies when certain data types, like location data or browsing history, are not being linked to you in any identifiable fashion. Apple has specific, developer-focused information on the new labels &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/"&gt;at its developer portal page&lt;/a&gt;, with more general information available on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapple.com%2Fprivacy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174017%2Fapple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the consumer-facing page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFjT8f"&gt;This isn’t the last of Apple’s major privacy changes coming with iOS 14. The company intends to release a new privacy feature requiring developers to ask for explicit permission to track iOS device users across apps and websites using a unique device identifier, called an IDFA (or Identification for Advertisers) code. The plan was to require this with the launch of iOS 14, but Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;announced in September&lt;/a&gt; that it would delay the feature until some time next year, to give developers more time to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dune director Denis Villeneuve blasts AT&amp;T and Warner Bros. for ‘hijacking’ films </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/24T0kqh-vtUldXEfLqa6C8eENXU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494669/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O1ndOe"&gt;Denis Villeneuve’s &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;is going to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;coming to HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; on the same date as its theater release, and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-blasts-warner-bros-1234851270/#article-comments"&gt;the director is not happy&lt;/a&gt;. He’s written an article for &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; blasting Warner Brothers and AT&amp;amp;T, saying that the the move to release movies on streaming on the same day as in theaters is “a desperate attempt to grab the audience’s attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cB6i7"&gt;“With this decision AT&amp;amp;T has hijacked one of the most respectable and important studios in film history,” he writes. “There is absolutely no love for cinema, nor for the audience here. It is all about the survival of a telecom mammoth, one that is currently bearing an astronomical debt of more than $150 billion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDcQ59"&gt;He's not alone in his anger at WB and HBO Max — last week Christopher Nolan, director of &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;complained about the move&lt;/a&gt;, repeating his frequently raised belief that movies “are meant to be big-screen experiences.” Villeneuve echoed this sentiment in his piece, saying that &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;’s “image and sound were meticulously designed to be seen in theaters.” Villeneuve says the original plan was to delay Dune to October 2021, and he supported that decision for public safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="We9jvR"&gt;Executives for AT&amp;amp;T, NBCUniversal, and ViacomCBS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22163583/streaming-theaters-hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-shows"&gt;have defended the release strategy&lt;/a&gt;, but with directors of the blockbusters starting to voice their disapproval, it’ll be interesting to see how Warner Bros. responds, if it does at all. It will also be interesting to see how audiences respond; whether they agree with the filmmakers that movies need to be seen on the big screen to be truly appreciated, or if they’re happy watching them from the comfort of their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ur3I5d"&gt;You can read Villenueve’s full editorial &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-blasts-warner-bros-1234851270/#article-comments"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65ht1Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 10th, 9:32PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Corrected the spelling of Christopher Nolan’s movie Tenet. It was previously misspelled as Tenant. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile introduces its first 5G hotspot and a 100GB standalone plan for $50 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inseego 5G MiFi M2000" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eii8RH05Dwh2GCU0S5eWBi21LWY=/0x1:1832x1222/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492516/Moretti_generic_top_006.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile will start selling the Inseego 5G MiFi M2000 today. | Image: Inseego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3nfzJ"&gt;T-Mobile might look as thought it’s late to the game by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2F5g-just-got-better&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167745%2Ftmobile-5g-hotspot-100gb-standalone-plan#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;unveiling its first 5G hotspot today&lt;/a&gt;, along with a variety of 5G standalone hotspot plans. After all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/18/20699111/verizon-5g-mifi-m1000-hotspot-650-expensive-data"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18303494/att-5g-service-19-cities-verizon-samsung-s10-exclusivity-tmobile-hot-spot"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; have offered 5G hotspots for a while now (although they began with significantly limited coverage). But T-Mobile’s particular blend of wide 5G coverage and better-than-LTE speeds means the device should be more accessible to more people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JaXk2X"&gt;Plus, the carrier’s standalone 5G hotspot plan is priced to compete, starting at $30 for 10GB and $40 for 30GB, and topping out at 100GB for $50. In comparison, AT&amp;amp;T’s standalone hotspot plans start at $60 per month for 15GB; Verizon’s offerings start at $80 for 15GB of 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SGbE23"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile’s standalone 5G hotspot plan is priced to compete&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rgcgrj"&gt;T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftablet%2Finseego-5g-mifi-m2000&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167745%2Ftmobile-5g-hotspot-100gb-standalone-plan#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Inseego 5G MiFi M2000&lt;/a&gt; hotspot is available now through T-Mobile and costs $336 to purchase outright. For now, the carrier is offering to knock that down to $168 if you add a new line and spread the payment across 24 months. The M2000 has more than 24 hours of battery life and is capable of connecting up to 30 devices at once, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1UE9h"&gt;A reminder: 5G comes in several flavors, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;not all are created equal&lt;/a&gt;. T-Mobile has taken a multi-layered approach with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538604/t-mobile-5g-network-midband-coverage-expanded-cities"&gt;aggressive expansion schedule&lt;/a&gt;, working to grow overall coverage quickly as well as bolstering its midband offerings, thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202726/tmobile-sprint-acquisition-ceo-finished-john-legere-steps-down"&gt;acquisition of Sprint’s network&lt;/a&gt; last spring. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now add tweets to your snaps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B0pNjIRRZYqM2q4oBx9KDOxnypY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68491764/acastro_170726_1777_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="13RGce"&gt;Twitter is making it even easier to spread your tweets far and wide to every social media platform imaginable. Starting today on iOS (support is coming “soon” for Android), you’ll be able to add tweets into a snap as a sticker. Before, if you wanted to share a tweet on Snapchat, you would have to take a screenshot of it and share that, without having access to any of Snapchat’s camera or editing features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVS3Rs"&gt;If you want to share a tweet to Snapchat, press the share button on a public tweet (private tweets aren’t supported, for obvious reasons) and select the Snapchat icon from the share carousel. You can then create a snap as usual, except you’ll have your selected tweet as a sticker that you can manipulate. You can then share the snap as you would any other — sending it to people, or adding it to your story, and whoever sees it can go to the tweet by swiping up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shows the process of sharing a tweet to Snapchat" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LosgzVI-mjpOf4uia5YI6a3QiM8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158880/JN9n1a0kXdN4WiHcn1HmXwjLGtQj9ym64p9Ee3Fe8PqM1khSpD4thVG9HhoqF4qx1hI_Am5Avqq1pSpNNXoFFHvcIw5OS1r9gol9REwmrtiIwa4CgkUDYwaIF5SHRQPjc9rE_ppC.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The process of adding a tweet to a snap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S2Qran"&gt;I have to say, the example snap looks way better than the (often crunchy) screenshots of tweets do, and it’s nice that it’s a format that lets you easily find the source. If you’ve abandoned Snapchat for Instagram Stories, don’t worry: Twitter also says that a small group of iOS users will be able to test sharing tweets to Instagram Stories soon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of a tweet that has been embedded into an Instagram story" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iufAMqocrBgKzSDoTgweuRgYKX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158926/xF6OtSQCTyfV0kcCl671ctkWapXjNOUfKWmpU_k7IUbuAz5pm9FNLCSh40zILd_rS1HoyS05nwCfwPweq23Tw4PZRqgPUMCfXtP_FoMGk62mzEeSi8RHJsCVnJBCtjESyAQL9zGy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Graphic: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soon, Twitter will be testing sharing to Instagram Stories as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wq9xZk"&gt;This is a feature built for social media apps as they are today: places to repost tweets. As I’m writing this, two out of the top 10 posts on Reddit are tweets. Instagram is filled with pages that post screenshots of tweets, and Facebook, I’m told, is mostly people posting tweets (Twitter, of course, is full of old Tumblr posts). Now, Snapchat can also be Twitter, and Instagram Stories’ time is coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgGOER"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S21 will reportedly launch on January 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KcJq-ueBQpDzH1NwS1u3tptlBFA=/52x0:616x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489320/samsung_galaxy_s21_668_leak.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teaser videos of the upcoming phones recently leaked online.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SBin3R"&gt;Samsung’s next flagship smartphone lineup, the Galaxy S21 series, will launch globally on January 14th, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-launch-date-india-availability-1184543/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority &lt;/em&gt;is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The date was revealed by Samsung’s largest mobile experience store in India, and &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-surprise-preorders-launch-date-confirmed-india"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;subsequently confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the date with a company official at Samsung’s local offices. Although &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; reports this as the global launch date, Samsung HQ has yet to confirm it, and in response to questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; said that it does not comment on rumor or speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MZSEn"&gt;Although a January launch is earlier than the February Unpacked events we’ve become accustomed to in recent years, this isn’t the first time this date has been rumored. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a January 14th launch based on its own sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAnyB9"&gt;The phones will reportedly go on sale on January 29th in India, according to employees at Samsung’s Opera House outlet in Bengaluru, &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; reports. The store is taking preorders for three upcoming handsets, the Galaxy S21, the S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra, with a Rs 2,000 (around $27) deposit. Full pricing for the lineup is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0zZc6u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sales will reportedly start later that month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G4nOBU"&gt;Along with confirming the launch plans, the new report from &lt;em&gt;Android Authority &lt;/em&gt;has also revealed some of the upcoming handsets’ specs. They’ll apparently be powered by Samsung’s Exynos 2100 processor in India, and the three models will be available in the following colors: gray, pink, purple, and white for the S21; pink, purple, silver and black for the S21 Plus; and black and silver for the S21 Ultra. &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; says the S21 Ultra will have a 108-megapixel main sensor, alongside two additional 10-megapixel sensors, one of which will have a 10x optical zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umdeJt"&gt;The latest report adds to a host of leaked details about the new handsets. Earlier this week we got an early look at the phones through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;series of leaked teaser trailers&lt;/a&gt;, which show off their redesigned camera bumps. The trailers appear to confirm that the S21 Ultra will have a total of five cameras, compared to three on the S21 and S21 Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="na3432"&gt;The trailers &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;followed a report in November&lt;/a&gt; which said that each of the phones will come with 120Hz displays, and will have screens ranging from 6.2 to 6.8-inches in size. Internally, they’ll reportedly have batteries ranging in size from 4,000 mAh to 5,000 mAh, and will be powered by Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor in regions that don’t use Samsung’s own processors. The S21 Ultra is also expected to be compatible with Samsung’s S-Pen, which is important considering the rumors that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;stylus-equipped Note lineup is being discontinued&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWvtgK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 10th, 12:34PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Samsung’s no comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is buying anime streaming service Crunchyroll from AT&amp;T for $1.175 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rF4efHRCnG5wPHovm_wc_gwL3xs=/22x0:933x607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68488042/crunchyroll_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l4Peux"&gt;Sony will be buying anime streaming service Crunchyroll from AT&amp;amp;T for $1.175 billion, Sony and AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2020/1209/atttosellcrunchyrolltosonysfunimationglobalgroup"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, Crunchyroll will become part of Sony’s Funimation, which already licenses many popular shows such as &lt;em&gt;Attack on Titan&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;One Piece.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vHXOS"&gt;Now that Sony owns both Crunchyroll and Funimation, the company has &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/21547657/sonys-funimation-acquires-crunchyroll-deal-price-watching-anime"&gt;tremendous power over&lt;/a&gt; anime in the US at a time when many other media companies are trying to figure out their anime content. Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/theres-something-super-weird-about-netflix-anime/"&gt;also invested heavily&lt;/a&gt; in both licensing and producing its own anime content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zvR6Mw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are excited to embark on this new journey”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cwJtag"&gt;“We are excited to embark on this new journey,” said Joanne Waage, general manager of Crunchyroll, in a statement. “Crunchyroll has built a world-class brand with a passionate fan-base of over 3 million subscribers, 50 million social followers and 90 million registered users. These amazing fans have helped to propel anime into a global phenomenon. Combining the strength of the Crunchyroll brand and the expertise of our global team with Funimation is an exciting prospect and a win for the incredible art form of anime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfZYHc"&gt;“The union of Funimation and Crunchyroll is a win for anime fans around the world that will elevate the art and culture of this medium for decades to come,” Colin Decker, CEO of Funimation Global Group, said &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.funimation.com%2Fblog%2F2020%2F12%2F09%2Ffunimation-to-acquire-crunchyroll-fans-win%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dorg-social%26utm_campaign%3Drelease%26utm_content%3Dcr-fun%26sf134076722%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22166585%2Fsony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Combining these two great companies will be a win for fans, and enable us to compete at a truly global scale. I am honored to welcome the wonderful Crunchyroll team to a shared mission—to help everyone belong to the extraordinary world of anime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKIce3"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has been shopping around Crunchyroll for some time, and AT&amp;amp;T and Sony have apparently been in talks for months about the deal. In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/at-t-wants-1-5-billion-in-crunchyroll-sale-to-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that AT&amp;amp;T wanted Sony to pay $1.5 billion for Crunchyroll, and the two sides were reportedly close to a nearly $1 billion deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541734/crunchyroll-sony-acquisition-talks-near-end-1-billion-nikkei"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpgNdp"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T purchased Crunchyroll as part of Otter Media in 2018 from the Chernin Group for a reported sum of more than $1 billion, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/business/media/otter-media-chernin-group-att.html"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The sale gave AT&amp;amp;T ownership over a number of digital properties. John Stankey, current CEO of AT&amp;amp;T but then head of WarnerMedia, said the company would use the Otter Media acquisition to “harness Otter’s expertise” while strengthening its own digital assets. Under Stankey’s leadership, AT&amp;amp;T and WarnerMedia are now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;focused on building up HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, the crown jewel of the company’s streaming offerings. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OtVRDQ"&gt;Detailed specs and images of the 2021 Moto G Stylus have leaked by way of an early Amazon listing, as &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-renders-leak_id128790"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This iteration on the stylus-having, budget-friendly device looks to borrow features from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432283/motorola-moto-g9-plus-phone-available-now-brazil"&gt;this year’s Moto G9 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, including a 6.8-inch FHD+ display that’s slightly larger than its predecessor’s 6.4-inch screen. Amazon’s (now removed) page lists a price of $341, which is unlikely to be the final MSRP, but it’s a bit higher than the original G Stylus’ $299 introductory price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WuRkwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new Moto G Stylus and G Power are surprisingly adept cameraphones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OFwmp1"&gt;One of the things we liked best about the prior G Stylus was the image quality from its camera, and Motorola appears to have tweaked the hardware setup in the 2021 version. Aside from a 48-megapixel main rear camera, it adopts the quad-camera array from the Moto G9 Plus, including an 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro camera, and 2-megapixel depth-sensing camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyBiQr"&gt;The leaked listing shows a few other details, including Android 10 pre-loaded, a 4,000mAh battery, and two color options: “aurora white” and “aurora black.” It will be one of few options for those looking for a stylus bundled with their phone; Samsung’s Galaxy Note series is another one, but those devices are much more expensive and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;may be going away soon&lt;/a&gt;. While Motorola hasn’t given an official launch date for the new G Stylus, it’s safe to assume that the device will be formally revealed soon if retailers are readying listings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s official Galaxy S21, 21 Plus, and 21 Ultra teasers have leaked, and the camera squircle is gone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iWgBsxXaSoexGgtZQSEKbS3EUpA=/52x0:616x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479492/samsung_galaxy_s21_plus_668_leak.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="91arj8"&gt;Samsung’s next flagship phones the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra are widely expected to arrive this January (alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22054757/galaxy-buds-pro-leaked-images-renders-rounded-design-case"&gt;some new buds&lt;/a&gt;), but we haven’t had a true glimpse at them yet. That may be changing today, as &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/"&gt;has just published&lt;/a&gt; three brief teaser videos that it says come directly from Samsung, and line up perfectly with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/18/21521860/samsung-galaxy-phones-january-2021-renders-leak"&gt;the OnLeaks renders&lt;/a&gt; we first saw in October.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S4zp2zRZ7UOWkc2_K4LUD2HHGqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154918/samsung_galaxy_s21_668_leak.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M9q3nOGRCjCWFQpSKgj8Kc269jA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154919/samsung_galaxy_s21_ultra_668_leak.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="re4oz4"&gt;While we can’t glean too much from these videos, they make it crystal clear what to expect from the design of these phones — a sleek, streamlined new camera bump that blends into the sides of the phone, with three cameras on the S21 and S21 Plus and five cameras (including what appears to be a periscope zoom lens, see the square shape) on the S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ha0Ubd"&gt;Your eagle eyes can probably also see that the S21 Ultra will have a curved screen, instead of the flat panels on the S21 and S21 Plus, and the names of all three phones include “5G” so there’ll hopefully be zero confusion about which networks they support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ta5PM8"&gt;Otherwise, we have to consult previous leaks to see what these phones might be all about. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;claimed in November&lt;/a&gt; that we’d be looking at 6.2-inch, 6.7-inch, and 6.8-inch phones, respectively — each with 120Hz screens; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; or Exynos 2100 processors; and 4,000mAh, 4,800mAh, and 5,000mAh batteries, respectively. However, the S21 Ultra will supposedly come with the brightest screen on a Samsung phone yet at 1,600 nits. It’ll also reportedly have an adaptive refresh rate that goes all the way down to 1Hz, as well as S Pen stylus support (but no integrated slot), while the standard S21 may have a plastic back instead of glass this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdVI6d"&gt;The Ultra will also purportedly have an improved 108MP camera sensor and two telephoto lenses, one at 3x optical and one at 10x optical, each with larger pixels to gather more light than previous zooms. But its main camera and ultrawide camera are suspected to use the same 12MP sensors across the lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aox2aB"&gt;According to filings at Brazil’s regulatory agency, the Galaxy S21 &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s21_family_wont_have_a_charger_or_earphones_in_the_box-news-46634.php"&gt;may also ship without a charger or earbuds in the box&lt;/a&gt; — which would be pretty rich, considering how &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-apple-charger-box-1169323/"&gt;it made fun of Apple for doing the same&lt;/a&gt; only a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
