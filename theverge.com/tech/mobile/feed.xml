    <title>Former head of Sonic Team releases new self-made mobile game</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yuji Naka showing off his solo-developer skills&lt;/em&gt; | Image: @nakayuji via Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2eoPOW"&gt;Yuji Naka — former head of Sonic Team — released a new game under his one-man studio Prope called &lt;a href="http://iprope.com/SHOT2048.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shot2048&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Naka was the lead programmer for the original &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; (which seems to be playable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834023/sega-genesis-sonic-1-tesla-arcade"&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt; nowadays) and most recently left his short stay at Square Enix to spend his time working on this hyper-casual title for mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nP75bx"&gt;The goal in &lt;em&gt;Shot2048 &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1594889891"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PropeLtd.SHOT2048"&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;) is to roll dice to the end of an alley and combine (multiply) enough like-numbers to create at least one die valued at 2048. It did take me about five attempts to win my first game... and about four tries to understand the game. There aren’t much in terms of instructions other than this iOS App Store description (though admittedly, after reading it again post-play, it makes sense now):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cQGAYO"&gt;The purpose is to shot the same number and make 2048.&lt;br&gt;The purpose is to shot the same number to make 2048, but aim for more.&lt;br&gt;Tap to move the number left or right, and release your finger to fire the number.&lt;br&gt;If you hit the same number, they will be combined and the numbers will be added.&lt;br&gt;The game is over when the numbers stop in the red game over area in the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="dvJrA2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I created a hyper-casual game called [&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SHOT2048?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SHOT2048&lt;/a&gt;]. This is the first time in my 37 years as a game creator that I, Yuji Naka, have made a game all by myself. I would appreciate it if you could play it and spread the word. Thank you very much. &lt;a href="https://t.co/vuWmoxO0sj"&gt;https://t.co/vuWmoxO0sj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LNwQDORXJO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LNwQDORXJO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Yuji Naka / 中　裕司 (@nakayuji) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nakayuji/status/1472186879588331525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t3WK54"&gt;It’s a neat idea for a quick time-pass and doesn’t actually require much in terms of math skill since you only really need to match colors and keep the dice out of the shooting zone. The stage gets a bit more challenging as too many dice fill up the play zone; should the dice stay in the shooting zone for too long — about five seconds — the game will be over. The physics can get kinda wonky, but you’ll need to count on some toppling to get the dice in the back to combine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/thiCJP-a0HaPD-UKM6yBUuMocNk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115535/shot2048.001.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I won once in Shot2048, might be worth playing again but definitely not with the pay-to-win transactions. On the right is a very similar game called Chain Cube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="67hcWv"&gt;Naka’s game takes clear inspiration from other popular mobile puzzlers like, uh, &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt; (which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/28/5556760/threes-developer-releases-emails-showing-work-in-reply-to-clones"&gt;has its own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/11/8722909/threes-free-to-play-launch-ios-android"&gt;history of cloning&lt;/a&gt;) or another similar title we noticed called &lt;em&gt;Chain Cube&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yIcUC"&gt;The free-to-play game is ad-heavy but will let you remove the ads for $5.99. Also, if you’re having a tough time winning, the game will gladly take $0.99 to give you five more tries. I was also requested by the app to track me, which I declined (though, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22828713/apple-app-tracking-transparancy-psa-privacy-ads-cohorts"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not always a full off switch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHDuVH"&gt;Naka built the game on Unity and says this is the first game he developed alone, touting his 37-year career in the video game industry. The inaugural Prope team (2006) consisted of Naka and 10 former Sega employees targeting the casual &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.giantbomb.com%2Fwaggle%2F3015-1035%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F20%2F22846465%2Fyuji-naka-sega-sonic-team-shot2048-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;waggle&lt;/a&gt; gaming boom, starting with &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/07/06/review-lets-tap-for-the-wii/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s Tap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Wii. Without a team, Naka &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nakayuji/status/1472934019432337409"&gt;needed some help&lt;/a&gt; getting leaderboards to work for &lt;em&gt;Shot2048&lt;/em&gt; — so he asked for (and received) help on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC settles with Verizon, AT&amp;T, and others over failed 911 calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhte_qzeEtWYvLvv25Tl4r2cKPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70294725/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6UFV1c"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/four-companies-settle-fcc-investigations-compliance-911-rules"&gt;has reached settlements&lt;/a&gt; with AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, Intrado, and CenturyLink (which now goes by Lumen Technologies) over investigations into failed 911 calls that occurred during network outages in 2020. The companies will pay a total of $6 million combined and also agreed to ensure compliance with the FCC’s 911 availability rules going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUOACx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T will pay $460,000 to settle two different investigations regarding network outages that took place on September 28th, 2020. Both Lumen Technologies and Intrado agreed to resolve investigations into outages that occurred on that same day, with Lumen Technologies paying $3.8 million and Intrado paying $1.7 million. Verizon settled with the FCC over an investigation of an outage that took place on May 7th, 2020, paying $274,000 as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JjexEM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s vital that phone companies prevent these outages wherever possible and provide prompt and sufficient notification to 911 call centers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5TA3d"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, Lumen Technologies, and Intrado weren’t just probed for failed 911 calls. The FCC also reports that it opened an investigation as to whether these companies alerted the affected 911 call centers of the outages in a timely manner. It also investigated AT&amp;amp;T for potentially failing to “deliver number and location information” during the outage, which is in violation of FCC rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKjhfJ"&gt;“Sunny day outages can be especially troubling because they occur when the public and 911 call centers least expect it,” said FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. “It’s vital that phone companies prevent these outages wherever possible and provide prompt and sufficient notification to 911 call centers when they do occur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX28cX"&gt;Just last month, &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-reaches-195m-settlement-t-mobile-911-outage-investigation"&gt;T-Mobile agreed to pay $19.5 million&lt;/a&gt; to settle an investigation into whether T-Mobile violated the FCC’s 911 calling rules during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292024/t-mobile-verizon-att-calls-failing-down-phone-networks-us-carriers"&gt;the massive nationwide outage&lt;/a&gt; that occurred in June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon tries to defend collecting browsing data on its network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lAushCodxkqVEjGJHgyQjuGnM6M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286702/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPknxr"&gt;Verizon has sent an email to customers to let them know they’re getting opted in to its Custom Experience data collection scheme after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22818783/verizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history"&gt;reports came out&lt;/a&gt; about it being turned on by default for some users. If you (understandably) trashed the email without reading it, the TL;DR is that Verizon’s program collects data about your apps and web browsing activity to help “provide you more personalized experiences with Verizon.” But of course, Verizon says, you have a choice — you can turn it off anytime because your privacy is important to it (though not important enough to make the program opt-in instead of opt-out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6pi66"&gt;Custom Experience is a sort of spin-off / successor / rebrand of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/2/16085062/verizon-up-rewards-program-track-browsing-history-data-select-oath"&gt;Verizon Selects&lt;/a&gt;, which people were enrolled into when they used the Verizon Up rewards program. Verizon Selects has now been rebranded as Custom Experience Plus, while the Custom Experience with a few limits on tracking is rolling out to most customers who don’t actively opt out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bzhiO"&gt;Verizon is letting its customers know about the program through emails, like one a member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s staff received, and texts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jamesreb/status/1471603532730040324?s=20"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; a reader says they got. The email promises that “you’re in control,” saying that you can opt out within the next 30 days before the Custom Experience is turned on for your line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mEB4Nz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon is now letting its customers know that the Custom Experience is coming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xk1K05"&gt;Doing nothing, however, will likely end with Verizon using your data to “personalize [its] communications with you, give you more relevant product and service recommendations, and develop plans, services and offers that are more appealing to you.” The &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/verizon-custom-experience-programs-faqs/?CMP=CRM_M_CU_AC_EM_NOT_21_11_LEGAL_CTM_EXP_NON_SLCT_ENG_NUS&amp;amp;EMHID=c96b4811be3d4808a642b94ba5f0fe873310c7077504f5b29ca77de541c45883&amp;amp;CUHID=398078901cccf63d677d949665702ed2995acb4db919825c6f5eb16102951ba7&amp;amp;BID=452102968" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s FAQ for the program&lt;/a&gt; says that “consumer and small business customers with smartphone lines are included in the Custom Experience program.” It does note that corporate and government lines, as well as lines for children and people in Maine, aren’t included in the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofay85"&gt;As we note &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22818783/verizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history"&gt;in our explainer&lt;/a&gt;, there are actually two levels to what Verizon is doing here — Custom Experience, which is the automatic enrollment one, and Custom Experience Plus, which is much more invasive but supposedly is opt-in. However, it does seem like people have found that they’ve inadvertently signed up for Custom Experience Plus while using other rewards programs. Verizon says with Plus, it collects location data straight from its network (so turning off location tracking on your phone won’t help), as well as metadata about your phone calls like who you talk to and when you talk to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QSFnj"&gt;You can read the full instructions on how to turn off Custom Experience and erase the data it’s collected on you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22818783/verizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but the short version is that it can be done in the “Manage privacy settings” preference pane of the My Verizon app (&lt;a href="http://m.vzw.com/CE"&gt;or the web&lt;/a&gt;). Verizon says that it doesn’t sell the data from Custom Experience to advertisers and that it’s for Verizon’s use only. One reader reported that Verizon even sent an alert that linked users to a page explaining how &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/dam/support/pdf/device-installment-privacy-notice.pdf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon uses the personal data you provide when you sign up for its service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As promised, Nokia phones started getting Android 12 this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6Ury3w_zy1QZ2X2zQVU4y49ZSc=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282874/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia X20 is HMD Global’s first device to get Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mZCT2X"&gt;HMD Global offered its first Android 12 update this week, starting with the midrange Nokia X20. The company says &lt;a href="https://community.phones.nokia.com/discussion/64559/android-12-on-nokia-x20"&gt;users in this first wave&lt;/a&gt; will receive the update by December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQvmdb"&gt;Good. That’s what HMD said it would do, and it’s doing just that. We love to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfq1o7"&gt;You’re forgiven if you forgot that the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_int%2Fnokia-x-20&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22839883%2Fnokia-x20-android-12-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia X20&lt;/a&gt; exists — it’s a mostly unremarkable device with a 6.67-inch 60Hz display, Snapdragon 480 processor, and four rear-facing cameras. In fact, its most compelling features might just be its healthy support policy (three years of OS updates) and an unusually generous three-year warranty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E0TWvj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Generally speaking, the Android 12 rollout has been a rocky one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kV0pax"&gt;That’s a great policy in theory — as my colleague Jon Porter pointed out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;his hands-on with the X20&lt;/a&gt;, the phone should still be under warranty when it gets Android 14. But there’s no real guarantee that HMD (or any Android device maker for that matter) will follow through with its promise of continuing OS updates. To that end, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811988/hmd-global-nokia-9-pureview-android-11-software"&gt;recently backtracked on its promise&lt;/a&gt; to bring Android 11 to the Nokia 9 PureView. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WF2h4z"&gt;And generally speaking, the Android 12 rollout has been a rocky one. OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828553/oneplus-buggy-oxygenos-android-12-update-9-pro"&gt;pulled its buggy Android 12-based OxygenOS update&lt;/a&gt; for the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 owners &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-android-12-problems-issues-update-postponed/"&gt;have also reported issues&lt;/a&gt; with the stable Android 12 update. Google’s own Pixel 6 and 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832212/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-bug-fixes-fingerprint-sensor"&gt;appear to be afflicted&lt;/a&gt;, too. Even a so-called stable Android 12 release for Nokia phones could prove to be equally unstable. But if the X20 is to live up to its promised three-year lifespan, it’s certainly starting on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is reportedly going to make more of its own chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CqPpYNbvftEmMdmVKKeMhMRR8yI=/0x0:2028x1352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282304/vpavic_210916_4760_0082.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uziLaj"&gt;Apple is reportedly working to design more chip components in-house, with the company said to be establishing a new office with the aim of replacing components that Apple currently sources from Broadcom and Skyworks, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-16/apple-builds-team-in-new-office-to-bring-wireless-chips-in-house"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9yzwE"&gt;The new office is said to be in its early stages but will eventually focus on “wireless radios, radio-frequency integrated circuits and a wireless system-on-a-chip,” in addition to “semiconductors for connecting to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12mJgk"&gt;While the A-series and M-series SoCs that contain the CPU and GPU for Apple’s iPhones and Macs get most of the attention, there are tons of additional chips inside those devices, handling things like power management, USB connectivity, wireless charging, and more. As &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2B13%2BPro%2BFull%2BChip%2BID%2F144993&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22839850%2Fapple-office-develop-chips-in-house-broadcom-skyworks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit’&lt;/em&gt;s iPhone 13 pro teardown&lt;/a&gt; documents, Skyworks and Broadcom supply a significant portion of the iPhone’s third-party circuitry — parts that Apple, it seems, would prefer to design on its own to create more bespoke solutions for its hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E4HLXA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple wants to rely less on third-party suppliers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ETAvVH"&gt;One of the most prominent examples of third-party chips is the iPhone’s modem, which is currently manufactured by Qualcomm (but had previously been the subject of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18410985/apple-qualcomm-settle-royalty-dispute-patent-licensing-terms-high-fees"&gt;years-long legal battle&lt;/a&gt; that briefly saw Apple switch to using Intel parts). Apple has made no secret about its ambitions to develop its own 5G chips instead of paying for Qualcomm’s chips, either: the company bought Intel’s smartphone modem business in 2019 for around $1 billion and is said to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800144/apple-own-iphone-modem-2023-tsmc-4nm"&gt;looking to switch over&lt;/a&gt; to its own in-house modems for the iPhone as early as 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6uxU8"&gt;That Apple is looking to build more of its own chips may not just be about exercising a greater level of control and hardware integration, though: it could also be about getting a better handle on part supply. Right now, Apple is already feeling the impact of the ongoing global chip shortage with supply issues for parts from suppliers like Broadcom, which forced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723209/apple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report"&gt;Apple to slash its manufacturing targets back in October&lt;/a&gt;. Building its own chips could help Apple alleviate some of those issues in the future, assuming it’s able to continue to work well with its manufacturing partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UO2mYA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s P50 Pocket is a stylish clamshell foldable launching this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6aRiNRkhbtH8SI2cHbl8CHI_Vk=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70280496/001RBNXygy1gxfadt3cfyj61hc0u07ee02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P50 Pocket appears to have a small external circular screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0qbOuv"&gt;Huawei is set to announce a new foldable phone later this month called the Huawei P50 Pocket, according to a post on the company’s &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4714230723379666"&gt;official Weibo account&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike its previous Mate X foldables, which fold from a device the size of a tablet into a smartphone, the P50 Pocket has a clamshell design that folds out to the size of a smartphone. It’s a similar design to Samsung’s Z Flip devices, or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;Motorola Razr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seNxZo"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/em&gt; photoshoot of the P50 Pocket &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/L6h3qlP5V"&gt;posted on Weibo&lt;/a&gt; makes it look like a stylish little foldable. It appears to have a similar dual-ring camera bump to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598135/huawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras"&gt;Huawei P50&lt;/a&gt;, but its lower ring has been repurposed to work as a small external screen, which appears to be able to show notifications or work as a camera viewfinder.  &lt;a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/huawei-p50-pocket-harper-s-bazaar-teaser-062427696.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget China &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that the phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor for security, and available colors include silver and gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Blj1lZbnmPp8RDE0ZmK9qtfqg3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100951/001RBNXygy1gxfadtvk2hj61400u0n0g02.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHDMhrpvEkBdgIl-peKwOf8iduE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100952/001RBNXygy1gxfadvhl0cj61400u0q8202.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TYT7cw"&gt;Huawei is of course no stranger to foldable devices, and has previously released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18239565/huawei-mate-x-foldable-phone-hands-on-design-mwc-2019"&gt;Mate X&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;Mate XS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Mate X2&lt;/a&gt;. But these use a folding form-factor that some have compared to a hotdog bun. In contrast, the new P50 Pocket looks to be using what’s been called a hamburger-style design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMxwvt"&gt;Huawei’s post only mentions a Chinese launch, and it’s unclear if or when the P50 Pocket could see a global release. We might be waiting a while, though. Huawei is yet to offer its latest flagship smartphone, the P50, outside of China following its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598135/huawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras"&gt;launch in July&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is still subject to US sanctions that both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20993148/huawei-mate-30-no-american-components-manufacturers"&gt;limit its ability to source hardware components&lt;/a&gt; and mean it can’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21147919/google-addresses-huawei-services-ban-android-trump-sideload-apps"&gt;preinstall Google’s apps and services&lt;/a&gt; on its phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We didn’t need an AR version of Snake, but AT&amp;T just gave us one anyway</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lyvzLeI-kJr3MWN6golqBER8L38=/0x50:2100x1450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70279143/5g_snake_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warp Speed Worm is an AR filter for Instagram and Messenger and has tenuous connections to 5G at best.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VBq5av"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has re-imagined the classic Snake game in a new, interactive, and wholly unnecessary way in an effort to promote the capabilities of its 5G network. Called &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/facebook-warp-speed-worm.html"&gt;Warp Speed Worm&lt;/a&gt;, it’s an AR effect that can be used on Instagram and Facebook Messenger video calls.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ugd5HQ"&gt;Snake was, of course, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/27/14749896/nokia-3310-snake-gameplay-preview-mwc-2017"&gt;game of choice&lt;/a&gt; on your early Nokia phone. Or, depending on your age and general level of apathy toward high school mathematics, you may recognize it as the game you played on your TI-83 graphing calculator while you were supposed to be learning about coefficients. Not that I know anyone who would do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuUZ0r"&gt;In any case, this newest contribution to the great Snake game &lt;em&gt;genre&lt;/em&gt; is an AR filter in which the titular worm is controlled by your head movements. You can play with friends, which AT&amp;amp;T would like you to do on their 5G network, or you can be a total doofus and play on your own using the camera in the Instagram app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="upPDP3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can play with friends, which AT&amp;amp;T would like you to do on their 5G network&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mmjSwD"&gt;It’s sort of cute — you tilt your head left or right to direct the worm to pick up little game controller icons. As you’ll recall from AP Calculus, the more the worm eats, the longer it gets. When the worm inevitably eats itself, the game is over, and a sad little dead worm crown appears on your head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9n6WIF"&gt;I gave the game a try by myself after struggling to understand how to save and use an AR group effect on an Instagram video call. I’ll admit that I missed the physical controls of my calculator and that my neck creaks alarmingly loud when I tilt it repeatedly. I also can’t comment on how AT&amp;amp;T 5G would have enhanced the experience — it worked just fine on my home Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s Concept Stanza converts your chicken scratch to digital text</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A worker holds the Dell Concept Stanza in their left hand in portrait mode at a white marble table in a cafe setting. On the screen are some drawings and notes. In their right hand is a black stylus." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oW0lH-srKEIieThxb6c_FZ5tdx4=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277284/Concept_Stanza___lifestyle_image___over_shoulder___embargoed_until_Dec_15.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is.&lt;/em&gt; | Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ar234k"&gt;Dell has shown off a new concept device that (let’s be honest) may never actually come out — but it’s a lot of fun to play with. The Concept Stanza is an 11-inch tablet that’s meant to simplify the process of taking notes at work. The idea is that if you write on the Stanza and then double tap your notes, they’ll be instantly converted to digital text. Connect it to a computer, and your notes will show up on the big screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSK333"&gt;Now, this is obviously not a revolutionary use case — devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Notes&lt;/a&gt; can convert handwritten notes to digital ones already. But the big difference with the Stanza is that it’s &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;for writing — there are no cameras, speakers, or ports on the device, in an effort to create what Dell describes as a “distraction-free experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dy6yaj"&gt;Dell’s tablet can also recognize more than letters. You can draw a line through text to delete it and can theoretically digitize shapes (such as Venn diagrams) as well. Separately, the Stanza can serve as an external monitor to extend your screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell Concept Stanza mounted horizontally on a stand with the stylus magnetically attached to the top, on a desk with a cup of pens and a row of notebooks in the background. The screen displays BioFrame 2.0 software." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7PymGJgdq4gVXkxZTmeWfXHeI2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098700/Concept_Stanza___docked___embargoed_until_Dec_15.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s the stylus, magnetically attached.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRfjb9"&gt;I got to try the Stanza out for a few brief minutes. It was a comfortable writing experience — the stylus is compact and the tablet’s screen is smooth. The device correctly interpreted all of my (fairly messy) writing. In English, that is — though we were told that the device is supposed to support a whole bunch of languages, I tried writing some things in Chinese and Korean characters that it did not recognize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EsY8B"&gt;So, work in progress. Since the Stanza is still in the concept stage, there’s no pricing and availability yet, and no guarantee that it’s going to become a real thing you can buy. But it could certainly be a nifty tool for boardroom and classroom use. It’s the rare concept device that I think seems pretty ready to go — though I hope it figures out how to do multiple languages at once. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo’s Find N is an impressive first folding phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ZzSQzXdM8-wFdPii7o44wIryOU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70275102/IMG_1126.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uTXtZn"&gt;After teasing its first folding phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825716/oppo-find-n-foldable-inno-day-2021"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, Oppo is revealing the Find N in full today. Oppo’s chief product officer Pete Lau told reporters in a briefing that the company has been working on this phone since 2018, with the final Find N the result of six generations of internal development. I can believe it — I’ve been using it since last week, and it’s a surprisingly impressive and refined product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVj84z"&gt;The Find N features a similar design to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, with a large, squarish folding OLED panel on the inside and a smaller screen on the outside that can be used when the phone is closed. The 120Hz inner display is 7.1 inches diagonal and has a slightly landscape 9:8.4 aspect ratio, unlike the Z Fold display, which is taller when unfolded. This means you don’t have to rotate the phone 90 degrees (with the fold horizontal) to watch videos at their largest size. There are dual stereo speakers located at the bottom of the phone, too, which further improves the experience of quickly opening the phone up to watch a video.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m-nndZxBUp20mF0mJ7FCF9phG3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098015/IMG_1128.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Find N’s hinge lets the phone stay unfolded between 50 and 120 degrees.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JoK22U"&gt;The screen looks great. Lau confirmed that it’s a Samsung-made panel, but says Oppo has heavily customized it and holds its own patents. The screen is protected by UTG (ultra-thin glass) and Oppo rates it for 200,000 folds, the same as Samsung. The crease in the panel is wider but much less visible than in the Galaxy Z Fold 3 because it wraps around a unique teardrop-shaped hinge that Lau says is also heavily patented and costs $100 to build alone. Another benefit of this design is that the phone folds shut without leaving a gap between the two halves of the display. You can feel the crease under your finger, but it’s difficult to see in regular use from all but the widest of viewing angles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Yp2CI"&gt;The outer screen is much more like a regular smartphone than the Z Fold’s. At 5.49 inches with an aspect ratio of 2:1, it’s actually very usable — if it weren’t for the folded device being twice as thick as a regular phone, it’d feel like the compact Android flagship that no-one else is making. The hinge does make for a larger bezel on the left side of the screen, of course, but it’s not intrusive. My biggest complaint about the outer screen is that it’s only 60Hz, which wouldn’t necessarily be a problem but feels jarring when the bigger, much smoother inner screen is right there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dkm5lU786QVPT2JBjJ87YUqRewc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098016/IMG_1130.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Find N’s outer display works pretty much like a regular phone, albeit quite a small one.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J3Hw5a"&gt;The rest of the Find N’s spec sheet is what you’d expect from a 2021 Android flagship. There’s a Snapdragon 888 processor and up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The main camera is 50 megapixels, using the same Sony IMX766 sensor from the OnePlus 9 Pro and Oppo Find X3 Pro, and is joined by a 16-megapixel ultrawide and a 13-megapixel 2x telephoto. The battery is 4,500mAh and can be charged at 33W with a SuperVOOC cable or 15W wirelessly. There’s also 10W reverse wireless charging and standard Qi support. A fingerprint sensor is located in the power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OStCPU"&gt;Oppo isn’t quite as ambitious as Samsung with its custom software for multitasking, but there are a few gestures that help make the most of the bigger screen. You can pinch with four fingers to collapse a full-screen app into a smaller floating column, or split the screen in half with a two-finger swipe down. Oppo has also customized many of its own apps with features designed for the folding screen — for example, if you prop it open at an angle, the music app can display lyrics on the top half. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y3bCiHdLkmMLZJgsQj5XCWP8jFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098017/IMG_1127.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Find N’s back panel curves similarly to the Find X3 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8iBTGO"&gt;One obvious concern is durability, and it’s one that I can’t speak to after having had such a short time with the Find N. But I can speak to the design, and I think Oppo has a winner here. The Find N is sleek and easy to use whether it’s open or closed — it strikes the balance between both configurations better than any other foldable phone to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lx0hET"&gt;I would say that the Find N should have Samsung worried, but unfortunately Oppo is only going to sell it in China, a country where Samsung phones have almost no presence. It’ll go on sale from December 23rd for a surprisingly low price of 7,699 yuan (about $1,200) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. 8,999 yuan (about $1,400) gets you a 12GB/512GB model. For comparison, the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at 8,999 yuan in China, so while the Find N isn’t exactly cheap it’s well within mainstream flagship phone territory. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, meanwhile, starts at $1,799 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gk6wc5"&gt;T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356978/t-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv"&gt;TVision streaming service was not long for this world&lt;/a&gt;, but its name lives on in the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fservices%2Fhub&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F14%2F22834584%2Ft-mobile-tvision-hub-google-tv-chromecast-dongle-ethernet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TVision Hub&lt;/a&gt; — a $50 dongle with Google TV. It appears to function a lot like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Google’s own Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, but along with some T-Mobile branding, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/14/tmobile-google-tv-ethernet-dongle/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; that it offers a feature you won’t find on Google’s streaming dongle: an ethernet jack. That direct internet connection may be a real benefit if your home Wi-Fi signal isn’t quite up to the task of streaming 4K video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38xndx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/12/t-mobile-releases-new-tvision-hub-for-some-reason/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spotted the device last week on T-Mobile’s website, which is a new version of the streaming dongle launched with the TVision service. It comes with a remote bearing Netflix, YouTube, and Google Assistant buttons and connects with accessories like game controllers and headphones via Bluetooth or USB-C. Like Chromecast, it supports 4K HDR streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2Ke8J"&gt;T-Mobile (probably wisely) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356978/t-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv"&gt;shuttered its streaming TV subscription service&lt;/a&gt; just six months after it launched, opting instead to partner with YouTube TV and Philo. While the service is gone, it seems that the company wasn’t ready to let go of the TVision branding. The TVision Hub is available now for $50 and is offered free with a new home internet line. &lt;/p&gt;
