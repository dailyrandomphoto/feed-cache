    <title>LG had few smartphone hits, but it’ll still be missed</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The US smartphone market just got more boring&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Y5UJKG"&gt;If you’re reading this on a phone, chances are, LG didn’t make it. The Korean tech giant has been losing money and market share with its smartphone division for years, so it wasn’t a surprise when it finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;announced plans to pull the plug&lt;/a&gt; today. You could be forgiven for shrugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmkhG2"&gt;But LG deserves to be remembered as more than just an also-ran. Its phones were rarely big hits, much less often the kind of polished product we’d ever recommend to most over its competitors. Despite this, LG did introduce several features and innovations that the phone world would be worse off without. The company was the first to put ultrawide cameras on its phones, for example, and it pioneered the kind of all-screen, no-button smartphone designs that dominate the market today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2q0XAn"&gt;And particularly in the US, where Android competition is extremely low, the loss of LG will only further entrench the Apple-Samsung duopoly at the high end. LG is the third-biggest phone vendor in the US, with roughly 10 percent of market share, although much of that was midrange prepaid devices sold through carrier stores. LG might not have been at the top of your smartphone shopping list, but if you live in the US, that list just got a lot more boring.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EM9ZNj"&gt;LG did have some claim to being a tastemaker in the pre-smartphone world. Its Chocolate and enV phones were stylish devices that helped LG expand its brand recognition around the world. But after the iPhone and Android changed everything, LG struggled to adapt. I’m duty-bound here to mention the original LG Prada, which had a capacitive touchscreen and was technically announced just before the iPhone, but its true legacy is mostly people pointing that out in online comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYXO5w"&gt;LG’s early Android phones weren’t impressive. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/7/2613319/lg-nitro-hd-review"&gt;2011 Nitro HD&lt;/a&gt;, for example, was its first splashy flagship device in a long time, but it was saddled with outdated, clunky software and poor battery life. Its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/15/3506326/lg-optimus-g-review-att-sprint"&gt;Optimus G&lt;/a&gt;, represented a degree of refinement, and by the time the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/19/4749116/lg-g2-review"&gt;G2&lt;/a&gt; came along in 2012, LG’s new G-series was a fairly credible alternative to the likes of Samsung or HTC. The G2 was one of the first flagship smartphones to attempt to cut down on bezel size, for example, and LG made on-screen buttons a core part of its design long before most others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1SuOX"&gt;It was also around this time that LG found a new partner in Google, releasing two Nexus phones in a row. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/2/3589280/google-nexus-4-review"&gt;2012 Nexus 4&lt;/a&gt; was built around the guts of the Optimus G, and it had its fans despite its crippling lack of LTE, weak battery life, and unimpressive camera. The next year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5062724/google-nexus-5-review"&gt;Nexus 5&lt;/a&gt; found an even stronger cult following despite it too having a poor camera and bad battery life. (The red version did look great, and the $349 price didn’t hurt.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The modular LG G5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qnZFVc"&gt;LG’s mobile division kept on ticking on, turning out respectable phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/4/5778556/lg-g3-review"&gt;G3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8559275/lg-g4-review"&gt;G4&lt;/a&gt; without ever really challenging Samsung. The software was still a heavy-handed customization of Android, and LG continued to lag behind peers with its pace of updates, but the hardware was solid. It was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;2016 G5&lt;/a&gt; where things really started to fall apart. Designed around a series of swappable modular accessories called “Friends,” the phone flopped, and LG quickly pretended it never happened. Suffice it to say that if you bought a camera grip or a DAC Hi-Fi audio accessory for your G5, it wouldn’t be able to make Friends with 2017’s G6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8fON0"&gt;It’s unfortunate that LG focused on gimmicks with the G5 because that phone did introduce one new feature that would become ubiquitous in the smartphone market years later: the ultrawide camera. Ultrawides on smartphones let people capture pictures that were previously restricted to camera gearheads, and it’s hard to imagine buying a new phone without one today. But it took a long time for other phone makers to figure out the utility; Apple introduced its first in 2019, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Woc3q"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/31/13462608/lg-v20-review-price-specs-android"&gt;V20&lt;/a&gt;, released the same year as the G5, had another unique feature that would become a hallmark of the company’s phones for years: an honest-to-God headphone jack in the year that Apple decided to ditch it. And not just any headphone jack — one that worked with a built-in quad DAC designed to boost sound quality and appeal to audiophiles. Did this sell many phones? Well, no. But it became a hallmark of LG’s high-end devices ever since, providing an option for wired headphone enthusiasts who despaired as other phone makers followed Apple’s lead one by one. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG G6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VLvRLb"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15188830/lg-g6-2017-review-phone-specs"&gt;2017 G6&lt;/a&gt; got the G-series back on track. It was the first major smartphone released with a now-familiar taller aspect ratio, with an even stronger focus on eliminating bezels than ever before. Of course, not many people noticed as Samsung followed immediately with the similar but sleeker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus"&gt;Galaxy S8&lt;/a&gt; and its “Infinity Display.” Later that year, LG released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/16/16457544/lg-v30-review-design"&gt;V30&lt;/a&gt;, which had a completely new (and very nice) design, but it’s always going to be a hard sell when your most differentiated feature is your (also very nice) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/29/17175466/android-haptic-feedback-is-bad-why"&gt;haptics system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6m3Wv"&gt;From here on out, LG’s flagship phones mostly blurred into one. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/22/17363182/lg-g7-thinq-review-android-phone-price-specs"&gt;G7&lt;/a&gt; was a pretty good facsimile of an iPhone X, even winning an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17591130/editors-choice-lg-g7-thinq-phone-review"&gt;Editor’s Choice designation&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Dan Seifert. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17933558/lg-v40-thinq-review-cameras-5-features-battery-screen-photo-quality"&gt;V40&lt;/a&gt; pioneered the now-common triple-camera setup. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939655/lg-g8x-thinq-dual-screen-review"&gt;G8X&lt;/a&gt; came with a dual-screen case that, in hindsight, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; really didn’t improve much upon a year later. But all of these phones looked basically identical to each other, and none of their key features were viewed as much more than gimmicks at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3a22s"&gt;For every good idea LG had, there’d be something pointless like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18301982/lg-g8-thinq-review-android-phone-snapdragon-855-6-gb-ram-z-camera-sensor"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt;’s vein-sensing “Hand ID” unlock. Despite the company making a big &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/12/17228306/lg-android-software-upgrade-center-research-development"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; about a new Software Upgrade Center to increase the pace of Android updates, nothing changed. And in the face of Samsung’s unstoppable marketing machine, LG’s best attempt at a brand identity was to add “ThinQ” to the name of each flagship phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JHoh1o_5HPFW71nrvu716UduAJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990610/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0007.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Wing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9esvuM"&gt;In its final year, LG’s mobile division did move to address its problems. The Explorer Project was intended to produce more innovative designs, like the beautiful but underpowered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304097/lg-velvet-phone-review-price-us-specs-camera"&gt;Velvet&lt;/a&gt; and the oddball dual-screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;Wing&lt;/a&gt;. At CES this year, the company announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;Rollable&lt;/a&gt; concept phone that it said it planned to take to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky42vU"&gt;That’ll never happen now, and it’s hard to say it’s a huge loss with companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/23/22296817/oppo-mid-air-wireless-charging-x-2021-concept-phone-xiaomi-motorola"&gt;Oppo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;TCL&lt;/a&gt; likely to pick up the slack with their own versions. But in the context of the US phone market, there’s going to be fewer choices, and whoever ends up accounting for LG’s lost market share is unlikely to be as creative a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="AZzaNR"&gt;LG’s phones were rarely, if ever, the best available, but the company did make a significant impact on the smartphone world at large. With its mobile division’s demise, the US market becomes even more homogenous.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG is quitting the smartphone business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wxQw9UvVgTlqt6MyuZMD5HGOn7E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69075601/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Wing was a uniquely designed device released last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6TTSk0"&gt;LG is exiting the smartphone business, the company confirmed today. The decision will “enable the company to focus resources in growth areas such as electric vehicle components, connected devices, smart homes, robotics, artificial intelligence and business-to-business solutions, as well as platforms and services,” LG said in a &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/04/lg-to-close-mobile-phone-business-worldwide/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Xy9US"&gt;Existing phones will remain on sale, and LG says it’ll continue to support its products “for a period of time which will vary by region.” The company hasn’t said anything about possible layoffs except that “details related to employment will be determined at the local level.” LG says it expects to have completed the business’ closure by the end of July this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ueOwC"&gt;The move has been rumored for several months, following the division’s huge losses over the past five years. Once considered a rival to fellow South Korean manufacturer Samsung, LG’s recent high-end smartphones have struggled to compete, while its more affordable handsets have faced stiff competition from Chinese rivals. The company had previously said it hoped to make its smartphone division &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058238/lg-smartphone-profitable-2021-apple-samsung-ces-mwc"&gt;profitable in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moPpjV"&gt;Today’s news means LG’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436954/lg-extendable-sliding-phone-teaser-explorer-project-wing-mobile"&gt;long-teased rollable phone&lt;/a&gt; is unlikely to ever see the light of day. The last time the company showed off the device was back at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;this year’s virtual CES&lt;/a&gt; when the company insisted that the device was real and would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;launching later this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UbwMax"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An attempt to sell the division reportedly failed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bt7zVh"&gt;Reports that LG has been considering exiting smartphones have been around since at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240282/lg-smartphone-business-exit-2021-internal-memo"&gt;the beginning of this year&lt;/a&gt;. Although a company spokesperson branded an earlier report about the company’s potential exit from the smartphone business “&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/15/no-lg-isnt-exiting-the-smartphone-business/"&gt;completely false and without merit,&lt;/a&gt;” an LG official later &lt;a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210120000992"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Korea Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;company had to make “a cold judgment” about the division. Potential measures could include “sale, withdrawal and downsizing of the smartphone business,” the official said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7TzZp"&gt;In March, reports emerged that the company had tried to find a buyer for its smartphone business, but that talks had stalled and it could instead shut down the division. &lt;a href="https://www.donga.com/news/article/all/20210321/106003359/1"&gt;Korean outlet &lt;em&gt;DongA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said the company had ceased development of its upcoming phones with rollable displays, and that it had shelved its planned smartphones for the first half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdnmaa"&gt;As it lost share to rivals, LG released a series of eye-catching devices with unusual form-factors. There was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt;, whose main display rotated to reveal a smaller secondary screen beneath it, or its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939655/lg-g8x-thinq-dual-screen-review"&gt;dual screen&lt;/a&gt; devices. LG also tried its hand at a modular smartphone with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;LG G5&lt;/a&gt;, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;abandon the initiative a year later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VG07jS"&gt;Unfortunately for LG, none of these features were useful enough to turn the phones into mainstream hits, and meanwhile the company’s more traditional handsets fell behind their rivals in core areas like camera performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEkq67"&gt;LG joins a long list of high-profile device makers to give up on smartphones over the years, although many of the brand names have stuck around on devices made by third-party manufacturers. Nokia’s consumer-facing brand lives on atop handsets made by HMD, while Blackberry’s branding was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21120107/tcl-blackberry-ends-phone-global-rights-date-2020"&gt;initially used by TCL&lt;/a&gt; and is set to return this year on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375026/5g-blackberry-phone-android-physical-keyboard-2021-release-date"&gt;device made by OnwardMobility&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also HTC, which still sells a few oddball handsets but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16340108/google-htc-smartphone-team-acquisition-announced"&gt;sold most of its IP to Google in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Who’s next?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tencent-owned studio behind Call of Duty: Mobile reportedly earned $10 billion in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7-0H-GxUrLNW0eqrbK9rbZEA0A=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69075061/Screen_Shot_2021_04_04_at_2.11.26_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L4jX9l"&gt;TiMi Studios, the Tencent-owned developer of huge mobile hits &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; and the MOBA &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings, &lt;/em&gt;earned a staggering $10 billion in revenue in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-videogames-exclusive-idUSKBN2BP0FG"&gt;according to an April 1st &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="490xCa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;’ article says those earnings make TiMi the “world’s largest developer,” according to its sources. While it’s unclear exactly what metric that is defining, it’s a undoubtably a huge number. For comparison, Activision Blizzard (which publishes the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; franchise) &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-fourth-quarter-and-2020-financial"&gt;posted 2020 revenues of $8.09 billion&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $2 billion &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than TiMi’s reported $10 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1aWxPN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TiMi’s games are some of the biggest in the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UEjgq5"&gt;While TiMi might not be a household name, its games are some of the biggest in the world. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; reportedly had the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"&gt;biggest mobile game launch ever&lt;/a&gt; when it released in October 2019, racking up over 100 million downloads worldwide in its first week of availability. And &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt;, which is only available in China, had an astounding 100 million &lt;em&gt;daily &lt;/em&gt;active users as of November 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-videogames-honorofkings/tencents-honor-of-kings-reports-100-million-daily-users-expands-into-new-genres-idUSKBN27H1HX"&gt;according to Tencent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0F4qf"&gt;It doesn’t seem like Tencent and TiMi will be resting on their laurels. TiMi is recruiting for a new AAA game that “resembles the virtual community from the movie &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;,” &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports, which seems to suggest TiMi wants to make its own metaverse-like game in the vein of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Tencent is also building a TiMi studio in Los Angeles, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEjDRn"&gt;Tencent has long-standing investments in some US-based gaming companies. It bought a &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2011/02/04/chinas-tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-online-game-firm-riot-games-for-more-than-350m/"&gt;majority stake&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot Games in 2011 and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/17/10410952/riot-games-league-of-legends-acquired-tencent"&gt;full ownership&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. And Tencent purchased &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/21/4131702/tencents-epic-games-stock-acquisition"&gt;40 percent of Epic Games in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, a stake that grown in value significantly following the huge success of Epic’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nYNS4"&gt;Tencent is also&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the owner of the studio Lightspeed &amp;amp; Quantum, which develops &lt;em&gt;PUBG: Mobile. &lt;/em&gt;That game has also been a smash hit and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350782/pubg-mobile-one-billion-downloads-tencent"&gt;just crossed more than 1 billion downloads worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish is begging authorities for help with T-Mobile’s CDMA shutdown looming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dish CES 2013 stock 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vKWoSSF8sVyWpIq_kz0p6q6tTao=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068243/20130110-625A1517VERGE.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boost Mobile, owned by Dish Network, serves 9 million customers — more than half of which rely on the older CDMA network.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CY4Z8b"&gt;Dish Network issued a new letter to the Federal Communications Commission this week, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-tmobile-network-shutdown-fcc-466e406c-db9d-4318-8cec-3579a54fdf04.html"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the urgent situation it faces if T-Mobile moves ahead with its planned January 2022 CDMA network shutdown. “We believe that T-Mobile’s actions raise significant competition and public interest concerns,” the letter states. It would be a blow to Dish’s business, but most importantly, millions of Boost Mobile customers would feel the impact as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPWrRn"&gt;Boost Mobile, a former Sprint MVNO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632376/boost-mobile-sale-sprint-tmobile-merger-approval-promise"&gt;sold to Dish&lt;/a&gt; as part of T-Mobile’s acquisition, serves 9 million customers. According to the letter, more than half of them rely on CDMA service. Its prepaid service is an accessible alternative to contract plans for low-income customers; there’s no credit check required or even a credit card. Customers can pay for phones and service at retailers like Walmart and top them off as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y9BNlO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boost customers may not necessarily even have an email registered with the company&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e1N4zX"&gt;It makes for an appealing service if the costs and contracts of major carrier plans are prohibitive, but it’s also what makes migrating these customers to a newer network uniquely challenging. Boost customers may not necessarily even have an email registered with the company, and those still using slower 3G CDMA devices are likely doing so not because they prefer it, but because they can’t afford a new phone. In less than a year, they’ll be forced to choose between making that purchase or losing their current cell service altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9poK8v"&gt;Bearing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/10/21207520/coronavirus-deaths-economy-layoffs-inequality-covid-pandemic"&gt;disproportionate effects of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and related economic fallout, it’s likely not a great time for these customers to be shopping for a new phone. Dish also points out that the global chip shortage makes it an especially bad time to try to secure a large number of new devices for customers. Overall, the company’s letter to the FCC makes quite clear how dire the situation is in its view: “A forced migration of this scale under this accelerated time frame is simply not possible and will leave potentially millions of Boost subscribers disenfranchised and without cell service come January 1, 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w4StEr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A forced migration of this scale under this accelerated time frame is simply not possible”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHOBXK"&gt;As part of the Sprint merger, T-Mobile agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708411/dish-tmobile-sprint-carrer-merger-assets-spectrum-boost"&gt;help set Dish up as the US’s fourth wireless carrier&lt;/a&gt;, and selling the prepaid Boost business to Dish was one step in that plan. However, in late 2020, T-Mobile notified Dish that it would be shutting down the CDMA network that many Boost customers use in early 2022, several years earlier than Dish had anticipated. It’s a move the company has been quick to call anti-competitive, both in &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/dish-chairman-calls-out-t-mobile-for-being-anticompetitive_id130387"&gt;previous communications&lt;/a&gt; and in this latest letter to the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyXfQq"&gt;T-Mobile doesn’t see things the same way. It isn’t technically violating the agreement by doing so, and in the company’s view, it has given Dish plenty of notice. Here’s what it had to say in a statement on the matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="S0FHwM"&gt;Everything we are doing here is exactly consistent with the agreement that DISH made with us a year and a half ago, and we have been very proactive and transparent about the timing for this transition with all of our MVNOs, including DISH. We gave DISH notice in October 2020 for a January 1st 2022 transition – far more than the required 6-month contractual agreement. Our agreement with DISH is also clear that they are responsible for migrating Boost customers, just as we are responsible for migrating Sprint customers, and we are confident that DISH is already making plans to take good care of their impacted customers prior to the transition date. Given the advance notice that they received, just a small percentage of Boost customers should need to upgrade their handsets by the end of this year, and typically those customers would be supported with incentives and promotions to get their handsets upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tn11Sl"&gt;In fact, the company is taking a kind of victory lap on the anniversary of the acquisition with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fceo-mike-sievert-merger-year-1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F2%2F22364126%2Fboost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new post on its blog&lt;/a&gt;, celebrating the 5G network it’s been able to build with Sprint’s former spectrum. Based on the tone of this latest letter to the FCC, it’s a celebratory mood that Dish certainly doesn’t share.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 foldable phone just got $200 cheaper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQWphspry895a1K8QTAAZaRLqfk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067145/vpavic_200907_4181_0017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jvTWM2"&gt;Samsung is dropping the price of its ultra-premium &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G&lt;/a&gt; by $200, bringing the foldable smartphone &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/preview/5d6ef31c-d5e1-4577-86ca-3587c4c936df?large"&gt;down to $1,799.99&lt;/a&gt; compared to its initial $1,999.99 launch MRSP. Even after the price cut, the Z Fold 2 5G will still cost you more than flagships from pretty much all of Samsung’s competitors, but it’s perhaps the best folding phone yet — and it certainly offers functionality that traditional handsets can’t match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9oFCyS"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Galaxy Z Fold 2 review: an extravagant success|95267" data-volume-uuid="ba0c11907" data-volume-id="95267" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-1" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AbuHMN"&gt;The new lower price is available for &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold2-5g/buy/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the unlocked model&lt;/a&gt; as well as carrier versions of the Z Fold 2 5G from Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T. Remember that Samsung is also now giving buyers of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 and Z Flip 5G &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297877/samsung-galaxy-z-fold2-z-flip-return-100-days-foldables-buy-and-try"&gt;an extended 100-day return policy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a show of confidence in this wave of foldables after the original Galaxy Fold got off to an infamously rocky start. Things got much better with the Z Fold 2 5G, which exudes quality that comes much closer to matching its cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgSoj9"&gt;Along with the reduced price, Samsung is introducing a referral program for Galaxy Z owners. If you already own one of Samsung’s latest folding phones and have sold someone else on buying in, you can give them a referral code that’ll save them $100 off their purchase and earn you $100 in credit at Samsung’s online store. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony will announce its next Xperia phone on April 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pOBNYcj159g5nednwfgqgMGRU7s=/342x0:4040x2465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69064144/1iiiresized.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alleged leaked renders of the upcoming Xperia 1 III.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4RFZqA"&gt;Sony has, in a very low-key way, just announced that its upcoming Xperia event will be on April 14th (&lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/04/01/sony-xperia-announcement-scheduled-for-april-14/"&gt;via D&lt;em&gt;roid Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The news comes from the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SonyXperia/featured"&gt;Xperia YouTube channel’s&lt;/a&gt; banner, where it lays out that there will be a new product announcement happening at 4:30PM Japan Standard Time — that’s 3:30AM EST, or 12:30AM PT (if you feel like burning the midnight oil to watch live). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCpQFG"&gt;The banner gives no real hints as to what will be announced, but there have been a few rumors floating around — one about a new flagship, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254722/sony-xperia-1-iii-leak-periscope-camera"&gt;the Xperia 1 III&lt;/a&gt;, and one about the return of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248890/sony-xperia-compact-2021-android-phone-leak-rumor-size"&gt;Xperia Compact&lt;/a&gt;, which could end up being an Android answer to the iPhone Mini. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H6oaUnRBgiSMcn8nkr7ID0I7pFY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22414885/channels4_banner.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PUguwx"&gt;It’s worth noting that there are &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/sony-xperia-1-iii-launch-1214221/"&gt;other rumors&lt;/a&gt; that mention new versions of the Xperia 5 and 10, leaving out the Compact entirely. But pretty much every rumor indicates that we’ll see a new entry in the flagship &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322518/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-smartphone-new-camera-photo-pro"&gt;Xperia 1 line&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254722/sony-xperia-1-iii-leak-periscope-camera"&gt;Leaks indicate&lt;/a&gt; that the 1 III will have a periscope zoom lens, and &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/sony-xperia-1-iii-specs-and-features-leaked-and-theyre-impressive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techradar&lt;/em&gt; recently published&lt;/a&gt; what could be the full specs. It’s mostly what’s expected from a flagship Android phone: Snapdragon 888, 12GB of memory, 5G, and a 4K 120Hz screen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzAYUR"&gt;It’s probably a safe bet that if there’s only one phone being announced (which is hinted at by the singular “product” in the image from Sony), the Xperia 1 III would be it — the 1 line seems to be on a yearly cycle. The Compact is much more of a wildcard — the last time Sony released a “Compact” branded phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/23/17044006/sony-xperia-xz2-compact-smartphones-leak-mwc-2018"&gt;was in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, though it does use the word to market the Xperia 5 II, with its 6.1-inch screen, which is around the same size as an iPhone 12 Pro or Galaxy S21. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248890/sony-xperia-compact-2021-android-phone-leak-rumor-size"&gt;The rumors&lt;/a&gt; for a 2021 version of the Compact say that it’ll have a 5.5-inch display, which is only a tiny bit bigger than the screen on an iPhone Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqzWwU"&gt;Both potential phones are rumored to come with headphone jacks. As for what we’ll actually see on the day, only time will tell — but thankfully there’s not much of it left.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Caterpillar is bringing its newest rugged phone to the US for $699</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ohv_sJx9yqXWNzAhpUUVI6kRuXI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059447/cat_s62_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An integrated thermal imaging camera is a central feature on the S62.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Cat Phones&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mI8RHq"&gt;The Cat S62 Pro — and that’s Cat as in Caterpillar, the construction company — is now available in the US. The rugged smartphone is the latest device to feature Cat branding (it’s technically a product of licensee Bullitt Group) and builds on its predecessors’ integrated thermal camera capabilities. It’s designed with construction and industrial workers in mind,  and at $699, it’s a more attractively priced follow up to 2018’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/22/17039758/thermal-camera-caterpillar-s61-update-s60-smartphone-android-price"&gt;S61&lt;/a&gt;, which debuted in the US at $899.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tQ7qG"&gt;Introduced last summer for sale in the UK, the S62 Pro features solid (if not super competitive) phone specs, which isn’t guaranteed in the rugged phone class. You’ll get a 5.7-inch 1080p display, a Snapdragon 660 processor with 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 4,000mAh battery. But unlike mainstream midrange devices launching now, you won’t get 5G connectivity or Android 11 pre-installed; it ships with Android 10 and Cat says it will provide an update to 11. While the S62 Pro is significantly less expensive than its predecessor, it no longer offers the air quality and distance measurement sensors, and uses a slightly smaller battery (compared to 4,500mAh).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cat Phones S62 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9w7SZ13qLHkZKeaeDZSIFj2S2M0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411956/cat_s62_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Cat Phones&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1f4rhd"&gt;That’s the boring stuff. The exciting bits that the S62 Pro has to offer include its marquee feature: a built-in Flir thermal imaging camera with four times as many thermal pixels as its predecessor. The phone offers new modes that allow users to adjust and blend overlaid information from the standard 12-megapixel camera, providing more context to the thermal image. There’s also an option to set an alarm that will notify you when a certain temperature level is detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Lgww6"&gt;As for its rugged credentials, the S62 Pro is rated at IP68 and IP69: the first indicates that it’s safe to submerge in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes, the second that it can withstand high pressure spray. The company says it’s been tested against even harsher conditions than this, but is warrantied to the level of those official IP ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S62 is built to withstand harsh work environments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vQnKfY"&gt;It can withstand drops of up to six feet onto a steel surface, and its Gorilla Glass 6 screen is bolstered by an additional factory-fitted screen protector. The S62 Pro also meets requirements of the MIL-STD-810 military standard, including vibration and thermal shock resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCjmVl"&gt;The S62 Pro isn’t currently available through any of the major US carriers, but is being offered unlocked &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.catphones.com%2Fen-us%2Fcat-s62-pro-smartphone%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F1%2F22360767%2Fcaterpillar-s62-pro-us-availability-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Cat phones&lt;/a&gt; and third parties including Amazon and Home Depot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter now lets you add stickers to Fleets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u_IVEvgAr1baU7UUnbGCn82UiGk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057753/Screen_Shot_2021_03_31_at_4.46.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yjTLCq"&gt;Twitter is adding stickers to its ephemeral, Snapchat Stories-like Fleets, the social media company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1377387235952181251"&gt;announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Stickers are available for users on both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ep3v6w"&gt;When you’re making a Fleet, you’ll be able to add stickers by tapping the smiley face icon on the bottom row of your screen. When you do, you’ll see a collection of Twitter-made animated stickers and emoji (the latter of which Twitter calls “Twemoji”). And if you search for something in the search bar at the top of the screen, Twitter will pull up GIFs sourced from Tenor and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21259965/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-buy-instagram-integration-cost"&gt;Facebook-owned Giphy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fjgQvo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Your Fleets just got an upgrade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now you can express yourself in the conversation with stickers. Add GIFs and Twemojis to a Fleet by tapping the   icon, on Android and iOS. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ihh9ZZh70a"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ihh9ZZh70a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1377387235952181251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iVxCKM"&gt;If you’ve ever used stickers on Snapchat or Instagram, this new feature should feel quite familiar to you. That said, the feature might feel so familiar because both Snapchat and Instagram have offered it for years. But Twitter is still in early days with Fleets, which only became available to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570368/twitter-fleets-disapeating-tweets-stories-launch-available-now"&gt;everyone back in November&lt;/a&gt;, so perhaps stickers are just a first sign of more additions to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon insists it will give you up to $1,000 in trade-in credits for your broken phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y0ZsK7"&gt;April Fools Day is at hand, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fyou-broke-your-phone-so-verizon-breaking-rules&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360418%2Fverizon-april-fools-day-trade-in-broken-cracked-water-damage-phone-android-iphone-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon has willingly stepped into the fray&lt;/a&gt; with a deal that seems too good to be true — especially for people who have a broken, useless phone. The US carrier insists that starting tomorrow, April 1st, customers can trade in an “old, cracked, or water damaged phone” for up to $1,000 off a new 5G phone, like an &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/vergeVerizonInsists03312021/https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-12/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/vergeVerizonInsists03312021/https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt;. The promo doesn’t extend to phones with battery damage (for safety concerns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSJ3xR"&gt;You’ll get the most out of this deal if you’re on a different carrier and looking to open a new line and port your number into Verizon’s network. But current customers can reap some savings, too. You can find out the value of your phone online or at any of its retail stores, although if you plan to visit in-person, the company encourages you to make an appointment on its &lt;a href="http://vzw.com/stores"&gt;store locator page&lt;/a&gt; or through the My Verizon app. The offer &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2Fonline%2F5g-cell-phones%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360418%2Fverizon-april-fools-day-trade-in-broken-cracked-water-damage-phone-android-iphone-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will go live on this page&lt;/a&gt; starting April 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8KQTct"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Trust us — this offer is #NoJoke”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XuZgYa"&gt;So, here’s the fine print (there’s a lot of it, but it’s worth trudging through if you think you may want to try for the deal):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RWnyZj"&gt;Eligibility requires upgrading, or adding a new line and porting a number, to one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans with 5G&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0Qa1a0"&gt;For new lines and phone number port-ins, or current customers porting a line from a different network: you can get a $300 Verizon e-gift card for an iPhone trade-in, or a $200 card for an Android phone (sent to you within eight weeks after transaction)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="74npNW"&gt;Stacked on that for new lines and port-ins (and also applicable for current customers who want to add a line, but not port in a number): you’ll get up to $700 in monthly credits sent your way for an iPhone trade-in, or up to $800 for a qualified Android phone (sent to you as a credit each month over a 24-month period)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cZ2zUm"&gt;If you’re simply upgrading your phone, but only have a broken phone to trade, Verizon will give you up to $440 in savings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="W8wz5J"&gt;There’s no limit as to how many people per account can trade in broken phones to take advantage of the deal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aO7Q6A"&gt;This is a “limited time” offer, but Verizon didn’t share when it will end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1qxg1k"&gt;Once all is said and done, you’ll eventually have a $300 Verizon credit sitting on your account, and / or an additional credit coming your way each month, which will lower the cost of your monthly bill. It won’t make the investment of buying a pricey, new 5G phone any less steep upfront, but it’ll soften the blow a little by spreading the credits out over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndZWHu"&gt;Verizon didn’t share exactly how much trade-in value every phone has, but it offered a list of phones that are in a “higher value” category and others that will fetch a “lower value.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Verizon trade in" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ew0cMFeYfkZ0u5p2VZK_24dWIEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410998/verizontrade.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, that’s right — Verizon will take your RED Hydrogen One as if that never happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UykTyw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 3:00PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Verizon responded to &lt;/em&gt;The Verge’&lt;em&gt;s request for clarification on a few points, including how many people can take advantage of this promo within a single account, when the promo will end, and how the credits received differ depending on whether you’re a new or current customer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
