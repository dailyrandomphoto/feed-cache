    <title>Put Baby Yoda on your wrist with Vodafone and Disney’s Neo smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S11oSF"&gt;European mobile carrier Vodafone has partnered with Disney to launch a new wearable for kids called &lt;a href="https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/press-release/vodafone-unveils-neo-the-game-changing-smart-watch-designed-for-kids-and-featuring-iconic-characters-from-disney-pixar-marvel-and-star-wars/"&gt;the Neo&lt;/a&gt;. Vodafone says the Neo combines its technological capabilities with Disney’s entertainment chops to offer a wearable that gives kids a sense of independence while letting parents stay in contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUL28t"&gt;The Neo’s most notable feature is its Disney branding. The Yves Béhar-designed watch lets kids choose from a collection of “Sidekicks” that will hang out on the main clock screen, including The Child / Baby Yoda / Grogu from &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, Buzz Lightyear from &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;, and Minnie Mouse. Vodafone says the Sidekicks will animate throughout the day, and the company plans to add more characters over time at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgVeLJ8M96k5GiI0TNnLACTmlzk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137589/1300x910_uk.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the Neo smartwatch with the Vodafone Smart app for controlling privacy settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MgtV38"&gt;Besides the injection of Disney charm, the Neo is mostly focused on keeping parents in touch with their kids, with a few added smartwatch features (though all of this requires a Vodafone subscription). With the watch, parents can call, text, and get updates on their kid’s location from the companion Vodafone Smart app. Parents can use the same app to create a “circle” of trusted contacts for texting and calling and limit screen time with Quiet Mode. To boost kid’s “independence,” the Neo can also receive calendar updates, check the weather, track activity, and take photos with a built-in 5-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F012Ev"&gt;Wearables for kids are not a new category, and plenty of other mobile carriers like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Ftimex-familyconnect%3Fsku%3D610214661166&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22056770%2Fdisney-vodafone-neo-smartwatch-children-yves-behar-star-wars-baby-yoda#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fverizon-gizmowatch-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22056770%2Fdisney-vodafone-neo-smartwatch-children-yves-behar-star-wars-baby-yoda#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; offer takes on the idea. Even Apple has gotten into the game with Family Setup in watchOS 7, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21518711/apple-watch-family-setup-test-review-features-explainer"&gt;we looked at earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The problems with smartwatches for kids are twofold: parents have to decide how much of their child’s privacy they’re willing to sacrifice to keep them safe, and usually, these watches aren’t very great in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqWeov"&gt;Vodafone says the Neo won’t be released in Europe until early 2021, where it should retail for £99 with £7-a-month subscription. If the Neo’s specific Disney wrapper piques your family’s interest, you can &lt;a href="https://eshop.v.vodafone.com/uk/neo-smart-kids-watch"&gt;sign up for the waitlist today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 promises faster speeds, better cameras, and more powerful AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6a14hgx76gzOvv3hgM8fBuQEU0o=/0x0:9504x6336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68344585/Snapdragon_888_Reference_Design.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z9hSKi"&gt;Qualcomm teased the Snapdragon 888, its latest 5G-equipped flagship smartphone processor, on the first day of its Snapdragon Tech Summit. But at the day two keynote, the company provided all of the details on the new chipset, which will be the brains powering almost every major 2021 Android flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9KveO"&gt;First off, the basic specs: the new processor will feature Qualcomm’s new Kryo 680 CPU, which will be one of the first devices to feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;Arm’s latest customized Cortex-X1 core&lt;/a&gt; and promises up to 25 percent higher performance than last year’s chip with a maximum clock speed of 2.84GHz. And the company’s new Adreno 660 GPU promises a 35 percent jump on graphics rendering, in what it says is the biggest performance leap for its GPUs yet. The new CPU and GPU are also more power-efficient compared to those on the Snapdragon 875, with a 25 percent improvement for the Kyro 680 and a 20 percent improvement on the Adreno 660.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LIPU5J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;25 percent faster CPU and the biggest GPU performance jump yet for Qualcomm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vYhpfn"&gt;Another key difference between the Snapdragon 888 and last year’s 865 is that Qualcomm has finally integrated its 5G modem directly into the SoC. That means manufacturers won’t have to deal with finding the space (and power) for a second external modem. Specifically, the Snapdragon 888 will feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142381/qualcomm-x60-modem-5g-phones-faster-power-efficient-5nm-carrier"&gt;Qualcomm’s 5nm X60 modem&lt;/a&gt;, which the company announced back in February, and it will enable better carrier aggregation and download speeds up to 7.5 Gbps on new devices. The Snapdragon 888 will also support Wi-Fi 6 as well as the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;6GHz Wi-Fi 6E standard&lt;/a&gt;, which should boost that rollout by making it the default on most Android flagships. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LdtnwNqp5q7047kNwkKFGZ0I_VY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137067/Snapdragon_888_Mockup.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OTWpU2"&gt;As is tradition for a Snapdragon update, Qualcomm is also putting a big emphasis on its camera improvements. The new Spectra 580 ISP is the first from Qualcomm to feature a triple ISP, allowing it to do things like capture three simultaneous 4K HDR video streams or three 28-megapixel photos at once at up to 2.7 gigapixels per second (35 percent faster than last year). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SViRM7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Capture three simultaneous 4K HDR video streams at once&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G0tDND"&gt;It also offers improved burst capabilities and is capable of capturing up to 120 photos in a single second at a 10-megapixel resolution. Lastly, the upgraded ISP adds computational HDR to 4K videos, an improved low-light capture architecture, and the option to shoot photos in 10-bit color in HEIF. That said, it’ll be up to phone manufacturers to build cameras that can take advantage of the new features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsXwcb"&gt;The final major changes come in AI performance, thanks to Qualcomm’s new Hexagon 780 AI processor. The Snapdragon 888 features Qualcomm’s sixth-generation AI Engine, which it promises will help improve everything from computational photography to gaming to voice assistant performance. The Snapdragon 888 can perform 26 trillion operations per second (TOPS), compared to 15 TOPS on the Snapdragon 865, while delivering three times better power efficiency. Additionally, Qualcomm is promising big improvements in both scalar and tensor AI tasks as part of those upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4m24b"&gt;The Snapdragon 888 also features the second-generation Qualcomm Sensing Hub, a dedicated low-power AI processor for smaller hardware-based tasks, like identifying when you raise your phone to light up the display. The new second-gen Sensing Hub is dramatically improved, which means the phone will be able to rely less on the main Hexagon processor for those tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9agPT"&gt;All of this adds up to a substantial boost in Qualcomm’s — and therefore, nearly every Android flagship’s — capabilities for what our smartphones will be able to do. The first Snapdragon 888 smartphones are expected to show up in early 2021, which means it won’t be long before we’ll be able to try out the next generation of Android flagships for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor will power the Android flagships of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dHGWnY3DYG6pWSxWMVrDfyD_tRg=/0x0:4936x3291/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68042714/Snapdragon_888_Front_Chip_in_Studio__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y47fNj"&gt;Qualcomm has officially announced the Snapdragon 888 at its Snapdragon Tech Summit, offering a first look at its next-generation flagship smartphone processor. The 888 will power the next wave of 2021 Android flagships from companies like Samsung, OnePlus, LG, Sony, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zmJfw"&gt;In a first for the company’s top-of-the-line 8-series chipsets, the Snapdragon 888 is making a big improvement for 5G: it’ll finally offer a fully integrated 5G modem, unlike last year’s Snapdragon 865 (which required that manufacturers include a separate modem chip inside the cramped interior of a modern smartphone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OybY60"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The future of Android flagships is here&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z9hHpK"&gt;The Snapdragon 888 will feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142381/qualcomm-x60-modem-5g-phones-faster-power-efficient-5nm-carrier"&gt;Qualcomm’s X60 modem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-x60-5g-modem"&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, which jumps to a 5nm process for better power efficiency and improvements for 5G carrier aggregation across the mmWave and sub-6GHz bands of the spectrum. Between the new 5nm architecture and the power efficiency gains from an integrated modem, the new chip looks to offer some substantial battery improvements when it comes to 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvxQx3"&gt;In addition to the 5G improvements, Qualcomm also teased several other advances coming to the Snapdragon 888, including the company’s sixth-gen AI Engine (running on a “redesigned” Qualcomm Hexagon processor), which promises a big jump in performance and power efficiency for AI tasks. The Snapdragon 888 also will feature the “most significant upgrade in Qualcomm Adreno GPU performance,” though specifics on what kind of improvements are coming have yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58DDc6"&gt;Lastly, Qualcomm previewed new photography features that the Snapdragon 888 will enable, including the ability to shoot roughly 120 photos per second at 12-megapixel resolution, thanks to the updated ISP (which is up to 35 percent faster). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4He7pw"&gt;Per Qualcomm’s usual practice, today’s announcement is just a first look at the Snapdragon 888. A more comprehensive overview of the specs and improvements being offered with this year’s chipset will arrive in the Snapdragon Tech Summit’s second day of keynotes, on December 2nd. And given Qualcomm’s near-total dominance when it comes to providing chips for almost every major smartphone in the US, the debut of the Snapdragon 888 isn’t just a first look at Qualcomm’s latest advances: it’s a preview of what to expect from phones like Samsung’s Galaxy S21 lineup and other top Android phones for 2021, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vcAwx"&gt;We’ll have additional details on the Snapdragon 888 tomorrow as the summit continues, so check back for more information soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwtJRk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZVcYT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung rumored to discontinue Galaxy Note line, add stylus support to 2021 Galaxy S and Z Fold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Note20 smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VwJHtx68dVO66jyKz49HEDxIQUQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68042605/dbohn_200817_4133_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U09Ahm"&gt;Samsung will reportedly discontinue its Galaxy Note phone line in 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-smartphone-idUSKBN28B3U5"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as the company contends with falling demand for pricey smartphones caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the company is set to focus on its flagship Galaxy S lineup of phones, while Samsung’s foldable phones (like the Z Flip and Z Fold) will take the place of the Galaxy Note as Samsung’s more experimental premium devices, complete with an optional stylus accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBBCwD"&gt;The idea that Samsung would stop selling the Galaxy Note line of phones in favor of the Galaxy S models makes a lot of sense. In the earlier years of the Note, the two lines of phones were distinct: the Galaxy S models were smaller, more mainstream devices, while the comparatively massive Note lineup hewed closer to a tablet, complete with the iconic stylus that helped set it apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="U0rMBr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Note’s success in popularizing big-screened phones may have been its undoing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8aECpr"&gt;But the Note’s success in popularizing big-screened phones may have proved to be its undoing. When the original Galaxy Note was introduced in 2011, its then-massive 5.3-inch display let it tower over other phones, like the 4.3-inch Galaxy S II that Samsung had released in 2011. But fast-forward to 2020, and phones like the Galaxy S20 Ultra and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra are effectively competiting against each other for the same audience, with far more similar specs, screen sizes, and functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXfvlh"&gt;In an era where Samsung is already developing and shipping cheaper smartphones in mere months — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451701/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-price-release-date-specs-features"&gt;like the Galaxy S20 FE&lt;/a&gt;, which released earlier this year to directly respond to consumer demand for a lower-cost midrange phone that still offered some of Samsung’s more premium features — it’s hard to justify the existence of a second lineup of flagships. That’s especially true when the only real outlier that sets the Note apart today is the stylus, something that Samsung appears to be trickling down to the standard Galaxy S lineup in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V4d1ej"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In a world of giant smartphones, the Note doesn’t stand out anymore&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EPhDgg"&gt;The other factor is the Galaxy Note lineup just isn’t that special anymore. In prior years, Samsung used the Note to experiment with some of its bolder and more interesting new innovations and design changes. For instance, the Note lineup helped popularize the edge display and featured larger swappable batteries, an IR blaster, the removal of the microSD card slot, and several generations of influential Galaxy hardware design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDfYCB"&gt;But its role of Samsung’s futuristic test platform has been wholly usurped by foldable phones like the Galaxy Z Fold, which promise meaningfully bigger screens than the traditional Galaxy S and Note lineups and the kind of bold new hardware that used to be the calling card of the Note. Add a stylus — which Samsung is reportedly planning to offer as an optional accessory — and the Z Fold lineup is a practically perfect heir to the Note lineup’s unique strengths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whw2I7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple hires venture capitalist Josh Elman to help improve App Store discovery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Dg9xmdKPggJ8NEjsgETIPTJO84=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68035850/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5GQi5r"&gt;Apple has hired Josh Elman, a prominent venture capitalist and former vice president of product at stock-trading app Robinhood, to help it improve iOS app discovery in the App Store. Elman announced the news via his Twitter account on Monday, saying he’s also leaving his role as a board partner at the firm Greylock Partners and as a board member of prominent tech companies like Discord and Medium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4JjGX"&gt;Elman joining the App Store team may help improve the iPhone maker’s relationship with developers after a rather rough year in which Apple’s stewardship of the App Store has been called into question by critics, rivals, and regulators. For instance, Elman is previously a board member of and investor in Houseparty, the chat app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662708/epic-games-houseparty-acquisition-fortnite-video-chat"&gt;acquired by &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;creator Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ufVVsy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2/ I’m joining Apple to work on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; and help customers discover the best apps for them.&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Elman    (@joshelman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joshelman/status/1333471692438441984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AKLbWt"&gt;Epic is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;suing Apple&lt;/a&gt; over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from the App Store, and that’s only one of many controversies Apple has weathered over the last 12 months. Another is an ongoing European antitrust investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoFPZv"&gt;Apple more recently extended an olive branch to the app development community by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;announcing a new small business program earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; that will cut its standard 30 percent App Store commission in half for developers making less than $1 million per year. The company has also tried to compromise with a number of app developers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;most prominently Hey email client creator Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;, and tech rivals like Microsoft over complaints with certain App Store restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIO4tZ"&gt;Elman doesn’t mention whether he will be working at all on developer relations, but he does say he will be focused on helping “customers discover the best apps for them.” Regardless, given his standing in the VC and software industries and his ability to identify apps before they become multibillion-dollar businesses, Elman is sure to provide some valuable insight into the next big iOS apps on the horizon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK bans installation of new Huawei 5G equipment from September</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q_V7rocAIk3vPq6KnBk_7GNDU88=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67998810/acastro_190521_1777_huawei_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N5xQD0"&gt;The UK government is banning the installation of new Huawei 5G equipment from September 2021 as part of its plans to phase out the Chinese firm’s technology by 2027, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c8e7ee9a-4661-4890-a41a-6a7b59f1caba"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The decision follows the government’s announcement in July that firms would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21322880/uk-bans-huawei-5g-network-infrastructure-trump-administration-pressure"&gt;barred from buying new equipment from January 2021&lt;/a&gt; over national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5aFeN"&gt;The announcement means that any telecoms companies who have stockpiled Huawei equipment ahead of the January cutoff will now not be able to use this for long-term 5G rollouts. &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;reports that some companies have been stockpiling this equipment since summer. Firms will still be allowed to maintain old equipment after September, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55124236"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n0UX01"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Firms have reportedly been stockpiling Huawei’s equipment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w6W4Xm"&gt;New legislation set to be debated in Parliament this week will start the process of enshrining the ban in law and set out how it will be enforced. Under the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-telecoms-security-law-to-protect-uk-from-cyber-threats"&gt;Telecommunications Security Bill&lt;/a&gt;, telecoms companies could be fined up to 10 percent of turnover or £100,000 per day if they don’t comply with the new security standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPZ9H1"&gt;While competitors Ericsson and Nokia have so far picked up several of the contracts to replace Huawei’s equipment, the government is promising to invest £250 million to encourage the growth of smaller players in the industry. This initiative will try to reduce the impact of removing Huawei’s equipment from 5G networks, and will include creating a new National Telecoms Lab as well as investing in new open radio technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQnlE9"&gt;Huawei declined to comment to the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt; on the announcement, and did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; request for comment. In the past, the firm has consistently &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46875747"&gt;denied posing a national security risk&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s vice-president Victor Zhang has said the UK’s decision to ban its equipment from the country’s networks is “politically motivated and not based on a fair evaluation of the risks”.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Note 20 5G and Z Flip 5G now available in festive red and white colors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRHC-03CCHRoQpmQd1mItgTrW7w=/0x0:3900x2600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67998491/GalaxyNote20_Back_Pen_Red.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Note 20 5G (left) is getting a new red color, while the Z Flip 5G (right) will be sold in white.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UO1f34"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 5G and Z Flip 5G are available in a pair of new colors in the US starting today, the company has announced. The Note 20 5G is now available in red, while the Z Flip 5G is available in white. Both colors are being produced in “limited quantities,” Samsung says, and there’s no difference in specs or pricing between these and the original models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIPiSo"&gt;For those keeping track, these are the fourth and third colors for the Note 20 5G and the Z Flip 5G, respectively. The Note 20 5G is &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-note20/specs/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available&lt;/a&gt; in copper, green, and gray, while the Z Flip 5G &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-z-flip/specs/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is available&lt;/a&gt; in copper and gray. Although they’re not getting the new colors, the Ultra version of the Note 20 is also available in white and black, while the 4G version of the Z Flip comes in black, purple, and gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rbk1qoYKEs5P31kE3x3WaMtwxMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22071830/GalaxyNote20_Front_Pen_Red.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The red Note 20 5G comes with a red S Pen, of course.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mCZ5zOsnnSZLfEqShfaQtQEy_jE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22071831/GalaxyZFlip5G_ClosedFront_Mystic_White.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, still folds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ds0AoF"&gt;The new Note 20 color has been announced as rumors continue to swirl that the range might be discontinued next year. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/16/galaxy-note-21-dead-foldables-report/"&gt;A few respected leakers have indicated&lt;/a&gt; that next year might not see the release of a new Note lineup, and last week a report from South Korean outlet &lt;a href="https://www.ajunews.com/view/20201122092719480"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AjuNews&lt;/em&gt; claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung plans to discontinue the range. Don’t worry if you’re a fan of the Note’s S Pen, though. Reports suggest that Samsung plans to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;add support for the stylus&lt;/a&gt; to the successor to the Galaxy S20 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="823VA0"&gt;The new colors for the Note 20 5G and Z Flip 5G are available to order from Samsung’s online store starting today, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSocVx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9gvgj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The $129 Poco M3 is Xiaomi’s latest budget big battery king</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sbj71e6sdoQcBz9twzu1e0m4_rQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67979600/DSCF7453.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gHJBqz"&gt;Xiaomi’s Poco sub-brand has &lt;a href="https://blog.poco.net/en/?p=135"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; its latest entry-level phone, the Poco M3. As with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21426866/xiaomi-poco-x3-nfc-hands-on-price-specs-release"&gt;most other Poco phones&lt;/a&gt;, the M3 has an strong spec sheet for its comparatively low price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1V3r7"&gt;The Poco M3 has a 6.53-inch 1080p LCD screen with a waterdrop notch for the 8-megapixel selfie camera. The display is pretty basic: the chin at the bottom is quite big, the fingerprint sensor is integrated into the power button on the side rather than the screen, and the panel is only 60Hz, but it’s sharp enough and perfectly serviceable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeHdsW"&gt;The phone’s design certainly stands out from behind, with a large glossy camera bump emblazoned with a bright white “POCO” logo. The main camera is 48 megapixels, but the other two cameras are just 2-megapixel sensors for depth and macro, so this isn’t really a meaningful triple-camera setup. While the phone’s chassis is constructed out of plastic, it uses a leather-ish finish that feels much nicer to the touch than most other plastic phones.   It’s available in black, yellow, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g1_ti_3q0TTLPsa4B77Je_5kpRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22120890/DSCF7449.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tkrGbN"&gt;The M3’s processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 662, which is paired with 4GB of RAM. It runs MIUI 12 atop Android 10. The battery is an impressive 6,000mAh, and the phone is a hefty but fairly manageable 9.6mm thick and 198g in weight. There are options for 64GB or 128GB of storage, and the phone has two SIM card slots in addition to a separate microSD slot. There’s also a headphone jack as well as a USB-C port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEbsSA"&gt;Xiaomi is putting the Poco M3 on sale online on Black Friday, November 27th, with early US pricing starting at $129 for the 64GB model and $149 for 128GB. The regular price is $149 for 64GB and $169 for 128GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yxf84F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Budget roundup: the latest low-cost iPhones and Android phones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21526773/budget-phones-cheap-iphones-android-low-cost"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4pqoQE"&gt;Even at those higher prices, the M3 looks like it’ll be very good value by US market standards. You could compare it to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286687/motorola-moto-e-2020-g-fast-review-price-specs-features"&gt;this year’s Moto E&lt;/a&gt;, for example, which starts at the same $149 price point but has a 720p screen, a Snapdragon 632 processor, a Micro USB port, 32GB of storage, and just 2GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces the A12 and A02S, two new entry-level phones for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFMBQuW6lVMM-ijuRRaJ8ZeWRJE=/11x50:817x587/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67941602/galaxya12_galaxya02s.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gIhUJB"&gt;Samsung on Tuesday announced the Galaxy A12 and A02S, two new entry-level phones set to launch next year in Europe. Both offer a lower barrier to entry for anyone looking for a modern Android smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nr4Egu"&gt;The A12 is designed to be a successor to the A11, sporting a 6.5-inch HD+ display with a notch for the 8-megapixel front-facing camera, an octa-core processor, a fingerprint sensor on the side, and a 5,000mAh battery. Photos are covered by a quad-array of cameras on the back, including a 48-megapixel main sensor, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, and a pair of 2-megapixel sensors to help out with macro and depth shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cmHxdu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9670224"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ToGBaR"&gt;The A02S is slightly less impressive: it has the same display and battery but with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage (though you can expand storage with its microSD slot). The phone is also saddled with different cameras: a 13-megapixel main sensor and the same pair of 2-megapixel sensors as the A12. Costs are also cut with ports, the A02S features an older Micro USB port as opposed to the USB-C port you may have wanted. The A02S is also missing a fingerprint sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hkjf79"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9670233"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PCHH0j"&gt;Samsung recently rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21212085/samsung-galaxy-a01-a11-a21-a51-a71-5g-mid-range-android-price-release-date"&gt;5G versions of its Galaxy A line&lt;/a&gt; of phones; we covered the Galaxy A51 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;more fully in our review&lt;/a&gt;. We thought that model favored screen quality over cameras and speed — expect potentially greater trade-offs with the A12 and A02S’s even lower prices. Regardless, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/worlds-third-best-selling-galaxy-smartphone-q3-2020/"&gt;Samsung’s budget options are its bestselling phones&lt;/a&gt;, so even minor improvements to specs seem like a good move for anyone in Europe looking for their first smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ay7Izv"&gt;The A12 is currently set to start at €179 ($212) for 32GB of storage and 3GB of RAM, with 128GB and 6GB of RAM on the high end for €199 ($236). The A02S starts at €150 ($178). The A12 will be available in January 2021 and the A02S in February 2021. There are currently no announced plans for a North American release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdpgOK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story said the A12 and A02S had 6.8 inch displays, the displays are actually 6.5 inches. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook tweaked the News Feed to highlight more mainstream news sources after the election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3KUdPu3nCCcZUP4dnWaTxkVABxw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67871354/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6x25Yo"&gt;Facebook, in the days after the US election, decided that an uptick in viral misinformation related to election results and President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede needed an extreme measure to be dealt with. So the company made a temporary change to its News Feed algorithm to favor mainstream news outlets, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/technology/facebook-election-misinformation.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;published on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKHjhm"&gt;Facebook specifically tweaked how much weight the News Feed gives to “news ecosystem quality” scores, an internet metric designed to quantify the trustworthiness and quality of a news source. That way, users of Facebook would see more news from publishers like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, CNN, and NPR and less of the hyper-partisan pages that tend to peddle in inflammatory and sometimes downright false or misleading content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LKOBnP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook tweaked the News Feed to favor mainstream news publishers in the days after Election Day&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eIwQFC"&gt;Many of those publishers with poor news ecosystem quality scores happen to be right-wing sites, and many of those right-wing sites have been spreading Trump’s false claims and countless other misleading and dubious election fraud and conspiracy theory stories far and wide on the social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvlJ7k"&gt;“There are many variables at play in every product decision we make, all aimed at creating the best possible experience for people,” Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne said in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The assertions in this report are based on sources who have no product decision-making authority and are advancing their own narrow impression of how our process works.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHZjgS"&gt;The company had been signaling for months that it was preparing for worst-case scenarios like what eventually unfolded when President-elect Joe Biden was declared the winner of the election earlier this month, but Trump to this day continues to try to undermine and overturn the results. Facebook described these scenarios and its tools for combating them as “break glass” plans, according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPN0WS"&gt;One of those plans involved manually tweaking the News Feed. CEO Mark Zuckerberg ultimately authorized the change when presented with findings that right-wing news publishers were seeing huge swells in engagement from unverified stories about election fraud and how Democrats were trying to steal the election from Trump, the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnDiXi"&gt;Facebook employees are now asking company leadership whether the changes could stay in place to help promote a healthier and less divisive news ecosystem on the social media network. But executives like News Feed chief John Hegeman tell &lt;em&gt;The Times &lt;/em&gt;that there are no plans to implement any election-related tweaks as permanent changes to the platform. Rather, Facebook plans to study the experiments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aHmMp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 24th, 1:14PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Facebook. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
