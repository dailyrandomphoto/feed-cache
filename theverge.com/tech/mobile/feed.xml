    <title>AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey says it was ‘time to unleash’ WarnerMedia assets</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ng1etn"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey said Monday that the company’s focus on its connectivity business in the US meant it didn’t have the global reach to grow a global streaming business with WarnerMedia, and the company decided it was “time to unleash the media assets” of WarnerMedia to Discovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnvHOq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T announced on May 17th&lt;/a&gt; that it would spin off its WarnerMedia business to merge it with TV company Discovery. The resulting entity, which has yet to be named and is still awaiting regulatory approval, will be a competitor in the cable space and for streaming content giants like Netflix and Disney; WarnerMedia owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and the Warner Bros. movie studio, while Discovery has a number of channels that focus more on reality TV, including HGTV, Animal Planet, Food Network, and TLC. Each also has its own streaming platform in HBO Max and Discovery Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNqL7r"&gt;“What’s become clear is that the opportunity for direct relationships with customers is truly going to be a global opportunity,” Stankey said of the streaming sector. “As a result of that, when you look at the opportunity to grow a fantastic subscriber base we kind of looked at this and said, ‘it’s time to unleash the media assets to go and seize a multi-hundred-billion-dollar opportunity.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3T019"&gt;Streaming is “a little bit of a different shareholder base and management base than what we’d typically have” as part of AT&amp;amp;T’s more traditional lines of business, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osveBA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/business/dealbook/att-agrees-to-buy-time-warner-for-more-than-80-billion.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T acquired WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt; (which was known as TimeWarner at the time) in 2016 for $85.4 billion. The deal was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17466518/att-time-warner-acquisition-closes"&gt;approved in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJeOzq"&gt;Stankey made the comments during the JP Morgan Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference. He bristled slightly when interviewer John Cusick, a JP Morgan analyst, asked him about his vision for the future of AT&amp;amp;T, noting “you’ve reversed nearly six years of strategic change at AT&amp;amp;T in three months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5sgVR"&gt;Stankey said he would “contest the characterization that we did it in three months,” adding, “We don’t wake up one day and say ‘hey today’s the day I think we ought to go find a transaction.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkxV5p"&gt;But with less than three years from when the WarnerMedia deal was approved to the time AT&amp;amp;T decided to spin it off, the change in direction struck many as sudden, but it also seemed to make sense. Telecom companies have tried to run media businesses with limited success; earlier this month, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22416854/aol-yahoo-sale-apollo-venetian-hotel-verizon"&gt;Verizon sold AOL and Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; for less than half of what it paid a few years prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shdcxS"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post’&lt;/em&gt;s Steven Zeitchik noted in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/22/discovery-warner-media-att-spinoff/"&gt;his analysis of the deal&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T did little to court business in Hollywood during the time it owned WarnerMedia. The surprise announcement in December that WarnerMedia would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;release all of its 2021 theatrical movies on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; drew widespread &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; from the entertainment industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSpVQS"&gt;Still, Stankey claimed Monday that AT&amp;amp;T’s ownership of WarnerMedia helped to grow HBO Max and HBO’s linear channel to a combined &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/hbo-max-hbo-reaches-44-2-million-subscribers-4165569/"&gt;44 million US subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in the year since HBO Max launched. “I think realistically, HBO Max would not be where it is today if not for the strength of the two combined companies,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is offering customers free Apple Arcade or Google Play Pass for up to a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NbGxCieqwryDJ_uVp_c1udB_CF0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333468/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLwTrr"&gt;Verizon has a new deal for new and existing unlimited plan subscribers starting May 25th: up to a year of Apple Arcade or Google Play Pass, free of charge. Specifically, customers who pay for the Play More Unlimited and Get More Unlimited plans get 12 months of either app subscription service for free, while all other unlimited plans get six months. It’s worth noting that both free options are longer than the ones Apple or Google offer themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pccJT7"&gt;The $80 per month Play More plan or $90 per month Get More plan (that’s the price for a single line) also come with other benefits to sweeten the deal. Play More comes with an “unlimited” mobile hotspot with up to 15GB of 5G data, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371902/verizon-unlimited-plans-free-disney-plus-espn-hulu-bundle"&gt;the Disney Bundle&lt;/a&gt; (Hulu, Disney Plus, ESPN Plus), six months of Apple Music, and 12 months of Discovery Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5MdnOH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not quite unlimited, but the add-ons are nice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E7CmXf"&gt;Meanwhile, Get More offers an “unlimited” mobile hotspot with up 30GB of 5G data, the Disney Bundle, a continuous subscription to Apple Music, and 12 months of Discovery Plus. Verizon frequently offers all sorts of other promotions so you can check &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/plans/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D39986104348088388961888296802413619485%7CMCAID%3D304EA1F622850B1E-40001414C26A22B2%7CMCORGID%3D843F02BE53271A1A0A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1621640023&amp;amp;mboxSession=4b9bd75675694d1c8939eaadd9212408" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt; for the most up-to-date deals. (Each plan only guarantees 50GB of 5G/4G data at most, so none of them are technically “unlimited.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGn63Y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20878843/google-play-pass-bundles-350-android-games-and-apps-for-4-99-per-month"&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18280589/apple-arcade-gaming-subscription-release-date-pricing-features"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt; are similar conceptually — pay monthly for access to a selection of the best apps from a platform without in-app purchases — but differ meaningfully in what they actually offer. Apple Arcade is focused on games and by far has some of the most interesting exclusives. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/26/21026128/apple-arcade-best-games-iphone-ipad"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grindstone &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Card of Darkness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were early favorites, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;the recent addition of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a JRPG from the creator of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, is also well worth subscribing for, even if you have to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxAtTn"&gt;Play Pass is a bit more holistic as an offering, but might be worth it if you’re new to Android. Google includes popular games &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; apps in the service, spanning everything from a farming sim like &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley &lt;/em&gt;(normally $4.99) to a utility app like AccuWeather (free, but includes in-app purchases). It also offers a larger selection than Apple Arcade, with &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/31/google-play-pass-800/#:~:text=Google%20Play%20Pass%20now%20offers%20more%20than%20800%20Android%20apps%20and%20games&amp;amp;text=Google%20introduced%20Play%20Pass%20in,of%20the%20%244.99%20monthly%20membership."&gt;now over 800 apps and games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8a0jgO"&gt;Neither Apple Arcade nor Google Play Pass are particularly expensive on their own at $4.99 per month each, but their free trials also aren’t as long as what Verizon is offering. Apple will toss in three months of Arcade for free if you purchase a new Apple device, but otherwise offers a one-month free trial. Google also only offers a one-month free trial for Play Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rk9jdR"&gt;If you’re interested in Verizon’s deal, but want a better understanding of what’s available to you, check out our lists of the best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178231/apple-arcade-iphone-ipad-best-games-2020"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22170029/best-play-pass-games-google-android-phone"&gt;Play Pass&lt;/a&gt; games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G UW review: extreme durability for an extreme price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A pricey phone built to withstand the elements&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RqQfv2"&gt;The Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G is a rugged phone that doesn’t require you to give up too many modern conveniences to gain the benefits of extreme durability. It’s common for rugged phones to feature older processors and lack modern features — these phones often have specialized uses, like barcode scanning or taking payments, and more or less just need to keep working in harsh environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgtCHM"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra 5G includes both the durability of a rugged phone and modern features like 5G, wireless charging, a high-quality processor, and dual rear cameras. At $899, it’s an expensive phone — you can buy a very nice non-rugged phone for that much — but if durability is a must and you don’t want to sacrifice performance or convenient features, the DuraForce 5G is (quite literally) a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EUeitz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10511069"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCwS5H0Rr6eSgsG4CWaocFtUhG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526443/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W7VFuv"&gt;Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G rugged features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bgM0jd"&gt;Pick up the DuraForce Ultra 5G and you’ll know right away that you have a rugged device in your hands. The top and bottom of the phone are wrapped in thick plastic bumpers, the sides feature a texturized finish, and at 278g (9.8oz) it’s much heavier than your standard smartphone. The screen itself isn’t very big — just a 5.45-inch 1080p LCD panel — but the sizable bezels and thick chin make it a chunky device overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdguzi"&gt;Despite its dimensions it’s actually easy to use one-handed, since the screen itself is relatively small. The phone will fit in a jacket pocket, but it’s too bulky for any of my jeans pockets. Haptics are aggressive, even at the “medium” default setting, which is a good thing in a phone you might be using with gloves. Otherwise, you can turn touch vibrations down to low or off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKFwdX"&gt;The phone is both IP65 and IP68 rated, meaning there’s generous protection against water intrusion both from jets and immersion (up to 6.5 feet for up to 30 minutes). The DuraForce Ultra 5G meets the Military Standard 810H specifications and includes protection against vibration, blowing dust and sand, extreme temperatures, drops from five feet onto concrete, high altitudes, and plenty of other hostile conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6wpa1D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Aside from some minor scuffs acquired in the driveway test, the DuraForce Ultra 5G merely shrugged at my efforts and kept on working just fine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hJWRm2"&gt;I couldn’t test it against all of those conditions, but I did subject the phone to plenty of abuse including an hourlong stay in the freezer, water immersion for 30 minutes in the kitchen sink, exposure to sand, and a drop from about five feet onto driveway asphalt. Aside from some minor scuffs acquired in the driveway test, the DuraForce Ultra 5G merely shrugged at my efforts and kept on working just fine. Kyocera does include a two-year warranty with purchase, so as long as you use the phone within the conditions it’s rated to withstand, you shouldn’t be putting your purchase at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpGg8x"&gt;In addition to rugged features, the DuraForce Ultra 5G is just loaded with buttons. There’s a power button with embedded fingerprint sensor, three programmable keys, and a large volume rocker that’s easy to press with gloves on. I frequently pressed one of the programmable buttons accidentally when I grabbed the phone — they’re in easy reach when you’re using the phone, but that unfortunately means a lot of unintentional presses, too. These buttons do require a long press to bring up whatever shortcut function you’ve assigned to them, so a brief press won’t do anything. You can also assign any of them to “do nothing” when pressed if you’d rather not use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FLffBgLPWI_Llf-npqmIGqOt0UY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526445/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GXpg0z"&gt;Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G screen, performance, and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="E8kAww"&gt;Aside from the obvious difference in appearance and ergonomics, the DuraForce Ultra 5G handles pretty much the way any other Android device does. The screen looks a little low on contrast in comparison to your standard display — likely because the panel is optimized for viewability in bright sunlight. That’s probably more important to the phone’s target user than a rich multimedia viewing experience, and the panel is indeed usable even in very bright direct light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sccb8"&gt;The screen’s protective “Sapphire Shield” remained free of scratches during my testing, but it does pick up reflections easily outside, more so than other phones with Gorilla Glass. It wasn’t enough to bother me, but someone planning to use the phone outside in bright light often might find it distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l13Zen"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra 5G ships with Android 10; Kyocera says it will provide an update to 11, but that the timeframe is still being determined. Android 10 is fine for now, but given that Google is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;readying Android 12 for the public&lt;/a&gt;, it’s definitely a step behind. Kyocera says it will provide a minimum of two years of security updates, which is a common if not terribly generous policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EKwQAE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This model works with both widely available sub-6GHz frequencies and hard-to-find but much faster mmWave spectrum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HPDPTP"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra 5G uses a Snapdragon 765G processor with 6GB RAM, which puts overall performance on par with a midrange phone. There’s some slight stuttering when scrolling quickly through screens with lots of images and video, and a noticeable pause after taking a photo in the camera app, but other than that it keeps up well — especially considering the lower performance bar in the rugged class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mjmbC"&gt;There’s a 4,500mAh battery built into the DuraForce Ultra 5G. It’s a comparatively large battery for the class, and it got me through a full day of moderate to heavy use. The phone supports Qi wireless charging, which is uncommon among rugged phones. The phone was a little finicky on my stand-style Belkin wireless charger, but it eventually worked when set on the charger in landscape orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrNjuL"&gt;And of course, there’s one of the DuraForce Ultra 5G’s namesake features: 5G. This model works with both widely available sub-6GHz frequencies and hard-to-find but much faster mmWave spectrum (also called Ultra Wideband by Verizon, hence the UW in the phone’s name). It’s only sold through Verizon in the US, which makes sense: the company has been pushing mmWave much harder than the other major carriers and does offer more coverage, though it’s still relatively scarce. Verizon’s 5G network is kind of lackluster overall at this point, though it will improve over the next couple of years. It’s a good feature to have on a phone you’re going to hang onto for a while, but definitely don’t buy this (or any phone, really) just for mmWave since you’ll probably have a hard time finding a signal anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9K8_BvBox1IIgUPqGHpe6gIS1iE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526441/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SstD0A"&gt;Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nEfbUr"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra’s rear camera array consists of a 24-megapixel f/1.8 standard wide and a 16-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, plus a time-of-flight sensor. Around front, there’s an 8-megapixel f/2.0 selfie camera. That’s a cut above what’s offered on many rugged phones. Picture-taking likely isn’t a high priority for prospective DuraForce Ultra owners, and image quality is certainly not up to what you’d find on conventional $900 phones, but it does the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SUrxOC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10511127"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HkQEvB"&gt;Photos in good light look fine, if a bit on the low-contrast, washed-out side. Exposure and color can shift noticeably between two images taken with the same camera at slightly different angles, and I noticed some odd misses here and there, like a blurry shot of a static subject where it looked like the camera had tried to apply too much HDR. But most of the time in bright light, photos are perfectly fine, and a cut above what I’d expect from a rugged phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPE5GH"&gt;There’s also a mode that will overlay live information on your still image or video about whatever extreme situation you happen to be in, including location, altitude, speed, and G-force. Extreme activities are generally not recommended in your second trimester of pregnancy, so I didn’t really test this out. I imagine if you’re into something like mountain biking or climbing and you want to record that kind of information with your activity, you probably have a better way of doing so already. In any case, it’s there, and it’s definitely more of a casual, fun feature than it is practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RdoMQqBzgM7hSRn2TD79gBmGDB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526440/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lwm3nQ"&gt;If you’re merely curious about living a rugged phone lifestyle, the DuraForce Ultra 5G isn’t for you. The phone’s extremely hardy specifications would be appealing to anyone who’s nervous about dropping their phone or occasionally brings their phone to rough environments like beaches or backcountry camping. If that’s you, spend your $900 on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;good standard phone&lt;/a&gt; (many are IP68 rated) and a rugged case. You’ll get better performance, a better camera, timelier software updates — basically, a lot more for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uGUklv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The inclusion of 5G, wireless charging, and processing power that’s a cut above the rest of the class makes it a good tool on and off the job site&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jansg3"&gt;If you need a rugged phone on the job as a frontline worker, first responder, or construction worker, for example, then the DuraForce Ultra 5G makes a lot more sense — especially if it’s going to be your primary phone off the job and you’d really like some extra bells and whistles. The inclusion of 5G, wireless charging, and processing power that’s a cut above the rest of the class makes it a good tool on and off the job site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gd8RS"&gt;However, $900 is an awful lot to spend on a phone, and I think that very specific kind of customer for this phone is a pretty small group. You could buy a less expensive rugged phone with more limited functionality like &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/kyocera-duraforce-pro-2/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kyocera’s own DuraForce model from last year&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;darn good midrange phone&lt;/a&gt; for around the same price. You probably can’t get mmWave 5G that way, but that’s no great loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Z3Jnx3"&gt;Still, the DuraForce Ultra 5G represents a convenient option for a particular type of person if two phones feels like too much fuss. It certainly handled everything I threw it at, and functioned well as a daily companion for more pedestrian tasks like scrolling social media and navigating trips across town. If extreme durability is a must and you don’t want to give up too much to get it, then the DuraForce Ultra 5G is a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Smaller Pixel 6 leaks with flat screen and fewer cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dWmKknsp9GG8QoIu3cza5DLzSH8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69321632/PIXEL_6_5K3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jw8QBm"&gt;Yesterday &lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt; released CAD renders of what is supposedly Google’s next flagship phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446078/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-specs-camera-screen"&gt;the Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and now the noted leaker has followed up with details and images of the smaller model, &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-6-renders-design-exclusive/"&gt;posted at &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The so-called Pixel 6 looks like it’ll adopt the same distinctive design as the Pro, with one colorway featuring orange and white sections broken up by a glossy black bar that houses the camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27MzEy"&gt;You’ll find one fewer camera in that bump, according to the leak — it’s said to be a dual-camera setup, presumably a regular wide and an ultrawide. The 6 Pro, on the other hand, appears to include a periscope telephoto lens. Both phones are depicted with a single centrally aligned hole-punch selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wKCqlx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 6.4-inch display without curved edges&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="On1SQc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt; says that the Pixel 6 has a 6.4-inch display with flat edges, unlike the curved 6.67-inch panel used in the 6 Pro. The 6 reportedly also has wireless charging, an in-display fingerprint sensor, and bottom-firing stereo speakers, with dimensions of 158.6mm x 74.8mm x 8.9mm. The &lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt; renders match up with designs shown off by &lt;em&gt;Front Page Tech&lt;/em&gt;’s Jon Prosser &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzupAfbY8a4"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2e31s"&gt;There’s no word on exactly when the Pixel 6 will launch, but Pixel phones do have a habit of leaking (or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18663172/google-pixel-4-camera-sensor-design-official-photo"&gt;being announced by Google&lt;/a&gt;) well before their eventual release date, so we could well be waiting until fall. At this point, it’s almost a surprise that leakers managed to beat Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352032/google-pixel-5-4a-5g-price-release-date-specs"&gt;to the punch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWRPbb"&gt;Google has also said it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;planning to release a Pixel 5A phone&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6 Pro could have a curved screen and a triple rear camera, new leak suggests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9E-SsriP6IB3EtdUWxmBEjxESQ8=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319100/PIXEL_6_PRO_5K3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newly leaked renders suggest that Google isn’t playing it safe anymore with its next generation of Pixel devices.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnLeaks and digit.in&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aYaYqP"&gt;New images from reputable leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/onleaks"&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.digit.in/news/mobile-phones/exclusive-google-pixel-6-pro-rednders-leak-display-design-camera-59483.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;digit.in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) show what may be a bold step forward for Google’s Pixel series. The Pixel 6 Pro, as pictured in the alleged renders, could offer a 6.67-inch curved display and a rear triple-camera array — a Pixel first — including a periscope-style telephoto lens. OnLeaks later followed up via &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt; with supposed renders of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447011/google-pixel-6-leaks-renders-pics-specs"&gt;smaller Pixel 6 phone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0Zh5G"&gt;This report also says that the 6 Pro will use an OLED screen, though there’s no confirmation of refresh rate, and will measure around 163.9 x 75.8 x 8.9mm. It’s expected to offer dual speakers and support wireless charging — features that are both available on the Pixel 5. There are some obvious differences in design, too, with the camera array moved to a raised, horizontal stripe across the back of the device and a bright accent color on the panel above it. There’s no confirmation with this leak whether the 6 Pro will include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364543/google-pixel-6-custom-in-house-processor-gs101-whitechapel-arm-report"&gt;rumored, Google-designed “Whitechapel” SoC&lt;/a&gt; (system on a chip).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UC-GcKR-HRuFxfKOQmvNX-DYtno=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528954/PIXEL_6_PRO_5K1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnLeaks and digit.in&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Renders show a rear triple-camera array including a periscope telephoto lens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MhZnlx"&gt;The naming shift from “XL” to “Pro” could also indicate a new relationship between the standard and big-screen models. In previous generations (the Pixel 5 never got an XL counterpart), the XL model was a “same phone, bigger screen” affair. Ditching that moniker for “Pro” could indicate that it’s both a bigger and higher-end device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTkQGB"&gt;Google has taken a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;conservative approach recently&lt;/a&gt; to its Pixel hardware and design. This hasn’t been an entirely bad thing, and it’s earned Google’s handsets a reputation for simple, affordable design with great cameras and software. But if these renders are the real deal, then the company appears to be making a move to challenge other flagships with higher-end hardware. For now, there’s no confirmed release date for the Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro, but we’d expect Google to stick with its typical fall timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoiiaR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, May 21st, 4.30AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a link to the later story on the smaller Pixel 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lofelt’s new haptics framework is ready to bring good vibrations to Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Qualcomm Lofelt" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owHO1DVBrVcpvFHKo7sgIRSPo2o=/69x0:807x492/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310907/0_66eU5_KB84vIXV7A.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lofelt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="htfuLm"&gt;Haptic feedback on Android phones is usually terrible, at least compared to devices that have Apple’s Taptic Engine. You know it, I know it, and a haptics company called Lofelt apparently knows it, too. Today, though, Lofelt, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297285/qualcomm-lofelt-haptics-vibration-snapdragon-888-api-software"&gt;partnership with Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, announced that it’s making its VTX haptic framework available to OEMs, with the hope that these manufacturers will start putting better haptics into more Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeMuxB"&gt;The framework will allow OEMs to utilize high-definition haptic vibration on phones running the latest Snapdragon 8-series and 7-series without any hardware tweaks. The system is “tightly integrated with Snapdragon and fully validated by Qualcomm,” according to Lofelt. While the framework is technically compatible with older phones that have a Snapdragon 7-series and 8-series chipset, it’s at the discretion of each OEM whether to add support. It seems more likely that companies will make the big effort to implement improved haptics in upcoming phones than adding it to older models. As for which newer models will feature the framework, none have been announced yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eNU9eK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VTX comes with “no performance trade-offs,” says Lofelt&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xsR6Fl"&gt;Ahead of this announcement, I got to actually feel the difference myself that Lofelt’s improved haptics can make on a phone through software tweaks only. The company sent over a custom Google Pixel 4 packed with demos that show off how its vibrations feel compared to the stock Android implementation (the same setup can’t be duplicated on other devices). Compared to phones designed to take full advantage of Lofelt VTX’s integration with the chipset, this Pixel 4 was running the haptics tricks through the application layer as a proof of concept. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m54Hgt2LU3SXibxUiEMAat33Vzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522947/lofelttoggle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lofelt’s app let me feel the difference between stock Android vibrations and the company’s own — and the difference was noticeable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2vih4G"&gt;Each of the demos featured a toggle that lets you switch between the stock Android vibration and Lofelt’s refined haptics, as shown in the bottom right of the picture above. One instance ran through a few scenarios in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;. The vibrations varied in strength and duration depending on the kind of gun being shot, and I was able to feel distinct pulsations of a helicopter soaring through the sky. A demo for &lt;em&gt;Asphalt 9: Legends&lt;/em&gt; let me feel the roar of an engine through haptics, as well as the fast, crunchy pulsing of the vibration motor when the car ran over a dirt median. Even though the Pixel 4 and earlier models don’t natively support VTX, these demos were far more expressive than standard Android phone vibrations. If you’re someone who takes mobile gaming seriously, to the point of owning something like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Razer Kishi controller&lt;/a&gt;, haptics could make your favorite games feel more immersive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPUkDo"&gt;The big challenge for Lofelt isn’t in proving that these sorts of immersive haptic experiences are worth building (give the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lofelt-studio/id1482238306"&gt;Lofelt Studio app for iOS&lt;/a&gt; a try if you need convincing yourself). The real work is ensuring that as many phones as possible can eventually get them, and that it won’t take too much effort for developers. That’s where Lofelt’s AX (adaptive experience) signal processing tech built into VTX comes into play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0AHjL"&gt;According to Lofelt, AX converts a universal haptic signal into vibrations that play to the strengths of each individual phone, taking into consideration its haptics driver, actuator hardware, and control algorithms from the manufacturer. The goal is for Android devices to catch up to Apple’s excellent Taptic Engine that’s in modern iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d67vsXP1TXxgnEht8c6zjiSlNZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21955672/akrales_201012_4137_0103.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Older phones with the Snapdragon 7-series and 8-series can be updated as OEMs see fit, but you’ll likely find better haptics in new phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LNUdA2"&gt;App and game developers can design advanced haptics using Lofelt Studio, which integrates with Unity, Unreal, and Xcode, and create a universal .haptic file that works across multiple devices. According to Lofelt, these files contain “universal parameters, such as whether the haptics should include smooth, continuous signals or more punchy, dynamic events.” In other words, you’ll only need to build it once, then the framework can deliver a consistent experience across different phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bERQJA"&gt;Existing games and apps running on supported Snapdragon hardware won’t be left in the dust. Lofelt claims that framework will also be able to convert the audio stream coming from an app into vibrations in real time without any hardware or coding modifications. So, you won’t necessarily need to wait for every developer to create bespoke haptics in order to start feeling some tactile enhancements with apps you already know and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3gtcJ"&gt;Lofelt says that its VTX framework comes with no performance trade-offs, and that it aims to deliver better haptics “while minimizing the impact on battery and actuator.” That sounds great, and the demo I tried feels ready for deployment. But now, the wait begins for some phone manufacturers to kickstart what could be a big, positive change for Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G chipset will put premium features in midrange phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpeqS7-xZs5K93r7a7GER8zE018=/0x0:895x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310906/Under_Embargo___Snapdragon_778G_Press_Note_Final_11__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qualcomm’s 700-series Snapdragon chipsets are popular among midrange and premium midrange phone manufacturers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dHT4li"&gt;Qualcomm has announced a new 700-series chipset for mobile devices: the Snapdragon 778G 5G. It will start appearing in premium midrange phones from manufacturers including Motorola, Xiaomi, Realme, Honor, Oppo, and iQOO in the next few months, bringing with it some video capture and AI capabilities borrowed from the Snapdragon 888, the current chipset of choice for flagship Android phones. The company has also made a couple of other announcements today designed to get 5G connectivity into more tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mhwNy"&gt;The Snapdragon 778G offers three image-signal processors, or ISPs — a feature Qualcomm touted in its flagship 888 chipset, and also appears in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350079/qualcomm-snapdragon-780g-888-5g-mobile-chipset-phone-android"&gt;higher-end 780G&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it possible to capture photos and video from three different cameras at once. You can easily switch between different cameras’ video feeds during recording ala &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/sg/support/mobile-devices/control-your-shots-with-directors-view-on-galaxy-s21-series/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s director view&lt;/a&gt; on the Snapdragon 888-powered S21 series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgzGLZ"&gt;The processor also supports cameras with staggered HDR sensors like the 50-megapixel chip in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; for better HDR video recording. The 778G also includes some improvements for more GPU-efficient mobile gaming, and things like better noise suppression and camera experiences on video calls. Both mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G are supported, as well as Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PGoBr"&gt;In “more 5G in more places” news, Qualcomm is also making M.2 reference designs available for current OEM customers of its X65 and X62 5G modems. This makes it easier for laptop, desktop, gaming, and IoT manufacturers to incorporate 5G connectivity into their products. The company is also debuting a new X65 5G modem, which Qualcomm says is more energy efficient and offers wider support of mmWave frequencies. It will start appearing in commercial mobile devices later this year, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 public beta is now available: here’s how to install it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rhzGfRd8tVHG9KHkxSRLx4kT19U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69307041/vpavic_210517_4586_0027.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo composite by Amelia Holowaty Krales and Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SGc5DS"&gt;Google unveiled Android 12 at its opening &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432922/google-io-2021-rumors-news-announcements"&gt;I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt;  keynote, and now you can try the new update yourself as part of the first public beta. The Android 12 public beta is currently available for Google’s Pixel phones (Pixel 3 and up) and will also come to devices from OnePlus, Lenovo, Asus, Oppo, Realme, Sharp, Tecno, TCL, Vivo, Xiaomi, and ZTE. You can enroll your Pixel phone on &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;Google’s Android beta site&lt;/a&gt; or find specific instructions for other supported phones on &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;the Android Developers page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blkQBw"&gt;Android 12 brings a cornucopia of new features, but the most exciting are the new visuals. Along with new animations, widgets, and a modified lock screen, Android 12 also offers theming, with the ability to change the colors used across the OS just by changing your wallpaper. Not all of the dramatic visual changes will be available in this first beta, but they should roll out over time as we get closer to release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3nlq1"&gt;Google is tweaking other aspects of the Android experience as well, like notifications and quick settings. It’s also making some improvements to privacy and security, with indicators for when your phone’s camera or microphones are in use, and easier access to all of your apps’ various permissions in one dashboard. For a more in-depth look at Android 12, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22203818"&gt;check out our full preview&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to get started with the beta right now, head below for instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pqo2S3"&gt;How to install the Android 12 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DcweJw"&gt;The process of how you get Android 12 beta on your phone ranges from requiring just a few clicks to something more involved. For this beta download, it’s considerably easier to get the it on one of the supported Google Pixel phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nukaT"&gt;For a Pixel, begin by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;visiting the Android 12 beta site to enroll your phone in the beta&lt;/a&gt;. You should be able to find your phone listed when you click “View your eligible devices.” After you enroll your device, you might be nudged via a notification on your phone that the software is ready to install. If you want to check manually, open the settings menu on your phone, then head to System &amp;gt; System Update. Tap “Check for update” to see if you can download the new software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5turHD"&gt;If nothing happens right away, your only option is to keep waiting. In the past, I’ve gotten the beta update on my phone within minutes of enrolling, though sometimes it takes hours. It may take over 24 hours for the software to be ready to install on your phone, so hang tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feWDkB"&gt;As for supported phones from other brands like OnePlus, Realme, Sharp, and others, &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;follow the instructions on each page&lt;/a&gt; from Google’s list of eligible phones, as the process for installation seems to differ depending on the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The BlackBerry keyboard lives on in this new Android phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVzzJYtocOfElCkblMsP62xwykE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304306/IMG_20210518_162259.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EuW3H4"&gt;Even though the iPhone arrived as a harbinger of doom for phones with physical keyboards well over a decade ago, the fanatical enthusiasm for BlackBerry isn’t something that just goes away completely. People loved their BlackBerry keyboards, and their relative efficiency when compared to touchscreens wasn’t really the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nApvQN"&gt;Still, the niche gets tinier by the year, and it falls on similarly tiny companies to serve it. Now we have the Titan Pocket, a new Android phone launching today &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/titan-pocket-the-smallest-qwerty-android-11-smartphone"&gt;on Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; from Unihertz, which previously released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332385/jelly-2-phone-size-screen-kickstarter-price-specs-features"&gt;miniature Jelly phones&lt;/a&gt; and, more pertinently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20826305/unihertz-titan-phone-keyboard-hands-on-kickstarter-specs-price-features"&gt;another BlackBerry-esque device called the Titan&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDQl9C"&gt;The Titan was like a rugged take on the BlackBerry Passport, which was a weird phone even for BlackBerry fans. Its sibling, the Pocket, keeps the rugged style but comes in much more manageable dimensions — Unihertz says the size has been reduced by 31 percent. The 3.1-inch LCD screen is actually a little smaller than a BlackBerry Classic’s, though it has a similar resolution at 716 x 720, which makes for a fairly sharp pixel density of 328 ppi.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XBpKRDDFEQI2oCJ2f11S3ryzRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522380/IMG_20210518_162324.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Titan Pocket is a lot more rugged than the average BlackBerry.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BgELwz"&gt;Obviously, you can’t fit all that much content on a screen like this. The Gmail app only shows three emails at once, for example. But if you’re longing for the days of firing out email blasts on your Blackberry, well, the Titan Pocket shows about as much of your message as any other smartphone would when bringing up a touchscreen keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0u9iY"&gt;I was never a BlackBerry addict myself, so those who were may feel differently, but I think the Titan Pocket’s keyboard is pretty good. I’m way faster on a touchscreen, of course, but the keys are responsive and easy to distinguish, and the backlighting looks much better than it did on the bigger Titan. The Pocket delivers on its promise of a satisfyingly tactile typing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Z7Cd2n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tUh5H6"&gt;Beyond the keyboard, the Pocket runs a basically stock version of Android 11 that hasn’t been customized much for its form factor. You can set some basic functions, but it’s not as deeply integrated as what BlackBerry users were used to. By default, pressing or holding down a letter key on the home screen just starts typing in a Google search. (This would be a useful feature if not for the fact that the cursor appears in the search bar behind the first letter you typed, making it essentially useless since you’ll have to fix a typo on every single search.) There’s also an option to use the keyboard’s touch-sensitive surface for scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCAPwV"&gt;As with the larger Titan, you’ll find many examples of how Android apps don’t really know how to deal with square screens. Games are mostly out, and fullscreen video usually only plays on its side. (Then again, I suppose the BlackBerry Bold wasn’t exactly an incredible entertainment device itself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fY84pp"&gt;Accordingly, the Titan Pocket is not a powerful phone. It has a MediaTek P70 processor, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage; you’ll sometimes see some lag when scrolling through Twitter and so on, but generally performance seems adequate for the kind of thing you’ll be doing on a phone like this. Other features include a microSD card slot, an IR blaster, and a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJSbGO"&gt;The standout spec is the 4,000mAh battery, which is no doubt helped by the sturdy, 16.8mm-thick design and should give the phone some pretty serious endurance considering the small screen and low-power processor. This phone’s vibe is decidedly less C-suite than an actual BlackBerry, but if you need to send emails while hiking, it could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEF6k_lvl3malWN2WedCaY8DLfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522379/ptp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Titan Pocket doesn’t do a great job with moving subjects or low-light conditions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7UlRgl"&gt;As long as you don’t also need to take stunning photos on the hike, that is, because the Titan Pocket’s single 16-megapixel camera predictably isn’t very good. It should do a reasonable job in bright conditions, like just about anything else, but the square-by-default results aren’t great for low light or moving subjects. Like my dog most of the time, as you can see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DcPZb"&gt;But hey, this is a niche device at a pretty low price. Its camera might be worse than most other phones out there, but its physical keyboard is better than all other phones out there by virtue of existing at all. Its &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/titan-pocket-the-smallest-qwerty-android-11-smartphone"&gt;Kickstarter early-bird pricing&lt;/a&gt; started at $159 but is now set at $219, which still makes it a potentially viable option as a second device despite its obvious limitations. (The official MSRP is $299.) Unihertz has a good record shipping crowdfunded phones, and while this one doesn’t do much for me personally, I can imagine it might for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzb36b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11.10AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The article has been updated based on further information from the Kickstarter campaign.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Display is showing off new foldable tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTk_hAE5ag1ZXNCS4g7AKUWtiz0=/0x15:820x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300675/foldable_concept.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s display division is working on a bi-folding OLED panel suitable for folding phones.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8J1SSe"&gt;This year has seen no shortage of rollable display demos from manufacturers, and now Samsung Display is the latest company to show off new concepts for folding and sliding screens. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsungs-new-foldable-and-udc-panels-reveal-an-exciting-future/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt; the concepts being showcased as part of a virtual Display Week exhibition (if you forgot to mail out your Happy Display Week cards, there’s still time since it &lt;a href="http://www.displayweek.org/"&gt;runs through Friday&lt;/a&gt;) including a “multi-foldable” mobile display and a large 17-inch folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRlPZr"&gt;The company calls its first concept S-foldable, with a bi-fold design that opens up to a maximum screen size of 7.2 inches. It’s similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; except, well, plus one fold. There’s also a sliding mobile display similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;ill-fated rollable concept&lt;/a&gt; LG showed off earlier this year before leaving the smartphone space altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BQ1emc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10505033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8S0EHO"&gt;Samsung Display is also showing two concepts for bigger panels, including a 17-inch foldable OLED that’s tablet-sized when folded and can function as a monitor when unfolded. Finally, there’s a more traditional-looking laptop display; it doesn’t fold or flex, but it does include an under-display camera — hopefully it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;better than the last one&lt;/a&gt; we used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prKcyC"&gt;Samsung Display is a division of Samsung Electronics, and it produces OLED panels for use by Samsung and other consumer tech manufacturers. So while these concepts may end up in future Samsung products, it’s certainly not guaranteed. The company as a whole hasn’t been shy about embracing foldable technology, getting into the foldable device market early. It may have more company soon; display OEM TCL has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;shown off its own concepts&lt;/a&gt; and says it will bring one to market this year. Until then, we’ll be watching and filling out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"&gt;foldable concept&lt;/a&gt; bingo cards.&lt;/p&gt;
