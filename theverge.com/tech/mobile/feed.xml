    <title>Verizon wants you vaccinated, so here’s $180 AirPods Pro and other accessory discounts  </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U7IgN6"&gt;Verizon is joining &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/today-the-first-winners-of-washington-states-covid-vaccine-lottery-will-be-chosen/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/media-center/odh-news-releases/odh-news-release-05-28-21"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; in offering a financial incentive to get the COVID vaccine: its customers who have gotten at least one dose can get a 10 percent discount on accessories, from either its online or physical stores. To sweeten the deal even more, Verizon is letting customers stack that discount on top of sale prices, which can be used to get some pretty solid deals. It’s unclear if or how you’ll have to prove your vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKbanD"&gt;For example, Verizon has the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/apple-airpods-pro-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro on sale&lt;/a&gt; until June 20th, and the 10 percent discount brings them down to $180 from their normal price of $250. If you’re more a fan of headphones and can snag the discount, you’ll be able to pick up Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/sony-wireless-noise-canceling-over-the-ear-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;delightfully named WH-1000XM4s&lt;/a&gt; for $270. The offer could also be a way to get a nice little discount on a lower-priced item you’ve been considering, like a Samsung wireless charging pad or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/anker-soundcore-liberty-air-2-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 headphones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIShJB"&gt;The offer is also valid for first responders, nurses, teachers, and military members. Any customers who are eligible will have from June 15th to July 31st, 2021 to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/discounts/vaccination/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fill out a questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; and receive their promo code, which can be redeemed until August 15th. While accessories that are on sale can be discounted, Verizon says that, for whatever reason, accessories whose prices end with a .97 can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3HiJf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung says it hasn’t decided whether to halt Galaxy S21 FE production</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKx6rJfWPBvv-CF_SNEt38S-44U=/0x0:970x647/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448284/s21fe.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An alleged render of the Galaxy S21 FE. | OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NIbrGO"&gt;Samsung has downplayed a report that claimed the company has suspended production of an upcoming phone called the Galaxy S21 FE. Korean publication &lt;em&gt;ETNews&lt;/em&gt; alleged over the weekend that production of the unannounced phone had stopped because of a shortage of semiconductors, and that Qualcomm processors had been reallocated to foldable devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyY0S7"&gt;The report has since been deleted, and Samsung now says it hasn’t made a decision on whether to halt production. In a statement texted &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/samsung-halts-production-of-new-phone-on-chip-shortage-et-says"&gt;to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, the company says “While we cannot discuss details of the unreleased product, nothing has been determined regarding the alleged production suspension.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IrGspR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE review: the right price for the right stuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d5ZIZ1"&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE — the FE stands for Fan Edition — was expected to be a cut-down, more affordable version of the regular S21. Last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;Dieter Bohn gave the Galaxy S20 FE a positive review&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it had “a few high-quality components that will delight while the cheaper parts don’t hurt the experience too much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9oMx4"&gt;The S21 FE hadn’t been formally announced, but Samsung did say at an event last year that it planned to release Fan Editions of flagship phones going forward. OnLeaks posted alleged renders of the S21 FE back in April, showing a similar design to the well-received Galaxy S21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzWE9d"&gt;While it’s noteworthy that Samsung didn’t deny &lt;em&gt;ETNews&lt;/em&gt;’ report outright, it may take some time before the truth emerges. The S20 FE wasn’t announced until September last year and got a release in October, so even if Samsung is experiencing supply chain issues with its successor right now, a launch wasn’t necessarily imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy A32 5G review: 5G on a budget</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A sub-$300 phone that’s ready for the future&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="p7mUdG"&gt;If you’re looking for a 5G Android phone and want to spend as little as possible, you can stop right here. At $279, the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G is your best bet right now, especially if you’re in the US where such options are scarce. It offers good 5G support (including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;all-important C-band&lt;/a&gt;!), a huge battery, and four years of security updates. That’s a compelling package for under $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHlDDa"&gt;That’s not to say it’s perfect. The A32 5G’s screen isn’t great, performance is a little laggy, and though capable, its camera is limited. If you can spend just a bit more, you can get a phone that does better in at least one of these areas. And if you can hold off on your phone purchase for even a few more months, we should see many more very affordable 5G phones on the market to choose from, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522711/oneplus-n200-5g-specs-screen-price"&gt;OnePlus N200&lt;/a&gt;. But if you don’t have time to wait and can’t spare the extra cash, I can’t find a good reason to talk you out of the A32 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HOLmhP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10602493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8FbAEW_mnjnHlY8Z1V6mGE19New=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22654071/ajohnson_20210608_4627_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A32 5G is a big device, housing a 6.5-inch screen and a large 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GJsj8V"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G screen, performance, and design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="l4qYTS"&gt;The A32 5G features a big 6.5-inch 720p LCD panel that’s best described as nothing special. Colors look a little flat and washed out, and though it gets bright enough to see in direct sunlight, the screen’s reflective plastic protective panel makes it challenging. It’s also a low resolution to be stretched across such a large screen, so you’ll see a little pixelization if you look close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LgiW1"&gt;The phone uses a MediaTek Dimensity 720 5G processor that compares well with Qualcomm’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/6/16/21286692/qualcomm-snapdragon-690-processor-5g-budget-phones-120-hz-4k-hdr-video"&gt;Snapdragon 690 5G chipset&lt;/a&gt; for budget 5G phones, used by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;. The Galaxy A32 5G combines the MediaTek processor with 4GB of RAM (decent) and 64GB of storage (skimpy but just enough to get by, and you can throw in a microSD card to expand it), and it performs well enough for its class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="QpPgiJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The A32 5G features a big 6.5-inch 720p LCD panel that’s best described as nothing special&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XK7rOH"&gt;There’s noticeable hiccuping with media-dense pages, brief pauses when diving into a demanding task like starting Google Maps navigation, and noticeable camera shutter lag. For the most part, though, I just didn’t notice slowdowns as I jumped between apps, scrolled through Instagram, and just generally went about using the phone normally. That’s about all I’d ask for from a sub-$300 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mELPZW"&gt;The phone’s headline feature, 5G, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;still isn’t something&lt;/a&gt; we’d recommend you run out and buy a new phone to get. But the A32 5G has a couple of features that make it worth your time, even considering that good 5G is still a year or two away in the US. Crucially, the A32 5G &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/samsungs-galaxy-a32-promises-c-band-5g-for-less-money"&gt;has been cleared by the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; to use C-band frequencies that Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, in particular, will be utilizing for 5G in the coming years. Not all 5G phones can use C-band, so that’s a big ol’ checkmark in the A32 5G’s favor. There’s no mmWave support here, which is the fastest and scarcest flavor of 5G, but that’s no great loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfMqJO"&gt;The second factor here is that you can reasonably expect to keep using this phone for enough years to actually see 5G that’s meaningfully better than LTE because Samsung will keep offering security updates for four years. Many budget devices only get about two years of security update support, but the A32 5G’s lengthy lifespan should see it through to the actual 5G age in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="CwkX6s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The A32 5G’s lengthy lifespan should see it through to the actual 5G age in a few years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HX9CnL"&gt;Battery life is one of the A32 5G’s strengths. Its 5,000mAh capacity battery is big indeed, and I had no trouble getting two full days of moderate use out of it. My usage was more battery-friendly than someone else’s might be, with battery optimization on and the bulk of my time spent on Wi-Fi, but even the most power-hungry user would be able to get a full day — if not more — out of the A32 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7a2rr"&gt;With a 6.5-inch screen, the A32 5G is a big phone for sure. It’s a little too bulky and awkward-feeling in my hand. What I dislike even more is that it feels slippery to me — the back panel plastic feels hard to get a decent grip on. On one occasion, I set the phone down on a softcover book, and it somehow shimmied itself across the cover and off of a side table when I wasn’t looking. (There’s a happy ending, though: it only fell about a foot into a box filled with hand-me-down baby clothes waiting to be put away, so there’s a good argument for keeping clutter around your house.) Anyway, get a case for it if you buy this phone, and know that if your hands are small, it won’t be very comfortable to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9eGBuNVVdirO_Sfgqwjj2ztPGw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22654072/ajohnson_20210608_4627_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a decent-quality 48-megapixel main camera on the A32 5G’s rear panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DqxxSP"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VH2X6K"&gt;There are two cameras of consequence on the A32 5G’s rear panel: a 48-megapixel standard wide and an 8-megapixel ultrawide. There’s a 5-megapixel macro camera that’s not very good and a 2-megapixel depth sensor that may or may not help with portrait mode photos. There’s also a 13-megapixel selfie camera around front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ge8fdB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10602618"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jo6l5C"&gt;Considering the phone’s price, the A32 5G’s main camera performs well enough. Like most any other phone, it takes very nice pictures in good lighting. That’s no surprise, even for a budget phone. But it reaches its limits quickly in less-good lighting, like interiors. That’s where optical stabilization or more sophisticated image processing would come in handy, neither of which the A32 5G offers. Instead, you may find some of your photos indoors are a little blurry, and you’ll be very challenged to get a sharp photo of a moving subject in anything less than bright daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZS8vo"&gt;The ultrawide camera shows its shortcomings if you look close — there’s some distracting flare in direct sunlight, and some noise visible in shadows of high-contrast scenes. There’s no telephoto lens here, with shortcuts in the camera app to jump to 2x (acceptable), 4x (eh), and 10x (don’t use it) digital zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKNWzLb6yiIqX-5QnIE4W7KaPxA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22654070/ajohnson_20210608_4627_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A32 5G’s generous security support timeline means it’s a phone you can plan to use for the next few years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AFcAmw"&gt;It’s tough to say how the Galaxy A32 5G compares to the competition because it doesn’t have much yet. It’s among the least expensive 5G phones you’ll find anywhere. Its closest competition at the moment is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;, which is a little more expensive at $299 but offers some worthwhile hardware upgrades, like a nicer screen, a bit better camera performance, and faster charging. It’s a nicer phone in a lot of ways, but it’s only slated for two years of security updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7fRN5R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you want a future-proof choice that’s easy on the budget, then the Samsung A32 5G will do the trick&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8BEKVd"&gt;Of course, if you only plan to hold on to your phone for a couple of years, then the N10 5G is worth strongly considering. If that’s the case, then 5G becomes a less important feature, too. If there’s room in your budget, consider the $349 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;, which will get you a much better camera, cleaner software, and timely updates over the next couple of years, albeit without support for 5G at all. It’s a much smaller device, though. So if a big screen is part of the A32 5G’s appeal, you might want to look at something like the $279 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;Motorola Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Bd53va"&gt;If you’d like to avoid the hassle of phone shopping again in two years and you want a future-proof choice that’s easy on the budget, then the Samsung A32 5G will do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 gives you better tools to fight the firehose of notifications — with a catch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuCoVA7ssG0Z3TCAXxJ7Soj_i0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69438771/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NfUox1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 preview&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week gave us a look at an important new feature coming to your iPhone’s notifications: help. A few new tools may act as a life preserver for those of us up to our eyeballs in a sea of notifications every day, regulating which apps and people are allowed to bug us, and when. But on the flip side, app developers get some additional tools for getting your attention, too, and could very well start sending you even &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;notifications — albeit in a less disruptive way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="LI7bZA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10601863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SwzC2c"&gt;First, the good news: the new notification features in iOS 15 look genuinely good and useful. There’s a new feature called Focus that allows you to choose which people and apps you’d like to see notifications from at a given time. It’s like Do Not Disturb but with much more customization than simply turning off every possible disruption. You can set up modes for work, sleep, personal time, and other scenarios like workouts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i13_lA5OsvFV8CNunF44yImFsvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651209/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_12.53.38_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;People who message you in third-party apps can be associated with their profile in your contacts list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zZv4cm"&gt;When setting up a new Focus mode, Siri can scan your outgoing messages and calls and automatically suggest allowing notifications from the people you talk to most. There’s a neat trick here too: communications from the people you approve can come from other apps, like Facebook Messenger, not just from iMessage or texts. When you get that Facebook Messenger message in iOS 15, you may see prompts to associate that person in that app with a matching person in your contacts list, too. Once you’ve done this, communications from that person in a third-party app will be allowed to interrupt your Focus mode, provided that you approved them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSS4Kr"&gt;You’ll also have the option to set &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524031/apple-focus-away-message-aim-wwdc-aol"&gt;a kind of away message&lt;/a&gt; when you’re using a Focus mode that will let others know you’re temporarily unavailable when they send you an iMessage. When your friend doesn’t hear back from you for hours, they won’t have to guess whether you hate them or you’re just really busy with work, and that’s nice for everyone. iOS 15 also adds notification summaries, which will batch lower priority notifications into digests you’ll receive at certain times of day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3PgZKCDdDimtOWb1gdIt3zWT6AA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652212/notification_summary_ios_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notification summaries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl0sTv"&gt;All of this gives you more control over interruptions, which is great! But what about app developers who want you to ~engage~ with their platform? They have new options too. They can now use one of four notification interruption types, two of which are new in iOS 15. First are passive interruptions, a new, less obtrusive kind of notification available to developers that doesn’t wake your screen or cause your phone to vibrate — they go straight to your notification center. Previous versions of iOS allowed the user to designate notifications from certain apps to be delivered silently, but this new framework lets the app developer choose to deliver them this way. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0u0PzzhdQyA4vW8XJnDCG7vf8Dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651200/passive_int.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Notifications classified as “passive” appear in your notification center silently, without buzzing your phone or breaking through a Focus mode.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv5hsy"&gt;These are the types of notifications likely to end up in summaries if you’ve enabled that feature. They don’t just appear in chronological order in the summary digest either — machine learning helps sort them by priority. They’ll likely include images and other visuals too, since Apple encourages developers to include media as part of the notification to increase its chances of showing up at the top of the summary list. And since the risk of annoying you is lower, developers have some incentive to send more frequent, more engaging notifications. They’ll be less disruptive, but these are the kinds of notifications we’re likely to see more of in iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aWF6uI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;since the risk of annoying you is lower, developers have some incentive to send more frequent, more engaging notifications&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RzQfNX"&gt;The other new interruption type is “time sensitive,” which is kind of a Notification Plus. It behaves like a standard notification, lighting up your screen and playing a sound or vibrating, but with an important difference: it’s allowed to break through your focus mode settings and notify you even if they aren’t from an “approved” app. The option to see time sensitive notifications can be turned on and off by the user, so if you really don’t want to see them, you don’t have to. In theory though, they should be for truly time sensitive events, like a package being delivered or your credit card company making sure it was you who bought two round-trip tickets to Maui. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwITss"&gt;In theory. Apple lets developers decide which notifications deserve time sensitive designation, so it’s more or less on the honor system. The company urges them to maintain trust and keep in mind that users can turn off notifications for their app if they feel they’re being bothered unnecessarily. And lest we forget, Apple itself has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165087/ios-apple-push-notification-advertising-marketing-now-allowed-app-store"&gt;bent the rules before&lt;/a&gt; on what’s considered too intrusive for a notification. Could developers end up overusing time sensitive notifications? Possibly, but they likely won’t gain much from doing so, since users can opt out of them and may decide to silence the app entirely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgEnYi"&gt;There are a few other things worth noting about notifications in iOS 15:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gzZDTh"&gt;With compatible audio devices like AirPods, Siri will be able to read any incoming notification to you. Previously, this function was limited to things like incoming messages. By default, Siri will read the contents of messages and time sensitive notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mSzX54"&gt;Notifications with a “critical” interruption type basically remain unchanged: these are things like Amber Alerts, which bypass your ringer settings to play a sound and get your attention. App developers still need special permission for these notifications, so we shouldn’t suddenly start seeing more of them in iOS 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2XzQyl"&gt;Notifications will look a little different, with bigger app icons and images of contacts included in messages. The actions you can take on a notification (liking an image, etc.) will get graphical icons, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>OnePlus updates its midrange Nord with new processor and a headphone jack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFsKI0A7E2BNkz8JgQoLdp3_6po=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433448/OnePlus_Nord_CE_5G.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord CE 5G will be available in black, blue, and silver.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OPgJcu"&gt;OnePlus has announced a new addition to its lineup of midrange phones, the Nord CE. According to the company, the “CE” stands for “Core Edition,” an indication that the company is focusing on the fundamentals, rather than inflating the device’s spec sheet with unnecessary extras. The phone is launching in Europe and India, and there are no plans for a US release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egSlyU"&gt;What this focus on the fundamentals means in practice is that the Nord CE is slightly stripped down compared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;last year’s Nord&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s slightly higher-specced than its predecessor, too. So you’re getting a higher-resolution 64-megapixel main camera (up from 48 megapixels), but there are only three rear sensors in total. (There’s also an 8-megapixel ultrawide with a 119-degree field of view and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor.) The Nord CE also only has a single 16-megapixel selfie camera, with no secondary ultrawide like the original Nord. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QOENK9aP_B8wGZ-Jdf9g3RrqxqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650055/Nord_CE_all_three_colours.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone features a very similar design to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mMJRZa"&gt;Internally, there’s a Snapdragon 750G powering this year’s model, compared to the 765G in last year’s phone. OnePlus claims its CPU is 20 percent faster, while its GPU is 10 percent faster. That’s paired with a choice of 6, 8, or 12GB of RAM, although these options vary slightly based on region. There’s a 4,500mAh battery inside the Nord CE, up from 4,115mAh last year, and the phone supports Warp Charge 30T Plus fast charging, which OnePlus says should charge you from 0 to 70 percent in half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naiktt"&gt;Externally, the Nord CE looks very similar to its predecessor. It’s got a very similarly styled camera bump on the back left (though with three rather than four cameras) and a hole-punch for its selfie camera on the front of the phone (again, with one rather than two cameras). However, on the bottom of the phone, you’ll find a headphone jack, which was missing from last year’s device. In terms of display, the Nord CE comes with a 6.43-inch 90Hz 1080p OLED panel. The phone is available in blue, black, or silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7n6EZm"&gt;The Nord CE will be available to preorder in limited quantities from OnePlus itself starting today in the UK, and these devices will ship on June 14th. The device goes on general sale on June 21st. In the UK, it starts at £299 (€329) for the model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and £369 (€399) for the model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. In Europe, there’s a version with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which will retail for €299. Those prices are slightly cheaper than the original Nord, which started at £379 (€399) for its 8GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzkoZL"&gt;Like the original Nord, OnePlus says it doesn’t have plans to release the Nord CE in the US. Instead, the US has the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522711/oneplus-n200-5g-specs-screen-price"&gt;OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; to look forward to. It’s a successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;N100&lt;/a&gt; that OnePlus CEO Pete Lau recently confirmed will retail for under $250.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung pushes pixel size even further with new camera sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vySmsQbNA_U2A2teUKK3ia92SYs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69432122/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gnuK0M"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005959/en/Samsung-Breaks-New-Ground-with-Mass-Production-of-Industry%E2%80%99s-Smallest-0.64%CE%BCm-pixel-Mobile-Image-Sensor/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new image sensor for smartphone cameras that it says has the smallest pixels in the industry. The ISOCELL JN1 is a 50-megapixel sensor with a relatively tiny 1/2.76-inch format, meaning its pixels are just 0.64μm in size. For comparison, Samsung already broke records in 2019 with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/23/20881141/samsung-isocell-slim-gh1-sensor-smallest-pixels"&gt;slightly larger ISOCELL Slim GH1&lt;/a&gt;, another 50-megapixel sensor with 0.7μm pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfAXUh"&gt;Conventional camera wisdom says that smaller pixels usually result in worse image quality with higher noise, so why is Samsung doing this? According to the company, it’s about form factor versatility. The sensor’s smaller size means it can be used in ultrawide or telephoto camera modules — which are challenging to design when size is at a premium — or as a way to reduce the height of the primary camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJukvb"&gt;As with other high-resolution camera sensors, the JN1 will make use of pixel-binning technology that combines multiple pixels into one for higher light sensitivity. In this case, Samsung says the sensor will capture 12.5-megapixel photos with the equivalent of 1.28μm pixels, and the company is also claiming a 16 percent boost to light sensitivity with its ISOCELL 2.0 tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCaixq"&gt;Unusually, Samsung even held a full-on live-streamed launch event for this sensor, which you can watch here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gisJ1C"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aai2Ux2Wsnk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SI2Dcz"&gt;Samsung says the JN1 is currently in mass production, so it’s likely to show up in smartphones before too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNgiei"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Moto G Stylus 5G is a step-up version of our favorite budget stylus phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y6xaGFnsQTnJYX_FLp51TJpPa0Y=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69427223/moto_g_stylus_5G_Cosmic_Emerald_Hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Stylus 5G features a 6.8-inch screen and a large 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9MXtRt"&gt;Motorola has announced the Moto G Stylus 5G, a new version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;very good, non-5G budget-friendly stylus phone&lt;/a&gt;. It offers broadly similar hardware to the 4G version, with notable exceptions in the new Snapdragon 480 5G chipset with sub-6GHz 5G connectivity and a bigger 5,000mAh battery. Priced at $399, it’s at the higher end of the budget range and will go on sale June 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rH8DV4"&gt;Like its 4G peer, the G Stylus 5G features a large 6.8-inch 1080p screen, ready for your notes and doodles courtesy of a built-in stylus. It includes 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and ships with Android 11. There’s a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a charging brick is included in the box. The Stylus 5G is a little bigger and heavier than the 4G version, but not by much — it’s about four grams heavier and 0.3mm thicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iVBHoG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10597540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSK7b6"&gt;The G Stylus 5G offers a rear triple-camera array that’s very similar to the 4G G Stylus’, with a 48-megapixel f/1.7 standard wide, 8-megapixel ultrawide, and 5-megapixel macro, plus a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Around front, there’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IitoSD"&gt;The G Stylus 5G isn’t the most aggressively priced 5G phone in the budget market. OnePlus says its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522711/oneplus-n200-5g-specs-screen-price"&gt;upcoming N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; will cost less than $250, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling for $279. It’s also surprising to see the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Snapdragon 480 5G chipset&lt;/a&gt; used here, since it’s intended for more affordable 5G devices well under the Stylus 5G’s $400 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaIEjl"&gt;On the other hand, the G Stylus 5G is quite a bit cheaper than the other prominent 5G phone with a built-in stylus, the $999 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506471/samsung-galaxy-note-20-review-price-stylus"&gt;Galaxy Note 20&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to look at things that way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus to launch stripped-down Nord CE 5G this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NWp7rWH46bNOfBLD1RWCi9PNoko=/0x0:864x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426437/nce5g.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OnePlus Nord CE 5G. | OnePlus via TechRadar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tUkr43"&gt;OnePlus is planning to announce a new budget smartphone called the Nord CE 5G this week. &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; has a render of the device &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/exclusive-oneplus-nord-ce-design-first-look-and-how-oneplus-designed-it"&gt;straight from OnePlus itself&lt;/a&gt;, showing that, well, it looks quite a lot like the original OnePlus Nord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkjv80"&gt;The CE 5G, however, will be a little cut back in terms of specs. OnePlus’ product head Oliver Zhang tells &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; that CE stands for “Core Edition” and refers to a design philosophy where the company had a goal of “distilling the product down to the most important things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUiITm"&gt;“You see mid-range phones on the market with very exaggerated specifications,” Zhang says. “We actively avoided some of those features and kept the things we felt would really make a difference to the daily smartphone experience, like fast charging (Warp Charge 30T Plus), a 90Hz AMOLED display, or 5G.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q16nzR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Nord review: the right compromises","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UMUIiF"&gt;OnePlus itself has been guilty of these “exaggerated specifications” in the past — the original Nord, for example, had a “quad-camera” setup that included a 2-megapixel macro camera and depth sensor of dubious utility. The Nord CE 5G, on the other hand, makes do with three cameras on the back. That camera proposition, as well as the CE 5G’s processor and price, will be key to the product’s appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ch34QH"&gt;Evleaks has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1402400286937960448"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; several leaked images and a video of the Nord CE 5G, revealing some more features like a 64-megapixel main camera, 7.9mm thickness, and — unlike the original Nord — a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yluuKP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;OnePlus Nord Core Edition 5G &lt;a href="https://t.co/9ovnqoXxKL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9ovnqoXxKL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1402400286937960448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FgGeMi"&gt;The full reveal is happening tomorrow, June 10th, at 10PM ET. The Nord CE 5G is being targeted at the European and Indian markets, according to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="6nxU1r"&gt;Google may have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22448165/google-samsung-wearable-partnership-wear-os-tizen-merge-smartwatch"&gt;shied away from a Pixel Watch&lt;/a&gt;, but a Pixel Fold still very much seems to be on the way — following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356760/foldable-google-pixel-q4-2021-leaked-internal-document-5-5a-4a-5g"&gt;a leak last August&lt;/a&gt; that revealed the company was planning to release its first folding Pixel phone in late 2021, Korean industry site &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; is now reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung will begin production of folding OLED panels this October for Google, Vivo and Xiaomi’s upcoming folding phones, all of which will reportedly be revealed late this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAfTpk"&gt;Google hasn’t exactly kept its folding phone ambitions a secret; in 2019, it published patent applications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266257/google-folding-bending-screen-display-patent"&gt;for its own folding screens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535863/google-pixel-foldable-phone-prototype-samsung-galaxy-fold-io-2019"&gt;admitted it had been prototyping them for quite some time&lt;/a&gt;, telling &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; that it didn’t have “a clear use case yet.” But now, it appears Google has a foldable, codename “Passport,” that could be nearly ready to announce. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/18/android-12-beta-model-numbers-pixel-6-family-passport-foldable/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; even spotted a new reference&lt;/a&gt; to it last month in Android 12’s code, alongside other codenames believed to be the upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 5a 5G. &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; says it’ll have a single 7.6-inch panel that folds inward, while Vivo’s upcoming phone will have a 8-inch main screen and a 6.5-inch outer display. It didn’t mention the size of the new Xiaomi phone’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uSRFA"&gt;It’s not clear whether a Pixel Fold would actually come with a display designed by Google itself, though it’s possible; Samsung acts as a contract manufacturer for many other companies, producing some of Apple’s homegrown processors as one example. Either way, one portion of the screen’s sandwich may still largely belong to Samsung itself: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ETNews &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung will supply its proprietary ultra-thin cover glass (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;which is technically made by German manufacturer Schott&lt;/a&gt;) to other smartphone manufacturers, and Google is expected to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DNbiiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Folding glass: how, why, and the truth of Samsung’s Z Flip","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2vekEL"&gt;Xiaomi already announced a folding phone earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;the Mi Mix Fold&lt;/a&gt;, but it sounds like it’ll have a second one. &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; also reports Oppo will be delaying a new foldable phone to 2022, with a 7.1-inch main screen and a smaller outer one between 1.5 and 2 inches diagonally.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple previews iOS 15 at WWDC 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJXKRU687lH-RGE7OuYMUCbW5qA=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418050/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1XcSmT"&gt;As expected, Apple offered a preview of iOS 15 at today’s WWDC 2021 keynote, highlighting some changes coming to FaceTime and notifications, as well as more privacy controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a31hjb"&gt;FaceTime gets some major updates, with spatial audio that reflects the speaker’s location on-screen, and voice isolation to help reduce distracting background noise. Portrait mode’s blurred backgrounds can also be used in FaceTime, and users can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;share music and videos during calls&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also possible now to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;include Android users on FaceTime&lt;/a&gt; with a shareable link that opens the call in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jmbj3hvnqDaBOFCsr2YZVLTMT-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643191/662_2021_06_07_662_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shareable links make it easier to schedule FaceTime calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="miGlYM"&gt;Notifications get a new look, with contact photos on text notifications and bigger app icons, and they will get new filter modes in iOS 15, called Focus. This allows you to customize which notifications appear during different activities, like while you’re working, and sync across all devices. You can set a custom home screen page with widgets and apps appropriate for your chosen Focus mode. There’s also an option to batch certain notifications and receive them as a digest at certain times of day as a summary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYkEgh_ery2zYr_RWSMglWUmKIA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643232/697_2021_06_07_697_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 15 offers more custom controls over notifications, like batch summaries and Focus modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vE5xTo"&gt;Messages gets a few updates, too. iOS 15 makes it possible for others to see when you’ve enabled Do Not Disturb mode by way of an automatic status update in Messages. It’s also possible to override Do Not Disturb for urgent messages. Photos shared in messages are automatically grouped into collages or stacks and will appear in other places like your photo gallery and memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgK87d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22502877/apple-app-privacy-report-ip-hiding-safari-mail-wwdc"&gt;Updated privacy controls&lt;/a&gt; in iOS 15 include a move to bring all Siri request processing on-device by default. Users will also get an App Privacy Report with a seven-day summary of how often apps accessed location information and your phone’s microphone or camera. Mail will also block tracking pixels commonly used in marketing emails to determine whether an email was opened and read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rrCgq"&gt;Other updates include the ability to search text in photos courtesy of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;new feature called LiveText&lt;/a&gt;, including the ability to search photos in Spotlight, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522951/apple-airpods-find-my-hearing-accesibility-notification-wwdc"&gt;AirPods audio updates&lt;/a&gt;, and the ability to locate AirPods Pro and AirPods Max using Find My. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/75mXKebWo8740_AmXOEjvnnFztk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643263/image__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Wallet can store ID info for TSA in iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Asxadc"&gt;Apple Wallet will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;support a wider range of items&lt;/a&gt;, like hotel room keys and relevant identification information for TSA. Memories get more customization options with different music track and transition options to change the feel of your video clips, and the weather app will display more information with new full-screen maps and a wider range of animated backgrounds. Maps gets some attention too, with “significantly enhanced details in cities” and a three-dimensional city driving view when using navigation on the phone or on CarPlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTYltu"&gt;Changes are coming to Safari are coming across the Apple ecosystem, including on iOS. It will offer a simpler tab bar design as well as support for grouped tabs that sync across all devices. Safari on iOS will also support browser extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qV47mQ"&gt;Apple says iOS 15 will arrive to the public this fall for iPhone 6s and newer, with a developer beta arriving today and a public beta next month. &lt;/p&gt;
