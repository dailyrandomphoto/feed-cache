    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Quantum 2 has quantum cryptography built in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RrYlX1bpoTaEsCDXGHFFrnhDoIA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117262/_Photo__SKT_to_Launch_QRNG_Powered_5G_Smartphone_Galaxy_Quantum2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oD1Wz8"&gt;Samsung and South Korean carrier SK Telecom have announced the Galaxy Quantum 2, Samsung’s second phone that features built-in quantum cryptography technology for increased security. It’s the follow-up to last year’s Galaxy A Quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ka7P1O"&gt;The Quantum 2 includes a chip developed by a company called ID Quantique, which says it’s the world’s smallest quantum random number generator (QRNG) at 2.5mm square. It works by capturing random noise with an LED and a CMOS image sensor. According to SK Telecom, the QRNG chip “allows smartphone holders to use services that require security in a more safe and secure manner by generating unpredictable and patternless true random numbers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4QGTZ"&gt;Quantum cryptography RNG is considered to be extremely challenging to hack without extensive physical access to a given device. The benefits will seem pretty niche to the average customer, but the QRNG chip does automatically work with apps that use the Android Keystore APIs, which should make the technology more accessible for developers. SK Telecom is touting local compatibility with the likes of Shinhan Bank and Standard Chartered Bank Korea, plus its own services like T World. The carrier says it’ll work with more services in the future, including Samsung’s own credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6b3mCn"&gt;The phone itself has reasonably high specs, close to what you’d have found in a high-end flagship phone from a year or two ago. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus processor, a 64-megapixel camera, and a 6.7-inch 120Hz OLED display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arWTr7"&gt;The Galaxy Quantum 2 is only confirmed for a release in South Korea right now. It’ll go on sale on April 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4HM3F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s follow up to the Z Fold 2 could be smaller, but maybe not in the dimension you want</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l5HaK0iuv9C7whGTmTMSI2pFSaY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116445/vpavic_200907_4181_0010_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u8ZMiY"&gt;Samsung’s next Galaxy Z Fold folding phone might have a slightly smaller screen than its previous models, feature a smaller battery, and quite possibly launch in July alongside a new Galaxy Z Flip, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=11865"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-3-will-reportedly-be-smaller-than-the-galaxy-z-fold-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CmxEB"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 will reportedly have a 7.5-inch main tablet screen and a 6.2-inch screen on the front cover of the phone, &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; writes, which would be virtually the same as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;the Fold 2’s&lt;/a&gt; 7.6-inch main display and 6.2-inch cover display. &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; says these screen sizes come with the added benefit of “zero bezels,” so even though the screens may be the same size, the third Fold could feel slightly smaller because the actual body of the phone might shrink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBiiEB"&gt;In comparison to the Fold 2’s 4,500mAh battery, the Fold 3 will reportedly make do with a slightly smaller 4,380mAh battery. Again, not a dramatic change in size and it might not even noticeably impact battery life, but it’s interesting to note if it effects other changes to the Fold’s design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uujIi-TwtsLqEJjklQdTF3pllPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439698/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_4.30.23_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even with a slight taper, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 is still almost as thick as two phones back to back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hwzwyn"&gt;There’s other rumored changes to the Fold line, including the possibility of S Pen support, just like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra got earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. For the Fold, a stylus could also pose additional challenges if Samsung tries to integrate stylus storage directly in the phone rather than using an add-on case like the Ultra. A hole for a stylus could take up space that could be filled with extra battery capacity or removed entirely for an overall thinner phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MF37JS"&gt;And — though &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t mention it at all, so don’t expect a change — thinness is the dimension that might actually matter when it comes to a new Galaxy Fold. Including the extra gap created by its hinge, the Fold 2 is about two S21 Ultra thick when folded. If Samsung isn’t thinning out the rumored Fold 3 to make it easier to hold and fit in a pocket, I hope they’ll consider that the next time around: it could also help Samsung compete with newcomers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Huawei’s Mate X2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi’s Mi Mix Fold&lt;/a&gt; which both use similar folding designs and are already thinner than the Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6H3DQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG Korea says that the Wing, Velvet 5G, and Velvet LTE phones will get Android 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1wDBuWsGUlparL02Rj8-GBW33go=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115027/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wing will be one of a few devices to receive OS upgrades for several years after LG exits the smartphone business.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vhTjQN"&gt;LG’s Korean website now lists which phones the company plans to update to Android 12, along with a few devices which will even get Android 13. These upgrades will most likely come long after the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;mobile industry exit&lt;/a&gt;, announced last week. &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/LG-Korea-reveals-which-phones-will-receive-Android-12-and-Android-13-update_id131368"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spotted the &lt;a href="https://www.lge.co.kr/lgekor/contents/mobile/swUpgradeDetail.do?swSeq=1441"&gt;updated FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, which previously stated that some models would get the OS upgrade to 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoiLYB"&gt;According to the FAQ, the LG Wing and both variants of the Velvet (LTE and 5G) will get Android 13. LG also says that those models, along with the V50, V50S, G8, Q31, Q52, and Q92, will receive an Android 12 upgrade. The company also notes that these two updates aren’t strictly guaranteed and will depend on product performance, product stabilization level, and Google policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBwiwF"&gt;LG Korea says that an Android 11 update, already in progress, is planned for the models mentioned above, along with the Q61, Q70, and Q9 One. As an aside, the Q-series models sold throughout Europe and Asia are similar to corresponding models sold as the K-series in the US but aren’t strictly a 1:1 match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4q1Bzo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG leaves behind more than a flip phone-shaped hole in our hearts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375938/lg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="s7vL90"&gt;Availability and timing of updates will, of course, vary by region, but the list is a good indication of which models the company plans to prioritize. Recently, LG’s German website &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327144/lg-android-11-software-update-wing-phones-mobile-q4-2021"&gt;published a timetable&lt;/a&gt; for its Android 11 updates, most of which won’t be released until the end of the 2021. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/1/18164265/lg-android-pie-update-g7-v40-q1-2019"&gt;isn’t known for a great track record&lt;/a&gt; on platform updates, but it’s encouraging to see specific model names mentioned for the future upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook adds state vaccine information to the top of the News Feed for US users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHzxHMDNgZz3cIahqSgeCEwwJGM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113471/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0445stills_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOo2aG"&gt;As all adults across the US become eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, Facebook is making it easier for its users to find information based on where they live. The company has started rolling out a feature that adds a box with state-specific information about &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/state-covid-19-vaccine-information/"&gt;where to get a COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the News Feed for every US user living in a state where the general public is eligible to receive the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmIyfF"&gt;The feature, once available, will appear at the top of your News Feed and show you state-specific information, confirming that you are now eligible to receive the vaccine, including a link on where to find the vaccine in your province, as seen in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HhaQxfqUxA3kr4gpBRtres2Ui7w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22437890/NRP_Covid_Vaccine_Eligibility_Notifications_banner.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BqRhSu"&gt;Most US states have now made vaccination appointments available to all adults, although &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-19-vaccine-eligibility.html"&gt;some states&lt;/a&gt; are still lagging. With more availability, it has become a challenge for some people in certain parts of the US to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;book an appointment&lt;/a&gt;, leading &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;some volunteers to build dedicated websites&lt;/a&gt; to help people in their search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sRMz0"&gt;The feature is also available in “nearly 20 countries,” according to Facebook, with the ultimate goal to release it in more areas as countries begin opening COVID-19 vaccinations to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90l29M"&gt;Facebook rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177085/facebook-covid-19-misinformation-notifications"&gt;a similar feature to its mobile app last year&lt;/a&gt;, which helped fight misinformation about COVID-19 appearing on its platform as the site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253055/facebook-q4-2020-earnings-report-app-usage-record-user-numbers"&gt;saw a surge in users&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook says more than 3 million US users clicked through those promotions between January and March, suggesting the new vaccine links may reach a significant number of Facebook users in the months to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG leaves behind more than a flip phone-shaped hole in our hearts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2nix_zd-RTVqievZhpUQKgS4w_Y=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69108712/ajohnson_210222_4437__005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Stylo 6 is one of the company’s bestselling phones in recent history.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company leaves a void that brands like Motorola and TCL are well-positioned to fill&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zHTSjt"&gt;LG’s exit from the smartphone business felt inevitable in the weeks leading up to it as rumors mounted. When it was finally confirmed, Avi Greengart, a longtime consumer tech analyst and president of Techsponential, noticed a trend toward nostalgia in the reactions to the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zosnHP"&gt;“I’m not getting a lot of people saying ‘What will I do to replace my LG G8X ThinQ?’ I’m getting ‘Aw, my first phone was an LG flip phone, and it was durable and reliable and I loved it.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuJe7t"&gt;As someone who spent many years covering the digital camera market, it’s a very familiar moment to me. We mourn the loss of the brand that gave us our first flip phone or our first camera with a tweet and a broken heart emoji. But truthfully, we moved on long ago, as did most of the rest of the phone- or camera-buying population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="t7t3Mw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Through last year, LG still held close to 10 percent market share in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ChXH3e"&gt;Things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/28/11525306/lg-g5-earnings-q1-2016"&gt;weren’t looking good&lt;/a&gt; for LG’s phone business in 2016 when it introduced the modular G5, and the ecosystem’s failure to take off perpetuated what would become years of losses for the mobile division. In 2020, the smartphone business &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fglobal%2Fpdf%2Fir_report%2F20%25204Q%2520Earning%2520Release%2520of%2520LGE.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F11%2F22375938%2Flg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recorded an operational loss of around $750 million for the year&lt;/a&gt;; the company promised to “closely review the direction of the business,” and we know now how that turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHTQMi"&gt;While most shoppers have moved on, there are still gaps left in the market when a Kodak or an LG packs it in. “This is a void. When they do leave, this will be a void,” says Ryan Reith, program vice president for IDC’s Mobile Device Tracker division. He says that through last year, LG still held close to 10 percent market share in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84KiyC"&gt;In particular, the company still had a solid foothold in the prepaid device business. Greengart doesn’t think there will be any lack of appetite to snap up that share of the market. “The competition there is brutal. The real question is will US carriers invite a new brand in — someone like Xiaomi would be my longshot.” The company’s Redmi and Poco lineups might be good candidates, with a focus on bringing high-end features and solid performance to affordable handsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8l9WYc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The real question is will US carriers invite a new brand in — someone like Xiaomi would be my longshot.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LfyPlb"&gt;Greengart also notes that OnePlus already has a foot in the door at Metro by T-Mobile, the carrier’s prepaid sub-brand. Samsung has already announced that it will sell two of its least expensive A-series phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;the A02s and A12&lt;/a&gt;, through prepaid brands like Cricket and Metro this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWl2U6"&gt;As for the sub-$300 space in general, there’s no shortage of brands ready to pounce. “I would say the two brands that are probably going to take that share going to be Motorola and TCL,” Reith says. He notes that Motorola is already well-positioned to pick up LG’s Latin American customers, which was recently about 30 percent of its mobile phone business. Even on an individual device level, there are obvious heirs: one of LG’s last bestselling devices is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301223/lg-stylo-6-review"&gt;Stylo 6&lt;/a&gt;, and its sole competitor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt;, is quite frankly a better phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b19Eaj"&gt;TCL has also made it clear in the past couple of years that it’s eager to get its own brand devices into more consumers’ hands, in addition to the phones the company already makes for other brands. Reith says he’s “bullish” on the company’s prospects, as more US shoppers have become familiar with the brand name by way of its TV business. If one thing’s certain, it’s that more than a few companies are in a good position to fill that void LG leaves behind. As Greengart puts it, “Undoubtedly there will be plenty of substitutes; in fact there already are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o55aMP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Undoubtedly there will be plenty of substitutes; in fact there already are.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DH5Gs2"&gt;Although LG only had a small presence in the premium market, there’s a gap left there too — even if it’s mostly symbolic. The few devices the company still sold were an alternative to the two dominant brands in the US: Apple and Samsung. Especially considering the lower cost of entry to the S21 series this year, those remaining customers will likely be easily scooped up by the duopoly. “The market is mostly Apple and Samsung in the United States,” says Greengart. “If it was concentrated before, it’s even more concentrated today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6wpis"&gt;Realistically though, the market had already spoken. LG’s efforts at bold, unusual designs in the premium space never caught on and spelled serious trouble for the business. Reith points to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;the LG Wing&lt;/a&gt; as an example. “To come up with a design like that… it takes so much money for R&amp;amp;D, that when you put that out and it only sells thousands of units — not hundreds of thousands, but &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of units — it’s a big, big loss,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rfzHOP"&gt;LG’s premium devices may have been interesting and unique, but the market spoke, and the company’s mobile phone exit became seemingly inevitable. That’s how these things work, and a multitude of companies are ready to swoop in and pick up where LG left off. But whether you follow mobile tech closely or just have a special place in your heart for your old flip phone, many of us will still take the opportunity to pause and shed a digital emoji tear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Q Link Wireless made private customer information accessible with just a phone number</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5GNoTZ"&gt;A mobile carrier allowed anyone with one of its customers phone numbers to access their personal information, including name, address, phone number, and text and call history, according to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/04/no-password-required-mobile-carrier-exposes-data-for-millions-of-accounts/?comments=1"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The carrier, Q Link Wireless, &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/south-florida-based-hello-mobile-beats-nationwide-prepaid-prices-1028340029"&gt;claimed to have over two million customers&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETd9uD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoContract/comments/mkolj5/critical_security_issue_with_hellomobile_account/"&gt;noted a Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; saying that the app used by the carrier and its subsidiary Hello Mobile never asked for a password or any identifying information when the user was logging on with a phone number. Looking &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-mobile-account/id1408895511"&gt;through the reviews&lt;/a&gt;, there are references to the poor security practices (to put it mildly) going back to December of 2020. While it’s unclear when the credential-less login system appeared, there is an update note from two years ago that mentions an “updated login process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="apWHAE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A ton of information was available in the app, which didn’t ask for a password&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UKaEKS"&gt;The carrier has reportedly fixed the issue — though &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoContract/comments/mkolj5/critical_security_issue_with_hellomobile_account/gty65gj?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;it seems it may have done so&lt;/a&gt; by just turning off logins to the app altogether. Before the change, &lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; was able to see, but not change, a bevy of information from a Hello Mobile customer who volunteered their phone number, including their name, address, account number, email address, and which numbers they’d contacted or been contacted by. The last one is probably the most sensitive — while the contents of texts or phone calls weren’t shown, there’s still a lot of information that can be gleaned from knowing who you talked to and when you talked to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6J98r4"&gt;The app’s description mentions that it allows users to add more minutes or data to their plans, but it’s unclear if that required extra authentication. Regardless, there’s still a ton of information that was available to anyone able to get the phone number of one of Q Link Wireless’ customers. Reportedly, Q Link Wireless hasn’t notified its customers that their information had been accessible — which seems to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374464/linkedin-data-leak-500-million-accounts-scraped-microsoft"&gt;a worrying trend&lt;/a&gt; among companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372707/facebook-responds-533-million-data-leak-notify-users"&gt;that leak user data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmEFee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; found no evidence that the security vulnerability was widely exploited, but having to worry about others having access to a ton of their sensitive data isn’t something that anyone needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ET8OCR"&gt;Q Link Wireless didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hans Zimmer’s ringtone for the Oppo Find X3 Pro is fit for a Hollywood score</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/THmENA15zQgYr6Suy6yWuuqijtk=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101935/Hans_Zimmer_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Oppo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2JrrWE"&gt;Hans Zimmer, the legendary composer of &lt;em&gt;The Lion King&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;, and other iconic soundtracks, has brought his epic compositions to a new audio medium: phone sounds. Yes, Hans Zimmer created a ringtone and other phone sounds for Oppo’s newest flagship, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22324860/oppo-find-x3-pro-flagship-announced-10-bit-microlens-specs"&gt;the Find X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGZoV7"&gt;The fact that Zimmer made these ringtones isn’t news. Oppo made a big deal about his involvement in March, posting a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaQEEHooI64"&gt;video interview with him&lt;/a&gt; and an entire song &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK2oi-JWoss"&gt;he composed just for Oppo&lt;/a&gt; (called “Colourful Future,” if you were wondering) on its YouTube channel. But these videos didn’t have what I wanted to hear: the actual Zimmer-composed sounds by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTXRKX"&gt;So I asked an Oppo PR rep if they could send the tones my way, and they did. Now, I can’t stop listening to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaK2xZ"&gt;I’ve embedded them in this post so you can hear them, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NySR4b"&gt;Ringtone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbvxaP"&gt;Here is the Zimmer-made ringtone — it’s beautiful. As my colleague Ian Carlos Campbell said, “Does he want me to cry every time the phone rings?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x1gB2z"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/2lig5ktt/widget?token=1918ee862a722caa98ca9e1992058518" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EvAw0p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QK5iYy"&gt;“I want the ringtone to open a door that says there is the possibility to feel something,” Zimmer said about the ringtone in Oppo’s video interview. It worked, Hans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rOzB5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W9WW9Q"&gt;Alarm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5mC3nL"&gt;Here’s the Zimmer-composed alarm tone. It sounds like waking up to a beach sunrise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uzb85b"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/4nsekecn/widget?token=c6dd755e66f4a5ba87ceec23f0a6eb46" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WqkLMo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="860BgG"&gt;Text tone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="khPUjq"&gt;Here’s the charming text tone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TEDSqK"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/cpabpgwb/widget?token=8ff9f9d6894606db344b26a33b53ac72" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OCC8Mf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JfOsLu"&gt;Notification sound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="z1JG7s"&gt;And here’s a generic notification sound, which I’d like all of my apps to use from now on, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0KMtwh"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/21mar2a2/widget?token=c5f77c980e5ec3336b9e21e57abf1391" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQ3LZw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfe0Gb"&gt;These are so good that now I’m hoping Google or Apple will work with Zimmer to refresh their phone sounds next. (Just imagine Zimmer’s take on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTcXZqIZxbA"&gt;iPhone’s classic Marimba ringtone&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phTDXT"&gt;I also recommend you watch Zimmer’s full interview &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaQEEHooI64"&gt;on Oppo’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, where he describes how he hears colors. Honestly, I believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8L4zdS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaQEEHooI64?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TS0Kph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung tries to woo iPhone users with a browser-based Galaxy test drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-tL5rT3tnAniP5hRb7OXfcVVG8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69100721/DSCF0384_result.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s iTest site on an iPhone 12 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y70C9m"&gt;Samsung has released &lt;a href="https://www.itest.nz/"&gt;a new website&lt;/a&gt; to give iPhone users “a little taste of Samsung” from their mobile browser. When visited on an iPhone, the site prompts users to add it to their phone’s home screen, after which it turns into a shortcut to a simulated Samsung Galaxy device. The site appears to be the work of Samsung New Zealand, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/samsung-itest-galaxy-device-iphone-experience/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqyLej"&gt;The experience might be limited, but it’s a neatly designed bit of marketing. Open up the camera “app” and a video will automatically play featuring influencer Logan Dodds, who describes Samsung’s camera app features in the interface around him. Poke around the other “apps” in the home screen and Samsung happily markets its phone’s other features and accessories, while text messages and even a fake phone call outline others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8yqhwHjJNLmEPaYlw_596woOS5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431983/IMG_0574.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: iTest.nz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tooltip from the settings app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SoB9n6iGmuve8gHxjCxLgYflnkg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431982/IMG_0573.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: iTest.nz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are fake contacts in the message app to text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nCrW3d"&gt;There are also a couple of Easter eggs thrown in if you dig a little deeper. I particularly liked finding the “Friends with kids” contact in the text message app, who sends you garbled nonsense whenever you send them a message. Pry too much into the settings app and you’ll be shown a tooltip that reads, “We’ve simplified the settings menu experience, just so our developer could have a lunch break.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jgXzj"&gt;Samsung is targeting the experience squarely at iPhone users. Try to visit the site with another Android phone and you get a message that says, “You’re on Android already,” while if you try to visit using a desktop browser the site gives you a QR code to scan with your iPhone. Yes, it’s ultimately just a bit of marketing, but it’s more creative than most other smartphone ads out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRwl3z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U12vbn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Imposters steal restaurants’ names in delivery app deception</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Proposed Ban On Bluefin Tuna Rejected At World Trade Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/crSKkdQjNjFO_ioyVWIjJ-A910Y=/62x0:2939x1918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098988/97868336.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0PU7a0"&gt;Ordering delivery through an app like DoorDash or GrubHub saves the trouble of cooking and lets you be a little picky — you can order from your favorite restaurant. But imagine receiving your food, sitting down to eat, and it tasting... &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. And then, following your gut, you learn that you’ve been duped by a fake, an imposter restaurant that stole its name. For many people ordering from two Japanese restaurants in San Francisco, that exact thing may have happened, &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/On-Doordash-these-S-F-sushi-spots-look-like-16078920.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irTysa"&gt;One restaurant, now styled as an izakaya called Chome, originally opened for delivery and takeout in the former location of Blowfish Sushi. Except it didn’t bother to change the name, awning, or logo at the start. Chome, operating as if it were Blowfish Sushi, served sushi to people ordering through apps like GrubHub, Postmates, DoorDash, and Uber Eats using the identity of a restaurant that closed in December 2020. Before it closed, Blowfish Sushi had been serving its neighborhood for two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GE5mv"&gt;Blowfish’s former owner, Jason Teplitsky, was not exactly thrilled. “How does someone decide to do something like this? Did they think we all got COVID and died?” Teplitsky tells the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-MTes26QnTrdE7PnbcyWWMjTak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430912/Screen_Shot_2021_04_08_at_3.28.42_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Wagyumafia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, the real Wagyumafia is famous for its use of wagyu beef &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WyYK82"&gt;Another fake restaurant, SF Wagyumafia, shares the name of &lt;a href="https://www.wagyumafia.com/"&gt;a famous sandwich shop&lt;/a&gt; known for its $180 wagyu sandwich and locations in Tokyo and Hong Kong. This San Francisco restaurant has no connection with the actual chain, according to the real Wagyumafia, but it was advertising the $180 sandwich. The fake was convincing enough to initially fool one food writer, the&lt;em&gt; Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; writes. When you’re ordering through an app without any real way to gauge what you’re getting into, what can you do but take a restaurant at its word?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dPCu7"&gt;At first glance, both these restaurants might seems like &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/21540765/ghost-kitchens-virtual-restaurants-covid-19-industry-impact"&gt;ghost kitchen schemes&lt;/a&gt; gone awry. They’re seemingly focused on delivery, readily accessible through the most popular apps, and of an unknown origin. But blatantly copying other well-known restaurants to the point that people mistake one for the other, or think a classic has suddenly reopened, seems more like straightforward fraud. The new “Blowfish Sushi” even registered as Blowfish with the city of San Francisco, which makes it seem like the owner knew what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvmEC3"&gt;Teplitsky and the original Wagyumafia are considering legal action, according to the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCALkR"&gt;In response to the concerns over both restaurants’ legitimacy, DoorDash and GrubHub have removed Wagyumafia and Blowfish Sushi from their listings,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/DoorDash-and-Grubhub-removed-imposter-S-F-sushi-16081842.php"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn’t able to find a listing for either restaurant on Postmates or Uber Eats, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyBNPb"&gt;DoorDash, Postmates, GrubHub, and Uber Eats either didn’t respond to our questions about how they verify restaurant listings in the first place, or weren’t able to tell us whether they have any specific protections to keep one restaurant from stealing another restaurant’s name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9Xiig"&gt;GrubHub did reply with a generic description of its practices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KsmjA0"&gt;We have no tolerance for misconduct or misuse of the Grubhub platform. We have a number of safeguards in place to prevent potentially fraudulent listings on our marketplace and we are constantly improving our processes and testing new features to prevent these situations. In the case of any listings that might be fraudulent, we immediately investigate and remove them from the marketplace if they’re in fact fraudulent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DW1LML"&gt;And DoorDash provided something similar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="31h5RR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;At DoorDash, we work to ensure that we are always offering the highest quality of service to merchants, Dashers and customers. We take these types of allegations seriously and we’ve suspended the Merchants from the platform as we investigate the matter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0JO8Gg"&gt;In GrubHub’s case, it says fraud like this isn’t widespread, but says it’s unable to explain exactly how it prevents fraudulent listing because doing so would potentially make its methods no longer useful. Typically these companies check banking and tax information to setup payments, so there are some required details that could potentially corroborate a restaurant’s identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nh67RE"&gt;Fake restaurants aren’t the only surprises potentially awaiting you in food delivery apps: some legitimate brands have also tried to entice diners by changing their name for delivery. Remember, that pizza you purchase from Pasqually’s &lt;a href="https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/chuck-e-cheese-pasquallys-pizza-wings-new-menu"&gt;actually comes from Chuck E. Cheese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WG33Q2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 8th, 11:39PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from DoorDash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtmKaR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is recalling 2.5 million hotspots that could overheat and cause burn or fire damage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kZ_LROeVAyQBrGge_IgPZQzhTlg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097923/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9uhdqQ"&gt;Verizon said Thursday it is working with the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Verizon-Recalls-2-5-Million-Ellipsis-Jetpack-Mobile-Hotspots-Imported-by-Franklin-Wireless-Due-to-Fire-and-Burn-Hazards"&gt;recall 2.5 million hotspot devices&lt;/a&gt; after an investigation found the devices’ lithium-ion batteries could overheat and pose fire and burn hazards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLDBPL"&gt;The Ellipsis Jetpack mobile hotspot models MHS900L, MHS900LS, and MHS900LPP were imported by Franklin Wireless Corp. and sold between April 2017 and March of this year, according to the CPSC. The model numbers are all for the same device but vary depending on how the customer purchased the device — through a consumer prepaid or postpaid plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5FsfJ"&gt;“The safety of our customers is our highest priority,” Verizon &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/statement-regarding-us-consumer-product-safety-commission-recall" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We are taking the situation very seriously, and we are working diligently to determine the cause of the issues with the supplier and to provide replacement devices for all of our customers, free of charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbhcha"&gt;The CPSC bulletin indicated Verizon had received 15 reports of the devices overheating; six of the reports involved fire damage to bedding or flooring. Two incidents included minor burn injuries, the CPSC said. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recalled Ellipsis hotspot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="251h8v"&gt;A Verizon spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that about 1.3 million of the hotspot devices are currently in use by customers. The recall is focused on the entire device, not just the batteries, and customers should not try to remove the batteries themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fVmIa"&gt;Demand for hotspots &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/hotspots-wifi-students-coronavirus-1a08db65-236b-43e8-a5e0-17429a07942a.html"&gt;increased over the past year&lt;/a&gt; during the coronavirus pandemic, with schools and libraries seeking the devices for students who didn’t have internet access at home so they could complete their schoolwork remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtbQCf"&gt;Verizon has sent a software update to the affected hotspots that are powered on that should help reduce the risk of the devices overheating, as it prevents the hotspot from charging up while it’s on. The company also recommends turning off the hotspots while they’re not in use and keeping them on flat surfaces without anything covering them. It’s also not a good idea to expose the hotspot devices to extreme temperatures for long periods, Verizon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaur3T"&gt;To request a replacement hotspot or get more information, customers can go to ellipsisjetpackrecall.expertinquiry.com or call 855-205-2627.&lt;/p&gt;
