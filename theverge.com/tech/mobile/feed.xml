    <title>The Xiaomi 12 Pro’s main camera is absolutely massive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqET6mS4OiiBEOijUcVP034qUG0=/0x67:686x524/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70328001/23b7af4f9dcbdb453c205e6c51479e5a.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even for Xiaomi, the 12 and 12 Pro offer huge main camera modules.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qN0wZM"&gt;Xiaomi is at it again — putting another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356660/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-camera-bump"&gt;fantastically huge camera&lt;/a&gt; on a flagship phone. This time, it’s the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mi.com%2Fglobal%2Fdiscover%2Farticle%3Fid%3D2603&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F29%2F22858529%2Fxiaomi-12-pro-camera-specifications-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xiaomi 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a 50-megapixel main sensor and f/1.9 standard wide lens. It’s not the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; biggest sensor Xiaomi has used in a phone, but the combination of a wide aperture lens and sizable imaging chip makes it... well, just look at the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dag6Sd"&gt;On the technical side, it’s a Sony IMX707 chip, which Xiaomi says it’s the first to use in a mobile device. &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/12/25/xiaomi-12-pro-confirmed-to-use-sony-imx707-sensor-for-primary-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmochina&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; that the 707 appears to be a very light refresh of the IMX700, which makes that claim a little less exciting. Either way, it’s a large 1/1.28-inch type sensor. Sony combines its 1.22μm pixels, which are already fairly large for a mobile camera sensor, to create even larger 2.44μm “4-in-1” pixels for better low-light photos. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfOub_Vp8H8dJkV5FgIx3hD-JCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132629/xiaomi.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vwrq8U"&gt;The 12 Pro includes two more 50-megapixel rear camera sensors: an ultrawide and a telephoto. The Xiaomi 12 features a slightly smaller 1/1.56-inch type sensor, a 13-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel “telemacro.” In addition to impressive hardware, the 12 and 12 Pro include camera software improvements like reduced shutter lag, burst shooting improvements, and subject tracking for human and animal faces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9W9QxH"&gt;On the non-camera side, the 12 Pro and its 12 sibling have all the trimmings of a modern flagship with Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipsets and 120Hz OLED panels. The Xiaomi 12 offers a 6.28-inch screen and a 4,500mAh battery; the 12 Pro includes a 6.73-inch screen with 1,500 nit peak brightness and a 4,600mAh battery with 120W fast charging. &lt;/p&gt;

The 12 Pro starts at RMB 4,699 (about $737) for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and the Xiaomi 12 starts at RMB 3,699 (about $580) for the same 8GB / 128GB configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>10 Apple Arcade games for your new iPhone or iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jZGq8g2Z3smGeIleo1ZAmJ62yGU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70326376/RoundUpArt_iOSGames.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to play on Apple’s game subscription service&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OPLfSJ"&gt;Apple Arcade is a gaming subscription service that offers a wealth of great titles with no ads &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-arcade/?itscg=10000&amp;amp;itsct=arc-0-apl_hp-lrn_tle-apl-ref-210507"&gt;for $4.99 per month&lt;/a&gt;. Some great new games were released for it this year, but there are also many Apple Arcade-exclusive versions of some of the biggest App Store hits, and they’re just as fun as when they first came out. We’ve compiled a mix of new and classic games you might want to check out if you’re a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6P2Ixz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Arcade finally got the boost it needed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PgPTGw"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8EzPyj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cffbqBWccOfLMSkMDwcvBM2eJhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080432/battle4_Additional.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Fantasian&lt;em&gt; features handcrafted dioramas that create a distinctive style.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A6pmHU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is a mobile JRPG from Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy. &lt;/em&gt;It takes cues from many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;classic JRPGs&lt;/a&gt;, features a soundtrack from another recognizable name to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; fans, Nobuo Uematsu, and takes place in a game world built from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;handcrafted dioramas&lt;/a&gt;. The game first released in April and got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616888/fantasian-part-2-apple-arcade-release-date"&gt;part two update in August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wyEU5k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918005" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LTnDsw"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1R4idG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clap Hanz Golf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TgnvUpuzb64HhlqyxdzcKVSAoAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080444/IMG_1524.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Clap Hanz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fore!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b2zIHX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clap Hanz Golf&lt;/em&gt; is a spiritual successor to the &lt;em&gt;Hot Shots Golf&lt;/em&gt; games (or &lt;em&gt;Everybody’s Golf&lt;/em&gt; outside of North America), so if you’ve played that series, you should feel right at home with &lt;em&gt;Clap Hanz Golf&lt;/em&gt;’s arcade-y take on the sport. &lt;em&gt;Clap Hanz&lt;/em&gt; is actually the developer for all of the &lt;em&gt;Hot Shots Golf&lt;/em&gt; titles except for the first, and the studio brings all of their expertise on the virtual greens to translate the sport to Apple’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jdFCWZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918007" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kgVYIF"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y2g2Su"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiny Wings Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tiny Wings Plus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aBTA28IIgWNp_iopNi6wE4e3WgQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060149/IMG_1415.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Andreas Illiger&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiny Wings Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HFw0mZ"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Tiny Wings Plus&lt;/em&gt;, you play as a tiny bird with the goal of building momentum between sloping hills. If you hit the curve of the hills just right, you pick up speed and fly through the air — which is made even more fun by the bird’s charming chirps of joy. The game is accompanied by a wonderfully peaceful song that you’ll be humming happily long after you’ve stopped playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TFbS84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911831" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dCbHOu"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="amswqS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threes Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NMnt-xuA9_w2gg08LS-IBNPZ2Fs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060142/IMG_1411.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sirvo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look how happy the tiles are!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j6utxH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threes Plus&lt;/em&gt; is a puzzle game where you swipe tiles with numbers to match them together. It’s a bit more complex than I’m making it sound, but the game does a great job explaining its rules. You have as much time as you need to make a move, which makes it more relaxing than some other puzzle games, and it’s all elevated by a delightful presentation — the tiles are full of personality, with silly faces and cute voices, and the music is excellent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x5tNV9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911834" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="6KFRre"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Htm68t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sayonara Wild Hearts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7_P0jJle2UbCj44dXbx8QDXMyxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080427/03_SWH_Screenshot_4K_16_9_NO_UI.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Simogo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Sayonara Wild Hearts&lt;em&gt; is filled with vibrant worlds.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TbxKKD"&gt;My colleague Andrew Webster described &lt;em&gt;Sayonara Wild Hearts&lt;/em&gt; as “an electrifying ride through a world made of pop culture,” and I think that’s pretty apt. Stages are short, too,  which means that you should be able to make progress whether you only have a few minutes to play or a little bit longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Pfx6Je"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sayonara Wild Hearts is an electrifying ride through a world made of pop culture","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882183/sayonara-wild-hearts-interview-switch-ps4-apple-arcade-simogo"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="W6dexR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918024" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="D91kbL"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="faLRDt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/evYFhSM16zGn_YdABwKbRq5mmRQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060097/Screen_Shot_2021_12_02_at_9.41.39_PM.png"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Jump through beautiful landscapes in &lt;/em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="68tpe0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; is a relaxing sidescroller where you jump off rolling hills. The goal is to go as far as you can without crashing into rocks or falling on your head while trying to do a flip. The excellent mechanics are complemented by a gorgeous art style, and you’ll find ample opportunities to use the built-in photo mode for snapping pictures of flips across beautiful landscapes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VZyrxp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911848" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="eFlm80"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hMg9v7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Reader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tfJFOCTKoRzeQfRRxe3EJlbnIHI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080421/Dear_Reader_8plus_05.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;Dear Reader&lt;em&gt; puzzle.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x5BulC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Reader&lt;/em&gt; makes puzzles out of pages of classic books. In this relaxing game, you’re tasked with putting mixed-up passages back in order by filling in blanks, swapping words around, and more. The game offers a clever way to work through a puzzle while simultaneously absorbing some classic literature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fyRLno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918038" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wQA52b"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tM1JQi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jetpack Joyride Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1x-S-JfoaV1QAlK3eWGhFpeWJso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060112/IMG_1404.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Halfbrick Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You’ll collect a lot of coins in &lt;/em&gt;Jetpack Joyride Plus&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wc7m4L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jetpack Joyride Plus&lt;/em&gt; is an action-oriented infinite runner where you collect coins, dodge missiles and obstacles, and pick up items (including ridiculous vehicles like a giant robot dragon) to make it easier to get as far as you can. There are also fun missions that add some structure to each run, and completing them gives you more coins you can spend on upgrades and items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ok5HMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911839" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XVKa0N"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1vBUrw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reigns Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Devolver&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swipe to learn more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSIsno"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Reigns Plus&lt;/em&gt;, a clever card-based monarchy simulator, you swipe right or left on requests brought to you to keep your reign in place for as long as possible. Each decision affects the balance of your kingdom, and some have adverse consequences that may lead to your eventual demise. The simple gameplay and excellent writing make for an engaging game where you’re constantly creating your own story, and it is satisfying to play for just a bit or for a long while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5JtErl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918052" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tpUhRX"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="U3r6H7"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Crossy Road Plus &lt;/em&gt;                                                                                                 &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bC9OgMAnCf9X6A0hE6tuNmh-oC4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060105/IMG_1398_copy.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hipster Whale&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You’ll dodge many obstacles in &lt;/em&gt;Crossy Road Plus&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eXUF0D"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Crossy Road Plus&lt;/em&gt;, you play a tiny voxel animal trying to navigate through busy streets, logs floating down rivers, and other types of perilous terrain, one tiny hop at a time. It’s kind of like a modern-day version of the classic &lt;em&gt;Frogger&lt;/em&gt;, but with more cute digital animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oJAWml"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Crossy Road Plus","description":"Hop to get as far as you can.","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crossy-road/id1559490508"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ySsixC"&gt;

  &lt;p id="vFk4dU"&gt;A ruling (&lt;a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/7658F4CE919568A7852587B900589344/%24file/20-1190-1928330.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;) on Tuesday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has backed up an &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-opens-6-ghz-band-wi-fi-and-other-unlicensed-uses"&gt;April 2020 decision&lt;/a&gt; by the FCC to open up 1,200MHz of spectrum in the 6GHz band for unlicensed use. Unlicensed means anyone can use it, as long as they do so responsibly, covering uses like your future Wi-Fi 6E home network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSMctO"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work"&gt;Wi-Fi 6 connections make more reliable and efficient use of the same spectrum&lt;/a&gt; that’s been in use for the last couple of decades, especially when multiple devices are connected, Wi-Fi 6E routers will work at 2.4GHz and 5GHz plus the new 6GHz band. That has enough room for up to seven maximum capacity Wi-Fi streams to broadcast in the same area at once without interfering with each other or using any existing spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;aside id="SU5GQZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wi-Fi is getting its biggest upgrade in 20 years ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="vkbMZI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:3630921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FedYPO"&gt;Beyond that, there’s already work on a future standard, known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11be"&gt;IEEE 802.11be&lt;/a&gt; or Wi-Fi 7. That could further optimize the use of the new band with even larger 320MHz channels, 46 Gbps maximum transfer rates, and more, but it’s not scheduled to be complete until 2024 (&lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/wi-fi-7-and-beyond.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HwbN4"&gt;In the immediate future, while 6GHz Wi-Fi has the same theoretical top speed as 5GHz Wi-Fi, the extra space means that instead of getting so much interference from other devices and nearby networks, you’ll have a faster, more consistent connection. Last year a representative for the Wi-Fi Alliance told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that this should enable 1–2 Gbps connections over Wi-Fi, similar to what you see now with mmWave 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BfK2w"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T argued against the FCC’s plan, saying the commission failed to identify and address possible interference with “tens of thousands of microwave links critical to maintaining network infrastructure,” talking about the &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/atandt-takes-fcc-to-court-over-5g-backhaul/d/d-id/772166"&gt;wireless tech that keeps many cell sites connected to the wider internet&lt;/a&gt;. In one filing spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/atandt-takes-fcc-to-court-over-5g-backhaul/d/d-id/772166"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T said, “The 6GHz FS [fixed service] band is the only band suitable for long distance transmission, routinely supporting paths between 10-50 miles and, in cases, even longer distances.” Mobile carriers preferred a plan where the FCC would auction off a chunk of the 6GHz bandwidth for use solely by their 5G networks. The FCC said that low-power indoor use protects licensed 6GHz tech like AT&amp;amp;T’s microwave links and TV broadcasts from interference, while “standard power” devices used indoors and outdoors could include automated frequency control to prevent interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="C7xt62"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FCC’s 6GHz decision could help your 5G connections too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JUAm3P"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T did not have a comment today on the outcome. However, at the same time this case is being decided, a similar objection by the FAA is being used against the FCC to pause its ability to start using C-Band spectrum for 5G. As an FAA spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “Landings during periods of low visibility could be limited due to concerns that the 5G signal could interfere with the accuracy of an airplane’s radio altimeter, without other mitigations in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="L2E9sG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FCC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FCC&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have to show no potential for harmful interference ever. FCC does not need to protect against wildly unlikely scenarios. Instead, FCC balances all factors to conclude whether harmful interference is unlikely enough to be negligible risk. /3&lt;/p&gt;— (((haroldfeld))) (@haroldfeld) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/haroldfeld/status/1475906524807634955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YsJ4sJ"&gt;Harold Feld, senior vice president of the advocacy group &lt;a href="https://publicknowledge.org/public-knowledge-applauds-d-c-circuit-court-ruling-affirming-fcc-rules-for-gigabit-wi-fi/"&gt;Public Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; says, “the D.C. Circuit reaffirmed that it will not second-guess the technical expertise of the FCC when the agency balances the needs of both legacy licensed users and new innovations in Wi-Fi.” FCC commissioner Brendan Carr agrees, as his statement mentioned, “Today’s opinion also underscores the FCC’s role as the nation’s lead spectrum regulator. It does so by once again affirming the FCC’s assessment of the risks of harmful interference to existing operations. U.S. leadership in wireless depends on stakeholders continuing to abide by Congress’s long-standing decision to place these determinations squarely within the FCC’s expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCmgG9"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;as we noted in our Wi-Fi 6E explainer last year&lt;/a&gt; when the FCC made this decision, opening up the spectrum for unlicensed use doesn’t reserve it exclusively for Wi-Fi. It could be used by other devices and connections, like 5G. Sometimes mobile carriers use unlicensed spectrum to augment their licensed spectrum with technology that helps speed up connections, and it could come into play again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Wqmceh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Big news! Today the DC Circuit unanimously upheld the FCC's decision to free up the 6 GHz band for more unlicensed use. This decision = more Wi-Fi in more places and it matters because it comes at a time when being connected is more important than ever. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jjN4G8ALzA"&gt;https://t.co/jjN4G8ALzA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1475915000862715916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaOi6B"&gt;New FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has continued to back this measure that was decided under her predecessor, Trump appointee Ajit Pai. She &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairwoman-rosenworcel-court-victory-dc-circuit"&gt;says in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that “Today’s decision is an important step in clearing the way for next generation Wi-Fi access at a time when it is needed most. In this pandemic so much of modern life has migrated online. 6GHz Wi-Fi will help us address this challenge by offering more access in more places, faster speeds, and better performance from our Wi-Fi networks. It will also help us in our mission to connect everyone, everywhere...It is encouraging to read the Court’s strong approval of this work and we look forward to addressing on remand the narrow issue that the court identified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgcSrS"&gt;That narrow issue she mentions is a concern raised by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) about interference in the 2.4GHz spectrum that the FCC didn’t directly address, but backers of the plan appear confident it will be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etTQAh"&gt;WifiForward, an industry group representing companies like Amazon, Google, Comcast, and Arris, &lt;a href="http://wififorward.org/news/wififorward-statement-dc-circuit-court-affirms-fccs-6-ghz-order/"&gt;praised today’s decision&lt;/a&gt;, saying, “The Commission’s decision was smart, well-researched, unanimous and bipartisan. We look forward to consumers getting faster, lower latency Wi-Fi operations in the band, which will include Wi-Fi 6E and eventually next-generation Wi-Fi 7.” The Wi-Fi Alliance that helps establish and roll out the new standards had a similar reaction, &lt;a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-statement-on-us-court-of-appeals-for-the-dc-circuit-decision"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;, “Today’s court decision removes the regulatory uncertainty surrounding use of the 6 GHz band, allowing Wi-Fi Alliance and our members to expedite delivery of urgently needed Wi-Fi 6E broadband connectivity solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another T-Mobile cyberattack reportedly exposed customer info and SIMs</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QSH0QlUPFQHvbkGa28e81UPZDZ8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70325030/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pj5stH"&gt;T-Mobile has suffered another cyberattack after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646439/t-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg"&gt;being rocked by a massive data breach in August&lt;/a&gt;. This time around, attackers accessed “a small number of” customers’ accounts,  according to &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/12/t-mobile-has-suffered-yet-another-data-breach/"&gt;documents posted by &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggOMKY"&gt;According to the report, customers either fell victim to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702544/fcc-rules-sim-swapping-port-out-fraud-cell-phone-carrier"&gt;SIM swapping attack&lt;/a&gt; (which could allow someone to bypass SMS-powered two-factor authentication), had personal plan information exposed, or both. The document shows that the customer proprietary network information that was viewed could’ve included customers’ billing account name, phone and account number, and info about their plan, including how many lines were attached to their account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fIswvB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The person who took credit for the summer hack called T-Mobile’s security “awful”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ystDXu"&gt;This summer, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii"&gt;carrier confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that a data breach exposed almost 50 million customers’ data, with the attacker accessing social security numbers, names, and dates of birth. (A person who claimed to be the hacker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643277/t-mobile-hacker-data-leak-claims-responsibility-criticizes-security"&gt;went on to call the company’s security practices “awful.”&lt;/a&gt;) The information reportedly exposed in December’s breach is less sensitive (and the documents say the customers who had their SIMs swapped have regained access), and is likely not as large in scope. We weren’t able to find widespread reports from customers that said they’d received notification letters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GxbXdL"&gt;

    <title>Samsung resumes Android 12 rollout, updates some foldables, and more S21s</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WTDwyG"&gt;Samsung is starting to roll out its Android 12-based One UI 4 update again after the company paused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782772/samsung-one-ui-4-android-12-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-release-date-features"&gt;its original release&lt;/a&gt; due to reports of bugs and soft bricks from users, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-finally-resumes-one-ui-4-stable-rollout/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The update, which is hopefully a bit more stable, should soon be available for Galaxy S21 phones (including the S21 Plus and Ultra), along with the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obk6Wo"&gt;One UI 4 includes a visual redesign based on Google’s Material You design &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;that debuted with Android 12&lt;/a&gt;. It also includes an updated keyboard. Despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22672780/samsung-android-12-beta-galaxy-s21"&gt;a public beta process&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung’s initial release in November &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-3-buggy-one-ui-4-update/"&gt;had some issues&lt;/a&gt;, and users said they were getting poor performance, saw some screen flicker, and experienced other bugs. Last week, the company &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_stops_one_ui_40_update_for_galaxy_s21_due_to_google_play_issues-news-52394.php"&gt;reportedly stopped rolling out the update&lt;/a&gt; to South Korean customers because of one particular issue with Google Play. Now, that rollout is back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GWNby7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android 12 has had a bit of a rocky rollout&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LdgJ8R"&gt;The Android 12 release has been rocky for other manufacturers too. OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828553/oneplus-buggy-oxygenos-android-12-update-9-pro"&gt;stopped distributing its OxygenOS 12 update&lt;/a&gt; for the 9 and 9 Pro after reports that it was riddled with bugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycx80l"&gt;Even Google hasn’t been immune — the Pixel 6 &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/how-to-fix-google-pixel-6-connectivity-issues/"&gt;had some bugs to start with&lt;/a&gt;, and the update meant to fix them introduced new connectivity issues that Google is &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/23/pixel-6-connectivity-fix-testing/"&gt;reportedly still trying to solve.&lt;/a&gt; The OS is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22724322/android-12-official-launch-date-pixel-phones-samsung-oneplus-xiaomi"&gt;also available for older Pixels&lt;/a&gt;, such as the 3A, 4, and 5A. While &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qf8mhf/android_12_issues_on_pixel_5/"&gt;some users have reported issues on those phones&lt;/a&gt;, they don’t seem to be as bad as those experienced by Samsung and OnePlus users. However, the December update for Android 12 &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/20/does-your-pixel-6-have-the-december-2021-update-yet-poll/"&gt;doesn’t seem to have rolled out to most people’s Pixels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola will try foldable phones again with a third-generation Razr</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Razr’s Quick View display is convenient" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PhCz_aJGzCQ-mAa_V9F0tn229UM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320913/dbohn_201023_4260_0008.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not pictured: a beloved phone.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qgFVqx"&gt;Motorola is working on a new version of its Razr foldable smartphones, according to a Weibo post &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/motorola-razr-3-3079713/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/5517268716/L7wJbmcFk"&gt;The post&lt;/a&gt; is from Chen Jin, the general manager of the Lenovo Mobile Business Group in China (Lenovo is currently in charge of Motorola’s smartphone business), and describes how the company has been quietly working on a new addition to its lineup of foldable phones. It doesn’t have big shoes to fill — Motorola’s first two modern foldables were mediocre phones with hefty price tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7hOxN"&gt;We ran Jin’s post through a few translation sites, and while some parts didn’t make the jump to English, there are consistent details that show up in all the translations. The post mentions that the phone will have a better processor, better interface, and a tweaked appearance. At this early stage, though, it’s hard to say how different the third-gen device will be from the last one — the second-gen Razr was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;more of a spec bump that added 5G&lt;/a&gt;, rather than a marked improvement from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;original Razr foldable&lt;/a&gt; announced in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k3wjvnG52T1oiKg_NhAI7LThbdY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128380/Screen_Shot_2021_12_27_at_12.11.59.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s translation of Jin’s Weibo post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VwPyMK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will the third time be the charm?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9iTVZO"&gt;Perhaps the third attempt at a foldable will be a charm — its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;previous two attempts&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;hard to recommend&lt;/a&gt;, even before Samsung released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;the exceptional Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; for $1,000. Today’s news, though, plus the fact that it’s still providing Android updates for them (albeit at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623902/motorola-razr-foldable-android-11-software-update-in-2021"&gt;a pretty slow pace&lt;/a&gt;), makes it seem like Motorola hasn’t given up on Razr revival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnCMET"&gt;&lt;a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;text=%E6%97%B6%E5%85%89%E5%9B%9E%E5%88%B02019%E5%B9%B411%E6%9C%8814%E5%8F%B7%EF%BC%8C%0Amotorola%20%E6%96%B0razr%20%E4%B8%8A%E5%B8%82%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E4%B8%9A%E5%86%85%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%BE%E7%AB%96%E5%90%91%E6%8A%98%E5%8F%A0%E5%B1%8F%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E6%89%8B%E6%9C%BA%EF%BC%8C%E5%86%8D%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E5%BC%95%E9%A2%86%E4%BA%86%E8%A1%8C%E4%B8%9A%E5%88%9B%E6%96%B0%E3%80%82%0A%E8%81%94%E6%83%B3%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E9%99%A2%E7%8B%AC%E7%AB%8B%E7%A0%94%E5%8F%91%E7%9A%84%E6%98%9F%E8%BD%A8%E8%BD%AC%E8%BD%B4%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%EF%BC%8C%E6%98%AF%E5%BD%93%E6%97%B6%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E5%94%AF%E4%B8%80%E6%8A%95%E5%85%A5%E9%87%8F%E4%BA%A7%E7%9A%84%E6%97%A0%E7%BC%9D%E6%97%A0%E6%8A%98%E7%97%95%E9%93%B0%E9%93%BE%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E3%80%82%0A%E6%88%91%E8%AE%A4%E4%B8%BA%E5%88%9B%E6%96%B0%E6%B0%B8%E8%BF%9C%E6%98%AF%E8%A1%8C%E4%B8%9A%E7%9A%84%E9%A9%B1%E5%8A%A8%E5%8A%9B%E3%80%82%0A%E6%88%91%E5%B8%8C%E6%9C%9B%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E5%8F%A3%E6%B0%B4%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%8C%E6%98%AF%E8%A1%8C%E5%8A%A8%E6%9B%B4%E5%A4%9A%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%9B%EF%BC%8C%E5%8C%85%E6%8B%AC%E9%BB%98%E9%BB%98%E7%94%A8%E5%BF%83%E5%9C%B0%E5%87%86%E5%A4%87%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%89%E4%BB%A3razr%20%E6%8A%98%E5%8F%A0%E5%B1%8F%E6%89%8B%E6%9C%BA%3A%E6%9B%B4%E5%85%88%E8%BF%9B%E7%9A%84%E8%8A%AF%E7%89%87%E7%AE%97%E5%8A%9B%EF%BC%8C%E6%9B%B4%E4%BC%98%E7%A7%80%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%0A%E6%9C%BA%E7%95%8C%E9%9D%A2%EF%BC%8C%E5%BD%93%E7%84%B6%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%98%E6%9C%89%E6%9B%B4%E5%A4%A7%E6%B0%94%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%96%E8%A7%82%E3%80%82%0A%E8%BF%99%E6%AC%BE%E4%BA%A7%E5%93%81%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E5%BD%93%E4%BB%81%E4%B8%8D%E8%AE%A9%E4%BC%9A%E5%9C%A8%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E4%B8%8A%E5%B8%82%EF%BC%81&amp;amp;op=translate"&gt;One translation&lt;/a&gt; of Jin’s post indicates that it could release in China first, which is backed up by the announcement appearing on Weibo. We’ll be keeping our eyes out for more details or an announcement of this phone to see if it’s truly a notable upgrade or just another iteration of a forgettable foldable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcUQZd"&gt;Manuella Foz, a Motorola spokesperson, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company “cannot comment on future devices” in response to an emailed request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVt53W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 27th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The original version of this article incorrectly stated that &lt;/em&gt;Android Police&lt;em&gt; spotted Jin’s Weibo post. The post was actually found by &lt;/em&gt;Android Authority&lt;em&gt;. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>9 great Android apps for your new 2021 Android device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9tIzFxLcRqeqzntLE3sLvPCZWvw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70317351/RoundUpArt_AndroidApps.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A privacy-minded roundup of apps, including a self-care penguin&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zj20b0"&gt;Congratulations on your new Android device! After going through all the legalese to set up your Google account and services (and probably doing the same with your phone manufacturer and carrier), you’re finally ready to make your phone or tablet your own. As you populate your email app with new emails and purge useless apps from your device, now is the time to install some better apps that will improve your life. Here are nine Android apps that made me happier and more organized, without being overly demanding of my user data or annoying with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IOVFJu"&gt;ColorNote Notepad Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="ColorNote" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PL8r78rs9xiI0HgUZfZnZSYDmuQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097002/Screenshot_20211214_190728.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Notes&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ColorNote Notepad Notes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="ColorNote app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Gg2F_00MemnHcWgmFtsuwdCTHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097012/Screenshot_20211214_191628.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ouxxfg"&gt;My home is full of post-it notes strategically placed on multiple surfaces: my desk, boxes, and even the cutting board. And they all serve different purposes: some are shopping lists, some are reminders to return an item, and some are just my to-do lists. The ColorNote app is basically a digital version of my sticky note addiction but organized into a single screen. You can create either a text note or a checklist and customize its color to help you differentiate one from another. The app has a calendar where you can note important dates, share individual notes with your friends and family, or even sync your notes across multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LESRm0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925165" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CLZbrU"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="smTWTg"&gt;Notebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Notebook app by Zoho Corporation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQCampC59WZmgd2-S_QMwdouvx0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097020/Screenshot_20211214_192140.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Zoho&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Notebook app by Zoho Corporation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aAOCy1bTDCdgfLKUUFktjQeDTP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097181/Screenshot_20211214_202422.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YzSTKC"&gt;It’s handy to have a robust note-taking app on your phone: this way, you can jot down detailed notes, include relevant photos from your work meeting, and keep a journal, all on the same device. The free Notebook app from Zoho organizes your notes into digital notebooks with gorgeous digital covers and provides powerful tools to help you document anything and everything. You can embed multimedia elements like sketches, photos, and even audio files into your written notes to add context and can add as many pages as you need. Your data is stored locally, but you can sync your notebooks across multiple devices (including Windows, macOS, and iOS) if you have a Zoho account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="52mgxW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925177" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="K0JWXn"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wA7WOD"&gt;Finch: Self-Care Widget Pet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Finch, the self-care widget pet app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rUXraJAUk_s6MrfrLwKT7UfP3DY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097035/Screenshot_20211214_192518.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Finch Cares&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finch: Self-Care Widget Pet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Finch, the self-care widget pet app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dK8_QldNXYPrqLlWbhLsQahIbSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097039/Screenshot_20211214_192529.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qZkGk8"&gt;We’re coming up to year two of the pandemic, and everyone is feeling various degrees of isolation and exhaustion. Good thing Finch, the self-care pet penguin, is here to guide us to take better care of our mental health. He lives inside the app and prompts you to practice self-care each day: he’ll check in on your mood and will tell you to stretch and set goals periodically, which will earn energy points to help him on his adventures. There is plenty to do in the free version, but you can upgrade to Finch Plus for more self-care exercises; it costs $39.99 for a one-year subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qzcXfu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925188" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ptHhGb"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="24j74j"&gt;CBT Companion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="CBT Companion app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVs0vaMt518GYN0t5xkQbNEINoM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097053/Screenshot_20211214_193100.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Resiliens&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;CBT Companion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="CBT Companion app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s19WY7Qa3TtzIeL5pt0uDVcdzYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097057/Screenshot_20211214_193124.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dF31SE"&gt;If you rather track your mental wellness without the gamification of Finch, the CBT Companion app (Cognitive Behavior Therapy) is a more pragmatic alternative. It offers a safe (and free) space to document your thoughts and provide exercises to practice your CBT skills, whether you’re working with a clinician or not. You can also pay $9.99 per month or $49.99 every six months to access additional exercises and content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AP2SSp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925215" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="m7AIco"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rkexJR"&gt;AfterShip Package Tracker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="AfterShip app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yijL08huhxm26BDMfvpBVCFkyHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097066/Screenshot_20211214_193709.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: AfterShip&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AfterShip Package Tracker &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="AfterShip app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iHW-6D_z2QR5UyNOF6U7O4L1ni0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097068/Screenshot_20211214_193654.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4TW1fw"&gt;Given how brazen porch pirates are these days, it’s more important than ever to know the delivery status of all the packages you’re expecting — whether they’re gifts for friends and family or groceries that need to be refrigerated as soon as possible. AfterShip lets you manually enter each package you’re expecting (rather than demand access to all your emails like other apps) — you just have to provide the tracking number and name the courier delivering the package, and the app can figure out the rest. It’ll show you where each package is on a map, as well as its current status (I usually have to tap on the name of the courier to see the latest update). This way, you’ll know when to expect a package to arrive, so you can grab it before a porch pirate can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vNxpQ2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925226" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Gema93"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DmvEz3"&gt;Discord&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Discord app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3KH_f7jl3ARHdrQeRtWOhO0jUcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097093/Screenshot_20211214_194408.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Discord app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_fp_QNMdeBEhlMikLvaAj6vGAhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097089/Screenshot_20211214_194337.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o5r7Oq"&gt;Ever since Google announced that it will be shutting down Hangouts, a chat app that my parents know and love, I’ve been on the hunt for another easy-to-use up chat app. Discord, the platform beloved by gamers, might just be&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;one. First, I like that you only need to provide your email address to sign up for an account, and you can invite specific people to join your server or room. Within your own private space, you can chat with your friends and family using text or GIFs or have the option to start a video or voice call, whether they have the app or use the web interface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9Xsadp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925236" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="SFpOKa"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nW1rtw"&gt;Firefox Browser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Firefox mobile web browser app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yqOQRggIBEPWzae3fVm8Q8_MUyA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097107/Screenshot_20211214_195145.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Mozilla&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefox Browser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Firefox mobile web browser app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7ZAPWs6VEZ9FWUzMjDmu8GM4WM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097109/Screenshot_20211214_195340.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kl4ZgI"&gt;I got so fed up with the algorithmically generated news on the Chrome web browser’s homepage that I started using the Firefox mobile browser on my phone instead. Like the desktop version, the mobile Firefox browser can block trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, cryptominers, and fingerprinters. Without these sneaky little things following you around, you can just surf the web as usual, though some sites might break without being able to collect data on you. You can even customize your browser by changing it to Dark Mode or moving the search bar to the bottom of the screen to make it easier to use on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FszHNp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925291" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="gnknpy"&gt;My current recipe management is a hot mess: I keep too many web browser tabs opened with recipes I want to find quickly, all on my phone. With Paprika, I can download the contents of my favorite recipes (as long as they’re available online and searchable by Google) and save the ingredients and instructions inside this little app. You can even tweak the recipe you import in case you have any tips or changes you’d like to make to the original. The app includes an editable grocery shopping list, pantry list, and menu, as well as a meal planning calendar to keep your kitchen organized. Although the free version only lets you store a maximum of 50 recipes, you can upgrade to the paid version that enables syncing between devices and storage of an unlimited number of recipes for $4.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVsKXM"&gt;Ever since IBM bought The Weather Company and, with it, Weather Underground — a site I swore by but whose app experience has seen better days — I’ve been on the hunt for a new weather app that is similarly respectful of users’ privacy. The Weawow weather app is that unicorn. It asks you to enter your location rather than demand continuous access to all your GPS data, lets you opt out of sharing your location data with third parties, and doesn’t serve ads along with its forecasts. I appreciate that this app makes it easy to change the units of measurement for those of us who need to, has a swipe-friendly interface, and lets me add it as a widget to my home screen with lots of options for customization.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s foldable P50 Pocket has a circular external screen that’s perfect for notifications</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2r9KRAtEARGT9IwY60Xq2WlNQTM=/124x0:2739x1743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70309517/p506.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EH5xiH"&gt;Huawei has officially announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Fphones%2Fp50-pocket&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F23%2F22851418%2Fhuawei-pocket-p50-foldable-clamshell-phone-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the P50 Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, a clamshell-style folding smartphone that has a circular, 1-inch external display for quick access to notifications and widgets. The device launches in China today, though US sanctions (which mean Huawei can’t use key tech like Google’s Android OS) mean the P50 Pocket won’t make any impact in the West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMMsBM"&gt;Huawei teased the handset &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839272/huawei-p50-pocket-china-launch-foldable"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; with a photoshoot focused on the P50 Pocket Premium Edition that appeared in &lt;em&gt;Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/em&gt;. This version of the device was created with Dutch designer Iris van Herpen. It has a gold or silver finish, and a 3D pattern on the exterior surface that’s typical of van Herpen’s work, resembling feathers or leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RZnpQqv8bdX5y4Me07SYC-pn_P8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122379/p502.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P50 Pocket is Huawei’s third foldable phone, but its first to use a clamshell design. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WLi0VCf1hOreTzv04EivhQW9nMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122378/p501.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s sales pitch for the P50 Pocket focuses, not surprisingly, on the pocketability of the device. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MzESqC"&gt;When unfolded, the Pocket’s OLED screen is 6.9-inches in size, with a 21:9 ratio and 120Hz refresh rate. The device weighs 190 grams and is just 7.2mm thick (Huawei compared it to the iPhone 13 Pro Max which weighs 238 grams and is 7.65mm thick). It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 4G SoC, a 4,000mAh battery, and runs Huawei’s Harmony OS 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7k7eIF"&gt;The P50 Pocket’s main camera array has a 40-megapixel main sensor, 13-megapixel wide angle lens, and 32-megapixel “super spectrum” lens which Huawei says captures a greater range of color. There’s a hole-punch camera built into the main display, but Huawei notes that the phone’s foldable design makes it more convenient to use the main camera for taking selfies, with the 1-inch cover screen doubling up as a viewfinder. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9KPIbU0IcXVyJQQ3L9nDbzJyl8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122383/p504.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P50 Pocket’s external circular screen can be used to display various apps and widgets. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lu5WI0pBGnM_IZZYlNYhtrZO8TY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122381/p503.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accessing basic information like turn-by-turn directions can be done more discreetly. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uLWOkA"&gt;Huawei is positioning that same “cover screen” as a big part of the P50 Pocket’s appeal. As well as showing notifications or the time, the screen can be used for widgets, letting users control music, follow directions, and so on. So, for example, if you’re using your phone to navigate in a new city, the cover screen will show discreet, turn-by-turn directions, rather than forcing you to open up the large 6.9-inch main display to check your position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSKqfK"&gt;The P50 Pocket also has a new hinge which leaves zero gap between the screens when folded. This compares favorably to devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3, which is another clamshell but has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;slight tapering gap&lt;/a&gt; when folded. The P50 Pocket also has face unlock on both the main and cover screen, and a side-mounted fingerprint unlock sensor — handy when many people are still commonly wearing masks during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jMEc9EYobXdJb8o4syzjAciVbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122384/p505.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P50 Pocket folds completely flat, while Samsung’s Z Flip 3 has a slight tapering gap. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="REh8E1"&gt;A standard edition of the P50 Pocket has gone on sale in China today with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for ¥8,988 (around $1,400), while the premium version, with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, sells for ¥10,988 (around $1,700). The standard edition is available in black and white, while the premium edition comes in silver or gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CpHWSx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtVSM_JMy-A?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2O7V6v"&gt;During a presentation, the CEO of Huawei’s consumer business group, Richard Yu said the clamshell design offered a more refined take on folding devices. “It’s very delicate and exquisite,” said Yu. “We want to bring elegance to you, on the go.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title> T-Mobile’s 5G Home Internet: I tried it, and it tried me</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Is cellular good enough for a home internet connection?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZyAzmr"&gt;I was interested in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;T-Mobile’s Home Internet service&lt;/a&gt; from the first time I heard about it: it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711794/t-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut"&gt;$50 (a price that includes the specialized router)&lt;/a&gt;, contract and data cap-free, and is powered by 5G and LTE instead of phone lines or cable. As many people in the US can probably relate, I’m not in love with my traditional ISP — I often push up against its 1.2TB data cap, and $80 per month feels like a lot to pay for the supposedly 400Mbps service I get. So I wondered: could I, a remote worker and heavy internet user who likes to stream video, play multiplayer games, and do cloud backups, actually be fine with internet delivered through the air instead of a cable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axXVco"&gt;After a few weeks of testing, it seems like the TL;DR answer is no; despite &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Feligibility&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22838200%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-5g-cellular-connection-cable-review-gaming-work-from-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile’s site&lt;/a&gt; telling me my address is eligible, the router almost always had a “weak” cellular signal, and there were so many drop-outs and slowdowns that even my non-techie wife was fed up with it after a few weeks. The thing about cellular internet, though, is that my experience won’t necessarily be the same as yours, even if you live a few blocks away from me. So take this review for what it is: one person’s experience with what the service is like in one tiny, non-specific part of eastern Washington state.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6UgddWWUxLMIYc4hj811jPDX8oI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086507/mclark_211109_4928_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s router has decent I/O, but the most interesting ports don’t work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eLzGp6"&gt;Before we get into the particulars of my experience, though, let’s start with what’ll be universal to those using the service: the router hardware and setup process. The router supports Wi-Fi 6, which is nice to see, and has a small circular touchscreen on top that you can use to see various statistics like how many devices are connected to your network and how good its cellular connection is. On the back, there’s a place to plug in the (frankly massive) power brick, two Ethernet ports, a power button, and a few pins that let you plug in a battery backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqUwQu"&gt;Looking at that picture, you may be just as excited as I was when you see that there’s a USB-C port. I have no idea why the router’s manufacturer, Nokia Solutions &amp;amp; Networks, put it there, but it and the RJ-11 phone port are currently non-functional, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fpublic-files%2Fattachments%2FT-Mobile%2520High-Speed%2520Internet%2520Gateway%2520End%2520User%2520Guide.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22838200%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-5g-cellular-connection-cable-review-gaming-work-from-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the router’s manual&lt;/a&gt; (pdf). Bummer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RncpqR"&gt;After you plug the router in and turn it on, it’ll prompt you to download T-Mobile’s app using a QR code displayed on its screen. I had a lot of frustrations with the app at first, until I realized that I had to connect to the router’s Wi-Fi network before hitting the “setup device” button. As far as I can tell, that step isn’t included in the quick setup guide, nor is it hinted at in the app itself. The setup process was a breeze after I figured that out, though, with the app prompting me to choose a name for my network and to set a password (the default name and password are printed on the bottom of the device if you’d rather just leave it as-is). Then, the app told me it was time to find a good spot to put the router where it could pick up a strong signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mhjayubdszaq6huIKXOa7OOgdYM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086515/mclark_211213_4928_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My search for signal didn’t go great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJDoddVDl6Wp_MGWQXiyMyq7uhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086512/mclark_211211_4928_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The router’s power brick is quite large&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UxzQzT"&gt;That process was actually quite fun. The router has a battery in it, so you can walk around with it and test out the signal strength in different spots. (The battery doesn’t seem to work as a backup power source, though. If it’s not plugged into power, you won’t be getting any Wi-Fi.) As I mentioned before, though, this feature didn’t help me out much; upstairs or downstairs, right next to a window or in the absolute middle of my house, I got a steady two bars of service (out of five) — even taking it outside didn’t help, not that I could’ve left if there had I gotten perfect signal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwBhLT"&gt;The app doesn’t make it clear if you’re using LTE or 5G, but digging into the router’s web GUI, you can see what cellular bands it’s making use of. After Googling band designations, I was able to determine that, at time of writing, the router was primarily connected to LTE and was using 5G as a secondary connection. Of course, as T-Mobile says on its site, that could change based on “signal strength and availability, time of day, and other factors.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The T-Mobile router’s status screen, displaying that the primary signal was on the B2 band, and the secondary signal was on the n41 band." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KXOiN5NyMsvNXQejGM3TfJrE1yU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099655/Screen_Shot_2021_12_15_at_12.52.13.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can figure out where your signal is coming from, with a bit of digging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DzCEBE"&gt;I ended up putting the router in what I felt like would be the most advantageous place: on a windowsill upstairs, facing the city. From there, all that was left to do was unplug my current access point (I didn’t want it to talk over the T-Mobile router) and plug my switch into my new cell-powered router to get all of my hardwired IoT devices connected to my new home network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fe8klf"&gt;At first, everything seemed all right. I was getting download speeds anywhere from 73 to 135 Mbps, and I even saw upload speeds as high as 20 Mbps. For the first day or two, I really didn’t encounter any issues — when it came to actually using the internet, it seemed to be the exact same experience as when it was coming in over the wire (and Siri could even play Apple Music on my HomePods, something that’s completely broken on my normal setup for some reason). The router also performed admirably — my laptop’s internet was just as fast in my office right next to the router as it was in my living room, which is downstairs and across the house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjOamWvfftJV6BkdGJXM9u4V9lQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099744/Screen_Shot_2021_12_15_at_13.23.48.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For $50 a month, it’s hard to complain about these results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oUE454"&gt;Slowly, though, hiccups started to pile up. Webpages would occasionally struggle to load, or I’d switch channels in Slack and notice that everybody’s profile pictures were grey squares until their actual smiling faces loaded in one by one (which is how I learned that Slack doesn’t seem to cache those images, for some reason). Once, the speeds were so abysmal that it took Twitter a literal minute to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmk9Xr"&gt;There were even a few periods where the internet would seemingly just be gone for a few minutes at a time, with my web browser immediately telling me that it couldn’t connect when I tried to navigate to a site. The frequency of the outages or slowdowns varied — some days, I only had occasional glitches, and a few days, the internet was basically unusable. There weren’t a ton of perfect days, but they did happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LkVXWn1va8kEhJmH79DSZKh_jpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099757/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_21.12.27.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This result, though, is less ideal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l2A2qC"&gt;From what I can tell, this was almost always an issue with the actual service and not the router (though there was one abnormally long outage that did appear to be a router issue, as it was fixed as soon as I rebooted the machine). I could send packets between the devices in my house just fine — I was just cut off from the outside world. I asked T-Mobile what could’ve caused these issues, and it told me that “while you might see slower speeds during times certain times of the day, due to network congestion, 30 seconds to load a webpage doesn’t sound like a normal experience.” I asked for ideas as to what may have caused it but didn’t receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTMOdT"&gt;As someone expected to be ready to jump on breaking news at any moment, this was obviously not ideal for my use case. I’m sure my boss and coworkers got annoyed with how often I said something along the lines of “okay, I’ll grab that as soon as my internet starts functioning again.” The unreliability also caused issues in my personal life, too — when trying to watch YouTube with my wife, she’d occasionally comment on the “potato resolution.” (Mind you, this is someone who is perfectly content watching DVDs.) I would also run into issues trying to play online games, with my ping swinging like a pendulum from a usable ~30ms to an unplayable 900ms. You can see the results of that in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BCmWyx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What that kind of performance looks like in-game. As a heads up, there is some violence in the clip, so you may not want to watch it if you’re sensitive to that kind of thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5xpMU"&gt;It’s not that T-Mobile Home Internet never worked. I’d say the majority of the time, it was perfectly fine. I was able to play several hours of multiplayer &lt;em&gt;CoD&lt;/em&gt; during my testing, and for the most part, I was shocked that the experience could be as good as it was over cellular. I was also able to do some perfectly acceptable video calls with friends and family. When my service was working, I genuinely couldn’t tell the difference between it and my normal cable provider. It’s just that I couldn’t rely on it working that well, and as someone who works from home, that’s a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="DCBcHD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10926399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wvunmr"&gt;I was hoping to switch to T-Mobile’s home internet if my tests went well — I’m not the type of person who needs to have a screaming fast 200 Mbps plus connection and am even willing to put up with a little spotiness if it means not having to pay $80 a month for Comcast and its data caps. But the first time I got the notification on my computer telling me that my phone’s battery was dead because I’d been tethering to it all day, I knew those hopes had been dashed. (It would’ve been awkward if my phone ran off T-Mobile, but I’m on the Verizon-powered Visible.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sNI7g6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yes, it did feel ironic having to use cellular internet because my cellular internet wasn’t working&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o2Buei"&gt;That doesn’t mean T-Mobile’s internet won’t work for anyone — I may have had a better experience had I been able to get more than two bars of service at my house (though the app usually showed that it still had two bars of signal during outages), and for some people, even the worst of what I experienced would be better than what they’re currently using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dPj7n"&gt;When I was using DSL a year ago, I still probably would’ve chosen T-Mobile over it — the two connections were similarly reliable, but I got faster speeds over cellular when it was working than I used to get over the phone lines. For people who live in an even more rural setting than I do and rely on the internet less, T-Mobile’s internet could be a huge upgrade from dial-up or extremely spotty satellite internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNPrtO"&gt;Speaking of satellite internet, there’s an obvious comparison between T-Mobile’s service and SpaceX’s Starlink; both promise home internet without the need for infrastructure coming to your house. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor-in-chief Nilay Patel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;wasn’t pleased when he tried out the Starlink beta&lt;/a&gt;, and the service is significantly more expensive than T-Mobile’s: you have to pay $499 plus shipping for a satellite dish and $99 a month for the service. But Starlink does promise higher speeds, saying you can expect 100Mbps to 200Mbps downloads. While T-Mobile says that many users can expect “speeds in excess of 100Mbps,” it says that the average is “between 35-115 Mbps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="hUJFvh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neither service excelled for us, but they could get better if they continue to compete&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ot8K5C"&gt;There are other pros and cons for each service. Installing Starlink’s satellite dish is significantly more invasive than plugging in T-Mobile’s router, and I doubt my apartment complex would ever be okay with me sticking something on the roof (even with Starlink’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776563/spacex-starlink-rectangular-dish-router-mounting-internet-satellites"&gt;new, smaller design&lt;/a&gt;). And T-Mobile’s service uses the cell towers that also provide service to our phones — Starlink &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21190273/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-constellation-astronomy-coating"&gt;wants to put 12,000 satellites into orbit&lt;/a&gt; to power its service, potentially obstructing our view of the cosmos. But if your house is in an area without reliable cell service, T-Mobile obviously isn’t going to be an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29L0sB"&gt;It’s conceivable that T-Mobile’s home internet could get better over time — when compared to building out traditional internet infrastructure, adding 5G capacity to cell towers requires much less physical labor. I want to break up with my ISP so badly that I may give T-Mobile another chance every year or two to see if it’s improved to the point that I could use it. The company makes that easy — it’s a no-contract service, so it’d only cost me $50 to get an entire month to give it another shot. If you live at an eligible address and are curious about cellular internet, it may be worth at least giving it a shot. You may end up having a much better experience than I did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oaqmi7"&gt;For now, though, I’ll be sadly trudging back to Comcast. It seems that my dream of $50 unlimited internet was just too beautiful to come true in 2021. If you’re thinking of trying it out for yourself, be sure to read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"&gt;our list of considerations&lt;/a&gt; before you do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor teases its first foldable, the Magic V</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j2pwUinsJGQl1dhcvrq1b99SY2w=/0x0:9999x6666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304931/HONOR_Magic_V.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0burOg"&gt;Former Huawei sub-brand Honor has teased the launch of its first foldable smartphone, the Honor V. An image shared &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3206603957/L7bOzxmnz?pagetype=profilefeed&amp;amp;layerid=4717137157950853"&gt;on its Weibo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Honorglobal/status/1473563964340678658"&gt;Twitter accounts&lt;/a&gt; teases the design of the device, showing a telltale hinge between the two halves of the device. The Weibo post says the “folding flagship is about to be released,” though no exact launch date has been announced and Honor declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b12PHd"&gt;Honor has been open about its desire to release a foldable for some time. As early as 2019, the company’s CEO George Zhao &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/honor-ceo-wants-to-launch-5g-phone-in-2019-foldable-phone-in-2020/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he was interested in producing a foldable under the Honor brand, but expressed concerns that the device would be too expensive for Honor’s younger target market. In June this year, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-foldable-phone-report-dscc/"&gt;reports emerged&lt;/a&gt; that development of such a device was underway at the company, and that its folding display panels were being provided by BOE and Visionox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hL8goF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Unfold all the potential. This is HONOR’s first foldable flagship phone, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HONORMagicV?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HONORMagicV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/kijORIGxg1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kijORIGxg1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HONOR (@Honorglobal) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Honorglobal/status/1473563964340678658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGNVMH"&gt;There aren’t many details on the exact form the Magic V could take, but a &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=3064"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests it could have an 8.03-inch folding inner display paired with a 6.45-inch outer screen. That suggests a device that resembles Samsung’s Z Fold devices (which unfold from a phone form factor into a tablet) rather than its Z Flip (a phone that folds to become more compact). That’s also the form factor used by Honor’s former parent company Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;with its Mate X2&lt;/a&gt;, though now that Honor has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;independent for a year&lt;/a&gt; it’s unclear how similar its upcoming device might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOsB69"&gt;Honor joins an expanding list of companies that have either released, or are planning to launch their own foldables. Samsung and Huawei were two early entrants, but more recently we’ve seen foldables from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, and Oppo, which officially announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price"&gt;Find N phone&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. As well as Honor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22735454/google-foldable-phone-pixel-fold-pixel-6-samsung"&gt;Google is also rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be planning to announce as many as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683566/google-jumbojack-foldable-passport-android-12-1-code-discovery"&gt;two foldables&lt;/a&gt; of its own in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
