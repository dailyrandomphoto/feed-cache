    <title>Midrange Samsung Galaxy S21 FE appears again in leaked manual</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pZZyie-EG6IUu6-eJO8tlaTIF0E=/1x0:1147x764/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801948/msedge_cwyTkgz4Rn.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render of the unannounced phone from the leaked manual.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-5g-user-manual-makes-no-mention-of-microsd-slot/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_CNo4aG0QZ2u7M8IsX0IwJps0YlMeItRJH4K0Ll1_CzQ-1630443096-0-gqNtZGzNArujcnBszQ0l" target="_blank"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qYtVdr"&gt;A user manual for Samsung’s Galaxy S21 FE (aka “Fan Edition”) has been &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-5g-user-manual-makes-no-mention-of-microsd-slot/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_CNo4aG0QZ2u7M8IsX0IwJps0YlMeItRJH4K0Ll1_CzQ-1630443096-0-gqNtZGzNArujcnBszQ0l"&gt;published online by &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, giving us another look at the unannounced midrange counterpart to the company’s Galaxy S21 flagship. As you’d expect from a manual, the document spends more time outlining how to use the phone than it does describing its specs, but it’s a guide for what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHbW9V"&gt;For starters, images included in the manual appear to confirm that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1400945475558199298"&gt;previously leaked renders&lt;/a&gt; are accurate. That means we’re looking at a similar design to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt;, albeit seemingly with a less premium finish. Three cameras are shown on the S21 FE’s rear while on the front there’s an in-display fingerprint scanner and a hole-punch notch for a selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-XbCbJJT3RrrhDqLSUVxy0rvuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819522/msedge_K8x7I5KuYH.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One section of the manual describe’s the phone’s reverse wireless charging feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9wSAPz"&gt;Other details mentioned in the manual include an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, an ultra-wide camera, and support for Samsung’s Wireless DeX software to allow the phone to mirror its display to supported TVs and use its screen as a touchpad. There’s no sign of a headphone jack, microSD card slot (which appeared on last year’s S20 FE), or an included charging brick in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncznlI"&gt;In terms of specs, &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; notes that previous rumors claim the phone will be powered by a Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 processor depending on the market, which would put it roughly in line with the Galaxy S21 flagship from earlier this year. Its battery is expected to have a capacity of 4,500mAh, with support for 25W fast charging and reverse wireless charging also mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2SlIL"&gt;The question now is when, if ever, we might see the phone officially announced. Earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;Samsung was forced to deny reports&lt;/a&gt; that it had cancelled production of the unannounced phone due to production difficulties caused by the global chip shortage. The emergence of a user manual suggests the phone will see an official release, though it doesn’t outright confirm it. For reference, last year’s Galaxy S20 FE was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451701/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-price-release-date-specs-features"&gt;announced on September 23rd&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of its release on October 2nd, suggesting we might not have long to wait to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Retailer leak suggests Google’s Pixel 6 will have 23W wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-qv5vUzcehk_Pc9n9yiH5-Y2z1M=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69800616/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tELnPI"&gt;Google may be working on a new wireless charging stand for its Pixel phones, according to a leaked image of a retail inventory backend mentioning a “Google Pixel 23W WL Stand” &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/31/exclusive-googles-new-pixel-stand-for-the-pixel-6-should-support-23w-fast-wireless-charging/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The name suggests the charger could support 23W wireless charging, and if Google does end up releasing this stand, it seems likely that the upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro would support 23W charging as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lW-ybK-aHCSF8Z4WcoegbJT7GoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22818317/Pixel_Stand_23W_668x445.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/31/exclusive-googles-new-pixel-stand-for-the-pixel-6-should-support-23w-fast-wireless-charging/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Android Police’s&lt;em&gt; image seemingly revealing the existence of a new Pixel Stand.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CiWQpx"&gt;That wireless charging speed, if accurate, would be more than the iPhone 12’s maximum 15W wireless charging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514850/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging-speed"&gt;with a MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt; and surpass the 10W wireless charging offered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17941176/google-pixel-stand-wireless-charger-announcement-price-release-date"&gt;by the original Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt; (which is still available on &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_stand?hl=en-US"&gt;Google’s online store&lt;/a&gt;). Google hasn’t replied to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEe95k"&gt;The company revealed the first details about the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;earlier in August&lt;/a&gt;. They seem like promising devices, especially with their new Google-designed Tensor system on a chip, and 23W wireless charging could make them an even more enticing purchase. Google plans to release those phones this fall, and if this new charging stand is real, it seems likely it will come out alongside them — especially since the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628702/google-pixel-6-charger-not-included"&gt;won’t ship with an included charging brick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung adds new foldable features to its older Z Fold and Z Flip phones with One UI 3.1.1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buD9WNxv5g64Fx49Rs1fERJ5Kw0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798834/vpavic_200907_4181_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="osL0Cu"&gt;Samsung’s new Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 phones add a bunch of clever new features designed for foldable phones as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/featurestories/samsungs-one-ui-3.1.1-bring-next-level-foldable-experiences-to-galaxy-z-series-users"&gt;One UI 3.1.1 update&lt;/a&gt;, but if you already own a Fold 2, Z Flip, or even the original Galaxy Fold, you’ll still be able to get some of the new additions without shelling out for a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PUS8kAXRx8uLumDtDMpWnUamNkw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817418/Screen_Shot_2021_08_31_at_12.32.22_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GLFk6Z"&gt;Available on all five foldable models is the new Drag and Split feature, which — as the name implies — allows you to tap and drag on a link to open it side by side with the original webpage or message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWWtZP"&gt;Samsung’s larger Fold models will also be getting the adjustable app windows for its multitasking mode, allowing you to adjust the height and width of the individual apps when you have multiple apps open at once. The older models will also get the automatically rotating app function, custom aspect ratios, and a newly added split view for messaging apps. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hlnuZ_QEOjBJus5XCBqAGI6Zts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817410/Untitled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TyEcbMre1ZTAoCPORr58VsZ6uDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817412/04_Set_Aspect_Ratio_for_Apps.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1Emj4"&gt;Lastly, for both the Z Fold 2 and the earlier Z Flips, Samsung is adding the option to force apps to use its “Flex mode” that puts video content on one half of a folded display, with playback controls on the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E41n3o"&gt;Samsung has worked to help keep its older foldables relevant even while rolling out new software features on its newer devices before. It offered a similar update for the original Fold last year when it released the Galaxy Z Fold 2 that added several new features it had introduced with the second-generation foldable. It’s a testament to how new the foldable field is in general. Samsung is still figuring out the best ways to use these new form factors, but it’s also not leaving behind early adopters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YmwIP"&gt;The One UI 3.1.1 update should be rolling out to Fold 2 and Z Flip owners starting today, while the original Galaxy Fold is expected to get the update “around a week later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGwFMQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcBvah"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new Z Flip and Z Fold get battery-protection feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TlX0XDeaSythk3kZHm40Zlpm27w=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69796778/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Flip 3. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rfgWFP"&gt;The Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 have inherited a battery protection that was previously exclusive to Samsung’s tablets, which when enabled is designed to maximize the lifespan of batteries, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-3-and-z-flip-3-have-tablet-like-battery-protection-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The “Protect battery” feature limits the devices’ charge level to 85 percent, preventing the full charge to 100 percent that’s believed to wear down batteries over years of use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFdn3B"&gt;The feature, which is available in the Settings app under Device Care &amp;gt; Battery &amp;gt; More battery settings, comes with the obvious trade-off of limiting the max battery life you’ll get out of either phone per charge. In our reviews we noted that both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; average around a day of battery life by default, which means you might have to commit to a midday top-up if you’re only charging to 85 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GAIxMTE82Jpdst1iupx3VlQSDWQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22816692/Screenshot_20210830_123117_Device_care.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Protect battery feature in the Samsung Settings app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bMDNAs"&gt;That might be a price worth paying if you want to get as many years of use as possible out of the pricey flagship phones, especially considering the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum#:~:text=Is%20all,custom%20glue."&gt;difficulty of repairing either device&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0S0Jug"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; notes that this isn’t the first time Samsung has included the Protect battery feature on its devices. But this is the first time it’s appeared on one of the company’s phones. The feature is available with One UI 3.1.1 on the two foldables, but reportedly hasn’t appeared on its other smartphones &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s10-s20-note-10-note-20-get-one-ui-3-1-1-updates/"&gt;with the same update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjCLaj"&gt;Other smartphone manufacturers already offer similar battery protection features. However, while Samsung’s feature won’t ever let a device’s battery charge beyond 85 percent, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210512"&gt;Apple’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054830/oneplus-optimized-charging-battery-overnight-overcharging-percentage"&gt;OnePlus’s&lt;/a&gt; equivalent features only temporarily limit their charging levels to 80 percent, before aiming to top up their batteries to 100 percent just before they’re unplugged to limit the time spent fully charged.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile CEO calls latest data breach ‘humbling,’ claims it’s committed to security</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="T-Mobile Kicks Off $3 Billion Bond Sale To Buy 5G Spectrum" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2V0H5We63VdhnL-hKeUivSOYQgw=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69788941/1231755320.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2NwJ4"&gt;A recent T-Mobile data breach &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;coughed up the information of more than 50 million people&lt;/a&gt;, including some who aren’t current customers or never were. The 21-year-old hacker who says they’re responsible for the attack already did &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105"&gt;an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; calling its security “awful,” and now CEO Mike Sievert is speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zn26vr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is T-Mobile’s fifth incident in four years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17ezIQ"&gt;Sievert says he’s taking a moment to update us now that the breach is contained and the investigation is “substantially complete.” “Keeping our customers’ data safe is a responsibility we take incredibly seriously and preventing this type of event from happening has always been a top priority of ours,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fcyberattack-against-tmobile-and-our-customers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;he writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBxgkw"&gt;It’s true that these attacks happen to many companies, but it’s hard to take the statement as sincere when T-Mobile has had at least five breaches since 2018. That includes this one, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security"&gt;two in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, plus one each for 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAdfgU"&gt;To do something about it, T-Mobile is partnering with cybersecurity firm Mandiant and consultants at KPMG to tighten things up. Will that put an end to this ridiculous streak of insecurity? No one can know, but that’s more than the “sorry for any inconvenience” notes released &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcustomers%2F6305378821&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcustomers%2F6305378822&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of the past breaches, and of course, all the subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637797/tmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans"&gt;got a free year of Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Too bad it’s only happening after a hacker made off with enough IMEI/IMSI, driver’s license, and social security data to spend the next few years stealing identities and phone numbers at will.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There’s a tiny tube amp in this super pricey Astell &amp; Kern music player</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Astell &amp;amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cccVmGKqjPuRUCIjbQJXc-skt0o=/0x0:2234x1489/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784480/akultimahero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qj4Sdc"&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern’s latest portable music player is as high-tech as it is extravagantly expensive. &lt;a href="http://aknewsroom.armourhome.co.uk/2021/08/27/astellkerns-latest-aultima-sp2000t-portable-digital-audio-player-packs-a-next-gen-triple-amp-system/"&gt;The $2,399 A&amp;amp;ultima SP2000T&lt;/a&gt; releases in October, and it stands out from the brand’s previous models like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/8/15752152/astell-kern-kann-review-audiophile-pmp"&gt;Kann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18518150/astell-kern-kann-cube-audiophile-pmp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Kann Cube&lt;/a&gt; with a new triple amp system. These things are never affordable, and the price might seem especially out there if you’re content with listening to music from a streaming service on your phone. But there’s some real engineering swagger in effect here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoQaKO"&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern managed to fit a tiny tube amp inside of this device. Specifically, it uses &lt;a href="https://korgnutube.com/en/"&gt;a Korg Nutube 6P1&lt;/a&gt;, which conceptually operates just like larger tube amps, only it’s small enough to fit in a device that can go in your pocket. To avoid any interference that the resonance of the tubes might generate, Astell &amp;amp; Kern says it developed a modular structure on the PCB just for the tubes, fixing them with silicone to minimize vibrations. The best part of the press release is that it says its design “uses magnetic forces to float the amp in the air to reduce internal noise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFeiKo"&gt;Audiophiles reading this have every right to be skeptical that Astell &amp;amp; Kern can reproduce the effect of a tube amp with such minuscule hardware, but it at least deserves some credit for trying. Check it out in action below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_lqdmIZNEYjqezZgxbkSgzwPqMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22809604/astellandkern7.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fe5okP"&gt;When you’re using the A&amp;amp;ultima SP2000T, it’ll let you switch between its OP-AMP setting for “ultra-clarity and a dynamic playback,” the tube amp mode for a “uniquely warm” sound, and a hybrid mode that blends the best of both modes into one. Additionally, this model has an ESS ES9068AS quad DAC for further enhancing the way your music sounds. This is apparently Astell &amp;amp; Kern’s first player to feature a quad DAC, as well as the Replay Gain utility, which adjusts the volume of all of your music (up to 24-bit / 192kHz) to the same level, so one song isn’t quieter than the other. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Astell &amp;amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tUwgXcceOaZDdFuE7MPxTLt_rMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22809612/akultima.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Astell &amp;amp; Kern&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yFN7nK"&gt;Now, for some specs. The player is compatible with 2.5mm, 3.5mm, and 44.mm plugs. It has a five-inch 1080p touchscreen, which might be the least impressive thing about it. You can charge it and transfer files via its USB-C port. It’s also Wi-Fi ready, supporting the company’s AK File Drop utility that lets you transfer files wirelessly via PC, phone, or even an FTP on the same network. You’ll obviously get the best sound quality with a set of high-end, wired headphones or earphones, but it also supports Bluetooth 5.0 with 24-bit aptX HD and LDAC codec support. Lastly, it has 256GB of flash storage built in, but it supports up to 1TB via microSD. It has a 4,200mAh battery, which the company says will get you about nine hours of FLAC playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfGcDP"&gt;For people with the sort of budget that allows this kind of purchase, this seems like something you may want to try before you buy. It’s possible that Astell &amp;amp; Kern created something great that defies its pocket-sized stature, but it’s just as likely that this has some overly ambitious first-gen quirks to iron out. You’ll be able to find out yourself when it releases in October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hacker claims responsibility for T-Mobile attack, bashes the carrier’s security</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pXBsKWjydj1cjknGWtEqYLTyrtc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69780942/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RiK1Qi"&gt;A person claiming to be behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/15/22626270/t-mobile-investigating-report-customer-data-breach"&gt;T-Mobile data breach&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii"&gt;exposed almost 50 million people’s info&lt;/a&gt; has come forward to reveal his identity and to criticize T-Mobile’s security, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. John Binns told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;that he was behind the attack and provided evidence that he could access accounts associated with it, and he went into detail about how he was able to pull it off and why he did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiPTSg"&gt;According to Binns, he was able to get customer (and former customer) data from T-Mobile by scanning for unprotected routers. He found one, he told the&lt;em&gt; Journal&lt;/em&gt;, which allowed him to access a Washington state data center that stored credentials for over 100 servers. He called the carrier’s security “awful” and said that realizing how much data he had access to made him panic. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, it’s unclear whether Binns was working alone, though he implied that he collaborated with others for at least part of the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="unWKVf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Binns called T-Mobile’s security “awful”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LFRnna"&gt;The information the hacker gained access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii"&gt;includes sensitive personal data&lt;/a&gt;, like names, birthdates, and Social Security numbers, as well as important cellular data like identification numbers for cellphones and SIM cards. T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fadditional-information-regarding-2021-cyberattack-investigation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F26%2F22643277%2Ft-mobile-hacker-data-leak-claims-responsibility-criticizes-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “confident” that it’s “closed off the access and egress points the bad actor used in the attack.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXOl4y"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105?page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report&lt;/a&gt; goes in depth into Binns’ history as a hacker. He claims that he got his start making cheats for popular video games and that he discovered the flaw that ended up being used in a &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/09/satori-iot-botnet-operator-pleads-guilty/"&gt;botnet that attacked IoT devices&lt;/a&gt; (though he denies actually working on the code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vX0k93"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Binns describes a troubled relationship with US intelligence services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gEbWj5"&gt;According to Binns, his relationship with US intelligence services is troubled, to say the least. A lawsuit that appears to have been filed by Binns in 2020 demands that the CIA, FBI, DOJ, and other agencies tell him what information they have on him. The lawsuit also accuses the government of, among other things, having an informant try to convince Binns to buy Stinger missiles on an FBI-owned website, attacking Binns with psychic and energy weapons, and even with being involved in his alleged kidnapping and torture. An FBI response to his lawsuit denied he was being investigated by the bureau for the botnet or having information related to the alleged surveillance, and abduction, and torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4ArHL"&gt;Binns told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that one of his goals behind the attack was to “generate noise,” saying that he hopes someone in the FBI will leak information related to his alleged kidnapping. It’s not likely that Binns’ situation will be improved now that he’s shone a spotlight on himself as the person who hacked one of the US’s major carriers. However, if his reports about how he gained access to a vast trove of T-Mobile data are true, it paints a concerning picture of the carrier’s security practices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will let you unlock your Z Fold 3’s bootloader, but at the cost of your cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/knM-Jr7vnUGfjkP4IUKRywCWjMk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770961/dbohn_210820_4722_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jPLB9Z"&gt;Samsung seems to be trying to discourage users from modifying the software on their new Galaxy Z Fold 3s, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-unlock-bootloader-broken-camera/"&gt;giving them a message&lt;/a&gt; that unlocking the phone’s bootloader will render the phone’s cameras unusable (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/24/samsung-cripples-the-galaxy-z-fold3-if-you-unlock-the-bootloader/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/11/20/unlocking-bootloader-sony-phones-no-longer-wrecks-camera-pie/"&gt;isn’t the first time&lt;/a&gt; we’ve seen phone manufacturers pull this sort of trick, but it seems to represent an escalation in Samsung’s fight against its users who want to gain complete control over their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJ7TsX"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unlocking-bootloader-will-disable-the-camera.4321957/"&gt;XDA Forums user confirms&lt;/a&gt; that after unlocking the bootloader, the Z Fold 3’s cameras were completely non-functional: facial recognition, loading the camera app, and trying third-party camera apps all failed for them. The user reports that re-locking the bootloader made the cameras work again. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LvBdSg7b7QZMbhQfWtdtpKa3zOE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803288/20210820_121528.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unlocking-bootloader-will-disable-the-camera.4321957/#post-85506611" target="_blank"&gt;白い熊 on XDA Forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The message shown to users trying to unlock their bootloader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HvNHFu"&gt;According to a photo (seen above) posted by a member of the forums, the message users receive when trying to unlock their Z Fold 3’s bootloader reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ote4a"&gt;Unlock the bootloader to install custom operating system software. Doing so will cause the camera to be disabled and may cause your phone or apps to stop working correctly. To prevent unauthorized access to your personal data, your phone will be factory reset, which will erase all data, including files and downloaded apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Fmd"&gt;Volume up: Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cw29iv"&gt;Unlock bootloader (may void warranty)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seJ0cP"&gt;Volume down: No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpUVLP"&gt;Do not unlock bootloader and restart phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3vtrq1"&gt;(A factory reset is &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/239798/how-to-unlock-your-android-phones-bootloader-the-official-way/"&gt;generally standard&lt;/a&gt; after a bootloader unlock, as is the possibility of a voided warranty.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsQDBi"&gt;While this may be an escalation, Samsung has previously had a somewhat unfriendly stance towards modders. &lt;a href="https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/faqs/faq-115013719548.htm"&gt;Samsung’s Knox documentation says that&lt;/a&gt;, if you root your phone and flash it with an unofficial Android build, anything having to do with its Knox security will &lt;a href="https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/faqs/faq-115013562087.htm"&gt;be permanently disabled&lt;/a&gt;, and will only be restored if you replace the phone’s hardware. This means that, if you root a Samsung phone, features like Samsung Pay and Secure Folder won’t ever work again. To be clear, this doesn’t happen if you just unlock your phone’s bootloader — it only occurs after you make changes to the phone’s OS (though doing so is the main reason to unlock your bootloader, so it’s perhaps a distinction without much difference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xiX36T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving up your cameras seems like an unreasonable ask&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yCF0eD"&gt;While that’s certainly more destructive and permanent, you could also argue that it’s not unreasonable to give up Samsung Pay and Secure Folder if you really want root access to your phone. Giving up your ability to take pictures is a much bigger ask. Plus, unless Samsung’s changed how Knox works, rooting your Fold 3 after unlocking it will also shut down those features, leaving you with a phone that has no cameras, no NFC payment, and no Secure Folder (not that you could take any sensitive pictures anyways). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FElkUr"&gt;There are some ways in which turning off features for rooted users makes sense. In the case of Knox, the phone doesn’t know what code is running on the phone, so it can’t make any promises of security. In the same vein, it wouldn’t be unreasonable if Samsung didn’t let you use the Fold 3’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00062630/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;facial recognition unlock feature&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s hard to see how turning off the cameras entirely is anything but a punishment for users who want to mod their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BDAExV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to see how turning off the cameras entirely is anything but a punishment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RxYodS"&gt;If you’re a US-based Samsung customer, though, you’d have to try a lot harder to even run into these issues — because Samsung reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.thecustomdroid.com/sampwnd-unlock-bootloader-samsung-snapdragon/"&gt;doesn’t officially allow bootloader unlocking&lt;/a&gt; on Snapdragon-based phones sold in the US. There are services you can pay for that claim to unlock your US phone’s bootloader, but it’s not &lt;a href="https://www.hardreset.info/devices/samsung/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2/faq/bootloader-unlock/"&gt;the relatively simple process&lt;/a&gt; found on the global version of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hP20J"&gt;At the moment, it’s unclear whether the Galaxy Z Flip 3 will also have the same limitation, though one of XDA Forums’ members &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unlocking-bootloader-will-disable-the-camera.4321957/page-2#post-85526781"&gt;posted a picture of the unlock bootloader screen on their Flip&lt;/a&gt; and the notice doesn’t mention the cameras. Samsung didn’t immediately answer &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s questions about whether the policy also applied to the Flip, or provide a statement about the policy in general.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 review: nearly normal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;As good as foldables get, but is that good enough?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xQB9CN"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the best possible case Samsung can make for a phone that unfolds into a small tablet. It’s the fourth iteration of the same basic idea, refined and repaired over the course of years following an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;embarrassing false-start failure&lt;/a&gt; on the first attempt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZNUhk"&gt;Because this is a story of refinement, the changes since the last model are minor. But added together, they make this the model that crosses that hard-to-define boundary between experimental and normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNu5wD"&gt;Although the Z Fold 3 feels like a refined, established product, it’s still not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; normal. It’s a marvel of material science that’s by turns wonderful and awkward. And its price is also still far from normal, too — even after a price drop, it starts a $1,799.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RcEeL"&gt;If you like the basic idea of the Z Fold but have been waiting for Samsung to fix its biggest issues, the steady and relentless refinement on display here is worth a look. If you think the whole idea is an extravagant and silly technical flex, none of these changes will change your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mc8Pwg"&gt;Even though those two opinions are almost diametrically opposed, I can’t really argue with either one. The Z Fold 3 is great &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YeDdPp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10715493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RRb1pC"&gt;When closed, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is still an extremely tall, narrow, and thick slab of a device that’s more akin to a remote control than a traditional phone. It’s awkward to fit into a pocket both because of its shape and its weight — although it’s slightly lighter than last year, fundamentally it’s still the size of two phones and it has the weight to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EvLSb"&gt;Samsung’s big addition to the hardware is IPX8 water resistance. I’ve dunked it in a vase and held it under a fountain without issue. I won’t speak to whether the durability improvements Samsung made this year will be enough to keep the phone intact long term, but at least initially it seems solid. I don’t feel like I need to baby this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There is still a gap between the two sides when closed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_SOyXM4kUAnemSG1_v1jplj080=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801028/dbohn_210820_4722_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is still a gap between the two sides when closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rzq5s"&gt;There’s still a gap at the hinge when it’s closed, but otherwise all the tolerances between the parts are tight. Samsung is still using tiny brushes inside the hinge to keep dust and debris out, but I’d still recommend keeping it away from any serious amount of grit or sand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRRJOd"&gt;The outer screen fills out the entire front of the display, and though it’s 6.2 inches diagonally, it feels much smaller because it’s so narrow. Samsung increased the refresh rate on the exterior display to 120Hz, so everything on it feels smooth; the main compromise when using it is that it’s just really hard to type on. Swipe-typing helps, but Samsung’s built-in keyboard still isn’t as good as Gboard at accuracy, and you’ll want to stick with Samsung’s keyboard since it has better options when in tablet mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtczAF"&gt;Open the phone up and you’re treated to the 7.6-inch display, which is bright, sharp, and has the same 120Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling with less of the “jelly effect” that plagued the earlier versions. It’s a great screen with one glaring problem: the interior selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i0qPO"&gt;Samsung opted for an under-display camera, one of the first to ship in the US. The camera itself is terrible, only 4 megapixels, and even those few are compromised by taking in light through a screen. Camera quality isn’t the problem, though — if I want to take a selfie, there are literally four other cameras I can use that are better. Think of it as a webcam for video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The under display selfie camera is more distracting and annoying than a hole punch." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jpVMUPRs-KkHsfU8l84P89IXTbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801091/dbohn_210820_4722_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The under-display selfie camera is more distracting and annoying than a hole punch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="btt3K1"&gt;Instead, the problem is how the screen looks when the camera is off. When there’s a brighter background over it — or text — it has a screen-door look that is both ugly and distracting. If I shift my head or the phone even a little, there’s a moire effect that instantly draws my eye — even after a week of use it’s still happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ehtMo"&gt;Samsung wants the Z Fold 3 to be a showcase of its technical prowess, but that desire has led it into putting a too-experimental feature on a premium device. The under-display camera literally mars the experience. Samsung needs to put a setting in to turn the screen over the camera off entirely and just revert this thing back to a hole punch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWYJuY"&gt;Surprisingly, that is my only real complaint about the interior screen. Which is saying something since it’s a giant, 7.6-inch display that folds in half. Samsung put a lot of emphasis on how it has made this screen stronger, thanks to how it re-layered the different internal components from the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The crease is still visible at an angle but not bothersome at all when you look straight on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aUwlAY86Tg80SJk418z7sH0zdOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801031/dbohn_210820_4722_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The crease is still visible at an angle but not bothersome at all when you look straight on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S Pen won’t work on the outer screen, but works fine on the main interior screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nVm5rOXMbsDkIDPjcicXaK2GEAc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801032/dbohn_210820_4722_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S Pen won’t work on the outer screen but works fine on the main interior screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T1mpI0"&gt;It still uses Samsung’s so-called “Ultra Thin Glass,” but that glass is still covered with layers of plastic. The top layer is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate"&gt;PET&lt;/a&gt; screen protector which feels much more like any other screen protector you’ve used on a phone. It radically changes the experience of the Z Fold 3 as it’s a lot more resistant to smudges and indentations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sz1Nxq"&gt;There is still a crease between the two halves, and I still am not too bothered by it. It’s mostly visible at an angle and largely goes away when you’re looking at the phone straight on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPPaLU"&gt;The other new layer on this screen is made up of a couple of Wacom digitizers so you can use a new kind of Samsung S Pen stylus with it. The Fold-specific S Pen is sold separately, and there’s no place to store it without a special case, which means you’ll be spending upward of $50 or even $80 more if you want to use stylus input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6Mkc0"&gt;Drawing and sketching with the S Pen on the large screen is nice — there’s not much lag, it seems accurate even across the crease (where algorithms detect position), and it glides cleanly across that new PET layer. Unfortunately, the Fold wobbles when you draw on a table, even with one of Samsung’s own cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcVgl6"&gt;You also can’t use the stylus on the outer display, which means it’s not as good at taking quick notes as the Galaxy Note. Hopefully Samsung won’t discontinue that line for people who really do depend on having quick and easy access to a stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Flex mode on the Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EAbQ9OfiFbggbG3dJGiF8tNPks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801034/dbohn_210820_4722_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flex mode on the Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="A8ga7P"&gt;Samsung has also refined the software that runs the Z Fold 3. Shockingly, One UI 3 has made the Android tablet experience halfway decent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch474o"&gt;That is a strange thing to type as I (and every reviewer I know) have been ragging on Android tablets for nearly a decade. But the subtle improvements Samsung made this year wrangle Android’s biggest tablet problems into flexible, usable little windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SN3N5i"&gt;Too many Android apps don’t re-form themselves to work better on tablet-size screens; they’re just stretched-out phone apps. That’s still the case this year, but some basics like getting multiple columns in Gmail or tabs in a browser work. Others, like Twitter or Slack, still look a little dopey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mbpn3W"&gt;However, Samsung’s multitasking system for windowing and managing apps has become adept at putting those recalcitrant apps in their place. You can drag and drop icons from a sidebar to put things into split screen or into a three-up layout. You can even pin that sidebar to be permanently visible for an even more tablet-like experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="SKr6Zb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Against all reason, Android on a tablet is good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The multitasking software on the Z Fold 3 is much more flexible than before." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S79WEKoUZ0TCUgJpSBFyqUC_56g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801132/Screenshot_20210823_123216_Twitter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The multitasking software on the Z Fold 3 is much more flexible than before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JDRRO3"&gt;Critically, you can more easily adjust the width and height of those various layouts now by simply dragging the dividers around. You can also tap those dividers to easily rearrange the various windows if you don’t want to deal with dragging them around. Saving those custom layouts to the sidebar is simple, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3aQ9C"&gt;Finally, there’s a “labs” feature that lets you strong-arm apps into playing nice with this new system if they haven’t been updated to resize properly on a modern Android device. You can set Instagram to fill the entire screen, for example, or resize TikTok into a little distracting-as-hell side rail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ht1jhh"&gt;Let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though. The iPadOS ecosystem of apps is still light-years ahead of Android when it comes to tablet options. But Samsung and Google have finally managed to push the Android tablet experience to the point where I am comfortable doing more advanced things than I can on a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXBhPn"&gt;But really, the thing about the big screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is that it is a &lt;em&gt;big screen&lt;/em&gt;. Big screens are great. They’re nicer for watching movies, playing games, reading books, and everything else. All the things that people like about outsized slabs like Samsung’s Ultra line or Apple’s Max phones are even better on this big screen. Hell: I can actually read and annotate PDFs on this device without having to tediously pan, pinch, and scroll around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zGMPW"&gt;It helps that the Z Fold 3 is excellent from a performance perspective. The Snapdragon 888 processor and 12GB of RAM keep up with multiple active windows at once. The 4,400mAh battery, however, isn’t quite what I would hope for in terms of longevity. I can get through a full day with four-ish hours of screentime, but getting more than that would require changing my usage in a way I wouldn’t want to. We’re used to tablets lasting forever, but this folding tablet is more akin to your average phone when it comes to battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f5OtsQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10715575"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fPBXJ4"&gt;The cameras are also more akin to what you’ll get on an average phone, not a flagship. The main selfie camera on the outside is 10MP and it’s perfectly serviceable. On the rear, you’ve got three 12-megapixel sensors for wide, ultrawide, and 2X telephoto. The only real change Samsung made since last year was adding optical image stabilization to the telephoto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zvu9kF"&gt;The results are classic Samsung: punchy, bright, sharp, and vivid — too often to a fault. Samsung tunes its camera to look great on Samsung screens, not to be true to what your eye might see in the moment. It’s a choice I don’t love, but at least on a technical level the images are good enough to work with. Similarly, the Z Fold 3 does a passable job with night photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JND4qs"&gt;For $1,800 I’d like something better, but that money is going toward the screen, the waterproofing, and all the rest. If camera quality is your top priority, this isn’t the phone for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 under a waterfall." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JbHY3hS0iqsnM6nfPEqyNoYIOUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801024/dbohn_210819_4722_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 under a waterfall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="21V3bb"&gt;Samsung’s big goal for its folding phones this year is to make them “mainstream.” For the Z Flip 3, Samsung hopes it can become a premium alternative for people who would otherwise buy a “normal” phone. For the Z Fold 3, the goal is to creating an entirely new class of flagship that its competitors can’t match. In both cases, Samsung’s putting all this effort in because its more traditional flagship phones are plummeting in popularity as Xiaomi and others undercut it on price while matching quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JKNd6"&gt;Samsung’s goals aren’t our problem, but they do lead to a benefit: folding phones that we can simply judge on their merits instead of simply gawking at tech demos. They’re still too spendy in my opinion, but I wouldn’t second-guess anybody who decides to spring for one of them. You know how you’ll be using your phone and at some point you have to walk over to your laptop to actually get something done? With the Z Fold 3, it takes me longer to get to that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5K2FRk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As good as it gets, but that might not be good enough&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3pxu3"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is as good as it gets when it comes to a phone that unfolds into a tablet. Until there’s another technological breakthrough that can change the flexibility of glass or the size of batteries, I don’t see anything fundamentally better than this coming along for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4gd00n"&gt;However, it’s still an awkward thing to carry around and use one-handed, and it’s still super expensive. The tradeoffs just don’t seem worth it. Then again, once upon a time we all said the same thing about the tradeoffs for big-screened phones like the Note. For a small sliver of tech-savvy people who know what they’re getting into, I could actually recommend the Z Fold 3. But for most people, as good as it gets is still not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi moves away from its ‘Mi’ product branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-h5HloF3s93W4qA5aaP7l2tgOTE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69767365/DSCF5652.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c1gMiZ"&gt;Xiaomi is phasing out its “Mi” product branding, a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; Products including flagship smartphones like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;this year’s Mi 11&lt;/a&gt; will instead simply carry the Xiaomi name. The news was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-ditches-mi-branding/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XH8Z8C"&gt;“Starting in 2021 Q3, Xiaomi’s product series ‘Mi’ will be renamed to ‘Xiaomi,’” says the spokesperson. “This change will unify our global brand presence and close the perception gap between the brand and its products. This change may take some time to take effect in all regions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35KsqH"&gt;Xiaomi says that it’ll still keep the Redmi brand around, meaning that the higher-end Xiaomi products will form a distinct line alongside Redmi products. Xiaomi products “represent the pinnacle of technology and offer a premium experience,” according to the company, while Redmi products “bring big innovation at a more accessible price point and are aimed at a younger audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pRTAA1pDRtWYVHJNG5B6nOYjEtM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802188/WechatIMG118.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7Bog7E"&gt;This naming convention “will also be applied to our ecosystem and IoT products over time,” says the spokesperson, though the Mi brand logo will continue to be used in Xiaomi’s Mi Home stores for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlkLvs"&gt;This month’s announcement of the latest phone in the Mi Mix series served as a harbinger of the shift, since Xiaomi referred to it as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617979/xiaomi-mi-mix-4-announced-under-display-camera-cup-specs-price"&gt;Xiaomi Mix 4&lt;/a&gt;. The previous phones were called the Mi Mix, the Mi Mix 2, and the Mi Mix 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzmv7b"&gt;The Mi brand was largely used in Western markets, presumably for readability and pronunciation reasons — phones like the Mi 11 are already called the Xiaomi 11 in China, for example. But Xiaomi evidently believes its company name is now recognizable enough and better represents its products.&lt;/p&gt;
