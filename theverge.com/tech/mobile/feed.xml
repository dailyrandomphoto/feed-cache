    <title>H&amp;M and other Western brands gone from Apple Maps and other apps in China</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eH7Nbo"&gt;Locations for H&amp;amp;M clothing stores in China were not showing up on Apple Maps searches in China on Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/h-m-is-erased-from-chinese-e-commerce-over-xinjiang-stance-11616695377?st=j58swhl0vn8ankj&amp;amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, amid growing anger among Chinese consumers at the company’s decision to stop sourcing from the Xinjiang region. The company has more than 400 stores in China, but all H&amp;amp;M locations are now missing from maps, ride-hailing, and e-commerce applications, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1zxjE"&gt;It was the latest of several Western brands, which also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/25/business/hm-nike-xinjiang-cotton-boycott-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;includes Nike and Adidas&lt;/a&gt;, that are facing calls for boycotts in China. The US &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/citing-uighur-mistreatment-u-s-restricts-imports-china-s-xinjiang-n1240039"&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt; it would stop imports of cotton and other goods from Xinjiang, over allegations the Chinese government uses forced labor in its production. Earlier this week, the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/biden-admin-announces-sanctions-against-chinese-officials-over-human-rights-n1261745"&gt;Biden administration announced&lt;/a&gt; it was imposing sanctions against two Chinese officials over what it says are ongoing human rights abuses against China’s Uyghur Muslim population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jhuk49"&gt;In response, the Chinese government and state-run media have urged boycotts of Western brands. On Wednesday, The Communist Party’s Youth League in China pointed to H&amp;amp;M’s &lt;a href="https://hmgroup.com/sustainability/fair-and-equal/human-rights/h-m-group-statement-on-due-diligence-/"&gt;statement from last year&lt;/a&gt;, in which the company said it was “deeply concerned by reports from civil society organizations and media that include accusations of forced labor and discrimination of ethnoreligious minorities in Xinjiang.” H&amp;amp;M said it would not source cotton from the Xinjiang region as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyGhiT"&gt;In a statement &lt;a href="https://share.api.weibo.cn/share/211447276.html?weibo_id=4618372530047437"&gt;posted to its Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, H&amp;amp;M China said the company did not “represent any political position” and that the company “continues to respect the Chinese consumer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FXNxT"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported that searches for H&amp;amp;M in Apple Maps on an iPhone, or China-based Baidu Maps, did not return any results, while other retailers appeared as normal. H&amp;amp;M was removed from the Alibaba e-commerce platform this week, according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgJAcX"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Area-codeless local calls will largely go away in October — but for a good reason</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8wfuIZiOVNjpyC3vewIKJ2r1RBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69027840/akrales_180620_1777_0481.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="devX27"&gt;In many places, you can call up a neighbor or local pizza parlor just by dialing seven numbers, as long as you have the same area code — but that ability will soon be going away, in order to make the National Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Crisis Lifeline easier to reach. If you live in one of the areas where the change is taking place, you’ll soon have to dial 10 numbers whether you’re making a local call or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bS7Tsp"&gt;Each cellular carrier has a support page explaining the change (we’ll link to all of them below, and a list of the area codes will be included at the end of the post), but the basic gist is that, starting October 24, 2021, anyone trying to call a local number using only seven digits will be met with a recording telling them to hang up and try again with the full area code. The change will apply to landlines, cell phones, and VoIP systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGBhIp"&gt;Here are the carrier support pages for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3kqb4U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fcoverage%2Ften-digit-dialing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22351130%2Farea-codes-10-digit-dialing-soon-required-for-certain-places-national-suicide-prevention-hotline-988" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XwNeda"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fidpassets%2Fimages%2Fsupport%2Fhome-phone%2F988-English-and-Spanish-tagged.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22351130%2Farea-codes-10-digit-dialing-soon-required-for-certain-places-national-suicide-prevention-hotline-988" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h0qaWo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsupport%2Fresidential%2Fhomephone%2Farea-international-info%2Ften-digit-dialing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22351130%2Farea-codes-10-digit-dialing-soon-required-for-certain-places-national-suicide-prevention-hotline-988" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="OUs5AB"&gt;It’s worth noting that seven-digit calling isn’t going away for everyone — there are only 37 states with affected area codes, and in some of those states &lt;a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_76c3369c-7b8a-11eb-bb14-cf281c5e0400.html"&gt;it will only cover specific regions&lt;/a&gt;. The change will still affect a lot of people though — there are plenty of states, including Alaska, Hawaii, New Hampshire, and New Mexico where the entire state will have to switch over to 10-digit dialing. People in large portions of Washington, Michigan, Colorado, Arizona, and other states will also be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ha4GY9"&gt;The change is happening due to &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-100A1.pdf"&gt;an FCC order&lt;/a&gt; from July 2020, which mandated that the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline should be reachable at a three-digit number, 988, to make it easier for people in crisis to reach the hotline. After the decision was reached, the responsibility for actually getting the system working was passed to the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalnanpa.com/pdf/PL_556.pdf"&gt;North American Numbering Plan Administrator&lt;/a&gt;, which is now in charge of making sure that calls to 988 end up at the Lifeline starting on July 16, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GQV05"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note that calling 988 will not connect you to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline until July 16, 2022. If you or a loved one is in crisis, please call 1-800-273-8255&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bc4Zg5"&gt;The technical reason for why this change is required is reasonably simple — some phone numbers start with 988, so if someone were to dial a number like 988-9999, the phone switch wouldn’t know how to interpret it. Since there isn’t a 988 area code, requiring all 10 digits ensures that no phone numbers will start with 988 and confuse the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwc5Jk"&gt;If you’re struggling to remember the last time you made a call without typing in the area code, you’re not alone — places like &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ethernet-ip/7-digit-dialing-disappears/d/d-id/587253"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/21/why-youll-need-10-numbers-to-make-a-call-from-the-510/"&gt;parts of the Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; have been requiring 10-digit dialing for years. Of course, tapping in a specific number at all is less common in an age of more messaging, fewer calls, digital address books, and phone number links on Google Maps. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Competitively priced Motorola G100 and G50 offer 90Hz screens and 5,000mAh batteries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ex2R7u7FDA_J2DB2Uju9aKZ4B0Y=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026703/both.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 6.7-inch Motorola G100 (left) and the 6.5-inch G50 offer big batteries and 5G connectivity.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oiVLTU"&gt;Motorola &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fblog%2Fhello-moto-g100&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22350611%2Fmotorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has unveiled the G100 and G50&lt;/a&gt;, two midrange phones headed first for European and Latin American markets. Both offer displays with fast 90Hz refresh rates for smooth scrolling and animations, 5G connectivity, and they embrace Motorola’s ethos of “more battery, more better” with huge 5,000mAh cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMcr76"&gt;The higher-end G100 is poised to compete with the likes of the Google Pixel 4A 5G with a Snapdragon 870 5G processor, 8GB of RAM, and a dual wide / ultrawide selfie camera for €499.99 (~$587). The G50, on the other hand, looks like a respectable, budget-friendlier device — its faster refresh rate, 6.5-inch screen is still a bit rare at its €229.99 (~$269) price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NlJWI5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10412513"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDG5VZ"&gt;The Motorola G100 offers a large 6.7-inch 1080p LCD. Its 8GB of RAM is accompanied by 128GB of storage, which is expandable thanks to a MicroSD card slot. Support for sub-6GHz 5G frequencies is included, as is Wi-Fi 6. The G100 features a main 64-megapixel camera (lacking optical stabilization, sadly) complemented by a 16-megapixel ultrawide that doubles as a macro camera, complete with a built-in ring flash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVGckN"&gt;Two selfie cameras are offered — an approach Google took with the Pixel 3 and subsequently abandoned — with a 16-megapixel wide and 8-megapixel ultrawide. Up to 6K / 30p video recording is possible with the main rear camera, and the rear ultrawide can capture 4K / 30p clips — something found on many flagships but isn’t too common in this upper midrange class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hNRPCM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10412520"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ClDon0"&gt;The Motorola G50 uses a slightly smaller (but still, you know, large) 6.5-inch 720p screen. It includes a slower Snapdragon 480 chipset with 4GB of RAM and 64 or 128GB of storage (thankfully, there’s a microSD slot here, too). The rear triple-camera array is mostly just a 48-megapixel standard wide camera; the accompanying 5-megapixel macro and 2-megapixel depth sensor don’t offer a whole lot of practical use. If none of that sounds too compelling, consider that the European pricing equates to well under $300. If the device were to make it to the US, it would be well-equipped to compete at that price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFkxlJ"&gt;There’s no confirmation just now if and when these phones will be sold in the US, but we’ll be keeping an eye out for them. In the meantime, the G100 goes on sale in European and Latin American markets today, while the G50 will arrive in “selected European markets” in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qmpa6"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi teases camera with liquid lens on upcoming Mi Mix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GcAEpsXkImSJuHJtGqvM_FqLWBI=/114x0:1256x761/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69024652/msedge_w9Th5ctGTx.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A4EZXC"&gt;Xiaomi’s upcoming Mi Mix handset will include a camera with a liquid lens, the company teased in a pair of &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4618643268962302"&gt;Weibo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4618645768244225"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; today. As its name implies, the lens typically includes a layer of liquid, and the lens’s focus and focal length are changed by applying an electrical voltage. Xiaomi says the lens will allow one camera to take everything from telephoto to macro shots as well as offer fast autofocus. The phone is due to be unveiled on March 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysMNvI"&gt;Liquid lenses have been around for a number of years, but they’re typically found in industrial applications where traditional lenses with moving mechanical parts might wear out too quickly. But their compact size and versatility make them an appealing prospect for smartphones. In theory, one camera with a liquid lens could combine several of the cameras that are found on the backs of most flagship smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c5RKhl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Xiaomi's mysterious MIX phone will use liquid lens for the first time in the world &lt;a href="https://t.co/73ob6uBsyn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/73ob6uBsyn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1374970048444502017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KyYqLw"&gt;As well as Xiaomi, there were rumors last year that &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_to_use_liquid_lens_in_its_flagship_devices_next_year-news-46480.php"&gt;Huawei is also exploring&lt;/a&gt; using the technology in its smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMPTBH"&gt;A liquid lens feels fitting for Xiaomi’s Mi Mix line, which has featured some pretty experimental designs over the years. In 2018, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18201055/xiaomi-mi-mix-3-slider-no-notch-phone-design"&gt;Mi Mix 3&lt;/a&gt; was among the first phones to offer a mechanical sliding selfie camera, and the following year, it showed off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/24/20881378/xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-announced-wrap-around-screen"&gt;Mi Mix Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, which had a screen that wrapped around almost the entire device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vivo X60 flagship series announced with Zeiss-branded camera system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEV6tL8QcY4DGjvLaJYlxo_z9A4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69024156/DSCF7692.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RgiJzL"&gt;Vivo has announced its latest international flagship phones, the X60 series. The highest-end model is the X60 Pro Plus, which is coming first to India, while the X60 and X60 Pro are also launching in the UK and several other markets. Vivo previously launched the X60 series in China but with substantially different specs to these new global models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NtRkq"&gt;Vivo’s main focus with the X60 series is the cameras. The company has started a new partnership with Zeiss that it says includes the use of T* optical coating and swirly bokeh simulation based on the lens maker’s classic Biotar design. These kinds of collaborations tend to be more marketing hype than genuine selling points, but the X60 Pro Plus’ formidable camera bump at least looks the part.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZYlEe9ldzVQZsbFpCA_qZAVmHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22396445/DSCF7696.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ak9i5g"&gt;Whether Zeiss had anything to do with it or not, the X60 Pro Plus has some impressively versatile camera hardware. Its quad-camera setup consists of a 50-megapixel Samsung GN1 primary sensor, a 48-megapixel ultrawide with Vivo’s gimbal-style stabilization, a 32-megapixel 2x telephoto, and an 8-megapixel 5x periscope telephoto, as well as a 32-megapixel selfie camera. We’ll have to see how the system performs in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNgWrF"&gt;The rest of the X60 Pro Plus’ spec sheet is suitably flagship-level. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and comes in a single blue vegan leather model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The display is a 6.56-inch 1080p OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. The battery is 4,200mAh and fast-charges at up to 55W, though unfortunately (as is universally the case for Vivo) there’s no wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ldUGXhV7cDteShRU434B9NMZ2vI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22396444/DSCF7693.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1dYiCn"&gt;The X60 and X60 Pro step down to a triple-camera system with a 48-megapixel main sensor, a 13-megapixel ultrawide, and a 13-megapixel 2x telephoto. They both use a Snapdragon 870 processor, which is paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage on the X60 Pro and 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage on the X60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je0qnb"&gt;The X60 Pro Plus will cost Rs. 69,990 (~$960) in India, while the X60 Pro is Rs. 49,990 (~$690) and the X60 is Rs. 41,990 (~$580). Preorders begin today and the phones will be available on April 2nd. Details on the release in Europe and other markets will be announced later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 780G chipset promises more flagship features for less</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1rTouLyZH7-32uTWAeoRpmEiqqE=/0x44:2266x1555/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023942/Screen_Shot_2021_03_25_at_9.53.34_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TZbFC"&gt;Qualcomm has announced its latest 7-series processor, the Snapdragon 780G, which trickles down features from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;company’s flagship Snapdragon 888 chipset&lt;/a&gt;, while still offering manufacturers (and, by extension, consumers) a more affordable phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzR4xq"&gt;The 780G takes the new top slot in the 7-series lineup, replacing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995714/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-chip-affordable-5g-phones-processor-low-price"&gt;765G&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/11/21252114/qualcomm-snapdragon-768g-5g-processor-765g-improvements-cpu-gpu-update"&gt;768G&lt;/a&gt; (the latter being largely a frequency-boosted version of the former). Obviously, there’s the usual boost in performance: the 780G features Qualcomm’s Kryo 670 CPU, which the company says offers a 40 percent boost in performance, and a new Adreno 642 GPU for up to 50 percent faster graphics compared to the 765 model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="437hTs"&gt;But the 780G also enables some new functionality, like the Spectra 570 triple ISP (image signal processor), which, like the Snapdragon 888, allows for phones to capture three simultaneous photo or video feeds at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpoyQ6"&gt;And like the Snapdragon 888, the Snapdragon 780G features Qualcomm’s sixth-generation AI engine running on a new Hexagon 770 processor, which can perform 12 trillion operations per second (TOPS) — twice that of its predecessor, even if it still pales in comparison to the 26 TOPS that the Snapdragon 888 offers. It also features the second-gen Sensing Hub that Qualcomm debuted on its flagship chipset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2p74Z"&gt;Lastly, the 780G has improved connectivity features, with an integrated Snapdragon X53 5G modem that promises up to 3.3Gbps speeds on Sub-6 GHz 5G networks. And like its pricier sibling, the 780G adds support for Wi-Fi 6E, meaning phones with the new chip will be able to take advantage of the fastest Wi-Fi speeds around as well as Bluetooth 5.2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6TEYv"&gt;The first phones with the Snapdragon 780G are expected to release in the second quarter of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five-year-old Fairphone 2 getting updated to almost three-year-old Android 9</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxzWufzeiJ-OPelFEGoc64fl6XM=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023493/jvincent_160412_1017_8176.0.0.1484136509.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Farphone 2 was originally released five years ago.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by James Vincent / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0b6Xx"&gt;Sustainable smartphone manufacturer Fairphone has gotten Google’s certification for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fen%2F2021%2F03%2F25%2Fandroid9-fairphone2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22349953%2Ffairphone-2-android-9-update-sustainable-long-term-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its Android 9 update&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/13/11414936/fairphone-2-review"&gt;Fairphone 2&lt;/a&gt;. Getting certification for a nearly three-year-old version of Android doesn’t sound that impressive until you realize that it’s running on a phone originally released five years ago when it ran Android 5. The roll-out of the software starts today, and will continue until April 18th, Fairphone says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjzkIV"&gt;It’s a length of support that’s basically unheard of among Android phone manufacturers. Although Fairphone 2 owners aren’t going to be able to enjoy the latest Android 11 features, the more important thing is that they’re running a version of Android that’s still officially supported. Google’s &lt;a href="https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-03-01"&gt;latest Android security bulletin&lt;/a&gt; from this month includes multiple fixes for security issues in Android 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FB9yH0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In order to get certification, we had to pass approximately 477,000 Google tests”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jfQlPs"&gt;The Fairphone 2’s Android 9 update has been in the works for a while and was released in beta &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fen%2F2020%2F06%2F18%2Ffairphone-2-gets-android-9%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22349953%2Ffairphone-2-android-9-update-sustainable-long-term-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;way back in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Fairphone outlined the challenges it had in trying to support such an old phone, including the fact that Qualcomm no longer provides support for the processor inside the device, a Snapdragon 801, which originally announced back in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAK1pH"&gt;“To get Google certification for Android 9 for Fairphone 2 just as we hit five years of support for the smartphone is a huge achievement for Fairphone,” says CEO of Fairphone Eva Gouwens. “In order to get certification, we had to pass approximately 477,000 Google tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="824F4E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we’re celebrating a milestone. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fairphone?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Fairphone&lt;/a&gt; 2 gets a major software upgrade 5 years after launch. We started Fairphone with a mission to encourage smartphone longevity by disrupting the electronics industry and this signifies that commitment.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/jdpOxZKEHQ"&gt;https://t.co/jdpOxZKEHQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/bQGbj54CEi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bQGbj54CEi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fairphone (@Fairphone) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fairphone/status/1375048421971746818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SwZzZM"&gt;“We want to show the industry that this kind of thing is possible, that a smartphone doesn’t have to be discarded after 2-3 years, we can prolong it’s lifespan,” the CEO added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVEX66"&gt;The only other smartphone manufacturer that offers a similar length of support for its devices is Apple, which last year released iOS 14, its latest phone OS, for its 2015 iPhone 6S. Android manufacturers, while behind Apple, are improving. Samsung now offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security updates for its recent Galaxy devices&lt;/a&gt;, while Google offers three years of updates for its Pixel phones, and OnePlus says it &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/a-notice-about-oxygenos-11-for-our-previous-devices.1351579/"&gt;plans to release Android 11 for its 2018 OnePlus 6 and 6T&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByEc3U"&gt;The Fairphone 2’s update to Android 9 this long after release bodes well for the company’s long-term support of its more recent Fairphone 3 and 3 Plus phones. The company says the phones should be updated to Android 11 in the second half of this year, with “one more major Android upgrade” coming thereafter. Software support and spare parts availability is set to continue until 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arizona Senate skips vote on controversial bill that would regulate Apple and Google app stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12’s OLED screen is excellent." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uaxrmAOr0oIn5bVpoP3Zd_82UVA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69021754/vpavic_4243_20201018_0141.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Px9JIH"&gt;The Arizona State Senate was scheduled to vote on an unprecedented and controversial bill Wednesday that would have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;imposed far-reaching changes on how Apple and Google operate their respective mobile app stores&lt;/a&gt;, specifically by allowing alternative in-app payment systems. But the vote never happened, having been passed over on the schedule without explanation. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;watched every other bill on the schedule be debated and voted on over the senate’s live stream, but Arizona HB2005, listed first on the agenda, never came up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91sY1K"&gt;One notable Apple critic is now accusing the iPhone maker of stepping in to stop the vote, saying the company hired a former chief of staff to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey to broker a deal that prevented the bill from being heard in the Senate and ultimately voted on. This is after the legislation, an &lt;a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/proposed/H.2005COBB.pdf"&gt;amendment to the existing HB2005 law&lt;/a&gt;, passed the Arizona House of Representatives earlier this month in a &lt;a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview?SessionID=123"&gt;landmark 31-29 vote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZo6Kk"&gt;“The big show turned out to be a no show. The bill was killed in mid-air while on the agenda with a backroom deal. Apple has hired the governor’s former chief of staff, and word is that he brokered a deal to prevent this from even being heard,” said Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, a fierce Apple critic who submitted testimony in support of HB2005, on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1374842497000673289"&gt;Twitter this afternoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqFFBr"&gt;Apple declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kTduxV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The big show turned out to be a no show.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzgvhY"&gt;It was well-known prior to today’s scheduled vote that both Apple and Google had hired lobbyists to combat the bill, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/apple-google-lobbyists-arizona-bill"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;because it directly threatened the companies’ industry standard app store commission of 30 percent. If the Arizona bill passed the senate and was signed into law by Ducey, it would have made the state a haven for app makers looking to sidestep the App Store and the Google Play Store’s payment systems, which are the mechanisms the companies use to take their cuts of all app sales and in-app purchases of digital goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2x3kDh"&gt;It could have also caused all sorts of additional headaches for both companies by forcing them to either institute a patchwork system of state-specific enforcement, or by potentially forcing them to stop doing business in Arizona altogether while opening the door to lawsuits against the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV9P5i"&gt;In testimony in front of the Arizona House earlier this month, Apple’s chief compliance officer, Kyle Andeer, argued that the App Store provides enough value to developers to justify the 30 percent cut. “The commission has been described by some special interests as a ‘payment processing fee’—as if Apple is just swiping a credit card. That’s terribly misleading. Apple provides developers an enormous amount of value — both the store to distribute their apps around the world and the studio to create them. That is what the commission reflects,” Andeer said in written testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7QnRI"&gt;“Yet this bill tells Apple that it cannot use its own check-out lane (and collect a commission) in the store we built,” he added. “This would allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free — even if they’re selling digital goods, even if they’re making millions or even billions of dollars doing it. The bill is a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="p9yUEK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A number of Democrats publicly objected to the bill &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nV7sfp"&gt;It’s worth noting that the bill also faced considerable opposition in the Arizona House not by big business-loving Republicans, but instead by Democrats. A number of Democrats publicly objected to the bill and voted against it on the grounds it was potentially unconstitutional for interfering with interstate commerce and also that it interjected Arizona into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;California legal fight between game developer Epic Games and both Apple and Google&lt;/a&gt; over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the Android and iOS platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj59JQ"&gt;The bill, which was primarily sponsored by Rep. Regina Cobb (R-5), is one of many that have popped up in state legislatures around the country challenging Apple’s and Google’s longstanding policies around the mobile app economy. These bills can be traced back to growing antitrust pressure against Big Tech mounting in both Europe and Washington, DC, and they &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-next-big-tech-fights-are-in-state-capitals-11615714201"&gt;represents a new local and state front in the ongoing fight over the tech industry’s outsize power&lt;/a&gt; and whatever methods lawmakers may employ to try and reign it in. Other arenas include California, where Epic launched its own fight, and the European Union. which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;launched antitrust investigations into the App Store and Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt; over anticompetitive claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJ2Wes"&gt;Both Apple and Google operate the two most dominant app stores in the world, and while the Google Play Store allows alternative app stores and therefore alternative payments systems, Apple does not. That means all digital purchases on iOS are subject to Apple’s mandated 30 percent cut, or in some cases a reduced 15 percent cut, though Apple has been criticized for cutting secret deals, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;those it has made with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; over Prime Video subscriptions and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change"&gt;later in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;, to exempt certain types of purchases when it’s strategically convenient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zivmsg"&gt;Both companies in the last six months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;announced changes&lt;/a&gt; to the commission structure that allows for smaller developers, which represent the vast majority of app makers on both Android and iOS, to claim a reduced 15 percent cut, though that has done little assuage the app store critics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jZ1f51"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These state app store bills have become lobbying battlegrounds between Big Tech and its fiercest critics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5OCugI"&gt;These antitrust proposals, like HB2005, are largely the work of the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF). The CAF is an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453745/spotify-epic-tile-match-coalition-for-app-fairness-apple-app-store-policies-protest"&gt;industry group formed last year&lt;/a&gt; consisting of Epic, Spotify, Tinder parent company Match Group, and dozens of other companies that have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the status quo of the mobile app economy and the app store owners’ ironclad developer agreements. Some of these companies, like Spotify, have for years complained of unfair treatment from Apple and have accused the company of prioritizing its own software over competitors through its use of App Store rules and iOS requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORWNpa"&gt;The CAF began &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/technology/north-dakota-tech-apps.html"&gt;lobbying lawmakers earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, first in North Dakota and now in multiple states including Arizona, to instigate the introduction of bills like HB2005. While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;North Dakota bill failed&lt;/a&gt;, Arizona’s was seen as a more promising alternative because it focused solely on in-app payment systems, while the North Dakota one also mandated that operating system owners allow for alternative app stores, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOSu9z"&gt;“The legislative session is not over. We will continue to push for solutions that will increase choice, support app developers and small businesses and put a stop to monopolistic practices,” said Meghan DiMuzio, the CAF’s executive director, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="982M8k"&gt;Now, the bill’s fate is now in question, and it’s not immediately clear what happened. Rep. Cobb, the bill’s sponsor, did not respond to a request for comment. The Arizona governor’s office and the office of the Arizona State Senate Majority Leader Rick Gray (R-21) also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Er7bnR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 24th, 10:12PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from the Coalition for App Fairness. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDnlbd"&gt;Apple has a rocky relationship with some iOS developers because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;its seemingly arbitrary decisions over what gets published and when&lt;/a&gt; — and now, because of a dumb miss, it’s being accused of putting profits ahead of human rights in Myanmar by the founder of ProtonMail and ProtonVPN, even though that’s probably not what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0d777E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fblog%2Fapple-blocks-app-updates%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22348961%2Fapple-protonvpn-app-security-update-rejection-myanmar-andy-yen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Proton founder Andy Yen writes&lt;/a&gt; that Apple blocked an important security update to the company’s privacy-protecting ProtonVPN software simply because Apple didn’t like the app’s description, specifically this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ifnRaK"&gt;Whether it is challenging governments, educating the public, or training journalists, we have a long history of helping bring online freedom to more people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="S7sR08"&gt;If you’re having a hard time finding anything objectionable there, you’re not alone — but Apple told Proton it wasn’t okay to encourage “users to bypass geo-restrictions or content limitations.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ic-9MFpvsv7azZgAvWDNllRo0bs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395261/apple_blocks_protonvpn_update.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uEVg5e"&gt;The context here is that VPNs have become a critical tool for protesters in Myanmar to sidestep an huge internet crackdown during the country’s ongoing, bloody military coup. One researcher &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/myanmar-citizens-find-ways-around-crackdown-on-internet?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that VPN use has increased 7,200 percent since early last month, when the government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266031/facebook-myanmar-blocked-instagram-whatsapp-military-coup-protest"&gt;blocked Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/6/22269831/myanmar-orders-block-twitter-facebook-instagram-military-coup"&gt;Twitter, and Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0U1f9I"&gt;I’m with &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/03/apple_protonvpn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;’s John Gruber on this&lt;/a&gt;: I highly doubt Apple made a conscious decision to deny ProtonVPN to Myanmar — the company’s smart enough to know how that would look, and it’s not like the &lt;em&gt;app&lt;/em&gt; was blocked, just a security update. Yen is an outspoken critic of the App Store now, having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;told Congress (and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) last year how he’d been strong-armed by Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6z9VyC"&gt;But the fact it’s just a security update makes the rejection &lt;em&gt;extra dumb&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;because Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299814/apple-app-store-policies-ios-bug-fixes-approval-dispute-appeal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;explicitly said&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; that it’d no longer hold up bug fixes because of these arbitrary guideline violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wKSyY"&gt;Regardless, Apple comes off looking a little like the bad guy here, especially now that ProtonVPN has taken the high road and ceded to Apple’s demands. “Due to the emergency situation in Myanmar, we removed the language about challenging governments which Apple found objectionable, and the app was finally approved,” Yen tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x31FBS"&gt;That perception seems like it’s going to be increasingly hard to fight, now that antitrust scrutiny of Apple’s App Store has been heating up in Congress and the courts, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341511/apple-epic-trial-tim-cook-tim-sweeney-craig-federighi-phil-schiller-mark-rein-testify"&gt;the Epic App Store trial set to begin May 3rd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bj9fA"&gt;It doesn’t help when Apple is seemingly caught breaking its own rules and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app"&gt;needing to apologize&lt;/a&gt;, particularly when it could be seen as retaliation against an app developer (Yen) who’d previously spoken out. Last year, many other developers weren’t willing to come forward and admit they’d been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;forced to add in-app purchases to their apps&lt;/a&gt;, specifically because they feared retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The lower-cost OnePlus 9R is official, and it sounds surprisingly strong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-zItN_GfnjTA-cyQGDGhjtf8Xho=/0x0:1203x802/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019938/colors_banners_color_1_banner0_pc_ae27cc_crop2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9R will be sold in black or blue color options.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Photo: OnePlus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kw3HcE"&gt;Yesterday’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"&gt;OnePlus event&lt;/a&gt; covered the high-end 9 and 9 Pro, but outside of that spotlight, the company has quietly revealed a smartly specced, less-expensive model: the OnePlus 9R. CEO Pete Lau &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338504/oneplus-9r-less-expensive-phone-confirmed-india-5g"&gt;confirmed last week&lt;/a&gt; that the 9R was on the way and would launch in India. It’s now &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2F9r&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22348430%2Foneplus-9r-specs-price-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;listed on the company’s Indian website&lt;/a&gt; starting at ₹39,999, which is about $550. That’s an attractive price indeed, especially considering you’ll get one useful camera feature here that the $729 OnePlus 9 doesn’t have: optical image stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYMf0E"&gt;The 9R doesn’t include the Hasselblad-branded cameras on the 9 and 9 Pro, which isn’t actually a big loss. The 9 and 9 Pro offer newer hardware with features like bigger pixels and a higher-res ultrawide, so you do miss out on some nice upgrades, but the Hasselblad-developed color tuning is nothing special. You do, however, get a stabilized 48-megapixel main camera, which helps reduce blur from camera shake in lower lighting conditions. It’s unfortunately missing from the 9, though it is included on the $969 OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r08mIl"&gt;Other cameras on the 9R include a 16-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. This system is borrowed from the OnePlus 8T, which is wholly capable of good image quality, even though its macro and monochrome cameras aren’t very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cPKPAX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uVsRpJ"&gt;There’s a 6.55-inch 1080p OLED with fast 120Hz refresh rate — same as the OnePlus 9 — and a Snapdragon 870 processor with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. It’s not quite as powerful as the top-notch 888 processor on the 9 and 9 Pro, but it should be more than adequate to keep day-to-day tasks running quickly and smoothly. The 9R is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery with 65W fast wired charging, a handy OnePlus signature feature that delivers a full charge in just under 40 minutes. Wireless charging, however, isn’t offered. Oh, and there’s 5G support, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhBHSr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10410330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4H9RQj"&gt;All told, it looks like a series of smart trade-offs for almost $200 less than the flagship model. Right now, the phone is only confirmed to launch in India, but we’re hopeful that it will make its way to European and North American markets. While OnePlus brought its good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; to the US earlier this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;midrange Nord&lt;/a&gt; never made it stateside. The 9R looks like an excellent candidate to fill in a wide gap between the budget N10 and the basic flagship model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VL2w2Z"&gt;In the meantime, customers in India can preorder the 8GB RAM / 128GB version for ₹39,999 (~$550) or the 12GB RAM / 256GB model for ₹43,999 (~$600).&lt;/p&gt;
