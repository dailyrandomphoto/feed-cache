    <title>Here’s how Samsung’s S Pen works with the new Galaxy S21 Ultra</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jkJS2j"&gt;Samsung’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21991813"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; supports the company’s S Pen stylus. Support for the accessory has been a staple of Samsung’s Galaxy Note smartphones for years, but this is the first time it’s been supported in the company’s Galaxy S-series. The new S Pen will be available as an optional $39.99 accessory, and Samsung says the S21 Ultra will also work with S Pens from other Galaxy Note or Galaxy Tab devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afNUJ4"&gt;As for what you can use the stylus to do on the S21 Ultra, Samsung has outlined a range of familiar use cases. These include drawing, note-taking, photo editing, and signing documents. Physically, the new S Pen stylus is a little bigger than previous Galaxy Note S Pens, but it retains the side button. Samsung is also releasing a bigger S Pen Pro later this year, which comes equipped with Bluetooth and support for air gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra with its stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RdEXJg"&gt;Unlike Galaxy Note phones, the Galaxy S21 Ultra doesn’t have a built-in slot for storing the stylus. Instead, Samsung is selling cases with S Pen carrying slots, which cost $69.99 when bundled with the stylus. Having to use a case to carry the accessory doesn’t sound as convenient as being able to slot it in the phone directly, but it’s a compromise given there’ll be plenty of Galaxy S21 Ultra owners who won’t bother with the optional accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDp54E"&gt;In the new lineup, stylus support is exclusive to the Galaxy S21 Ultra. You won’t be able to use an S Pen with either the Galaxy S21 or S21 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEPyMe"&gt;Rumors of the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s stylus support have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;around since last year&lt;/a&gt;, and the feature was essentially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;confirmed in an FCC filing&lt;/a&gt; at the end of December. Now that the Galaxy S series is inheriting one of the Note series’s biggest features, there are rumors that the latter could be discontinued. However, this has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22177972/galaxy-note-21-still-happening-yonhap"&gt;reportedly been disputed&lt;/a&gt; by one Samsung official.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra first look: polished design (and prices)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ohf7aS0VQJIX1JrQynhe9j-YDms=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667033/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Starting at $799 and available on January 29th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Bcr1Iv"&gt;Samsung’s latest flagships are here: the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21 Plus, and the Galaxy S21 Ultra. The first two — which start at $799 and $999, respectively — mark some of the least expensive flagship phones that Samsung has made in years, while the $1,199 S21 Ultra aims to be not just the top-specced phone in Samsung’s lineup, but also the best phone, period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vasZep"&gt;I was able to briefly try out all three devices last week, and they all share a new design language that throws out a lot of what I’d come to expect from a Samsung smartphone. The internal changes are more incremental from last year’s S20 lineup, though, and in some cases, they’re an intentional step back. All three phones will be available to preorder on January 14th and will launch on January 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrknfq"&gt;The new devices can effectively be divided into two categories: the S21 and S21 Plus, which are aiming to achieve a more wallet-friendly flagship experience, and the S21 Ultra, the ultimate Samsung smartphone that cuts no corners and aims to offer the most premium phone possible — with a price tag to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z8zSO8"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Galaxy S21|100092" data-volume-uuid="242ec3170" data-volume-id="100092" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-559" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uUOavS"&gt;Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="wQ64gh"&gt;Unlike past years, the S21 and S21 Plus are almost identical devices this time around, barring the obvious differences in screen size, battery size, and one or two other minor details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1E3Mv"&gt;But the most important change with these two phones isn’t actually the hardware itself; it’s after years of creeping prices, Samsung has finally reversed course, with the S21 and S21 Plus actually starting at $799 and $999, respectively, this year. That’s a full $200 less than last year’s models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCtUH9"&gt;In order to accomplish that, Samsung made a few compromises in order to reach those lower price points. The displays, while the same 6.2-inch (S21) and 6.7-inch (S21 Plus) sizes as last year’s models, have dropped the subtly curved edges that have been a Samsung hallmark for years. Those flat panel screens also feature a step down in resolution from the 3200 x 1440 panels on last year’s models to a more modest 2400 x 1080 resolution. Both phones still offer 120Hz refresh rates, although it’s dynamically adjusted now. Lastly, the RAM has also been dropped from 12GB to 8GB. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/186Qtt86WK6nB5BfKlTL1m8FVvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232929/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Plus (left) and Galaxy S21 (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1zkIHr"&gt;The smaller Galaxy S21 makes additional trade-offs: the back panel is made of polycarbonate plastic, not aluminum, and it lacks an ultra-wideband radio (which the S21 Plus and Ultra offer for better integration with Samsung’s new Galaxy SmartTag.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtYrhs"&gt;Lastly, Samsung is following in Apple’s footsteps by no longer including a charging brick or headphones in the box, justifying it with similar environmental reasons (although Samsung will also likely save a few dollars by not bundling those parts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dh92Gr"&gt;The big question is: are those admittedly small changes worth the $200 price cuts? We’ll have to wait until we can put the new S21 and S21 Plus through their paces in our upcoming review. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFe-VPqD3aWkiOZKXv6ArfBcTUA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232921/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dKXfsR"&gt;It’s not all downgrades, however: the processor is Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 888 chipset, which promises big improvements in overall performance. There’s comprehensive 5G integration on both devices, with support for mmWave and sub-6GHz networks. The fingerprint sensor has been upgraded to Qualcomm’s new 3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2, which should be faster and easier to use. And the batteries are still big: the S21 still offers a beefy 4,000mAh battery, and the S21 Plus has been upgraded to an even larger 4,800mAh one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSt4QD"&gt;But the biggest update this year is the new design, which ditches the glass-slab sandwich that Samsung’s been using for years for an updated look. And it’s easily my favorite thing about the new phones. After years of dealing with the protruding camera bumps that have been the de facto cost of offering bigger sensors and better lenses on our smartphones, the S21 and S21 Plus embrace the camera bump instead of trying to work around it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nW1DZw2s8CszwwLruPWVY8PPGyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232924/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0009.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ya477yPE5nhznTuwoIoqHL25jbc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232931/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0013.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CMSm12v55xWzjOz-aJfp052Narg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232920/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Plus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s7ZVWo"&gt;The S21 and S21 Plus still have camera bumps, but they look good as seamless pieces of metal that flow out naturally from the matching sides of the phones, with smooth edges and spiffy two-tone designs that look really nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzyCMU"&gt;Largely unchanged from last year, though, is the camera system itself. Both the S21 and S21 Plus offer a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 64-megapixel telephoto lens, along with a 10-megapixel selfie camera. (The S21 Plus no longer has a depth sensor.) If those sound similar, it’s because the hardware is virtually identical to the cameras found on last year’s Galaxy S20 and S20 Plus phones. Samsung has made some improvements on the software side of things, including the 30x “Space Zoom” mode, a new “Director’s View” mode for video that makes it easy to swap between lenses while filming, and additions to Samsung’s “Single Take” mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSpguD"&gt;Samsung has told us that it will no longer over-smooth faces by default, instead making it an option. It’s high time that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HQ0IYBxvlbiKR_MsSYaoiVtoPgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233312/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra, with S Pen and case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XUq3vN"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dd9LV2"&gt;If the S21 and S21 Plus are more restrained steps back in smartphone design, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a phone that imagines what it would look like if you never had to make any compromises. It’s a phone that promises the very best of what Samsung’s hardware and Android can offer — if you’re willing to pay for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2M8tJB"&gt;Starting at $1,199 (a price that doesn’t include any extras like an S Pen stylus or a case), the S21 Ultra is Samsung’s third superlatively named phone, the successor to last year’s S20 Ultra. And it has a lot in common with the original, including a massive screen, a 108-megapixel camera, and top-of-the-line specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKLqix"&gt;But the S21 Ultra is a more refined version of last year’s model, one that looks to smooth out some of the sharp edges for a better experience — literally, in some cases, thanks to Samsung’s new rounded design language (which is similar to the S21 and S21 Plus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QV-3wxNRI7HBzVVRk76GjemWaqw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233319/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0010.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMPRS-gX4duxcdGclOLU06cKzNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233310/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZFJi11aO2QYYkS4ivp8fF5cVP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233318/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0009.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uVjfvZ"&gt;Looking at the spec sheet, the S21 Ultra checks almost every box: a 6.8-inch 3200 x 1440 OLED display, with refresh rates up to 120Hz (a refresh rate the S21 Ultra can hit at full resolution, unlike last year). There’s 12GB of RAM, a 5,000mAh battery, up to 512GB of storage, and Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 888 processor. It’s hard to imagine Samsung cramming more in here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGPnxT"&gt;Of course, just because Samsung can’t fit it into the phone doesn’t mean it’s done adding features. The S20 Ultra will be the first Galaxy S phone to support Samsung’s S Pen stylus, which does S Pen things. If you’ve used a Galaxy Note recently, you’ll have a good idea of what to expect. The only quibble: the stylus isn’t included in the box with your $1,199-plus phone: it’ll cost an extra $40, or $70 in a bundle that includes a case that can store both the phone and the stylus. And those cases are pretty bulky, adding extra width to an already pretty big phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x1fJYPTkfuKz2n_hkJlD-KKe9uo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233315/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ah66N0"&gt;And then there are the cameras. The S20 Ultra’s camera tried to shoot for the moon, with its 108-megapixel sensor and 100x zoom mode that promised photography that could live up to the “ultra” moniker of the rest of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u27L7L"&gt;The technology was incredibly cool, but it had plenty of issues. The S21 Ultra promises to offer a more refined experience for the second time around: the camera has a new focal length for slightly wider shots, a new laser autofocus system (similar to the Note 20 Ultra) that should help with the focusing issues on last year’s model, support for 12-bit color depth, and a more refined demosaicing process. Samsung is also working to give users more control over things like its AI-based photo enhancements, allowing you to adjust the level of smoothing, for example. Whether that’s all enough to solve the issues of the original is something that will require further testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6f9jF"&gt;The S21 Ultra isn’t just about that big 108-megapixel sensor, though. It also has an additional three rear cameras. There is a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, of course. Then there is not one but &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; separate 10-megapixel telephoto cameras: one with a 3X zoom and one with 10X zoom, which Samsung says is designed to give users more flexibility in how they approach shots. The downside of all those added sensors is that it expands the camera array to almost twice as wide as the regular S21 and S21 Ultra models, which spoils the look a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGrZtm1pLAsx2jJyW9c6328_C-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232923/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Yv4rEt"&gt;The Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra are a more deliberate lineup than Samsung’s past offerings. It’s a balancing act: with one hand, the devices show that Samsung has started to internalize the idea that not every phone needs every aspect of its spec sheet ramped up to the absolute max; with the other, it offers the Galaxy S21 Ultra, a phone that does just that for the power users who truly want that kind of device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZEQIK"&gt;It’s a philosophy that we started to see last year with the $699 Galaxy S20 FE, an intentionally cheaper Samsung phone that aimed to offer a premium experience at a more affordable price. The $799 and $999 S21 and S21 Plus feel like extensions of that philosophy, expanded from a niche “fan edition” device to the most mainstream of Samsung’s hardware. Factor in the almost omnipresent Samsung sales, and the S21 could be the most affordable Galaxy S device in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHMNCu"&gt;For years, Samsung has focused on making the best phones on paper that it could. The S21 lineup feels like an attempt to make the best phone for the different needs of different customers, rather than simply the most excessive phone it can muster. It might be the right strategy in the midst of a struggling economy, but it means that its smaller phones aren’t quite as impressive. With the S21, if you want the best thing Samsung has to offer, you are going to have to buy the biggest thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwmGzr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra starts at $1,199. This article incorrectly listed the price in one paragraph as $1,119.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With the Samsung Galaxy S21, it’s time for Bixby to put up or shut up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQ2xWZUtfBN8OSG41vsKCfp0NlQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68666219/vpavic_220317_1557_0163.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lkivyw"&gt;Today, Samsung will unveil the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21 Plus, and Galaxy S21 Ultra (I’ll take the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227941/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-brown-zune-unpacked-2021"&gt;Zune-inspired brown one&lt;/a&gt; thanks). It’s happening a couple months earlier than usual for the S line of phones, but otherwise the script will remain the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="StxdLf"&gt;Here’s the script. Samsung will be the first major Android maker out of the gate with Qualcomm’s newest chips, this time with the Snapdragon 888. Samsung will use its unseemingly immense marketing budget and longstanding carrier relationships to ensure it will be seen as the default option if you want a premium Android phone — &lt;em&gt;especially &lt;/em&gt;if you are making that purchase in a US carrier store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpXxp6"&gt;Other parts of the script are not necessarily guaranteed but are safe bets. They will probably be excellent phones, well-balanced and capable. Samsung will make big camera claims that will require rigorous testing to verify. And of course the ever-swinging pendulum of Samsung’s OneUI software will continue its current arc towards being overloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="h9Nrsj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9028921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sLXQPb"&gt;That last part of the script has me thinking about one of the major recurring characters in it: Bixby. Samsung’s digital assistant launched in 2017 with the Galaxy S8. It was yet another digital assistant, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15094720/samsung-galaxy-s8-design-safety-vs-note-7-battery-explosion"&gt;as Dan Seifert wrote at the time&lt;/a&gt; it had a very clear and very good remit that helped to distinguish it from Alexa, Siri, and Google. Samsung wasn’t trying to turn Bixby into a general-purpose, know-and-do-everything assistant. It had &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NkAcum"&gt;Samsung knows it can’t compete with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others when it comes to raw machine learning power and putting vast amounts of information at your fingertips, so it’s using Bixby to solve a simpler task, one that those companies have largely ignored. Bixby isn’t going to try to be the everything-assistant. Instead, it will be that “bright sidekick” that complements those other services. It’s a new user interface, not a new way to ask how tall the Eiffel Tower is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ1AqL"&gt;Bixby was to be an interface, not an assistant. Was that really a viable strategy? Who knows! Certainly not Samsung, which very quickly did what Samsung tends to do with software: give in to feature creep. Over the last few years, Bixby has turned into the thing it originally was designed &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be: a worse version of the Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZvqmB"&gt;Samsung tried to push Bixby. It created a dedicated button for it. It later dropped that button but assigned it to a long press of the power button. It built out Bixby routines (which was related to Bixby’s original purpose). But then it associated Bixby with a chum-feed of content that lived left-of-homescreen. And it announced independent smart Bixby speakers that never really shipped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nXt6F"&gt;On The Vergecast we have a running joke that &lt;a href="https://bixbyshoes.tumblr.com/"&gt;Bixby is a dog that wears shoes and is also a butler&lt;/a&gt;. It’s well-meaning and eager to please, but ultimately stumbles around a lot and doesn’t do a very good job serving drinks or answering the door because &lt;a href="https://bixbyshoes.tumblr.com/post/171592540108"&gt;it is a dog, wearing shoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZUPu2j"&gt;
&lt;div class="tumblr-post" data-href="https://embed.tumblr.com/embed/post/3negucxstVdHs6YbOvHoDA/171592540108" data-did="da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bixbyshoes.tumblr.com/post/171592540108"&gt;https://bixbyshoes.tumblr.com/post/171592540108&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://assets.tumblr.com/post.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ncO1cS"&gt;Speaking of shoes, put yourself in Samsung’s. Why does it continue to develop Bixby? I can only think of two reasons, one good and one bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGopDR"&gt;The good reason: a hedge against Google and Android. It’s always possible Google might do something egregious and Samsung would want to bail and do without Google’s services (or even Android itself). It’s not a terrible idea to have your own digital assistant percolating just in case. If nothing else, it might serve as a signal to Google that Samsung is, in fact, willing to just walk away and do Tizen and Bixby in certain negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXQj4X"&gt;That’s the good reason — or at least as close to a good reason as I can come up with — but I don’t know if it’s the real reason. I suspect the real reason is one and the same as the bad reason: Samsung is &lt;em&gt;still, &lt;/em&gt;after all these years and after all its successes, trying to be Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJR5nc"&gt;Being Apple is shorthand for having an end-to-end ecosystem where your users live and breathe your services and are thereby locked into your products. If you’re going to have an holistic, all-encompassing ecosystem you need to cover all the bases, and so: Bixby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlKK64"&gt;And also: your own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;fitness service&lt;/a&gt;. And your own health app and ecosystem of connections. Your own family of Bluetooth headphones. Your own tracker tag (before Apple even announces its tracker tag). Your own tablets. Your own music service. Your own news service. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INAaIx"&gt;All of these are things that Samsung has either tried or is actively trying to do now. Some of them are really successful! Samsung’s Galaxy Buds line will today consist of three different variants of earbuds, each with its own clear reason for being and each quite good (presuming the new Galaxy Buds Pro don’t whiff). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJW7R5"&gt;Samsung has always had aspirations to build up a whole world (or, er, Galaxy) for its users to live in, just like Apple. What’s frustrating is that Samsung is very good at so many things and if it would just lean a little more into those things, it could chart a more innovative and interesting path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmGeha"&gt;Take Samsung DeX, for just one example. It’s the thing that allows you to connect your phone to a bigger screen like a TV or a monitor and get a full desktop interface. It’s genuinely cool but, I suspect, more of a tech demo than an oft-used feature. But the Snapdragon 888 that will be in these S21 phones will in many ways be just as powerful as the chips that are going to be running Arm-based Windows laptops this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8A0qP"&gt;There’s untapped potential with DeX that Apple couldn’t match for years if Samsung could figure it out. Instead, it’s putting effort into getting Tile-esque tracking tags out the door before Apple can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONvSxX"&gt;If Samsung would focus a little more on where it’s already ahead and a little less on where it’s woefully behind, it would make much more exciting products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxuQXt"&gt;That’s why I’m calling it: I’ve had it with Bixby. If Samsung can’t either bring it up to snuff with Siri (a low bar!) or find a way to bring it back to its more focused roots, it’s time to send it to the farm. Or at least give users the option to remap the power button to the Google Assistant (without needing third-party hacks). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Urm3Xz"&gt;There is a tiny glimmer of hope. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8aD3a6gHZeQ?t=63"&gt;Jimmy is Promo’s leak&lt;/a&gt; of the new version of Samsung’s OneUI version of Android shows that users will be able to choose between the Google feed or Samsung Free feed on their home screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUEQVH"&gt;Samsung’s user interface on top of Android has swung like a pendulum between two poles. It becomes overloaded with features and weird UI for a few years, then the pendulum hovers there at the end of its arc before swinging back to a cleaner, simpler UI. It’s time for the pendulum to swing back. And that means it’s time to let Bixby go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EIFHf5"&gt;The last of CES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1256224424"&gt;Are all of these technically CES announcements or are some of them merely CES-adjacent? When CES is all virtual is it an event where things happen or merely a mood, a state of mind? Am I using jokes about philosophical quandaries as a smoke screen to cover up my inability to determine whether or not these things technically are a part of CES or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hLlPQ"&gt;Sometimes questions don’t have answers. All we can really know in this world is that laser projectors are still really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAV2pM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/13/22229575/asus-latte-movie-projector-mobile"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asus’ latte dispenses movies instead of coffee and milk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; I have an Anker/Nebula version of one of these mini projector/speaker things and it’s one of the best things I throw in my suitcase when I travel (er, when I traveled). You really do need a dark room for it to be any good, but you’d be surprised how much more convenient it is to just plug an HDMI cable into the projector you’ve got than it is dealing with whatever TV might be at the hotel or Airbnb. I might be interested in switching to this, as the Nebula’s version of Android TV is old, buggy, and poorly supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZhhJj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228488/lg-4k-laser-projector-airplay-2-price-release-date-specs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG’s latest 4K laser projector supports AirPlay 2 for $2,999&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="D661uf"&gt;If you’re new to the ZenBook Duo line, the laptops have a primary screen (the regular one) as well as a secondary screen (the ScreenPad Plus) that’s built into the top half of the keyboard deck. It’s not really big enough to do anything on, but you can load your distractions (Twitter, Discord, etc.) onto it to keep them out of your main workspace. Some programs, including Adobe’s, also offer ScreenPad-specific interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The big news is that all the new releases have been outfitted with Nvidia’s brand-new GeForce RTX 3000 series graphics cards. In addition to improved frame rates and ray tracing, these chips will deliver Nvidia’s latest features, including its resizable BAR technology. They’re also getting support for Wi-Fi 6E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="iMZBBp"&gt;The Creator 15 is just the latest of the dump of gaming- and creator-focused laptops to adopt Nvidia’s new RTX 3000 graphics, following their release at CES 2021. These laptops will use the third generation of Nvidia’s Max-Q design, which is engineered for thin gaming and content laptops. The new GPUs also include a new Dynamic Boost 2.0 technology that leverages AI to balance power between CPU, GPU, and GPU memory in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>A fistful of Samsung Galaxy S21 phones is perhaps the ultimate leak  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of a person purportedly holding three Samsung phones" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEWMfFPMZgHBrxzC6_GgE115vMo=/0x481:1150x1248/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68664608/Ero0eYGXUAIs5en.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: @We_The_Techies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EuglGL"&gt;You’ve seen the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/13/22229034/samsung-galaxy-s21-leaks-news-rumors-stylus-ultra-plus-carrying-case-video-trailer-specs"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwmw_o6_3LQ"&gt;renders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187074/samsung-galaxy-s21-leaked-colors-plus-ultra"&gt;leaked renders&lt;/a&gt;. Now, only a day before the launch, you can see what the entire Galaxy S21 lineup looks like in a real person’s hand, thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/We_The_Techies/status/1349448741640613889?s=20"&gt;Twitter user Mr.Techie&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-family-1192643/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKoTzc"&gt;The images also provide a good size comparison between the rumored regular, Plus, and Ultra variants of the phone. We also get to see at least three of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227941/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-brown-zune-unpacked-2021"&gt;the colors&lt;/a&gt;, and in my opinion the purple is looking &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; nice, but does seem to continue the trend of collecting fingerprints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zkfrB3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Samsung sent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MrTTechie?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MrTTechie&lt;/a&gt; a few demos ahead of tomorrow’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unpacked2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Unpacked2021&lt;/a&gt; event.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HgBJ7u"&gt;Mr.Techie also mentions that the S21 Ultra is on the thick side, though given its dark color it can be a bit hard to compare with the other phone he’s holding in the image. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/13/22229034/samsung-galaxy-s21-leaks-news-rumors-stylus-ultra-plus-carrying-case-video-trailer-specs"&gt;Given the rumored specs&lt;/a&gt;, that may not be too much of a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LU4b7R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/S21Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#S21Ultra&lt;/a&gt; is THICKKKK  I haven't held such a thick flagship in years.  Makes the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Note20Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Note20Ultra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iphone12promax?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iphone12promax&lt;/a&gt; seem razr thin &lt;a href="https://t.co/IzRs5HwslB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/IzRs5HwslB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mr.Techie - We The Techies (@We_The_Techies) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/We_The_Techies/status/1349449700563410946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8e45mu"&gt;These leaks are coming in just under the wire, as the launch event is happening tomorrow. If these pictures don’t quite satisfy your curiosity, you can check &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22220913/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-s21-phones-earbuds"&gt;out our article about what to expect at the event&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, it’s hard to imagine how anything more about these phones could be leaked, short of them showing up at people’s doorsteps tomorrow morning before the reveal. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iMaorN"&gt;Qualcomm has just made a &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/01/13/qualcomm-acquire-nuvia?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWm1RMk1qazFOV0ZqT1dWaCIsInQiOiJpdWM0WjJIUitvMlgxOHNvS1Y2WWY3VXBBQ2xZY0lSd1I1eXNRdVpIRVJNcXlEd2d1QlZKcUljMHl4WnhDYmgrRWhcL3Irc3VFTEo3M3lLUDVQUHQzZUdaS3BtTUZlTitXMTB5bEFhdXZoRWlieGZ4d3QwM2lVS1FoNDVyYWVSOU8ifQ%3D%3D"&gt;splashy acquisition&lt;/a&gt; in the chip market that’s sure to shake up the semiconductor industry in substantial fashion. The company Qualcomm is purchasing, Nuvia, was formed in 2019 by three former engineers and chip specialists, all of whom &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/three-of-apple-and-googles-former-star-chip-designers-launch-nuvia-with-53m-in-series-a-funding/"&gt;worked at Apple on the A-series chip line that powers the iPhone and iPad&lt;/a&gt;. And now, Qualcomm is paying an eye-popping $1.4 billion for the firm, placing a huge bet on the team’s talent and its focus on building next-generation CPUs for use in data centers, mobile, and other devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdD4RT"&gt;Qualcomm is specifically calling out the growth of 5G as one of the reasons it’s paying such a handsome sum for a company of just a couple hundred employees founded only two years ago. “5G is further accelerating the convergence of mobility and computing. The acquisition of Nuvia builds on Qualcomm Technologies’ Snapdragon technology leadership, delivering step-function improvements in CPU performance and power efficiency to meet the demands of next-generation 5G computing,” Qualcomm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMpB2x"&gt;All three of the company’s co-founders — Gerard Williams, Manu Gulati, and John Bruno — will be joining Qualcomm, which expects to integrate the company’s chips “across Qualcomm Technologies’ broad portfolio of products,” including the components that make their way into data centers, smartphones, laptops, vehicles, and other devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p7npXr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nuvia is just two years old, but Qualcomm is paying $1.4 billion to acquire its technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M5vI10"&gt;“CPU performance leadership will be critical in defining and delivering on the next era of computing innovation,” Nuvia CEO Gerard Williams, formerly chief CPU architect at Apple, said in a statement. “The combination of Nuvia and Qualcomm will bring the industry’s best engineering talent, technology and resources together to create a new class of high-performance computing platforms that set the bar for our industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twDKSg"&gt;Qualcomm is collecting tech and talent and taking aim at the data center industry at a time of significant change in the chip market. Many companies that once used to rely on big-name chipmakers like AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm have spent much of the last decade building out their own internal chip design teams to lessen their reliance on third-party companies and to better integrate their hardware and software. This is true not just of Apple, at which Nuvia’s co-founders gained their expertise, but also Amazon, Google, Facebook, and others, too. (Nuvia’s other two co-founders worked on chip design at Google, too.) All of these companies are building their own chips for use in everything from data centers to smart speakers and everything in between, often licensing the Arm architecture to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZcE2Q"&gt;That’s put Qualcomm at odds with companies it used to consider core partners. Apple and Qualcomm, in fact, engaged in a bitter multiyear patent infringement legal battle the two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18410985/apple-qualcomm-settle-royalty-dispute-patent-licensing-terms-high-fees"&gt;settled in 2019,&lt;/a&gt; but the message was clear: Apple was tired of paying other companies to license their tech and would rather go it alone using Arm-based designs. That was only further cemented by Apple’s landmark decision to drop Intel in the CPU field for Apple’s own custom-designed line of M1 processors, which arrived on the scene last fall powering the first of many new Apple computers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;critical acclaim thanks to their huge performance gains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWPZV7"&gt;While Apple and Qualcomm cut a deal for the iPhone maker to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525962/qualcomm-apple-settlement-4-5-billion-dollars-patent"&gt;continue using Qualcomm’s modems&lt;/a&gt;, including its 5G ones that enable the network capabilities on the latest iPhones, Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168779/apple-leak-cellular-modem-johny-srouji-town-hall"&gt;reportedly hard at work on building its own cellular modems&lt;/a&gt; to further extricate itself from Qualcomm in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="auSOKt"&gt;And that’s where a company like Nuvia comes in. While many companies are building their own Arm-based CPUs to compete with AMD and Intel in the data center — like &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd"&gt;Amazon’s Graviton chip&lt;/a&gt; — Nuvia is &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/24/nuvia-raises-240-million-to-design-arm-based-cpus-for-datacenters/"&gt;reportedly building a more flexible custom chip core&lt;/a&gt; (also based on Arm) called Phoenix. That chip core could result in a variety of different CPUs down the line, not just those designed to act as data center processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWkUEz"&gt;“We’re designing our own core from the ground up,” Williams &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/24/nuvia-raises-240-million-to-design-arm-based-cpus-for-datacenters/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat &lt;/em&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, when the company raised $240 million in a Series B funding round. “Our secret sauce is really physical design capabilities and microarchitecture. And that’s where you see the differentiation coming into play for almost anybody that builds a processor.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAsNbS"&gt;Williams said at the time that the speed and efficiency of its chip core was “very much like a mobile core in terms of size and power,” but with with “substantially higher” performance, a prescient statement to make considering Qualcomm’s plans to use Nuvia technology in its mobile Snapdragon system-on-a-chip line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Samsung’s Galaxy S21 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8-iIHerUIYUFIbFNEHjwpjWEZlw=/0x124:720x604/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651597/ErjR_QcXIAQxpu3.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349058979578654725" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pddNHN"&gt;Samsung’s next Unpacked event is less than a day away, kicking off on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;January 14th at 10AM ET&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to copious leaks, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect from the upcoming event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbAnaA"&gt;Samsung is widely expected to announce its next lineup of flagship phones, which will likely be called the S21, S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra. The S21 Ultra is rumored to have top-of-the-line specs, cameras, and, in a first for an S-model Galaxy phone, support for Samsung’s S Pen stylus. The S21 and S21 Plus are expected to have similar specs but differ in size. And since we first published this post, we’ve seen even more leaks about the phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jF9FUl"&gt;A new set of true wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds Pro, and a Tile-like item tracker, the Galaxy SmartTag, also seem like a lock. Rumors about both products have hit the web recently, and they each showed up in a leaked preorder ad for the S21 Ultra. And of course, Samsung may surprise us with things that we don’t know about yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJz7gG"&gt;We’ll be covering the whole thing here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But if you want to get an idea of what you can expect from the big day, here’s the rundown of what we think we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TqiJEm"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra will support the S Pen stylus&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0G7_oTvi3-gJyp9V5o9U5zPg3k0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231614/ErjR_QYXcAMdE1r.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349058979578654725" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J6U8SR"&gt;Let’s talk about the Ultra flagship first. The big new feature for the S21 Ultra is support for the S Pen stylus, as confirmed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;Federal Communications Commission filings&lt;/a&gt;. However, the stylus will apparently be an optional accessory, and the phone isn’t rumored to have a dedicated slot to store it, unlike the company’s Note series of phones. The S Pen will cost just under €40, which translates to less than $49, according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYkvk3"&gt;Samsung seemingly does plan to release cases that allow you to store the S Pen, though, and you can see pictures of two of those cases below, shared &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120513.html"&gt;by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Some cases may also come with the S Pen, according to a marketing render &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349350653848662021"&gt;shared by leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Kg5iB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10281935"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x1dLQd"&gt;As for cameras, the Ultra will apparently have four back cameras, including 3X &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 10X telephoto cameras, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those telephoto cameras are also expected to have optical image stabilization and a 10-megapixel resolution. The phone may also have Samsung’s 100X “Space Zoom” feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132870/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-zoom-100x-space-optical-hybrid-digital-periscope"&gt;first debuted in the Galaxy S20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcHFUh"&gt;The other two back cameras are rumored to be a 108-megapixel wide-angle camera and a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and the selfie camera may be 40 megapixels. The phone could also have laser-assisted autofocus, something that was included with last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79T64A"&gt;You can get a closer look at the rumored camera setup and features for the Ultra in this leaked marketing image &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349350645300670467"&gt;from Blass&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uATsHSI3-sYDtd66u_a-jwZYFu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232849/ErnanHfXYAA9gz2__1_.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra’s cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BDMfVq"&gt;The Ultra is also expected to have a 6.8-inch WQHD+ (3200 x 1440) resolution display, according to &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s expected to support a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1346342403792273413"&gt;leaker Ice Universe&lt;/a&gt; says the S21 Ultra may be able to run at that full WQHD+ resolution with the 120Hz refresh rate, something that the S20 Ultra couldn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWM6E3"&gt;The S21 Ultra is rumored to support 5G networks, be IP68 certified for water and dust resistance, have a 5,000mAh battery, and come with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage. It also could come in a wide range of colors — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227941/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-brown-zune-unpacked-2021"&gt;including brown&lt;/a&gt; — though some of the colors may only be available on Samsung’s online store, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120570.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1E36WI"&gt;Blass shared what appears to be the full &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349350653848662021"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349350658118459392"&gt;sheets&lt;/a&gt; for the S21 Ultra (and the S21 and S21 Plus) across two tweets. These tweets also include information about what Samsung is including in the box — which we’ll touch on a bit later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a7lbvG"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus will offer similar specs at different sizes&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/it5FRQ3b2AXEL7gtf2AG_SR1K-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231623/ErjQbLVXIAIUOju.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349057583638839304" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Plus lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y14BTZ"&gt;Samsung also plans to announce the Samsung S21 and S21 Plus, which won’t have quite as powerful specs as the Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SIeKj"&gt;The most obvious difference between the S21 and S21 Plus is a smaller camera module. The two phones are expected to have a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 64-megapixel telephoto lens, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120248.html"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And both phones will reportedly have a 10-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43jhke"&gt;Here’s a better look at the cameras on the S21, thanks to another leaked marketing render &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143"&gt;from Blass&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7yhor9DKX7P2whgS81d6AC-kqP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226116/e621085f8ae9e2b7f52b30e774a0648f163650b16b9f84df9afe07c77759bbd3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21’s and S21 Plus’ rumored camera setups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ddghEu"&gt;As for screens, the standard S21 is expected to have a 6.2-inch display with an FHD+ (2400 x 1080) resolution, while the S21 Plus is rumored to have a 6.7-inch screen with an FHD+ (2400 x 1080) resolution. Both are expected to support an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate, according to leaked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349399984916082690"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349399998673399809"&gt;renders&lt;/a&gt; shared by Blass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="117x1F"&gt;Like the Ultra, both the S21 and S21 Plus are expected to support 5G networks and be IP68-certified. They’re also expected to be offered with either 128GB or 256GB of storage. And depending on which model you buy, they’ll have different battery sizes: the smaller S21 is rumored to have a 4,000mAh battery, while the S21 Plus is expected to have a 4,800mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="py3yCA"&gt;Each phone is also rumored to have a different back cover material. The S21 could have a plastic back, while the S21 Plus may have a glass back, according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqsBCJ"&gt;You can see the full spec sheets for these two phones and the Ultra across &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349350653848662021"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349350658118459392"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; from Blass. And like the S21 Ultra, the S21 Plus may come in colors that are only available online, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120570.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OG7VjD"&gt;The S21 lineup may not include a power charger in the box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q72Bf7"&gt;Samsung’s newest phones will take a cue from Apple by not including a charger in the box, according to leaked marketing renders of the box shared &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120535.html"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349037682555572226"&gt;Blass&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the box, it seems you’ll only get the phone, a USB-C cable, and a SIM ejector tool. And Samsung recently deleted ads &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197394/samsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger"&gt;mocking Apple&lt;/a&gt; for not including a charger with the iPhone 12 lineup, lending credence to rumors that Samsung will be making a similar move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KSbPQp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What's (not) in the box. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS21Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS21Ultra&lt;/a&gt; aka no charger makes the packaging much smaller.&lt;a href="https://t.co/B4tL980QqG"&gt;https://t.co/B4tL980QqG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roland Quandt (@rquandt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1348936174690308097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="meFNfx"&gt;While the decision could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307463/apple-iphone-12-power-adapter-charger-rumor-usb-c"&gt;a good one for the environment&lt;/a&gt;, keep in mind that if you’re thinking about picking up an S21, you may also need to consider purchasing a separate charging brick to go along with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CCf341"&gt;The new phones may run Samsung’s One UI 3.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj3VlO"&gt;Samsung’s S21 lineup may run One UI 3.1, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aD3a6gHZeQ"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; from YouTuber Jimmy is Promo reveals some of the features that could be coming in the new update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TBEzw3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aD3a6gHZeQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sRol9y"&gt;The video, which apparently demonstrates One UI 3.1 running on the S21 Ultra, shows off a way to record from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, some of the S Pen features that work on the S21 Ultra, backgrounds for the call screen, the ability to select video resolution from the video recording screen, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pvS9V2"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds Pro true wireless earbuds could compete with the AirPods Pro&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s rumored Galaxy Buds Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Det9wn"&gt;In addition to its S21 slate of phones, Samsung is also heavily rumored to announce a new set of true wireless earbuds called the Galaxy Buds Pro. Not only have they been revealed as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221020/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-smarttags-s21-ultra-pre-order-january-14th"&gt;preorder freebie&lt;/a&gt; for the S21 Ultra in a leaked marketing render &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;shared by Blass&lt;/a&gt;, but YouTuber Digital Slang has already posted a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAGUMP0xsio"&gt;hands-on video&lt;/a&gt; of the Galaxy Buds Pro and their comparisons with the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GDIfgKm0Zeg"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and Samsung’s bean-shaped &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9cJJVFJkFgU"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NtfL99"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAGUMP0xsio?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3prOX"&gt;The new earbuds are rumored to have active noise cancellation, an eight-hour battery life (up to 28 hours with the charging case), and an IPX7 water / sweat rating. You can see how the Galaxy Buds Pro compare to some of Samsung’s other true wireless earbuds in this leaked spec sheet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1341767829926768643"&gt;from WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt;. The Galaxy Buds Pro may cost $199, making them a more affordable alternative to the $249 Apple AirPods Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1hLHE2"&gt;Samsung may launch its Tile-like item tracker called the Galaxy SmartTag&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJQ7mSqcubi_fODBqbacWlaryb0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22208211/smarttagleak.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-live-images-ncc/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9flwoY"&gt;Samsung’s rumored new Tile-like Galaxy SmartTag will apparently use Bluetooth to connect with devices and share its location. The tag itself looks to be a small square with rounded corners and a loop at the top to make it easier to attach to things, as shown in photos posted on the website of Taiwan’s telecom regulator &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-live-images-ncc/"&gt;and shared by &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The design in the photos also matches an image of the SmartTag in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;leaked ad&lt;/a&gt; of preorder bonuses for the S21 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izd5pO"&gt;It seems likely that the SmartTags will work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541567/samsung-find-my-smartthings-find-service-locate-missing-smartphone-tablet-smartwatch-earbud-galaxy"&gt;Samsung’s new SmartThings Find app&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you track the locations of your Galaxy devices, similar to Apple’s Find My app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KbTTwE"&gt;Samsung could also announce new wireless charging pads and a rose gold smartwatch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Oia0eJ"&gt;Samsung may announce a few other things at Thursday’s event. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s Roland Quandt tweeted about two &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349166544740376577"&gt;wireless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349166197305171970"&gt;chargers&lt;/a&gt;, including one that seems to have dedicated spots for a phone and a smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ 2021 laptop line includes two new dual-screen ZenBooks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user types on the Zenbook Pro Duo 15 OLED in a low-lit office space. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5tbQNX0fxCvGkmzFp14_nlRHYw8=/0x11:9451x6312/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662341/ZenBook_Pro_Duo_15_OLED_UX582_Scenario_photo_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Zenbook Pro Duo 15 OLED is coming in April. | Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8zOo1Z"&gt;Asus has announced two new dual-screen ZenBook Duo laptops as part of its slate of CES 2021 announcements. The 15-inch model will be available in North America in April of this year, but you can &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202101AM120000007"&gt;preorder the 14-incher&lt;/a&gt; for $999.99 starting January 14th to ship on January 22nd. There’s also a new VivoBook and a new ExpertBook for folks looking for light and portable purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nC2148"&gt;If you’re new to the ZenBook Duo line, the laptops have a primary screen (the regular one) as well as a secondary screen (the ScreenPad Plus) that’s built into the top half of the keyboard deck. It’s not really big enough to do anything on, but you can load your distractions (Twitter, Discord, etc.) onto it to keep them out of your main workspace. Some programs, including Adobe’s, also offer ScreenPad-specific interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jxZWf5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Asus’ ZenBook Duo line is getting better Intel processors and Nvidia graphics chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1rz6N"&gt;The 15.6-inch ZenBook Pro Duo 15 OLED is an update to the dual-screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20908627/asus-zenbook-pro-duo-review-screenpad-plus-dual-screen-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;ZenBook Pro Duo 15&lt;/a&gt;, a 15.6-inch dual-screen laptop with a primary OLED display. There’s also a 14-inch model, a sequel to the regular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285164/asus-zenbook-duo-review-screenpad-plus-dual-screen-laptop-specs-freatures-price"&gt;ZenBook Duo&lt;/a&gt; that came out last year. This model is verified through Intel’s Evo program, which means Intel vouches that it has good performance, battery life, and other features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHxgXl"&gt;The two Duos got a spec bump: The Pro Duo 15 OLED now has Intel’s 10th Gen processors (up to a Core i9) and Nvidia’s latest GeForce RTX 3070 mobile GPU. The ZenBook Duo 14 now includes Intel’s 11th Gen processors (a Core i7 or a Core i5) with Iris Xe integrated graphics (and you can add an Nvidia GeForce MX450 GPU as well). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twYWOQ"&gt;The update I’m happiest about is that they both have a new design that tilts the ScreenPad Plus upward — it’s no longer flat on the keyboard deck. That means you don’t need to crane your neck over the keyboard to read the secondary display, something that was inconvenient about the older Duo models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKigZy"&gt;There’s also a new hinge design that Asus says is 30 percent smaller, and a smaller fan size. Asus has also upgraded the ScreenPad’s software (it’s now called Screen Xpert 2) to include  new apps that make multitasking easier. With a new Window Flick feature, for example, you can easily “flick” windows from one display to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user edits a photo using a stylus on the Asus Zenbook Duo 14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/80bahzQVurBt8_83f6kI8AJu9NY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232888/ASUS_II_0224__2_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the 14-inch model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OhyDVB"&gt;Outside of ZenBook land, there’s a new VivoBook S14, which is also Evo-certified. Asus says it’s the lightest 14-inch VivoBook ever made at just 2.87 pounds. The S14 has also been bumped up to 11th Gen processors with Xe graphics. Asus says you’ll get up to 17 hours of battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8r0F2H"&gt;There’s a regular VivoBook 14 as well, which is powered by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;AMD’s new Ryzen 5000 U-Series mobile processors&lt;/a&gt;. Both models are coming to North America in February, with pricing to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The VivoBook S14, open, faces away from the camera next to a pile of accessories including a tennis racket, a toolbox, and a pair of sunglasses." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mon4bK_4eMm9PeWeyAA9jctKflQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232868/VivoBook_S14_S435_Unique_and_modern_Deep_Green_metallic_chassis.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the VivoBook S14 in “deep green.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8LPVve"&gt;Finally, Asus has made some updates to its ExpertBook lineup, including its astonishingly light ExpertBook B9. The new model’s full name is the ExpertBook B9 B9450CEA (vPro). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ho2BBT"&gt;The 1.94-pound laptop, which Asus says is the world’s lightest 14-inch business laptop, now includes Intel’s latest 11th Gen vPro processors, which provide a number of security and remote management features, including Intel’s Active Management Technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JW0TWl"&gt;The ExpertBook has a number of new features designed to make conference calls easier, including two-way AI noise-canceling technology, Harman Kardon-certified speakers, and support for Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rH5pYN"&gt;The new ExpertBook B9 is coming in Q1 2021, with pricing to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ExpertBook B9 seen from above, with backlit keyboard illuminated. The touchpad displays an LED numpad. A stylus sits to its left and an external drive to its right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5RE6NBAuXnBSPMVc0OOPTN9t5l4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232893/ExpertBook_B9400CEAV_US_military_grade_durability.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new ExpertBook B9 has “military-grade durability” according to Asus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Today’s day ends in y, so it’s time for more Samsung Galaxy leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEfD5lZuHIVEFeNd8DCzsbhtF5M=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662005/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_S_Pen_Cover_1610374922_0_11.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaked images show a case for the Galaxy S21 Ultra with space for its optional stylus.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120513.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7E9ca9"&gt;Samsung is announcing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;Galaxy S21 smartphones tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, but thanks to dozens of leaks, most of the details are already public. Today saw yet more images of the upcoming handsets leak online, offering more details on their specs, key features, and accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wDd0I"&gt;First up is this &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120513.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It contains images of a case for the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which includes space for its optional stylus. This case appears to differ from one shown in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212835/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-stylus-support-case-40-euros-accessory"&gt;previous leak&lt;/a&gt; that included a flip cover designed to protect the front of the phone. Cases like these are believed to be an important accessory for the new Galaxy device since it reportedly won’t include a built-in carrying slot for the optional stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAoH2i"&gt;Evan Blass has also shared a host of images of the unannounced phone. Images include one of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349037682555572226/photo/2"&gt;S21’s packaging&lt;/a&gt;, which appears to be smaller in size and won’t contain a charging brick as standard, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120535.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Another image suggests Samsung is planning to offer wireless earbuds like the Galaxy Buds Live or Galaxy Pro, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/1/22209216/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-tile-item-tracker-leak"&gt;SmartTag Tile competitor&lt;/a&gt;, as preorder bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s network will stop working with over a dozen older phones this month</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zQTF5X"&gt;Over a dozen devices including the original OnePlus 1 and Sony Xperia Z3 won’t be able to connect to T-Mobile’s network from January 29th, the carrier has announced in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fcoverage%2Fnetwork-upgrade-device-compatibility&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F13%2F22228540%2Ftmobile-network-shutdown-devices-january#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a support document&lt;/a&gt;. T-Mobile says this is the result of a network update, and that the affected devices are not able to receive a software update to allow them to stay connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9kJIB"&gt;“As a result of a network update going into place on 1/29/2021, we identified a small number of older devices that are not able to receive a manufacturer software update and as a result, these devices will be unable to establish a network connection,” the document reads. “T-Mobile and Metro customers utilizing these older devices will lose all network connectivity if they do not replace their device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cCILWN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These devices will be unable to establish a network connection”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K1Sqr6"&gt;It’s not clear exactly what it is about this network update that means these older devices can no longer function. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/08/these-are-all-the-devices-t-mobile-says-will-stop-working-on-its-network-next-month/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reported the news based on internal documents, initially said it related to a requirement for devices to support voice over LTE (VoLTE). However, T-Mobile says this is not the case, and says the change is not related to the shutting down of any legacy network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zh9QHn"&gt;Here’s the full list of devices T-Mobile says will no longer work from January 29th. Note that they’re all older devices, with the most recent being 2016’s Huawei P9 according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hsCjKB"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon Galaxy Note 4  (T-Mobile branded version will still work, but needs a software update)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="36zReg"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T Galaxy Note Edge &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qg0Q5d"&gt;HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZZmrHQ"&gt;HTC Desire 650 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="61hUVp"&gt;Google Nexus 9 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lYawxw"&gt;Huawei Mate 8 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jg1UOZ"&gt;Huawei P9 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="91f4re"&gt;Mikrotikls SIA R11e-LTE6 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="52MrtR"&gt;OnePlus 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5g6GsQ"&gt;Quanta Computer Inc Quanta DragonIR7 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lij8Lz"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S5 Duos &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WLBMuY"&gt;Sony Xperia Z3 Compact &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5U046p"&gt;Sony Xperia Z3 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nqCiCe"&gt;Sony Xperia Z3 Orion &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qCSJMO"&gt;Sony D6616 Xperia Z3 Orion &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Bwn4Xy"&gt;Soyea Mobile Communication Equipment Co Ltd SOYEA M02 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tco9I2"&gt;ZTE ZMAX &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ddkZBR"&gt;T-Mobile’s site also provisionally includes the Arlo Security Camera System on its list, but adds that it’s in talks with Arlo about a possible solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IAJAs"&gt;T-Mobile reportedly started informing affected customers of the changes by post on December 18th, followed by sending SMS messages on December 28th. Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reports that the move will also affect Sprint customers with affected devices, who’ll lose the ability to roam on T-Mobile’s network. However, T-Mobile or Metro by T-Mobile subscribers are thought to be the only ones losing &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;network connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87t9LS"&gt;T-Mobile says affected customers should contact it to arrange an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXHTpv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMTl0t"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy S21 Ultra may be the next big gadget to come in brown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n_w7UJ-kedwkqSE56U1tVZV7bxE=/0x0:720x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658892/ErjR_QYXcAMdE1r.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349058979578654725" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtPDA9"&gt;Samsung’s next top-of-the-line smartphone may come in brown, according to leaked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349057583638839304"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349058979578654725"&gt;renders&lt;/a&gt; of the entire Galaxy S21 lineup shared by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; writer Roland Quandt, and I have to say that it’s giving me some &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2011/fond-memories-microsoft-zune-brown/"&gt;serious Microsoft Zune vibes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULPFtC"&gt;The phone won’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; come in brown, though — it appears there are five colors planned for Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra, including that brown, and you can see all of them at the top of this post and pictured below. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DazcvkXo4koT1qgPJigV-Oc21_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231665/ErjQbLTXUAI_3Ww.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349057583638839304" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another render of the S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P7Zd81"&gt;Other notable phones have been brown-&lt;em&gt;ish&lt;/em&gt;. I’d argue that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017"&gt;the gold iPhone 8’s aluminum&lt;/a&gt; could look like a very light brown in the right light, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17871816/apple-iphone-xs-max-review-camera-processor-battery-price"&gt;gold iPhone XS’s back&lt;/a&gt; has some brown tones. Samsung edged toward brown with the “Mystic Bronze” color offered on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333566/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5g-announced-price-release-date-1449-99"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 5G&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; (though that color also has a lot of pink, in my eyes). But unlike those recent iPhones and Samsung phones, the S21 Ultra’s brown can’t be mistaken for a gold or a bronze — it’s a dark, earthy brown, and I kinda like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPxMv3"&gt;Samsung is also expected to announce two versions of the non-Ultra S21: the Galaxy S21 and a larger Galaxy S21 Plus. Each of those models will come in slightly different sets of colors, based on the renders shared by Quandt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5NV8v"&gt;The S21 may come in four colors, including a white and a lighter black that seem to be S21 exclusives. (The white is my personal favorite of all of the phones.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uH4_b0-BxkKAXXq6tJ1jU_wG700=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231619/ErjR_QcXIAQxpu3.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ElYPMH"&gt;And it seems the larger S21 Plus could come in five colors, including a vibrant red, a darker black, and a blue-ish white that appear to be exclusive to the S21 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/it5FRQ3b2AXEL7gtf2AG_SR1K-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231623/ErjQbLVXIAIUOju.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Plus lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dKvgWj"&gt;Colors aren’t the only things that have leaked about the S21 lineup, though — we’ve rounded up everything else we think we know about the phones (and a couple other products Samsung may announce on Thursday) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22220913/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-s21-phones-earbuds"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glI2Az"&gt;Samsung’s next Unpacked event kicks off Thursday morning at 10AM ET, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will be covering all of the news from the show.&lt;/p&gt;
