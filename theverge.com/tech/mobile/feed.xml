    <title>DOJ letter tells Dish and T-Mobile to figure out CDMA customer migration, or else</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pMa9RrwpNfJMj_2kkApq73BOgcQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69705623/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile plans to shut down Sprint’s legacy CDMA network on January 1st 2022, a move that Dish Network calls anti-competitive. &lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ytOgRk"&gt;The Department of Justice has “grave concerns” about the upcoming shutdown of Sprint’s legacy CDMA network, according to &lt;a href="https://dish.gcs-web.com/static-files/d0097e8d-56b9-486a-bc0a-1190e7141481"&gt;a recent letter&lt;/a&gt; spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-09/u-s-doj-has-grave-concerns-about-t-mobile-network-shutdown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and is urging both Dish Network and T-Mobile to take “all appropriate steps” to reduce the impact on customers still relying on the network. Many of Dish’s Boost Mobile customers — which it acquired from T-Mobile as a condition of the Sprint merger — still rely on the older 3G network and stand to lose phone service when the Un-carrier decommissions it on January 1st, 2022. It’s been a sore spot in increasingly troubled relations between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUYtOO"&gt;This July 9th letter from the DOJ was shared by Dish as part of its second quarter financial filings yesterday. It’s addressed to Dish Network and T-Mobile lawyers, and it acknowledges that the network sunset could potentially leave a significant number of Boost Mobile customers stranded without phone service. The DOJ reminds T-Mobile that it agreed to give Dish “reasonable advance notice” of a legacy network shutdown, though it stops short of condemning T-Mobile’s timeline as unreasonable. Essentially, the DOJ says it’ll need to wait and see how things play out in order to know whether the notice T-Mobile gave was reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AdPbfe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Dish ‘fix’ for the T-Mobile-Sprint merger seems more shortsighted than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585761/dish-t-mobile-att-sprint-competition-editorial"},{"title":"Predictably, T-Mobile’s merger promises weren’t enough to make a carrier out of Dish","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="H8frHU"&gt;“The Division cannot yet determine whether the notice provided will have been reasonable for a January 1, 2022 CDMA shutdown in light of all relevant facts and circumstances since they have not all transpired. However, if DISH undertakes all reasonable efforts to transition its customers off the CDMA network and a substantial portion are still remaining at the end of the period, that fact may very well suggest that notice had not been sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hT4ZsK"&gt;The DOJ doesn’t let Dish off the hook, either, and says the company is also bound by the terms of the merger agreement to make every effort to migrate Boost customers off the old network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="zCWQ9L"&gt;“...any failure by DISH to pursue all available avenues to prevent a widespread loss of services to the customers it acquired pursuant to that Final Judgment could raise concerns regarding its own compliance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qySN8N"&gt;The letter wraps up with a tidy request to please just figure it out, or else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xmcCjo"&gt;“The Division therefore expects both Parties to take all available steps to ensure the transition of Boost customers off the CDMA network prior to its shutdown. Should any conduct related to the CDMA network shutdown suggest that a violation of the Final Judgment will likely occur, the Division will act swiftly to pursue all remedies available to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="IcnQSm"&gt;Meanwhile, the two companies don’t appear to be ready to act cooperatively. T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Ffor-t-mobile-5g-connectivity-means-that-no-one-is-left-behind&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F10%2F22618472%2Fdoj-letter-dish-t-mobile-3g-cdma-network-shutdown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;published a blog post yesterday&lt;/a&gt; admonishing Dish for “dragging their feet in getting their customers upgraded to the superior 4G/5G world.” On a call yesterday with investors, Dish chairman Charlie Ergen sounded more resigned when discussing the topic than he did a few months ago &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;when he compared T-Mobile to the Grinch&lt;/a&gt;, this time calling the company “sore winners.” He says that Dish is making all reasonable efforts to migrate its customers, but he believes a “material amount” of them will stand to lose service on January 1st. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus is trying to jump on Samsung’s folding phone hype</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="DVOBgU"&gt;Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22608535/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-z-fold-flip-earbuds-watches"&gt;August Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to take place tomorrow with foldables and wearables tossed about, but it appears that OnePlus has a thirst for attention that simply can’t wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vF5RFu"&gt;The company tweeted out this &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CSZhpf1C9WW/"&gt;brief video clip&lt;/a&gt; with some kind of two-screened mobile device, although it’s unclear exactly what we should expect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jin057"&gt;LG has already done the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225118/lg-v60-thinq-5g-review-dual-screen-specs-features-price"&gt;second-screen phone case thing&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939655/lg-g8x-thinq-dual-screen-review"&gt;more than once&lt;/a&gt;), so if that’s all OnePlus has up its sleeve it could be disappointing. That said, the durability of Samsung’s early foldable devices has been disappointing and this could be a way for OnePlus to poke the bear on its big day. Or maybe it won’t be much of anything at all, and we’ll all move on to the next Galaxy without even thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XjCDG"&gt;If you’re going to go head-to-head with the Korean giant, you’ll need the hardware to back it up. We’ll see what’s real and what’s hype at 10AM ET on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi announces Mix 4 with under-display camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jo5Uu8jPjslxptbyKiozr17qA9E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703667/mix4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pf5xvq"&gt;Xiaomi has announced the Mix 4, the first phone in the Mi Mix series to be announced in nearly three years. The Mix phones have always been about bezel-less designs with seamless screens, and the Mix 4 carries on that idea by commercializing a technology that Xiaomi has been working on for a long time: a selfie camera that’s located directly under the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PziUla"&gt;Xiaomi calls this CUP (Camera Under Panel) technology, though it’s similar to the under-display selfie cameras we’ve seen from other companies. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608812/oppo-next-generation-under-screen-camera-tech-announced"&gt;Oppo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597594/zte-axon-30-refresh-specs-availability-under-display-phone-camera"&gt;ZTE&lt;/a&gt;’s latest efforts, the Mix 4’s screen has a 400ppi area that lets light pass through to the selfie camera, which Xiaomi describes as “virtually invisible.” The camera is 20 megapixels and the display is a 6.67-inch 120Hz 1080p curved OLED panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky1XD1"&gt;Xiaomi says CUP is “a technology iterated through three major generations, five years, sixty patents, a $77 million investment, and hundreds of engineers.” Last year the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405241/xiaomi-under-display-selfie-camera-no-notch-hole-punch-2021-mass-production"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; to start mass-producing smartphones with its third-generation under-display camera technology in 2021, so it’s making good on that promise with the Mix 4. Xiaomi first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650166/xiaomi-under-display-selfie-camera-weibo-teaser-mi-9-notch-hole-punch"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; its take on the idea back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JS4R8h5931q5lgahRKBbyHVS2HU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773053/Xiaomi_MIX_4_13.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MBQ0Ih"&gt;The Mix 4 is the first phone to be announced with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550723/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-cpu-ai-performance-mwc-2021"&gt;Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 Plus processor&lt;/a&gt;, a speed-bumped version of the flagship 888 chip with a top clock speed of 3GHz. (Honor did already say that it would use the 888 Plus in the Magic 3, but that phone is yet to be revealed in full.) The processor is paired with 8GB or 12GB of RAM and 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ1Axr"&gt;The camera system centers around a 108-megapixel Samsung HMX sensor, suggesting similar or identical performance to the slightly outdated but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;still pretty good Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a 13-megapixel ultrawide and an 8-megapixel 5x periscope telephoto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tajwxO"&gt;The Mix 4 has a 4,500mAh battery that can charge at up to 120W wired and 50W wireless. This isn’t Xiaomi’s first phone with 120W fast-charging, but it might be the fastest — Xiaomi claims the battery will get a full charge in under 15 minutes, compared to 23 minutes for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. 50W wireless charging, meanwhile, will take 28 minutes to get you to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgxMRA"&gt;Xiaomi will only confirm a mainland China launch for the Mix 4 so far. Preorders will start there tomorrow with general availability coming on August 16th, and the pricing starts at 4,999 yuan (~$770) for an 8GB/128GB model, going up to 6,299 yuan (~$970) for 12GB/512GB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony completes acquisition of Crunchyroll from AT&amp;T</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yy6ts9txU9z4BE6YBgoLOiaP1zU=/87x0:1038x634/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69701179/CROriginals_16x9.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ykNr6X"&gt;Sony officially owns AT&amp;amp;T’s Crunchyroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5lbai"&gt;Sony’s deal to acquire Crunchyroll was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166585/sony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020 and sees Crunchyroll join Funimation, Sony’s existing anime streaming property, under one roof. The ultimate goal of the unification of the two anime properties under a single roof is to develop “a unified anime subscription experience as soon as possible,” said Tony Vinciquerra, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IH9y5c"&gt;The deal is priced at $1.175 billion, and AT&amp;amp;T — which had been reported by &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/at-t-wants-1-5-billion-in-crunchyroll-sale-to-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to be shopping the service around for $1.5 billion — will use the funds to help pay down the debt it amassed from its spending on streaming. In a radical shift away from its streaming strategy, AT&amp;amp;T has since decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451111/att-ceo-stankey-unleash-assets-warnermedia-discovery-hbo"&gt;release its media assets&lt;/a&gt; and focus on its core connectivity business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R0hqlr"&gt;Meanwhile, Sony plans to use the Crunchyroll service to broaden its already substantial anime streaming footprint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QM6bKD"&gt;“With the addition of Crunchyroll, we have an unprecedented opportunity to serve anime fans like never before and deliver the anime experience across any platform they choose, from theatrical, events, home entertainment, games, streaming, linear TV — everywhere and every way fans want to experience their anime,” Vinciquerra said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish says it will launch wireless 5G service in beta at the end of September</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jj7W-ZCC1g6M24nmInn6CPhDh84=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700580/acastro_200804_1777_dish_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dish aims to cover 70% of the US population by mid-2023 with wireless service.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ct2cfr"&gt;On an earnings call today, Dish Network execs said that its Las Vegas 5G wireless service is in the final phase of construction and will launch in beta by the end of September. That keeps it just in line with the Q3 deployment goal it gave earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZpGzT"&gt;The beta launch is an important first step toward its commitment to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8931827/dish-carrier-plans-5g-network-tmobile-sprint-us-confirms"&gt;covering 70 percent of the US population by June 2023&lt;/a&gt;, a target that’s looking more ambitious by the day as the company continues to lose wireless customers. It lost 161,000 subscribers in Q1 of this year, and it just &lt;a href="https://ir.dish.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dish-network-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;reported a net loss of 201,000 wireless subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in Q2. The company stands to lose even more of its remaining 8.9 million wireless subscribers as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598163/t-mobile-metro-5g-prepaid-boost-cricket-switch-promotion"&gt;T-Mobile has unveiled a generous promotion&lt;/a&gt; aimed at the very customers it was required to sell to Dish as part of the Sprint merger deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuuRe8"&gt;Dish says the Vegas beta will last a minimum of 90 days, during which it plans to gather customer feedback and troubleshoot issues as its technology transitions from the lab to the real world — chairman Charlie Ergen acknowledges that the network won’t work perfectly at first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuO44z"&gt;Dish also recently signed an agreement with AT&amp;amp;T, on which it will rely for the majority of its service as a wireless service reseller (MVNO) while it goes about building its own network. On today’s call, Dish clarified the role that its new partner will play in the beta launch. It says that the majority of network use in its Las Vegas launch will be on its own network, with AT&amp;amp;T and existing partner T-Mobile’s networks providing some roaming support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1POU7"&gt;Curious to try it out yourself? Anyone interested in testing out the network as part of the beta program can sign up for more information through &lt;a href="https://launch.5gmobilegenesis.com/"&gt;Dish’s Project Genesis website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9fq9v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vodafone latest UK carrier to reintroduce roaming charges in Europe after Brexit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Masked customers queue to enter Vodafone Mobile Phone Store..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xzuy64efwhZV1QK-OQVpuhOlVa8=/0x164:5000x3497/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69698853/1234410114.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael McNerney/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZNzbEa"&gt;Vodafone has announced it will &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vodafone.co.uk%2Froamingupdate22&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616543%2Fvodafone-europe-roaming-charges-price-tariff-brexit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reintroduce roaming charges&lt;/a&gt; in Europe for UK mobile customers from January next year. It’s the latest UK carrier to reintroduce the fees after the country’s departure from the European Union, and it follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548668/ee-uk-carrier-roaming-charges-european-union"&gt;similar U-turn from EE&lt;/a&gt; in June. All major carriers in the country &lt;a href="https://www.cityam.com/major-uk-mobile-networks-vow-not-reintroduce-roaming-charges/"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; they had no plans to introduce roaming fees in Europe after the Brexit vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glGRZq"&gt;The fees will apply to any Vodafone customers who sign up to or change their contract from August 11th, 2021, with the fees applying from January 6th, 2022. Costs are dependent on the specific plan, but most customers will pay £2 ($2.77) a day to use their UK allowance of calls, texts, and data in Europe, or £1 a day if access is bought in eight- or 15-day bundles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ohPej"&gt;Customers signed up to Vodafone’s “Unlimited Data Xtra plan with 4 Xtra benefits” or “Limited Data Xtra plan with 4 Xtra benefits” will pay no extra fee to use their UK allowance in Europe. All UK Vodafone customers traveling to the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state, will not have to pay any roaming fees regardless of their contract. Full details of the new payment plans can be &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vodafone.co.uk%2Froamingupdate22&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616543%2Fvodafone-europe-roaming-charges-price-tariff-brexit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ti7lO"&gt;Roaming charges were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15418776/eu-mobile-roaming-charges-date-june-15"&gt;abolished in the European Union&lt;/a&gt; on June 15th, 2017, but after the UK voted to leave the EU, it had to renegotiate its trade agreements with the bloc. These did not include free mobile roaming, allowing UK carriers to reintroduce fees if they wished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVuENU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Samsung’s August Unpacked event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5LSJypPHZrnZSp5JxQeLknnqQlo=/151x0:1050x599/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69698607/E7Ow9IyXsAAEUyS.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WleRDN"&gt;The next Galaxy Unpacked event is fast approaching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;on August 11th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT&lt;/a&gt; — but you might’ve already seen what Samsung has lined up, thanks to a copious amount of leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNoWn8"&gt;Samsung is expected to announce new additions to its high-end line of folding Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip phones. Based on leaks, both the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 seem more like refinements to Samsung’s existing designs with the newest specs. The new Fold and Flip should come with new color options and, in the case of the Flip, a reworked outside screen and camera housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9j18tO"&gt;Now that Samsung and Google have revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;their smartwatch partnership with Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like Samsung might also launch two of the first smartwatches to run it. Leaks seem to suggest Samsung will show off a new Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and Galaxy Watch Active 4. The company is also rumored to be updating its line of true wireless earbuds with the Galaxy Buds 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFmZuZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all of Samsung’s next foldable moves, but ahead of the event, here’s the breakdown of what we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qZULQKv1zeeuJKAzVV0v4dZAQrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679450/E4qkWBHXwAgIQ_W.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1408107239903223808?s=21" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (tweet now deleted)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 with S Pen stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="tv9Bmy"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is gaining a major Note feature: stylus support&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="r5IDMf"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594685/samsung-z-fold-3-stylus-support-note-durability"&gt;has confirmed there won’t be a new Note in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the latest flagship phone to gain access to the Note’s formerly exclusive stylus features. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders/"&gt;Leaked images from &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest the Fold will get an optional case that holds Samsung’s S Pen stylus when you’re not using it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Df-Rb3lQUoCWfx8LGvHu7TVAxSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741284/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Fold3_Samsung_S_Pen_case_render_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;91mobiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4602QH"&gt;Bundled in its stylus reveal, Samsung also confirmed that the new Fold and Flip will feature improved durability, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594727/samsung-z-flip-3-fold-water-resistant-ipx8-pen-case"&gt;with rumors of IPX8 water resistance&lt;/a&gt; possibly supporting part of that claim. Otherwise, it seems like the new Fold will feel like a yet more refined version of the previous two models, offering three color options of green, black, and silver, and a Snapdragon 888 processor. The phone is also expected to have a 7.55-inch interior folding screen and a 6.23-inch external screen, with both rumored to be 120Hz high refresh rate displays, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-z-fold-3/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WihO95"&gt;For cameras, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370?s=20"&gt;prolific leaker Evan Blass suggests&lt;/a&gt; the Fold will feature three 12-megapixel rear cameras, one of which will be an ultrawide and the other telephoto, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The exterior selfie camera is expected to be 10 megapixels, while the inside selfie camera is rumored to only be 4 megapixels but possibly housed under the Fold’s inside panel. Samsung Display has teased its work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230521/samsung-display-under-panel-camera-laptop-webcam-oled-bezels"&gt;under-panel cameras in the past for laptops&lt;/a&gt;, so it's possible the company could debut something similar with the Fold 3.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XUwp_n_ImCHiueUlb_cbu4yHlPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764805/E7zXe5GXEAAM7tj.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaked render of the yellow Galaxy Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="1nyvu5"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 has a tweaked design and larger cover screen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="UKfSTW"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is expected to feature a new exterior design with vertically stacked 12-megapixel rear cameras and a larger 1.9-inch cover display for notifications and selfie camera shots. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1422248661271162887?s=20"&gt;Leaked renders from Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; show the device coming in at least four colors: light purple, light yellow, grayish-green, and black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="S9nVyY"&gt;The interior screen of the Flip 3 is rumored to be &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-3/"&gt;the same 6.5-inch display size&lt;/a&gt; as the original Z Flip but with a new 120Hz high refresh rate display. The interior hole-punch selfie camera will reportedly sport a 10-megapixel sensor. This might not be a dramatic interior change from the first Galaxy Z Flip, but leaked renders suggest that Samsung may have also shrunk the bezels of the Flip 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqpWTZ"&gt;Like Samsung’s other flagship phones, the Flip 3 will likely be powered by the Snapdragon 888 and, in the case of the Flip 3, the same 8GB of RAM as the first Flip, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-3/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rumored Galaxy Watch or Active 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="jHlNxl"&gt;The new Galaxy Watches might fit more wrists&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="qrL1Cc"&gt;Samsung is expected to introduce at least two new smartwatches at Wednesday’s event. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic&lt;/a&gt; will reportedly feature a more traditional watch shape, with a rotating bezel and 42mm, 44mm, and 46mm sizes, which should at least give people more size options to play with. The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic is rumored to come in two finishes, aluminum or stainless steel, both of which will be water-resistant in depths of up to 50 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOVAOg"&gt;The more sleek and modern &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; (or Galaxy Watch 4 Active, it’s not entirely clear) will reportedly come with two side buttons and in either 40mm or 44mm sizes. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-watch-4/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; suggests&lt;/a&gt; you’ll be able to choose from watches in either black, olive green, rose gold, or silver, with additional customizations for watch bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbtmPH"&gt;Both watches are expected to run Samsung and Google’s new co-developed Wear OS 3. Not much is known about it, but leaks have definitely seemed to show it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/1/22604862/samsung-galaxy-watch-photos-images-leaked-classic-4-wear-smartwatch-os-google"&gt;running on both of Samsung’s new watches&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung also showed some of what its skinned One UI version of Wear OS 3 would look like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;at Mobile World Congress earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Leaked renders of Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="FtxMJ0"&gt;New Galaxy Buds 2 with improved sound in a variety of colors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="i9nhWr"&gt;Samsung’s next set of true wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;the Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, don’t seem wildly different from its original pair in terms of design. They are, however, expected to come in new colors and feature improved noise reduction abilities, possibly helped by silicone ear tips similar to the ones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Samsung included in the Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFe3Ro"&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 are rumored to come in green (some renders look like the inside of a pistachio), pink, black, and white. The new case for the Buds 2 also seems to lift some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;the design elements of the Pixel Buds A-series&lt;/a&gt;: uniform white exterior, with a colored interior that matches the buds themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldX4YS"&gt;It’s not clear what kind of battery life gains the new Galaxy Buds 2 could pack in, but Federal Communications Commission filings &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/galaxy-buds-2-fcc-leak/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show the device’s charging case has a 500mAh battery, and each earbud will have a 60mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FCC finally made a new broadband map of the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wS0eUSzhJ-Rxjc9F9g3aolzq1ms=/184x0:1750x1044/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69689876/Screen_Shot_2021_08_06_at_9.06.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FCC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7eTcDY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-launches-new-mobile-broadband-map"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission has launched&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://fcc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=6c1b2e73d9d749cdb7bc88a0d1bdd25b"&gt;new map&lt;/a&gt; designed to show consumers what kind of cellular coverage they can expect in a given area from AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, US Cellular, and Verizon. It’s been a long time coming, and it doesn’t address &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;home internet availability&lt;/a&gt;, but it looks like an improvement over the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition"&gt;woefully inadequate and inaccurate&lt;/a&gt; past attempts to show gaps in the nation’s broadband coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNVutI"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1423671191210954752?s=20"&gt;pointed out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, it shouldn’t have taken this long for this map to be available. The &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/3/bill-to-improve-broadband-data-maps-signed-into-law"&gt;law requiring that these maps be made&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability (DATA) Act, was signed in March 2020, and the lack of details about broadband coverage has created confusion about the so-called digital divide for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sL7XuU"&gt;It’s also worth noting that the map isn’t based on data that the FCC collected or crowdsourced. FCC acting chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a news release that the data was provided by the carriers who don’t have a great reputation for having the most accurate picture &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;of where they do and don’t provide broadband&lt;/a&gt; (though the FCC is working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345533/fcc-broadband-data-collection-program-fix-the-internet"&gt;getting a better picture of home internet availability&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22574103/internet-bill-equity-verge-consumer-reports-partnership"&gt;working on examining how cost-effective broadband is&lt;/a&gt;). The map also doesn’t address the issue with home internet availability, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/10/6131759/i-live-in-the-us-and-i-cant-get-home-internet"&gt;a long-running concern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Xj9r3k-UzIq5KRkXH20J0jatkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766633/FCC_Map_Vs.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The FCC’s map (left) versus T-Mobile (right, top), AT&amp;amp;T (right, middle), and Verizon’s (right, bottom).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w05RVM"&gt;The interactive map lets users select which carrier’s coverage map they want to see, and it provides information about LTE coverage, voice coverage, or both. The FCC says the map is the work of its Broadband Data Task Force. The map is fairly user-friendly; instead of having to flip between &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcoverage%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F6%2F22613096%2Ffcc-cellular-broadband-voice-availability-map-data" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/maps/wireless-coverage.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/coverage-map/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s&lt;/a&gt; coverage maps, users can see all of the data in one place, overlaid on top of each other. The map also provides a distinction between data availability and voice availability — which is useful, as being able to make a call and being able to get online are obviously two very different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylnplN"&gt;One big thing the map is missing is data about 5G coverage, or really any indicator of what kind of speeds users can expect. &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/notes/2021/08/06/new-mobile-map-preview-whats-come"&gt;In a note about the map’s launch&lt;/a&gt;, Rosenworcel says the network has to provide at least 5Mbps down and 1Mbps up to qualify as 4G data coverage. If one carrier provided an area with 100Mbps speeds and another provided 10Mbps speeds, that could be difficult to distinguish on the map. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4ogxZB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Data for the map is provided by the carriers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="juNEm2"&gt;Rosenworcel also admits that this map is only a first step in the FCC’s work to improve the information available to consumers, but it’s an important one. It at least lets consumers know the minimum of what mobile coverage they should expect in a given area and gives them the tools to make more informed decisions about their cellular provider. Hopefully the FCC will be able to have a similar effort to map the availability of home internet connections in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1pnq8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 6th, 5:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarified that this map doesn’t address home internet availability issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone plans in 2021 (and how to pick one)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/scMaL7yhAqctduO7lUG16ZZ6KzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69687901/awhite_200223_3916_0446.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Shopping for a phone plan doesn’t have to be painful&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sWASXY"&gt;Some of us get excited about shopping for a new phone (New technology! Megapixels! Fancy screen!), but none of us enjoy shopping for a new phone plan. Spending any amount of time at a wireless retail store is not high on our list of things to do with our precious time on this planet. And yet we must. While we can’t promise to make it an enjoyable experience, we can help you do a little homework ahead of time to make it less painful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQUpt4"&gt;If you prefer to cut right to the chase, we’ve got two recommendations from the major US carriers for you: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone-plans%2Fessentials&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22606623%2Fbest-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile’s Essentials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you’re looking for unlimited, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/shared-data/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon’s 10GB Shared Data plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you’d rather have a set amount of data each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ObrwNh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10682646" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="EVX5wr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10682697" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YxiK3j"&gt;T-Mobile’s Essentials plan is your best bet for a cheap phone plan with unlimited data: at $60 per month for a single line, it’s the least expensive unlimited plan from a major carrier and includes some nice extras like wireless hotspot data (at slower 3G speeds, but better than none at all — which is what you’ll get on comparable plans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGcWlt"&gt;Verizon’s 10GB Shared Data plan is $65 per month for a single line and should provide plenty of data for most people. Verizon lets you roll over unused data and includes mobile hotspot usage for no extra fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZtrZO"&gt;We’ll go into more detail about these plans and some of our recommendations for the best cheap unlimited plan, best premium unlimited plan, and best cheap by-the-gig plan a bit later, but first, take a look at a few things to consider before you pick a plan. If you also happen to be shopping for a new device, we’ve got suggestions for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;best phone you can buy right now&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;best phone under $500&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_qJ3xeWXCnCBAPAWbr7rMnn2vM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13250625/akrales_181010_3013_0161.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nUzok3"&gt;Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="fL0aST"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10686366"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kTOBax"&gt;This is an obvious — and important — first consideration in your mobile plan shopping process. On a high level, you’ll want to know which wireless carriers cover your area. If you’re in or near a major city, you’re pretty much guaranteed service from any of the major carriers. If you’re in a rural area, you may have fewer choices and a smaller, regional carrier might serve your needs better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5Jvjw"&gt;Carriers’ published coverage maps are a good starting point. They’re not reliable enough to gauge coverage in a particular neighborhood or on your street, but they can help identify carriers without a significant presence in your area. Check US Cellular’s coverage, too, since it tends to offer service where some of the major carriers don’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3O97am"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; provides a thorough, balanced evaluation of the major carriers’ network performance across the country every year; &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fastest-mobile-networks-2020"&gt;take a look at 2020’s results&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/which-us-5g-network-is-fastest-were-revving-up-to-find-out"&gt;keep an eye out for 2021 results soon&lt;/a&gt;. And it doesn’t hurt to poll your co-workers and neighbors about their wireless service for more data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FHTFCl"&gt;Budget basics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xeRavP"&gt;When you start shopping around, you’ll see some very attractive prices on the major carriers’ unlimited plans, like $30 or $45 per month. Remember that those are prices &lt;em&gt;per line&lt;/em&gt; on your account, and the prices carriers like to show you are based on their best per line rate, which is usually available when you have four or five lines. If you’re shopping for a single line, expect to spend around $70 per month, plus taxes and fees in most cases. For four lines, expect around $140 for your total bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LEeRV"&gt;The quoted prices on carriers’ websites also include a discount for signing up for autopay. If you’re not comfortable signing up for autopay, you’ll need to add a little more to your monthly bill — $10 per line per month in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="702rIO"&gt;Shared data versus unlimited&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DnX0ZR"&gt;Plan costs add up fast, but there are ways to save a little bit if you’re okay with looking outside of the big carriers’ marquee plans. If you’re a lighter data user, a shared data plan with a set allotment of data per month can save you a bit of money. AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon both offer such plans starting around $50 per month for a single line. (All of T-Mobile’s plans offer some kind of “unlimited” data service.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaXT4w"&gt;Shared data plans seem to be on their way out, and carriers will be much happier to steer you toward an unlimited plan. There are some downsides to shared data plans, too. They tend to be limited to 4G or low-band 5G, which isn’t a big deal now but could be in the next few years. But on the plus side, both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T allow mobile hotspot use on their shared data plans, which isn’t an option on either carrier’s basic unlimited plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0GJll"&gt;Which brings us to one of the great mysteries of carrier unlimited plans: they aren’t really unlimited. Even the most expensive unlimited plans include limitations on how much data you can use via mobile hotspot. Most plans also include monthly data thresholds that, once exceeded, leave you subject to temporary slowdowns in times when the network is busy. Before you pick an unlimited plan, it’s a good idea to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"&gt;read up on the fine print&lt;/a&gt; so you know just what you are (and aren’t) getting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ePTP7Pj9AsZJelzBrpC_kv5cKl0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11579471/akrales_180620_1777_0481.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wEQp9g"&gt;MVNOs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Fwtn3f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10685640"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CN3dzx"&gt;Signing up with a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) can also help you save some money. These companies resell service on the major carriers’ networks, so with a couple of exceptions, you’re getting access to the same network for less money. These plans are better suited for those who don’t need the absolute best network speeds because they typically include lower prioritization thresholds than the major network plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7hMrT"&gt;Many MVNOs are set up to operate without retail locations, too, which could be a positive or a negative depending on if you prefer to walk into a store to troubleshoot issues with your connectivity. They’re also more eagerly adopting eSIM, which many newer phones support and which removes the need to wait for a physical SIM card to pop into your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQzs7e"&gt;Generally, you’ll find more plan options with set data limits per month than the few shared data options that remain with the big carriers. You’ll also find more prepaid options and fewer requirements like credit checks or contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2YDxaJ"&gt;Prepaid versus postpaid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="tFCoEl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10685643"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oCKEFj"&gt;In addition to MVNO prepaid options, the big three carriers also offer their own prepaid plans. These plans don’t require credit checks, but you’re still getting your service and customer support directly from the network operator. There are data-capped and unlimited data options across the board, and if you’re willing to spend more, you can get premium features like HD streaming video and mobile hotspot data that not even all postpaid unlimited plans include.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjDshy"&gt;Prepaid plans directly from the big carriers can also be nearly as expensive as postpaid. Depending on your situation, it may make sense to pay a little more per month for a postpaid plan or go with an MVNO for a better price. But they’re a decent option, especially if you’re looking for a single-line plan, have predictable data usage habits, and need to avoid the credit check on postpaid plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3gBzjR"&gt;Best phone plans in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SSIljM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our plan recommendations take into account cost, features, and restrictions imposed on the carrier plans we evaluated. They should be considered along with network performance in your area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="81QBe1"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Best basic unlimited plan: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone-plans%2Fessentials&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22606623%2Fbest-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile Essentials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;$60 / month for one line (with autopay)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ei18fC"&gt;At $60 per month for a single line, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone-plans%2Fessentials&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22606623%2Fbest-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile’s Essentials&lt;/a&gt; is the least expensive of the major carriers. Assuming T-Mobile coverage in your area is sufficient, it offers the best value for someone who just wants to stay connected and not worry about data overages. Plus, it includes 3G hotspot data and access to all flavors of T-Mobile’s already-strong 5G network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mi9lYS"&gt;It’s always subject to data slowdowns when the network is busy, but so are the other carriers’ basic unlimited plans. T-Mobile may impose additional slowdowns for users who go over 50GB of data in a month, so if you’re a heavy data user, you may want to consider a more expensive unlimited plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lnoIck"&gt;T-Mobile offers a handy way to test-drive its network on your own phone without switching from your current provider. It’s only available with certain iPhones right now, and you should be aware that you might experience faster speeds than you’ll actually get with data prioritization on the Essentials plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BoeptR"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10682646"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="EncFUu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10682520"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="5g314D"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ymV6yH"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Best premium unlimited plan: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon Play More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;$80 / month for a single line (with autopay)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dSigOl"&gt;The major carriers offer two pricier “step-up” plans with the exception of Verizon — it offers three, but the middle two are essentially the same except for the mix of included services. For very heavy data users and those who want the highest possible streaming video quality, the top tier plans make the most sense, but for most people, one of the middle-of-the-road options is likely a better fit. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s Play More Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; (and nearly identical Do More) plan isn’t the cheapest option, but it strikes the best balance of cost versus features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj6Tfo"&gt;You’ll get 720p HD video streaming (though this needs to be enabled in your Verizon account) along with a healthy 15GB of mobile hotspot data and a 50GB threshold of premium data before slowdowns can be imposed. Crucially, it includes access to Verizon’s Ultra Wideband (UW) 5G, which will become important over the next few years as it brings new spectrum online. You get super-fast but hard to find mmWave 5G, too, which isn’t worth upgrading for, but it’s part of the UW bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOY5Dj"&gt;Finally, the included services are worthwhile. Play More includes access to Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus, which is shared across all lines on the account. If you’re not interested in those streaming services, Do More includes 600GB of Verizon Cloud storage as an alternative, though, honestly, that sounds like a lot less fun than having nine seasons of &lt;em&gt;Letterkenny&lt;/em&gt; included with your phone plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h8N4bl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685853"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="u7d2fg"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Best family plan: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon Play More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;$180 / month for four lines (with autopay)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YNWBrA"&gt;Verizon’s Play More is also our top pick for families. Four standard lines will cost $45 each for a total of $180 per month, but parents with younger kids can mix and match the standard plan with &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s Just Kids plans&lt;/a&gt;, which are cheaper and offer parental control features. Just Kids lines come with a limit of up to 20 contacts for talk and text, and speeds capped at 5Mbps — good for a younger kid whose phone use you want to keep closer tabs on but not well-suited for older kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGmyt7"&gt;At least one unlimited plan line is required to add Just Kids lines, which are $35 each for an account with four lines, making a plan with two Play More lines and two Just Kids lines $160 per month. And Disney Plus included with the price of the plan doesn’t hurt, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tn0aVJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10682526"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GtZ2fZ"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KrlGCb"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Best postpaid shared data plan: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/shared-data/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon Shared Data Plan — 10GB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;$65 / month&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KapvP3"&gt;We think &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/shared-data/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s $65 per month 10GB plan&lt;/a&gt; provides the best bang for your shared-data buck compared to its 5GB plan and AT&amp;amp;T’s 4GB plan (T-Mobile doesn’t offer postpaid shared data plans). However, if you buy a phone from Verizon on a two-year contract, that monthly price goes up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFCXUf"&gt;The 10GB plan typically costs $40 per month for account access and an additional $25 per month per line (with autopay), adding up to $65 per month for a plan with a single line. If you’re on a two-year device contract, that $25 fee per line per month goes up to $40 — with or without autopay enabled — so you’ll pay $80 per month for a single line plus the cost of the phone itself, which varies depending on the model. If you prefer buying your phone through your carrier on a two-year plan, then an unlimited plan may make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBAB6t"&gt;Otherwise, the 10GB plan is about the same price as the company’s basic unlimited plan but comes with the ability to stream video at 720p (once enabled for your account) and use your data via a mobile hotspot. You can also carry unused data over to the next billing cycle, and use your data on other non-phone connected devices like a tablet for an extra $10 per month per device; unlimited requires a separate device plan starting at $10 per month for a smartwatch or $20 for a tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b8q5vP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685884"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Jgd2CY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10682529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oVlryv"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6KFJ2Z"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Best cheap phone plan (by the gig): &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/plans/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Fi Flexible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting at $30 / month for a single line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="T7sKQo"&gt;Our pick for the best cheap data-capped phone plan is &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/plans/"&gt;Google Fi Flexible&lt;/a&gt;, which costs between $30 and $80 per month. It isn’t the least expensive, and it’s certainly not the one with the easiest pricing structure to comprehend. But it does live up to its “Flexible” name and offers some inclusions that cost extra on other plans, like mobile hotspot data and additional SIMs for non-phone devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4jQDm"&gt;Here’s how it works: on the Flexible plan, you prepay a set access fee per line at the start of every month, depending on the number of lines on your account. (It’s $20 for one line.) At the end of that, you pay $10 for every 1GB of data used during the month, up to a set maximum amount determined by, again, the number of lines on your plan. That’s 6GB on a single-line plan, so your plan will cost at most $80 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9wbPA"&gt;You can keep using data beyond that limit, but you won’t be charged more, and you won’t experience drastic slowdowns until you reach 15GB. At that point, you’ll be dropped down to 2G speeds for the rest of the month unless you add more data at $10 / GB. Again — not the cheapest plan by any means — but if you can get by most months on 2 or 3GB of data, your $40 or $50 bill will look pretty good compared to most alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zugdMm"&gt;It’s a little bit more complicated than your typical phone plan, but it means you’re only paying for the data you use in a month — with a lot of flexibility built in if you need to use a little or a lot more data than usual in a typical billing cycle. And it includes a somewhat rare feature: the option to add data-only SIMs at no extra charge so you can use your plan across other devices like tablets and smartwatches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U9Psqx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685910"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="GWgECJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10682574"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="jsQiQH"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Fhbd29"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Best cheap unlimited phone plan: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fproduct%2F12-month-unlimited-sim-card-plan%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22606623%2Fbest-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mint Mobile 12-month Unlimited Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;$30 / month (pre-pay $360)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BXc1NS"&gt;Going by raw numbers alone, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fproduct%2F12-month-unlimited-sim-card-plan%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22606623%2Fbest-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mint Mobile’s $30-per-month unlimited plan&lt;/a&gt; stands out with easily the lowest monthly cost for unlimited data. However, to get that price you’ll need to prepay for 12 months of service for a sizable $360 upfront cost. New customers can try the service for three months at that $30 rate. But after that, you’ll need to renew for the full year or pay a little more for a six-month plan ($35 per month for an upfront cost of $210). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sh5oxm"&gt;If paying up front is doable for you, then you’ll get one of the best deals in wireless. The plan includes 5G, comes with 5GB of mobile hotspot data per month, and you won’t experience significant slowdowns unless you surpass 35GB of data in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlENcl"&gt;If paying for six or 12 months of service up front isn’t the best option for you, then we think &lt;a href="https://visible.pxf.io/c/482924/1068329/12909?subId1=VergePhonePlans08052021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.visible.com%2Fplan%2F"&gt;Visible’s $40 per month standard plan&lt;/a&gt; is the next best option. Visible runs on Verizon’s network (and is, in fact, owned by Verizon) and includes some perks you won’t even get on Verizon’s own basic unlimited plan. You’ll get UW 5G access — capped at 200Mbps, but still, probably at least as good as your home Wi-Fi. Mobile hotspot usage is also included, though it is capped at 5Mbps. That’s a bit slower than 4G, so you won’t want to rely on it as a primary connection for your laptop, but it’s good enough for basic internet browsing and email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxZkPP"&gt;Of course, Visible customers are more likely to see their speeds slow down compared to Verizon’s own subscribers when the network gets busy, so there is some benefit to signing up directly with the network. But it’s a significant step up from $40 per month to the $70-per-month Verizon Start Unlimited plan in order to guarantee faster network speeds at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SpJLD3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="j797LN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10682576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Facebook streamlines the settings page on mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WeaYdozU55jXG8f3rO9Z0346mqc=/10x0:1398x925/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680466/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_3.36.00_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old Facebook settings page compared to the new one on mobile.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5pmmN"&gt;Facebook is streamlining the settings page on mobile in &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/"&gt;a new redesign&lt;/a&gt; that’s rolling out starting Wednesday. Visually, the new layout looks much less cluttered, and individual settings don’t have descriptions, meaning you’ll see more on the page at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0ROKf"&gt;Facebook has also changed up the organization of the settings themselves. The company has reduced the number of categories for settings and renamed them, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, so now, you’ll see six categories of settings: Account, Preferences, Audience and Visibility, Permissions, Your Information, and Community Standards and Legal Policies. Some settings have also been relocated so that they’re by related ones, Facebook says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMPyON"&gt;You’ll be able to see the new look on Android, iOS, mobile web, and Facebook Lite. You might already have the redesign — I just checked the Facebook app on my iPhone 12 Mini and it loaded up. It was present on the mobile web for me, too.&lt;/p&gt;
