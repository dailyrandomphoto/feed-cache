    <title>Verizon insists it will give you up to $1,000 in trade-in credits for your broken phone</title>

  &lt;p id="Y0ZsK7"&gt;April Fools Day is at hand, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fyou-broke-your-phone-so-verizon-breaking-rules&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360418%2Fverizon-april-fools-day-trade-in-broken-cracked-water-damage-phone-android-iphone-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon has willingly stepped into the fray&lt;/a&gt; with a deal that seems too good to be true — especially for people who have a broken, useless phone. The US carrier insists that starting tomorrow, April 1st, customers can trade in an “old, cracked, or water damaged phone” for up to $1,000 off a new 5G phone, like an &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/vergeVerizonInsists03312021/https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-12/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/vergeVerizonInsists03312021/https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt;. The promo doesn’t extend to phones with battery damage (for safety concerns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSJ3xR"&gt;You’ll get the most out of this deal if you’re on a different carrier and looking to open a new line and port your number into Verizon’s network. But current customers can reap some savings, too. You can find out the value of your phone online or at any of its retail stores, although if you plan to visit in-person, the company encourages you to make an appointment on its &lt;a href="http://vzw.com/stores"&gt;store locator page&lt;/a&gt; or through the My Verizon app. The offer &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2Fonline%2F5g-cell-phones%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360418%2Fverizon-april-fools-day-trade-in-broken-cracked-water-damage-phone-android-iphone-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will go live on this page&lt;/a&gt; starting April 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8KQTct"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Trust us — this offer is #NoJoke”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XuZgYa"&gt;So, here’s the fine print (there’s a lot of it, but it’s worth trudging through if you think you may want to try for the deal):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RWnyZj"&gt;Eligibility requires upgrading, or adding a new line and porting a number, to one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans with 5G&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0Qa1a0"&gt;For new lines and phone number port-ins &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt;: you can get a $300 Verizon e-gift card for an iPhone trade-in, or a $200 card for an Android phone (sent to you within eight weeks after transaction)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="74npNW"&gt;Stacked on that for new lines and port-ins (and also applicable for current customers): you’ll get up to $700 in monthly credits sent your way for an iPhone trade-in, or up to $800 for a qualified Android phone (sent to you as a credit each month over a 24-month period)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1qxg1k"&gt;Once all is said and done, you’ll eventually have a $300 Verizon credit sitting on your account, and / or an additional credit coming your way each month, which will lower the cost of your monthly bill. It won’t make the investment of buying a pricey, new 5G phone any less steep upfront, but it’ll soften the blow a little by spreading the credits out over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndZWHu"&gt;Verizon didn’t share exactly how much trade-in value every phone has, but it offered a list of phones that are in a “higher value” category and others that will fetch a “lower value.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Verizon trade in" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ew0cMFeYfkZ0u5p2VZK_24dWIEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410998/verizontrade.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, that’s right — Verizon will take your RED Hydrogen One as if that never happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H8BhBi"&gt;We’ve reached out to Verizon to see how long this promotion will last, as it didn’t share an end date. Also, Verizon didn’t share how many people per account can trade in broken phones for credits, so we’ve asked about that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cell phone plan fine print, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XX4UYQkK_A81tQh9b_JmRvspGho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055394/acastro_210330_4500_phoneData_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlimited plans from Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all have one thing in common: limitations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A guide to the limitations on your unlimited data&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ejBS9S"&gt;Phone plans are notorious for including the worst kinds of jargon — things that seem to tell you what you’re signing up for but actually conceal a long list of conditions and exceptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfKPDU"&gt;This is the industry that brought us the term “anytime minutes.” Seriously, have you ever really thought about that phrase? &lt;em&gt;Anytime minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Even the 10-year-old &lt;em&gt;Portlandia&lt;/em&gt; sketch where Kumail Nanjiani sells Fred and Carrie a phone plan is still painfully accurate. (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrccTMwoLv8"&gt;Go watch it&lt;/a&gt; for such gems as “After you pay for it, it is free” and “It’s just a one-time fee that you pay annually.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPW9SB"&gt;So it should come as no surprise that when wireless carriers call a service “Unlimited,” there are, in fact, limitations on it. T-Mobile recently brought attention to one of those practices known as “deprioritization” by introducing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;an unlimited plan without it&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s just one of a handful of fine print provisos that all three of the major US carriers impose on their customers. Here’s a jargon-free guide to the most common limitations on your favorite carrier’s so-called unlimited plans, postpaid and prepaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qHiyY4"&gt;Premium data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HnEpNO"&gt;You will likely see the phrase “premium data” or “premium network access” on your plan details; that’s a nice way of describing “deprioritization,” or “throttling” as it’s also called. This is when carriers temporarily slow down data speeds for their heaviest users when network traffic is high. The carriers say this practice is necessary to ensure networks aren’t overwhelmed. In many cases, deprioritization doesn’t kick in until users hit a certain monthly threshold of data usage — often 50GB — but some carriers’ lowest-tier plan subscribers are always subject to slowdowns, regardless of how much data they’ve used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="R5GdxD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some carriers’ lowest-tier plan subscribers are always subject to slowdowns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UzMdrt"&gt;That’s the case for users on Verizon’s Start Unlimited plan and AT&amp;amp;T’s Unlimited Starter, while those on the carriers’ more expensive unlimited plans aren’t subject to slowdowns until they’ve used 50GB in a month. T-Mobile’s basic Essentials plan includes a 50GB threshold. Its most expensive plan, Magenta Max, is the only one of the major carriers’ plans that doesn’t include a limit on its fastest mobile data speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBMPZK"&gt;Prepaid unlimited plans from all of the major carriers across the board are subject to slowdowns, regardless of how much data has been used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N9MpjO"&gt;Video streaming limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EherbJ"&gt;With your smartphone connected to home Wi-Fi, you can stream video at whatever resolution you please. Streaming video over mobile data is another story. Just about every phone plan out there limits streaming video to 480p quality, but there are a few exceptions. But even the plans that do support higher-quality streaming usually require you to enable it in your account. If you do have this option and choose to enable it, just keep in mind that streaming video might eat into your monthly “premium data” allotment faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yz9TMC"&gt;For example, Verizon’s more expensive unlimited plans include 720p streaming, but you need to log in to your account online and enable it. For an extra $10 per month, you can raise that to 1080p. And if you’re connected to the company’s fast Ultra Wideband 5G — which is only included on those more expensive unlimited plans — you’ll get streaming up to 4K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eoqSn2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even the plans that do support higher-quality streaming usually require you to enable it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8IM7fz"&gt;The other two carriers work in a similar way. AT&amp;amp;T’s basic unlimited plans get 480p, and while the “Elite” plan includes 1080p, you’ll need to turn off a feature called “Stream Saver” in your account settings to enable it. T-Mobile’s most expensive plan, Magenta Max, includes 4K streaming, which customers need to activate. All others are limited to 1.5Mbps, which essentially translates to 480p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0ysgF"&gt;With a couple of exceptions, customers on prepaid unlimited plans are restricted to 480p streaming, too. AT&amp;amp;T’s most expensive prepaid unlimited plan allows users to disable Stream Saver and get 1080p streaming if they like. Verizon prepaid customers on the unlimited plan with Ultra Wideband 5G service will also get 4K if they’re connected to that network. Some data-capped prepaid plans from T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T allow customers to opt for HD, but not so for basic unlimited plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UnH9SV"&gt;Tethering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ObhxDk"&gt;Another one for the category of “your unlimited data is not truly unlimited” is mobile tethering. Even though your phone might support tethering (using your mobile device’s data connection as a Wi-Fi hotspot or via a USB cable to your computer), your phone plan has limitations on if and how much you can use this feature. Basic unlimited plans tend to offer slow or no tethering at all, while even the most expensive plans include some limit to how much data you can use this way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="C0Hpfa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Basic unlimited plans tend to offer slow or no tethering at all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HLcpEf"&gt;There’s no mobile tethering offered on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s most basic unlimited plan. More expensive plans from both carriers offer progressively more generous 15GB and 30GB caps the more you pay. T-Mobile offers 3G tethering (600 Kbps) on its basic plan, which is adequate for web browsing but not ideal for streaming SD or HD video. Up to 5GB of much faster 4G / 5G data is included on its middle tier and a cap of 40GB on Magenta Max — these speeds will feel much closer to what you get with home internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrsCFv"&gt;Mobile tethering tends to not be included on basic prepaid unlimited plans; AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon offer it as an add-on for an additional monthly fee, while T-Mobile includes it at 3G speeds. The step-up prepaid unlimited plans include high-speed tethering across the board, albeit with a lower 10GB cap in all cases. Verizon does include unlimited Ultra Wideband 5G tethering for its top prepaid plan (again, if you can manage to find an Ultra Wideband signal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qhruad"&gt;Mexico and Canada&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vpbF5d"&gt;If there’s one way that your unlimited plan might actually be getting you more than you realized, it’s that your plan likely includes some international data for trips to Canada and Mexico. Most plans include, as a bare minimum, very slow 2G speeds in those countries, but a few include a certain amount of 4G data on either a monthly or daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FNWFev"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most plans include, as a bare minimum, very slow 2G speeds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RGkzUd"&gt;Verizon makes it simple: it includes up to 0.5GB per day for all of its postpaid and prepaid unlimited plans. Once that daily cap is reached, you’ll get 2G speeds after that. AT&amp;amp;T only says that all unlimited plans — postpaid and prepaid — include data in Mexico and Canada but that “2G off-net data speeds may apply.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeQe49"&gt;T-Mobile’s basic postpaid Essentials plan gets 2G only; the top-tier plans include 5GB of 4G monthly and then 2G after that. The company’s prepaid unlimited plans don’t include even 2G data, and “additional charges apply for international use.” Instead, users can add 5GB of 4G data for use in Canada and Mexico for an additional $5 per month. T-Mobile and Verizon also specify that the majority of a subscriber’s usage must come from within the US; otherwise, the companies are entitled to cut off international service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QDXOKP"&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="n9VNnO"&gt;Those are the major items, but what else will you find if you go peering down the dark alleyways of your phone contract? Some are obvious, like clauses to keep you from turning your phone into your home Wi-Fi hub. Plans with generous tethering data allowances are more likely to include these details, stating, for example, that the majority of use must come from a smartphone or tablet. And of course, your contract prohibits you from certain types of bad behavior and illegal activity. But you knew that already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzGw8Q"&gt;You might also be pleasantly surprised to find discounted or subsidized streaming video services are included in your plan, too, but you’ll definitely want to read the conditions closely. Often, it’s a promotion for a set time period, like Verizon’s “Disney Plus for six months on us,” after which you’ll be charged on your monthly phone bill unless you cancel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyTPmo"&gt;Others — usually on the more expensive plans — are included standard, like HBO Max included on AT&amp;amp;T’s Elite plan, and Netflix subscriptions on T-Mobile’s Magenta and Magenta Max. Even in those cases, you’ll want to read the conditions; a certain number of lines are required on T-Mobile to qualify for the Netflix deal, and the subscription offered may be for a more limited version, like SD quality only on one screen per account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="985AFE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s one more agreement in your contract to be aware of: the privacy policy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5TWlaB"&gt;But there’s one more agreement in your contract to be aware of: the privacy policy. Specifically, all three major carriers sell anonymized data about their customers to third-party advertisers in the name of serving more relevant ads. It’s an unwelcome but extremely common practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3ruipH"&gt;The good news is that you can opt out of these programs. Verizon customers can do so by logging in to My Verizon and following the steps on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fprivacy%2Ffull-privacy-policy%23acc-item-34&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360228%2Funlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s privacy page&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, T-Mobile customers can find instructions for opting out on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fprivacy-center%2Ftake-control-of-your-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360228%2Funlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;carrier’s privacy center page&lt;/a&gt;, and AT&amp;amp;T customers can opt out by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http://www.att.com/cmpchoice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321733/t-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22085774__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;logging in to their account’s privacy controls&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not going to stop the dozens upon dozens of other websites and services that you use from selling your information, but it’s at least one less source to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s iPhone 12 stand will follow you with face tracking (but not during video calls)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C_MyDRTOtdl9YM1IeiLdi0MLnHE=/240x0:1440x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69054852/belkin_MMA001btBK_movement_tracking_tripod_stand_playing_guitar_on_live_stream_carousel_1_v01_r01_1680x800_us.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bgwcJV"&gt;Belkin has a new iPhone stand that’s useful enough to be interesting but annoyingly limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSHDJV"&gt;The company’s “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-MMA001%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360203%2Fbelkin-iphone-12-magsafe-face-tracking-stand-no-video-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Magnetic Phone Mount with Face Tracking&lt;/a&gt;” works with the iPhone 12’s MagSafe feature, clipping your phone into place using the device’s built-in magnets. It then uses face tracking to follow you around the room, rotating so it’s always facing you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwSRbw"&gt;The catch is that this feature doesn’t work with video calls on Zoom, FaceTime, or any other similar service — surely one of the biggest potential use cases in a pandemic. In fact, judging by the product description, the tracking feature &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works when recording video through Belkin’s own iOS app. That would mean you can’t even use the stand to make sure your phone is always facing you as you follow along with an exercise video or recipe. We’ve reached out to Belkin to double check this and will update this article when we know more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9itFST-kcwCd0tftdHB2JqBUJ9E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410698/belkin_MMA001btBK_movement_tracking_tripod_stand_hosting_streaming_workout_session_carousel_2_v01_r01_1680x800_us.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can track yourself recording video but not watching it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1ij6qo"&gt;Being able to record video that tracks you will definitely be useful to some people, and Belkin says its iOS app can connect directly to social media accounts (including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and others) to make posting easy. But it still means the mount is more of a specialist tool than a device that could help more consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRDLhq"&gt;Other relevant specs: the mount works in landscape and portrait orientations, can be tilted vertically from -15 to 30 degrees, rotates horizontally through 360 degrees, and is powered by three AA batteries. And of course, because it uses MagSafe to attach to your phone, it only works with the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. The mount will sell for $65, but it’s only listed as “coming soon” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-MMA001%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360203%2Fbelkin-iphone-12-magsafe-face-tracking-stand-no-video-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Belkin’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s game over for Arizona’s controversial App Store bill</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The legislation disappeared before a scheduled vote last week, and now it’s likely done for the year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="bkMQgy"&gt;Arizona House Bill 2005, a hotly contested piece of legislation that would have imposed developer-friendly changes to Apple and Google’s mobile app stores, is now on death’s door. The &lt;a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/proposed/H.2005COBB.pdf"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt;, which would have allowed alternative payment systems on Android and iOS that bypass the stores’ 30 percent cuts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22349302/arizona-hb2005-bill-vote-skipped-senate-apple-google-ios-android-app-store"&gt;mysteriously disappeared last week&lt;/a&gt; prior to a scheduled vote that could have sent it straight to the governor’s desk to be signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBIRDW"&gt;The bill had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;just won a landmark victory in the Arizona House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, and the state Senate was officially set to begin its vote at 3PM local time. HB2005 was the first bill on the agenda, yet it never came up. Now, it turns out that the Senate decided to pull the bill at the last minute, and its sponsor tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that its fate is effectively sealed for the rest of the year. Arizona will wrap up its congressional session next month with no plans to hear HB2005 again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73lQ9d"&gt;That’s bad news for the bill’s proponents, which include a coalition of app makers and prominent Apple critics that have been outspoken in recent months on the need for regulations on mobile app distribution. The fight is being led by the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), an industry group consisting of Apple critics and competitors like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games and Spotify, that has taken the fight against alleged app store monopolies to the local stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mOVBtO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These bills are part of a far-reaching push to enact state-level app store regulations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCBpiZ"&gt;The CAF has begun lobbying state legislatures to introduce bills in more than a half-dozen states at this point, to varying degrees of success. HB2005 was its most promising campaign yet, after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;failure in North Dakota last month&lt;/a&gt; sank one of the first legitimate app store bills to go to vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHBsWI"&gt;The primary goal of these bills is to allow developers to bypass Apple and Google’s 30 percent app store commission, while much loftier aims include forcing Apple to allow entire alternative app marketplaces on iOS and making it illegal for tech companies to retaliate against developers for trying to bypass the app store policies. Apple has decried such bills by saying they threaten to “destroy the iPhone as you know it” by opening it up to security risks and undermining the revenue stream it says helps enforce App Store reviews and other benefits, though the company has only ever spoken publicly about such legislation through submitted testimony. Without Arizona, the movement is that much weaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3I4ZjZ"&gt;So who killed HB2005? We don’t really know, but a clearer picture is beginning to emerge. At the very least, congressional members have now been willing to say publicly that Big Tech lobbying had a noticeable effect on the bill just before it went up for a vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9CrNP"&gt;State Rep. Regina Cobb, the bill’s sponsor and a Republican representing the state’s fifth district, claims Apple and Google “hired almost every lobbyist in town” and named six specific lobbyists who, she says, caused Senate members who’d previously agreed to vote to waver. “We thought we had the votes before we went to the committee yesterday, and then we heard that the votes weren’t there and they weren’t going to take the time to put it up,” Cobb said of the Senate Commerce Committee’s decision to pull the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5nTLK"&gt;That lines up with what Commerce Committee Chair J.D. Mesnard, a Republican who represents Arizona’s District 17, &lt;a href="https://prospect.org/power/big-tech-lobbyists-take-down-arizonas-app-store-bill/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect &lt;/em&gt;on Friday of last week&lt;/a&gt;: he pulled the bill because he felt it would fail. “I polled the committee members and there just wasn’t enough support for it,” Mesnard said in an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Prospect&lt;/em&gt;. “A number of members were conflicted on it, others were just opposed. There was some support for it, but it definitely was coming up short.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14vlSr"&gt;Cobb says she doesn’t think anything illegal or nefarious occurred, just lobbying as usual — unlike outspoken Apple critic and Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, who publicly accused powerful corporations of making illicit deals, colluding with the chamber’s Democrats (some of whom opposed the bill) and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HFavHv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Google “hired almost every lobbyist in town”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1GDH0"&gt;“The big show turned out to be a no show,” Hansson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1374842497000673289"&gt;wrote on Twitter on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; of last week. “The bill was killed in mid-air while on the agenda with a backroom deal. Apple has hired the governor’s former chief of staff, and word is that he brokered a deal to prevent this from even being heard.” Although &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has heard a similar allegation from multiple sources with knowledge of the situation, no one, save Hansson, felt comfortable offering an explanation on the record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57ujSy"&gt;The seeming death of HB2005 and the confusion and mystery surrounding it underscore both the immense power of tech titans like Apple and Google and also the rough legislative road ahead for similar bills in Illinois, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and other states around the country. The clear takeaway is that although these bills are the result of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/technology/north-dakota-tech-apps.html"&gt;successful lobbying efforts&lt;/a&gt; from the CAF and its partners, the Silicon Valley lobbying that has arisen to counter these bills has proven just as savvy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5swZGE"&gt;“There’s a legitimate issue here. It’s undeniable [Apple and Google] have gatekeeper power and hold sway over the app stores, and there’s just nowhere else to go. You have to go through one of these companies to get your app before consumers,” says Pat Garofalo, the director of state and local policy at the nonprofit American Economic Liberties Project, which has voiced support for the bills. “It makes perfect sense there are lots of forces — whether they be small, medium, or large — arrayed on both sides of this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrxQZJ"&gt;Cobb admits she took up the cause after being approached by the CAF and that having other big tech companies as the opposition didn’t help because it added extreme pressure to the impending vote and caused a number of congressional members on both sides to express doubt and confusion about the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5fdApK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I realized once you start taking on Apple and Google this way you’re going to be hit pretty hard.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YbD0G"&gt;“I realized once you start taking on Apple and Google this way you’re going to be hit pretty hard,” Cobb said. She said she had multiple meetings with Apple, including with longtime Apple veteran Tim Powderly, the director of federal government affairs at the company. She says the conversations were cordial, but that Apple was very intent on finding a compromise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZWKnn"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this story. Google did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PrEzO1"&gt;Regardless of why the bill was pulled, the outcome is the same: Arizona HB2005 won’t be changing how Apple and Google operate their mobile app stores because its chances of ever becoming law are slim to none. “Unless it is brought as a striker, it will need to be re introduced next year,” Cobb told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in a follow-up email on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MaB8H"&gt;A striker, formally known as a “strike everything amendment,” is a controversial legislative maneuver that aims to replace the entire text of a bill in an attempt to reopen debate on it and push it forward without having to abide by standard deadlines. Cobb said such a move is unlikely at this point because strikers “often get negative publicity and they’re not always successful,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaT9br"&gt;While Cobb says she isn’t intimidated by Apple or Google, she also tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; she’s not likely to keep pushing unless she thinks she’ll succeed. “I’m trying to decide how much political capital I want to put into this.” Failing that, Arizona’s Congress will meet again the following January — but the state’s attempt at regulating Apple and Google’s app stores is effectively over for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HtKclx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This idea is out there, now this is sort of in the zeitgeist.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yggVg0"&gt;The CAF says it will continue the fight, even though it’s now seen two legislative defeats in its app store lobbying efforts, the first a more aggressive bill that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;failed to garner enough votes in the North Dakota House last month&lt;/a&gt;. “The legislative session is not over. We will continue to push for solutions that will increase choice, support app developers and small businesses and put a stop to monopolistic practices,” said Meghan DiMuzio, the CAF’s executive director, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBxbTg"&gt;Garofalo of the American Economic Liberties Project thinks it’s likely one of these state bills will succeed at one point, especially in the absence of meaningful federal regulation or antitrust enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VLYVc3"&gt;“This idea is out there, now this is sort of in the zeitgeist,” he said. “I do think a state will do this, and there are really good reasons for a state to do it.” All it will take, he adds, is a group of lawmakers that “hears the right arguments, gets the upside, and decides to do it.” At that point, the primary thing standing in the way will be the lobbying efforts of tech companies that stand to benefit when these bills fail. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple blocked some searches with the word ‘Asian,’ and now it’s getting fixed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KBYeeJdZ2lPDnpkTG1CjBtdT3Bg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69050574/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4DWj4R"&gt;Apple’s built-in web content filter for iOS and macOS has apparently been blocking any searches containing the word “Asian” for almost a year, and the error is finally getting fixed, according to a &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-asian-adult-content-filter-ios-fix/"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The issue shows up when you’re using a device that has the “Limit Adult Websites” content restriction turned on. But it’s not just blocking adult websites; it’s blocking almost any searches relating to Asian culture, including “Asian market,” “Asian culture,” and even “stop Asian hate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4HQNl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to confirm that the above searches were blocked on devices running current versions of Apple’s software (iPadOS 14.4.1 and macOS 11.2.3) with the content restrictions turned on. The searches are blocked on both Safari and Chrome on iOS devices, but Chrome was able to perform them on macOS. Devices without the content restrictions turned on can perform the searches and receive results. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nnBi-paaXCSm7De5vPXKvZYOqZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408688/IMG_A6361A17FF98_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The error message shown when a search is blocked by the content restrictions on an iPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NzBuf2"&gt;The good news is that the issue should soon be resolved. The searches work on devices running the iOS 14.5 beta, &lt;em&gt;Mashable &lt;/em&gt;reports. Still, it’s ridiculous that it took this long to fix: there are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/charliestigler/status/1229845987864109056"&gt;reports of the issue&lt;/a&gt; from February 2020, and it shouldn’t have been an issue in the first place. Of course, creating a filter for adult content is extremely difficult, but almost entirely blocking a word used to describe &lt;a href="https://asiapacific.unfpa.org/en/node/15207"&gt;60 percent of the world’s population&lt;/a&gt; is obviously incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35eD3x"&gt;In current, non-beta software, the filter behaves very strangely. “Asian restaurants” is blocked on macOS but not iOS, while “Asian food” is blocked on both. And while the issue has been around for a while, it’s especially embarrassing for Apple in the current moment, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358649/anti-asian-hate-violence-linkedin-content-moderation-atlanta-shooting"&gt;anti-Asian sentiment and violence have been on the rise&lt;/a&gt;. It’s good to see it should be solved in the next versions of iOS, but it shouldn’t have taken this long. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon says it will shut down its 3G network — for real this time — on December 31st, 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JsotKMjQE5x4o8PYbbzbbVWUHvM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049900/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon stopped activating phones on its 3G network several years ago.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rjM2ZN"&gt;After years of delays, Verizon says it will finally &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F3g-cdma-network-shut-date-set-december-31-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22358628%2Fverizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shut down its 3G CDMA network&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2022 — and the company means it this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KIxAK"&gt;Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/11/3488546/verizon-sunset-2g-3g-cdma-2021"&gt;initially targeted 2021&lt;/a&gt; for the shutdown and later revised with a more ambitious goal of 2019. That didn’t happen, and as recently as January 2021, the company said the plan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215453/verizon-3g-shutdown-paused-delay-network-old-phones"&gt;was on hold indefinitely&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Verizon has confirmed an official shutdown date of December 31st, 2022, and a statement that “the date will not be extended again” on the company’s news site leaves no room for ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzdy3l"&gt;This move won’t affect anyone who has activated a phone with Verizon in the past few years; the company stopped activating 3G-only phones in 2018. Verizon is also keen to point out that it will be the last major US carrier to take its 3G network offline. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;says it will shut down its network&lt;/a&gt; in February 2022, and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/05/t-mobile-3g-shutdown-reportedly-delayed-until-2022/"&gt;T-Mobile is aiming for January 1st, 2022&lt;/a&gt;, which could &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/what-t-mobile-3g-cdma-shutdown-means-for-boost-mobile"&gt;cause serious problems&lt;/a&gt; for millions of Dish Network’s Boost Mobile customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lUxhZH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon stopped activating 3G-only phones in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H3cshK"&gt;If you happen to still be using a 3G device on Verizon at this point (well done, you!), then you’ll need to upgrade to something 4G-compatible by the end of 2022 to keep using the network — and it might be a good idea to go for a 5G device at this point just to stay ahead of the next curve.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Area 120 incubator releases a powerful AI document scanner for Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0LkIYK9iwh9IhIfXkNrntStG9VQ=/107x0:1292x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048903/Screen_Shot_2021_03_30_at_9.01.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2GBHa9"&gt;Google’s Area 120, an internal incubator program for experimental projects, is releasing a new app today called Stack that borrows the technology underlying the search giant’s &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/document-ai"&gt;powerful DocAI enterprise tool&lt;/a&gt; for document analysis. The end result is a consumer document scanner app for Android that Google says vastly improves over your average mobile scanner by auto-categorizing documents into the titular stacks and enabling full text search through the contents of the documents and not just the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Bt1Ca"&gt;“I joined Google a couple of years ago when my education startup, Socratic, was acquired. At Socratic, we used Google’s computer vision and language understanding to make learning easier for high school students. I wondered if we could apply the same technologies to make organizing documents easier,” said Christopher Pedregal, the team lead on Stack, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FpXSKY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stack lets you search through the full text of scanned documents &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="muAoj3"&gt;Following the acquisition, Pedregal and his colleague Matthew Cowan joined Google’s Area 120, where they came up with an app that could use DocAI and its artificial intelligence technology to improve the process of scanning receipts, bills, and other important documents. The app uses Google’s biometric authentication on Android, so you can secure sensitive documents behind face or fingerprint scanning to unlock the software. It also automatically creates fields for scanned bills so you can fill in due dates and other important info. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3GTMH"&gt;The app, like so many of Google’s experimental (and sometimes even not-so-experimental) efforts, is getting released in the hopes it catches on and not with any real concrete business model attached or a definite roadmap. Pedregal stresses that “it’s early days” for Stack, which means the app can “still get things wrong.” It also means it could, at a moment’s notice, get sent to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;Google Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; — though, presumably, with the option to export your documents if that does happen at some point in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAX5gh"&gt;That said, it seems like a powerful alternative to a normal document scanner, and few companies are better than Google at understanding text and recognizing images. So it’s certainly worth a shot if you’re in the market for a better way to organize your real-world paper. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Codename: Urban Legends is a taste of what Niantic thinks 5G could do for AR gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g22CO7uRg3ebCUxumkI0ShCf9kI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047739/5G_MEC_Codename_Urban_Legends_Hero_D__1___1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2X0fuI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; developer Niantic has &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/niantic-planet-scale-ar-5g-multiplayer"&gt;unveiled &lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which it describes as “a multiplayer demo experience that offers a glimpse into the future of AR and 5G networks.” The game revolves around casting magic spells to kill monsters and rescue allies. It’s similar to Niantic’s previously released games, but the trailer includes a unique feature: multiple players interacting with the same augmented reality creatures from their own phones. Niantic says it’s just a demo at the moment and not for general consumer use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaDxce"&gt;It’s an exciting shift from Niantic’s previously released games like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, and the company says this is largely thanks to 5G&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Although its games have had multiplayer elements, for the most part each player exists in their own augmented reality worlds. For example, while the same pokémon appear on the map for every player in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, each player can only view and interact with their own creatures in AR. In other words, you can’t throw a pokéball to catch someone else’s augmented reality pokémon. (&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Go&lt;/em&gt; has a limited &lt;a href="https://niantic.helpshift.com/a/pokemon-go/?s=buddy-pokemon&amp;amp;f=shared-ar-experience-with-your-buddy&amp;amp;l=en&amp;amp;p=web"&gt;shared AR experience mode&lt;/a&gt; where you can see other players’ pokémon but not interact with them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iP56r2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A multiplayer demo experience that offers a glimpse into the future of AR and 5G networks”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BaVrf9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legend&lt;/em&gt;s isbuilt on the same platform that underpins the augmented reality games &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;. Niantic hopes that AR gaming will be 5G’s “killer app,” benefiting from its higher speeds, lower latency, and ability to keep lots of people’s phones connected to the internet in a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trziOF"&gt;Niantic says that carriers from its &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/niantic-planet-scale-ar-alliance-5g"&gt;Planet-Scale AR Alliance&lt;/a&gt; — an organization formed of over half a dozen carriers around the world aimed at developing augmented reality 5G experiences — have been network testing the game. These include Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, Globe Telecom in the Philippines, and Verizon in the US. Niantic &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/niantic-planet-scale-ar-alliance-5g"&gt;formed the alliance last year&lt;/a&gt; to promote and develop augmented reality experiences for 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtaV8l"&gt;Although it’s a cool demo, &lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reliance on 5G risks replicating some of the geographical issues that affected &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go. &lt;/em&gt;5G coverage is currently concentrated in cities, meaning players living in more rural areas risk losing out (&lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends &lt;/em&gt;works on both Sub-6GHz and mmWave variants of 5G). It was a similar situation when city-dwelling &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;players benefited from having more pokéstops and gyms compared to players out in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGG3TC"&gt;Today’s announcement doesn’t say when the demo might turn into a real game or on which phones it runs. However, Niantic tells us the game will be exclusive to its carrier partners’ customers once it releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JFiPv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends&lt;/em&gt; is an interesting tech demo, and it has the potential to expand on &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;’s augmented reality features in some interesting ways. We just want to know when players will be able to dive in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s new logo is almost unrecognizable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fOJTpR6OmjyOacN7eoScADglUcg=/160x0:2059x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047710/Screen_Shot_2021_03_30_at_12.51.31_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xiaomi’s new logo (left) and old logo (right). &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="05KiGt"&gt;No one in the world does corporate pomposity quite like tech firms, and Chinese mobile giant Xiaomi is no exception. The company announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;new foldable Mi Mix Fold today&lt;/a&gt;, but it also revealed a new logo, spending more than 20 minutes describing the process in which it turned its old square design into... a squircle. (Halfway between a square and a circle.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JigPOx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Xiaomi says the new logo has a new “internal spirit,” too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U3HWJE"&gt;In fairness to Xiaomi, the company is not blind to the fact its new logo is &lt;em&gt;pretty similar&lt;/em&gt; in appearance to the old one. “Are you disappointed at this logo, that we just made our original logo rounder?” asked Xiaomi’s CEO Lei Jun, somewhat rhetorically. No worry, Lei explained, as the company “didn’t just change the shape from square to round” but also changed “the internal spirit as well as the mentality of the brand.” So, that’s reassuring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEElAD"&gt;The company went on to note that the shape of the new logo can be described using mathematical equations (a property that is common to most shapes, I believe) and that it took the firm a long time to pick the right one (it started the rebranding process in 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98iYgb"&gt;You can see some of the shapes it considered and discarded below, along with the blindingly, obviously, self-evidently superior final design. N:3, could it be any other way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T8VZNL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10419708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FtECfm"&gt;We’re having some fun at Xiaomi’s expense here, but really this is just par for the course when it comes to corporate redesigns. Indeed, this sort of long-winded, self-indulgent presentation is common to pretty much all big tech brands at this point, from Samsung to Microsoft to Apple (who started the game and remains the master of the form). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiVBtm"&gt;As Lei explained, the new logo is part of a bigger overhaul of Xiaomi’s “brand identity” overseen by famed Japanese designer Kenya Hara. “The new logo is not a simple redesign of the shape but an encapsulation of Xiaomi’s inner spirit,” said Hara during a video segment. “The design is essentially a reflection of the concept ‘Alive.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZgAqV"&gt;So, if you feel dead inside considering the millions of dollars of work that went into circling the square of Xiaomi’s logo: don’t. That’s disrespectful to its brand identity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi announces the Mi Mix Fold, its first folding phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RCsMj-zHd0WmoMDy0CBaSsJBZks=/0x0:1688x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047687/mf1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mi Mix Fold pairs a folding screen on the inside with a smaller outer display. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Px37br"&gt;Xiaomi has resurrected its Mi Mix series with the Mi Mix Fold, the company’s first commercial folding phone. Unlike previous outlandish Mix devices and concepts from the company, the Mi Mix Fold is a pretty conventional folding phone that uses a big-screen-on-the-inside / small-screen-on-the-outside design similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Huawei’s new Mate X2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNbPcj"&gt;The inner screen is an 8.01-inch 4:3 OLED panel with 2480 x 1860 resolution, a standard display brightness of 600 nits (900 peak), and support for Dolby Vision HDR. Xiaomi says the display is able to withstand being folded 200,000 times. The outer screen is 6.52-inches with a 90Hz refresh rate. Xiaomi is making big claims about the Mi Mix Fold’s audio capabilities, with four Harman Kardon-tuned speakers and what the company describes as 3D panoramic sound.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GcyVDYwontZoiL40zB4XrIT8x8k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407567/MIX_Fold__21_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone has a camera with a liquid lens on the rear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f5Q0Hb"&gt;The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 paired with 12GB or 16GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage. Battery capacity is 5,020mAh, and Xiaomi says the 67W fast-charging system should get you a full charge in 37 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4Xy8k"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350245/xiaomi-mi-mix-liquid-lens-autofocus-focal-length-camera"&gt;previously teased&lt;/a&gt; last week, the new Mix is also the first phone to use liquid lens technology in its camera. Xiaomi says that it allows for a telephoto lens with a close focusing distance of 3cm and optical zoom of 3x, or 30x hybrid zoom. The rest of the camera system is comprised of a Samsung HMX 108-megapixel main sensor and a 13-megapixel ultrawide, which sounds like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;the same solid setup that’s on the Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ejj5UQvBfcj0lHw62SyX6AsH_a8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407568/MIX_Fold__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The inner screen is an 8.01-inch 4:3 OLED panel with “2K+” resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7B1jVL"&gt;Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194065/xiaomi-foldable-phone-tablet-device-teaser"&gt;first showed off a folding phone prototype&lt;/a&gt; more than two years ago, before Samsung shipped its first Galaxy Fold. That device had a double-folding design where a tablet-sized screen could be bent back on the left and right edges for a more phone-like experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ae1pI"&gt;Later that year, Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/24/20881378/xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-announced-wrap-around-screen"&gt;announced the Mi Mix Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, which had a wraparound screen that covered almost the whole phone, but it never made it to market. More recently Xiaomi unveiled its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267807/xiaomi-quad-curved-waterfall-display-concept-phone-announced"&gt;latest concept phone&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a “quad-curved waterfall display” that curved on all four sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kyt1GQ"&gt;The Mi Mix Fold, on the other hand, is very much going on sale — people in China are able to preorder it as of today, and it’ll ship on April 16th. Prices start at 9,999 yuan (around $1,521) for a model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, going all the way up to 12,999 yuan (around $1,978) for a 16GB / 512GB ceramic special edition. There’s no word yet on a release outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;
