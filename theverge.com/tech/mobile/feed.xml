    <title>Pocket’s sort by time to read feature seems designed for the return of commutes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPYtvq3Yi4YITDbBlyq2Vl6nNrg=/70x70:1036x714/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68957097/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_10.19.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Pocket&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2AtnIX"&gt;Pocket, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/27/14752590/mozilla-acquires-pocket-read-it-later"&gt;an app for saving articles to read later&lt;/a&gt;, is rolling out a sorting option to Android users over the next few weeks that could solve my paralysis when choosing something to read. The new sort by time-to-read feature, spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1370081315719110658/photo/1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s Dan Seifert&lt;/a&gt;, means articles can be organized where they fit best, whether it’s the five minutes it takes to microwave lunch, or a 20-minute wait for the late bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkGs37"&gt;The feature appears in both the search section of the app, and as a sorting feature in your main list. A reader can sort their saved article search by length, choosing from Quick (less than five minutes), Medium (six to ten minutes), Long (eleven to twelve minutes), and Very Long (over twenty-one minutes). Your list of saved articles can also be organized by newest saved, oldest saved, longest to read, and shortest read, according to Pocket’s VP and General Manager Matt Koidin. If the feature proves popular, after Pocket “modernizes its iOS codebase,” Koidin says the company will bring these sorting options to iOS and the web as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kphJhj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I have wanted this feature in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pocket?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Pocket&lt;/a&gt; for YEARS, thrilled it's finally a thing &lt;a href="https://t.co/Xpaxkz4awm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Xpaxkz4awm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— dan seifert (@dcseifert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1370081315719110658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kSDPor"&gt;In my pre-pandemic life, when I used to ride the bus to work almost every day, I’d constantly misjudge what I was getting myself into when deciding what to read. Pocket’s pre-existing time-to-read stamps for articles help, but when you have a dragon’s hoard of writing you wanted to read at some point, things get complicated. Finding an article that can fit into a typical commute time might help people actually finish reading what they care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEhl81"&gt;I assumed reading time was personalized, but Koidin says that Pocket actually bases its estimates on an average 220 words-per-minute reading speed. Now the hair on the back of my neck goes up when I think about great writing as a reading length first, rather than a holistic work of creative effort, but I think it’s easy to see how useful this could be (if I wasn’t shackled to an iPhone currently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15NbXJ"&gt;Commutes might not be in the equation for everyone just yet, but for those who still travel to work regularly, the feature might help. It at least has me missing my reading time on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Almost all of LG’s Android 11 updates aren’t coming until the end of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3xU6sLQGi-VF0k51MRC4uxwX3c4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68955865/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jB1tF0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lg.com/de/android-updates"&gt;LG’s German&lt;/a&gt; website has revealed its Android 11 update roadmap — at least for Europe — and the news isn’t too encouraging. With the exception of the LG Velvet 5G, most of the company’s phones won’t get Android 11 until the back half of 2021, with the vast majority of devices not seeing the update until at least Q4 2021 (long after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;Android &lt;em&gt;12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; should be available, if Google’s release schedule is similar this year). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98aXQk"&gt;It’s worth noting that the released schedule is only from LG’s German site. It’s possible that time frames will be different in other regions, that LG could add more devices over time, or that the updates will simply take less time to develop than the company expects. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BCIctszh8vH1l1bOUfYP14fxeUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365453/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_10.43.55_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gv2P4A"&gt;The slow update speed isn’t entirely surprisingly, though. LG’s phone business has been struggling for years, prompting reports that the company is considering exiting the smartphone space entirely this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240282/lg-smartphone-business-exit-2021-internal-memo"&gt;although the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in January that nothing has been finalized yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4ZVjV"&gt;LG has also denied rumors that its next major smartphone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296298/lg-rollable-denial-not-on-hold-or-cancelled"&gt;the LG Rollable&lt;/a&gt;, has been canceled, although there’s still no firm release date for that device either outside of a vague 2021 window. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s long-promised 5G home broadband will launch later this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xSH8vXRo5Bmuw4wCC_DHyAtOB6U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951865/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile hopes to expand the service to 7 to 8 million customers in the next five years | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d8ZTO1"&gt;At an analyst event on Thursday, T-Mobile revealed that its long-awaited 5G home broadband service will launch later this month, which it confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; A 4G version of the service is currently in pilot testing with 100,000 households. By the end of the year, T-Mobile says it hopes to extend the service to 7–8 million customers within five years. There’s no confirmed launch date for the service yet, but we’ll know more later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCrFgl"&gt;The company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254853/tmobile-sprint-merger-5g-home-internet-service-promises"&gt;promising 5G-based wireless broadband&lt;/a&gt; since before its acquisition of Sprint, saying that the merger would make it possible to offer service that would challenge the dominant cable companies. Before the deal was approved, T-Mobile went ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;started testing out the service&lt;/a&gt; with a limited group of customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0z9D8s"&gt;The self-styled Uncarrier isn’t the only one testing the waters of fixed wireless internet. Verizon &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fc-band-verizon-expands-5g-home-internet&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325833%2Ft-mobile-5g-home-broadband-internet-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just expanded&lt;/a&gt; its 5G home internet service to ten more cities, though in testing last year &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/for-now-verizons-5g-home-internet-service-offers-very-little-coverage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; that actual availability in the cities Verizon serves is scarce. If nothing else, both companies seem plenty motivated to get 5G home internet up and running. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pakistan is again banning TikTok, this time for ‘peddling vulgarity’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufLIkvf3ZyakkULTvro5-1pWqgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951763/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hGrOzk"&gt;Pakistan has banned TikTok yet again, citing objectionable content on the shortform video app. This is the second time the ByteDance platform has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509817/tiktok-pakistan-ban-immoral-indecent-content"&gt;banned in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, following a brief 10-day shutdown in October of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONMcK"&gt;Last fall, TikTok was banned for hosting “immoral” and “indecent” videos, but the company was able to assure the Pakistani government that videos would be moderated “in accordance with societal norms and the laws of Pakistan,” and the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523094/pakistan-tiktok-ban-lifted-after-10-days"&gt;resumed operations&lt;/a&gt; a week and a half later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kgMTQd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In respectful compliance to the orders of the Peshawar High Court, PTA has issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok App. During the hearing of a case today, the PHC has ordered for the blocking of App.&lt;/p&gt;— PTA (@PTAofficialpk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PTAofficialpk/status/1370044117678444544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s4pyxu"&gt;The company has tens of millions of users in Pakistan, and yet a high court in the city of Peshawar ordered the government’s telecom regulatory body, the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority, to ban the app in order to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOV0rz"&gt;“In respectful compliance to the orders of the Peshawar High Court, PTA has issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok App,” reads the announcement. “During the hearing of a case today, the PHC has ordered for the blocking of App.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnTr1J"&gt;It’s not entirely clear why TikTok’s legality in Pakistan is again in question and whether any one video or trend on the app is the culprit. Yet, &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/11/pakistani-court-orders-tik-tok-banned-over-obscene"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that complaints were made from Peshawar High Court Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan, who accused TikTok of hosting content “unacceptable for Pakistani society.” &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/90df50e4-7fd9-4def-86e3-db256882140d"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Khan said the platform engaged in “peddling vulgarity” and ordered the ban take effect immediately during a hearing on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n1gtY3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the second ban for TikTok in Pakistani in the last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9vyZs6"&gt;“TikTok is built upon the foundation of creative expression, with strong safeguards in place to keep inappropriate content off the platform,” TikTok said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In Pakistan we have grown our local-language moderation team, and have mechanisms to report and remove content in violation of our community guidelines. We look forward to continuing to serve the millions of TikTok users and creators in Pakistan who have found a home for creativity and fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wCZ8I"&gt;TikTok has endured a number of contentious government bans and other restrictions around the world — most notably, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262940/tiktok-leaves-india-ban-app-china-government-security-privacy"&gt;countrywide ban in India since last summer&lt;/a&gt; and the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;hamfisted attempt&lt;/a&gt; to force the company to partner with a US tech firm to assuage fears of Chinese government influence over the platform. (That deal, with cloud giant Oracle, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276090/tiktok-oracle-deal-biden-trump-ban-china-bytedance-white-house"&gt;apparently on life support&lt;/a&gt; under President Joe Biden.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OJcgI"&gt;The app has faced its most serious opposition in and around Southeast Asia, where governments have extended existing control over the media to the video-centric social network using laws and regulations around what constitutes obscene or immoral content. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile plans to turn up 5G speed this year, cover 90 percent of Americans with fast 5G by 2024</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d1ALIQN-zGC7S5F5hxvsqxiV0yk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951303/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile is keen to stay ahead of the 5G competition | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5066wz"&gt;During its &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/T-Mobile-Virtual-Analyst-Day/default.aspx"&gt;virtual analyst event&lt;/a&gt; today, T-Mobile outlined &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eliblumenthal/status/1370098384816779265?s=20"&gt;some bold plans&lt;/a&gt; for expanding its 5G coverage and speeding up its current offerings. The company says that by the end of 2023, it will cover 90 percent of Americans (about 300 million) with what it calls Ultra Capacity 5G (its faster mid-band and mmWave service). It also plans to cover 97 percent of Americans (approximately 320 million) by the end of 2022 with its slower low-band 5G, which it calls Extended Range. Currently, 125 million are covered by Ultra Capacity, with Extended Range covering 287 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHYsUO"&gt;Additionally, those currently covered by Ultra Capacity 5G will see an increase in average speeds from 300Mbps up to 400Mbps, thanks to additional megahertz devoted to 5G, and T-Mobile says that more speed increases are on the way. This portion of T-Mobile’s 5G service is largely based on spectrum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202726/tmobile-sprint-acquisition-ceo-finished-john-legere-steps-down"&gt;acquired from its Sprint merger&lt;/a&gt;, with mid-band frequencies well-suited to faster speeds and broad coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sfFCloG7qNYmJkL-vz7n6C2PeQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363649/slack_imgs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s C-band acquisition figures into expansion plans starting in 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S1S5xW"&gt;Already having access to those mid-band frequencies allowed T-Mobile to take a less aggressive approach to the recent FCC C-band auction, a fact it celebrated throughout its investor call today. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Ft-mobile-further-solidifies-5g-leadership-position-with-successful-c-band-auction&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325857%2Ft-mobile-5g-coverage-ultra-capacity-extended-range" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile says its comparatively low bid&lt;/a&gt; of $9.3 billion (Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T bid $45.4 and $23.4 billion, respectively) went toward spectrum that would strategically supplement its current 2.5GHz holdings. Those frequencies will become available in 2023 and likely figure into the latter part of the company’s aggressive expansion plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoyhdH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction March 11th, 4:32PM PT: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T bid $45.4 and $23.4 billion respectively in the recent FCC auction. A previous version of this article said that the companies bid $45.4 and $23.4 million, which would have been quite a steal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo announces Find X3 Pro flagship with microscope camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OP9PQ9ME_gfB9dweKHvjtlEq0RE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947568/DSCF7577.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="26hpQt"&gt;After a drawn-out series of leaks and teases, Oppo has announced its 2021 flagship in full. The Find X3 Pro is a sleek, powerful phone with an unusual design and some unique features to match. It’s also an important device for Oppo, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318941/china-smartphone-market-share-oppo-huawei-vivo-apple-xiaomi-january-2021"&gt;recently overtook Huawei&lt;/a&gt; in the Chinese smartphone market and will be looking to capitalize on its rival’s troubles this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNJdHd"&gt;The Find X3 Pro’s most arresting visual element is its camera bump, which almost looks organic in the way it seamlessly rises from the same piece of glass as the rest of the phone’s back panel. Combined with the finish, which on my unit is aggressively shiny and glossy, the phone looks sort of like it was forged out of &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2-&lt;/em&gt;style liquid metal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/li_PZuoMOeFQdhkYRQU8RIWZ1lY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362260/DSCF7572.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Sbic"&gt;The camera system itself is no less unusual. There’s a primary camera and an ultrawide that both use 50-megapixel 1/1.56-inch Sony IMX766 sensors, meaning the image quality should be comparable across both, though we’ll have to see how that bears out in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqWHj8"&gt;There’s also a 3-megapixel microlens, which shouldn’t be mistaken for the useless macro cameras found in some phones today. Oppo claims up to 60x magnification, and it’s more like a microscope than a macro lens — you can take pictures of things like subpixel layouts on screens, and there’s even a ring light to illuminate the subject. I’m not sure if this will be a selling point for many people, but in my early testing I can confirm that it’s pretty cool. Here’s a quick shot of my computer monitor:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BZdLCMaTM4xe51OWFwIKTXjA2t4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362255/IMG20210311143520_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ibrXP2"&gt;You’ll notice that the whole shot isn’t quite in focus, and that’s because depth of field is extremely shallow when shooting this close — you have to get within millimeters. I probably need more practice using the microlens, but my first impression is that it might be more useful for looking at things in real time than capturing them for sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQIVVq"&gt;One notable omission is a periscope zoom lens, even though Oppo did more than anyone to popularize the technology. There is a telephoto lens here, but it’s just a 13-megapixel sensor with 2x optical zoom over the primary camera. That’s not necessarily a downgrade, since it could improve image quality at mid-range shooting distances, but it does mean the Find X3 Pro won’t have anywhere near as much zoom reach as its 5x-telephoto-equipped predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2ZGfAfwu3JOBgQC-Q2ad5yxCmM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362261/DSCF7578.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tWxaBM"&gt;The Find X3 Pro’s display is another key feature; it’s a 3216 x 1440 LTPO OLED panel with a peak brightness of 1,300 nits and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Oppo is making a big deal out of the fact that it’s a 10-bit panel and that it’s integrated full-path color management into ColorOS; this means photos and videos captured with the cameras can be displayed with more than a billion colors, as opposed to the 16.7 million colors on conventional smartphone screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKe3mQ"&gt;The Find X3 Pro has typically flagship-tier internals: a Snapdragon 888 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The 4,500mAh battery can be fast-charged at up to 65W, and Oppo has finally embraced wireless charging on a flagship with a 30W system that can fully charge the phone in 80 minutes. The lack of wireless charging was my biggest knock against the Find X2 Pro, so Oppo’s off to a good start here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbpxC7"&gt;We don’t have pricing or release details for the Find X3 Pro just yet; Oppo plans to announce that next week. Stay tuned for more information and a full review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon decrees only ‘premium’ customers can escape its slowest 5G speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wfNicsIBDiN9I_ObyseevKZKQ64=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68945901/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Verizon wants to funnel more customers into its more expensive unlimited plans. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7u1DyK"&gt;If you’re on a basic Verizon plan, you’re going to be stuck with the company’s poor performing “nationwide” 5G network — even after critical C-band spectrum comes online. The company revealed in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0JNCwmCmCg"&gt;presentation to investors&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that C-band frequencies, and their faster speeds, will only be available to customers on “premium” unlimited plans. Those on metered or the basic Start Unlimited plan will be relegated to slower, low-band 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CiFr0q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Verizon confirms that to access C-Band you will need a premium unlimited plan like its Play More, Do More and Get More. If you have an older plan you'll only have access to its DSS "nationwide" 5G, not this newer and faster flavor.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/JH1uTixZaI"&gt;https://t.co/JH1uTixZaI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eli Blumenthal (@eliblumenthal) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eliblumenthal/status/1369798985016373251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="919wxO"&gt;This is essentially how the company already treats its ultra-fast mmWave 5G: customers on the base-level unlimited plan don’t have access to this network, while Play More, Do More, and Get More Unlimited subscribers do. Customers on metered plans don’t have mmWave access either, and likewise won’t have C-band, though they can add access to both for an additional fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1HI3Uz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company is extremely keen to funnel customers into “step up” plans and is using that C-band spectrum as incentive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vA0agR"&gt;That’s bad news for Verizon customers hoping that C-band would improve the poor performance they’re seeing on the company’s nationwide 5G. The network currently uses narrow low-band channels not well suited for 5G, and relies on a technology called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing to accommodate 4G and 5G traffic on the same frequencies. As a result, Verizon’s 5G speeds are closer to 4G — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196060/verizon-5g-slower-than-lte-speed-test"&gt;and at times even slower&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gG3daF"&gt;Verizon has been limited by the spectrum it has access to, and so it spent big in the recent FCC auction of mid-band frequencies known as C-band. This chunk of spectrum is ideal for 5G, offering faster speeds than LTE with coverage that’s broader than range-limited mmWave. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;The company bid $45.4 billion on C-band licenses&lt;/a&gt; — more than double what AT&amp;amp;T spent. When these blocks of frequencies start becoming available at the end of the year, it should significantly boost the network’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gmzDf5VcpUEMbWWLSRqpjNa1ac0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361438/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_5.41.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon predicts premium unlimited plans will make up 50% of its postpaid account mix by the end of 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XITILH"&gt;And that $45 billion is just the start. Verizon revealed on its investor presentation that it plans to spend an additional $10 billion over the next three years on C-band deployment, above and beyond its expected capital expenditure. That’s likely why the company is extremely keen to funnel customers into “step up” plans, and is using that C-band spectrum as incentive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49XVIf"&gt;Verizon also says that going forward, all new phones that it sells will be C-band compatible. That’s already the case for flagships like the Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12 series, but not all budget or midrange phone are C-band compatible in the US. That’s one less thing for phone shoppers to have to think about when buying a phone with Verizon, but it also makes Verizon’s job of talking you into a more expensive plan easier, too. And if you’re on one of their basic plans, you might be hearing that sales pitch sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked OnePlus 9 Pro and OnePlus 9 renders leave little to the imagination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Ju1cBmowIpZypZy9QCMvxTlBOE=/202x0:1822x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68945213/oneplus_leak.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images of OnePlus’ upcoming 9-series phones show prominent branding from camera partner Hasselblad. | Image: WinFuture&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gGsXN9"&gt;We have a very clear picture of what the upcoming OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro will look like thanks to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture &lt;/em&gt;— the site has &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,121663.html"&gt;published a whole bunch of official press renders&lt;/a&gt; of the upcoming phones well ahead of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22315517/oneplus-9-launch-date-hasselblad-camera"&gt;March 23rd launch&lt;/a&gt;. We got our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319657/oneplus-9-charger-in-box-pete-lau-announcement"&gt;first official look&lt;/a&gt; at the upcoming flagship in a teaser video from OnePlus earlier this week, but this latest leak features both regular and Pro models from multiple angles in a variety of colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QodKHK"&gt;These renders align with what OnePlus has already shared, and they also resemble an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174437/oneplus-9-photos-leak-2021-flagship"&gt;alleged prototype device&lt;/a&gt; that was leaked late last year. It appears that the OnePlus 9 Pro will come with a slightly curved 6.7-inch display, and the OnePlus 9 will feature a flat 6.5-inch screen. That’s about the extent of the spec details in this leak; &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; speculates that the 9 may use a plastic chassis rather than metal, but it’s hard to say for sure based on these images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xusBIS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10385194"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1pZUzb"&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; evident is the Hasselblad branding on both devices’ camera bumps, thanks to a new partnership. Both phones include a Sony IMX789 sensor in the main camera, and as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369304680241762311"&gt;confirmed by OnePlus CEO Pete Lau&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, an ultrawide camera will be included with a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor. That’s an unusually high resolution count for an ultrawide, but as Lau demonstrates with some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369505640771633157"&gt;side-by-side images&lt;/a&gt;, those extra pixels might allow for more aggressive distortion correction and cropping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZ85vg"&gt;Outside of camera lenses, these renderings show the range of color options we can likely expect from the 9 and 9 Pro. The 9 Pro is shown in sturdy black, olive green, and metallic silver. The 9 looks to be offered in black, with more laid-back blue and purple options available, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A YouTuber has already posted a full Galaxy A52 5G unboxing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SefcI2MdrvWvu0FJjNfLlRMxlOs=/267x0:1842x1050/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944216/galaxya52_unboxing_leak.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;New A-series phones, including the A52 5G seen here, are expected to debut on March 17th. | Image: Moboaesthetics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1uGRyb"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G will likely be announced next week at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322232/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-unpacked-event-awesome"&gt;Samsung’s second Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt; of the year, but thanks to an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/gKPSqrWtAKc"&gt;early unboxing&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a52_5g_appears_in_unboxing_video-news-48142.php"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we won’t have to wait that long to see it in action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcfms9"&gt;The upcoming midrange device has been subject to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;plenty of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309330/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-security-updates-leak"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt; over the past few weeks, and the video from YouTuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh1fruDeJL4QcVgFUULX_cQ"&gt;Moboaesthetics&lt;/a&gt; seems to confirm many of them. The device in the video matches up with previously leaked renders and appears to be fully functional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbnzcg"&gt;Specs featured in the lengthy video include a 64-megapixel main camera with OIS, a 120Hz display, IP67 dust and water resistance, under-screen fingerprint sensor, and a 4,500mAh battery. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230868/samsung-galaxy-s21-storage-microsd-support-slot"&gt;Unlike the S21 series&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a microSD card slot for memory expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dQsP3w"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKPSqrWtAKc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tolgqU"&gt;The A52 5G and also-rumored A72 5G are both expected to be accompanied by cheaper non-5G variants with other slightly downgraded specs, like a 90Hz screen rather than 120Hz. All told, they’re shaping up to look like highly competitive midrange phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAegLA"&gt;Samsung has not confirmed exactly what it’s announcing at next week’s event, but given the appearance of this video and the recent leaks, it seems certain that the A52 5G will be making its debut soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter tries to fix problematic image crops by not cropping pictures anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4gOvrR0-X2nZdOI9bHzEx72IW3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942725/akrales_180620_1777_0282.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HE8qby"&gt;Twitter has devised a potential solution to its problematic image cropping issue: no more cropping. The company said on Wednesday it’s now testing a “what you see is what you get” image preview within the tweet compose box and experimenting with displaying full-frame images. That way, images will show up in the Twitter timeline looking just as they did when the user was composing the tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPy8CD"&gt;“Now testing on Android and iOS: when you Tweet a single image, how the image appears in the Tweet composer is how it will look on the timeline –– bigger and better,” the company wrote in its announcement tweet on the new feature test. Twitter also says its testing new 4K image uploading on Android and iOS as part of a broader push “to improve how you can share and view media on Twitter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gs69cb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now testing on Android and iOS: when you Tweet a single image, how the image appears in the Tweet composer is how it will look on the timeline –– bigger and better. &lt;a href="https://t.co/izI5S9VRdX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/izI5S9VRdX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1369680667886444548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zh1e8t"&gt;With the new image preview change, there should be less algorithmic surprises — like the ones several users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;brought attention to last fall&lt;/a&gt; that showed how the company’s automated cropping tool quite often favored white faces over Black ones. In many of those cases, irregularly sized images shared on Twitter were automatically cropped behind the scenes using an AI-powered algorithm, but in ways that raised some troubling questions about how the software prioritized skin color and other factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k1sqTZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Trying a horrible experiment...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which will the Twitter algorithm pick: Mitch McConnell or Barack Obama? &lt;a href="https://t.co/bR1GRyCkia"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bR1GRyCkia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tony “Abolish ICE” Arcieri   (@bascule) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bascule/status/1307440596668182528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 19, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BvAmEm"&gt;Twitter at the time said the neural network it uses for automated image cropping was tested for racial bias, and the company claims it found none. But it also admitted it needed to perform more analysis and refine its approach to avoid situations like this where even the appearance of bias was a possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaGZrA"&gt;“It’s clear that we’ve got more analysis to do. We’ll open source our work so others can review and replicate,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lizkelley/status/1307742267193532416"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; Twitter communications lead Liz Kelley in the aftermath of the controversy going viral. “Just because a system shows no statistical bias, doesn’t mean it won’t cause harm.” Kelley said Twitter would rely “less on auto-cropping so more often the photo you see in the Tweet composer is what it will look like in the Tweet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aPUBWa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;we are going to rely less on auto-cropping so more often the photo you see in the Tweet composer is what it will look like in the Tweet   =  &lt;/p&gt;— liz kelley (@lizkelley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lizkelley/status/1311796809652555776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 1, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bjw06K"&gt;Twitter’s Parag Agrawal, the company’s chief technology officer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498619/twitter-image-cropping-update-racial-bias-machine-learning"&gt;later wrote a blog post delving into the issue at length&lt;/a&gt;, saying at the time that Twitter would be conducting “additional analysis to add further rigor to our testing” and that it was “committed to sharing our findings and... exploring ways to open-source our analysis so that others can help keep us accountable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01NJCK"&gt;Now, it looks like Twitter’s proposed solution is here, at least in a test phase. While tweets in standard aspect ratios will be identical when previewed in the compose window and displayed in the timeline, Twitter’s design chief Dantley Davis says extra-wide or tall images will be center cropped for those included in the test. Twitter has not shared a concrete timeline for when this change may be pushed live for all users. &lt;/p&gt;
