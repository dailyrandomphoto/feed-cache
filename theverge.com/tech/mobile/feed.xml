    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7WOe68"&gt;Intel made a splash earlier in May with the launch of its first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;11th Gen Tiger Lake H-series&lt;/a&gt; processors for more powerful laptops, but at Computex 2021, the company is also announcing a pair of new U-series chips — one of which marks the first 5.0GHz clock speed for the company’s U-series lineup of lower voltage chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0df8VH"&gt;Specifically, Intel is announcing the Core i7-1195G7 — its new top of the line chip in the U-series range — and the Core i5-1155G7, which takes the crown of Intel’s most powerful Core i5-level chip, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WnkU6O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel announces its new 11th Gen Tiger Lake CPUs, available on laptops this fall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5pSqBq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"&gt;Like the original 11th Gen U-series chips&lt;/a&gt;, the new chips operate in the 12W to 28W range. Both new chips are four core / eight thread configurations, and feature Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics (the Core i7-1195G7 comes with 96 EUs, while the Core i5-1155G7 has 80 EUs.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmgxVm"&gt;The Core i7-1195G7 features a base clock speed of 2.9GHz, but cranks up to a 5.0GHz maximum single core speed using Intel’s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology. The Core i5-1155G7, on the other hand, has a base clock speed of 2.5GHz and a boosted speed of 4.5GHz. Getting to 5GHz out of the box is a fairly recent development for laptop CPUs, period: Intel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512501/intel-9th-gen-laptop-desktop-processors-5ghz-update-specs-speed-features"&gt;first laptop processor to cross the 5GHz mark&lt;/a&gt; arrived in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykakbu"&gt;Along with the new processors, Intel has also announced its latest 5G modem solution for laptops — a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18250061/intel-qualcomm-m-2-5g-modules-computer-pc-laptop"&gt;M.2 card&lt;/a&gt; that device makers will be able to incorporate into their designs, called the Intel 5G Solution 5000. (While Intel famously sold off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition"&gt;smartphone 5G division to Apple&lt;/a&gt;, Intel has continued its efforts in other areas of the next-generation connectivity standard.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2NmZP"&gt;The new modem is a collaboration between Intel, Mediatek (which is handling the modem firmware) and Fibocom (which is actually manufacturing the modules), and will offer sub-6GHz 5G support and integrated eSIM technology. Intel says that Acer, Asus, and HP will all be offering laptops combing Intel’s Tiger Lake chips and new 5G Solution 5000 cards later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE Axon 30 Ultra review: the right stuff for the right price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Specs for less&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="P1dvF9"&gt;The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra is a high-end device that checks all the right hardware boxes. Snapdragon 888 processor? Check. Fast refresh rate screen? Check. A metric ton of rear-facing cameras? Check, check, check, and check. It’s also priced well, starting at $749 while many of its competitors start around the $1,000 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxpM46"&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra delivers on many fronts, like its high-quality screen and flagship-level performance. For some, that will be enough. However, it falls short in more subtle ways that you won’t see on a spec sheet. Its novel camera array is let down by uneven, heavy-handed processing. There’s also a stray bug here and there, which can range from harmless (a 5G on / off toggle appears twice in a quick settings menu) to more annoying (the camera shutter noise going off even in silent mode). ZTE may iron out these bugs in future updates, or they won’t, and you’ll be the obnoxious parent with the noisy smartphone camera during your child’s dance recital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wJJMY4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Axon 30 Ultra offers top-notch performance with a large, lovely screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D0XZjf"&gt;And even though all of the key hardware is there, a few flagship-y features have been omitted to hit the Axon 30 Ultra’s more aggressive price point. There’s no IP rating for water resistance and no wireless charging. The phone doesn’t work on Verizon either, just on T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T, and 5G service on T-Mobile is limited to one band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2drbo"&gt;If those factors aren’t dealbreakers and you’re comfortable working around the occasional quirk, then the Axon 30 Ultra offers top-notch performance with a large, lovely screen at a lower price than the competition. We don’t see too many of those high-performance / lower cost premium phones in the US to challenge the heavyweights of the Android world, and it’s nice to have an alternative. But it does lack some of the polish and a few features that distinguish the more expensive competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RISD3i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10523685"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9CB5vm7q1v7wttz73DMdCW-o9i8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541699/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 30 Ultra’s screen is curved on the edges for a more immersive feel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NBY3pw"&gt;ZTE Axon 30 Ultra screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="F2OVYN"&gt;At 6.7 inches, the Axon 30 Ultra’s screen is about as big as they come these days. It’s a 1080p OLED with a refresh rate up to 144Hz. You can set it manually to 60, 90, 120, or 144Hz, or let it switch automatically between those rates based on the content you’re viewing. That 144Hz rate is a little faster than the 120Hz rate you’ll find on most high-end devices, but I’m not sure I could tell the difference between them if I didn’t know which was which. The bottom line is that every swipe, scroll, and animation looks incredibly smooth on the 30 Ultra’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTCogS"&gt;Generally speaking, it’s just a really nice screen. Contrast is rich, the bezels are slim, and the panel curves over the sides of the phone; marketers love to call a screen like this “immersive,” but that actually feels like a fair descriptor. It’s a little tough to see outside in bright light, but it’s still usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMM5vd"&gt;That big screen makes the Axon 30 Ultra a big device. It’s comfortable enough to hold, and the curved screen and back panel help, but I definitely can’t reach my thumb clear across the screen while using it one-handed. There’s Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back panels and the frame is aluminum, giving the whole phone a solid, premium feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OBllqlbe-u4OEX7RujUiRbvUw1k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541698/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra offers Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l74KmZ"&gt;Phone performance also meets the “premium” bar, thanks to that Snapdragon 888 processor. It feels very snappy jumping between apps, pinching and zooming around Google Maps, and scrolling through Twitter. I’m also happy to report that the in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is quick and responsive, too — it gave me a little thrill with every unlock and password manager authentication. It’s a feature that goes the extra distance to making this feel like a highly responsive, premium device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52B1Z7"&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra’s 4,600mAh battery is big enough and consistently got me through a day of moderate use. However, I was conservative with some battery-draining settings like screen refresh rate, and all of my use was on Wi-Fi, so I expect you could fully drain the battery over the course of a day if you really went for it. Wireless charging is, as mentioned earlier, not an option here, but the phone supports 65W wired charging with the included charging brick, and it is plenty fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPTv60"&gt;Android 11 comes preloaded on the Axon 30 Ultra, and ZTE says an Android 12 update will come at the end of the year or in early 2022. The company doesn’t give a firm timeline for security updates but says it generally provides them for around three years. Not the worst support policy by far, but not among the very best. ZTE’s Android interface is called MyOS, and it’s a straightforward affair that doesn’t try to get too fancy. There are a truly overwhelming number of shortcuts in the fully expanded quick settings menu accessed by swiping from the top of the screen, but you can rearrange and whittle them down to your heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZMSnp4xWK8VPPsKzNKLSuU3NKws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541697/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameras galore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xNBIzj"&gt;ZTE Axon 30 Ultra cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qjDNQk"&gt;Rather than one high-resolution main camera complemented by several lower-resolution sensors, ZTE has chosen to put three 64-megapixel sensors in the Axon 30 Ultra’s rear camera array. You’ll find a standard wide-angle main camera with optical stabilization, a 35mm-equivalent wide-angle for portraits, and an ultrawide. There’s also an 8-megapixel 5x telephoto camera with optical stabilization. It’s a lot of cameras, and none of them are throwaways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYlN8t"&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra’s cameras are impressive, but they’re also a little frustrating. First, the good: these three 64-megapixel cameras all capture a lot of detail in good light, which I’d expect from the main camera, but that isn’t always the case with ultrawides since they tend to have lower resolution chips. The telephoto module offers 5x true optical zoom — results aren’t great indoors or in dim light, but with plenty of available light, it’s much better than the digital zoom alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owRAuH"&gt;I also really like the portrait lens, which is wider than the telephoto options most other smartphone cameras use. This is a personal preference; I like getting more of the scene in portrait photos, you may not. There’s no option to digitally zoom in while using portrait mode if you don’t like the wide-angle look, and portrait mode photos (with artificially blurred backgrounds) can only be taken with the dedicated portrait lens or the selfie camera. Something to consider if wide portraits are really not your thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LW4sU9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10523726"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e8ARRZ"&gt;Now the bad: image processing (particularly color and saturation) is inconsistent between cameras, and two photos from the same camera can vary noticeably with slight shifts in composition or subject positioning. Images from the main camera often look oversaturated. Most of the time it’s subtle enough not to bother me much, but then I’ll take a picture of my orange cat and he’ll look like a Cheeto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bm86wQ"&gt;Portrait mode photos suffer some misses, too: subject separation from blurred backgrounds can look a little clumsy, and the lack of OIS in the portrait camera means you’re more likely to see slight blur in dimmer conditions, even without much camera movement. The wider focal length also means you’ll need to crank up the blur if you want to obscure a distracting background, which makes the subject cut-out problems more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sDGqA5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;when the Axon 30 Ultra does get things right, images look really good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zqwvia"&gt;Maybe these shortcomings are more frustrating because when the Axon 30 Ultra does get things right, images look really good. Exposure is well balanced, all four cameras are genuinely useful, and each of them offers an impressive level of detail retention. I’d entertain leaving my dedicated camera at home more often with this combination of focal lengths and capabilities, but image processing is too much of a wild card for me to feel comfortable with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCWFDO"&gt;One of the Axon 30 Ultra’s most annoying bugs lives in the camera app, too: the camera shutter sound is permanently stuck on, even with every volume control set to silent. There’s no way to turn it off in the camera settings menu or the main settings menu. I hate this. Maybe some people could live with it. Maybe you can root your phone and eliminate the problem yourself. Maybe ZTE will fix the issue soon. All I know is that I cannot live a shutter-sound-on lifestyle and it’s the kind of thing I might return a phone over, no matter how good the pictures look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mH6bRMCt-aI9NDyBwx9TNIZnS1I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541700/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra is missing a few flagship-y features like wireless charging, but it doesn’t skimp on build quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KuqBgm"&gt;The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra is exactly what it appears to be: a lower cost alternative to the big Android flagships with top-tier performance and a great screen. I wouldn’t recommend it to just anyone, and you need to be comfortable either living with a couple of quirks or navigating a way around them. You don’t quite get the same level of polish or reassurance that you would from a Samsung, OnePlus, or Google device, but in return you get excellent performance for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9oJVY"&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra has a healthy price advantage over the other big-screen-big-performance competition like the $1,069 OnePlus 9 Pro and the $999 Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus. If you’re willing to concede some screen real estate, then its advantage narrows compared to the OnePlus 9 ($729) and standard Galaxy S21 ($800). With either of those options, you’ll get the same excellent performance and a few other benefits, like wireless charging and more sophisticated image processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WqvMNv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra has a healthy price advantage over the other big-screen-big-performance competition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QrI7E8"&gt;Of course, it’s an important caveat that the Axon 30 Ultra doesn’t work on Verizon. That will rule out a significant number of prospective customers in the US. And I wish the cameras lived up to their hardware potential more often. If that’s not much of a concern, you’re not a Verizon customer, and your priorities are set on a big screen and snappy day-to-day performance, then you have a great option in the 30 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="m4pRSn"&gt;All that said, I can’t see a reason not to buy the Axon 30 Ultra if none of the above concerns you. You’ll get excellent performance, a massive screen with a silky smooth fast refresh rate, and great camera hardware — and you can rub it in your friends’ faces when you pay several hundred dollars less for your phone than they did.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Come make bad decisions with us&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mWHafX"&gt;There are plenty of buying guides for figuring out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;best phone to buy&lt;/a&gt; at a given time, across a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;wide variety of prices&lt;/a&gt;. We have two of them, in fact. But if you’re a dyed-in-the-wool phone enthusiast, you don’t need a guide that’s going to give you the best rational recommendation. You need something that’s going to help you scratch your new gadget itch in the most satisfying way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwnkhO"&gt;I’m here for you because, well, I’m one of you. This is the internet’s premiere buying guide for phone enthusiasts. We’re not going to focus on practical, rational choices, nor are we going to concern ourselves with budgets. These are the dream phones, the ones you buy not as a utilitarian tool, but for the fun of playing with a new piece of tech that you’ll probably sell or trade in for a loss in six months. I’m not even going to single out a specific model that you should buy, because you’re likely buying a new phone every year (or maybe more!) anyway. This is all about throwing caution to the wind, diving deep into a hobby, and buying something you don’t need but absolutely want. Budgets be damned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEMlHI"&gt;Grab your cargo shorts, we’re going shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="HQWhbW"&gt;The best folding phone because you know you need one in your collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cyP7p8"&gt;Folding phones are the future, right? You can’t call yourself a Real Phone Enthusiast without one in your life. Hands down, the best folding phone you can buy right now is Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G. It’s got everything you might want from a modern smartphone, but it also opens up into a tablet-sized screen that lets you put more than one app side-by-side or look at a giant version of Google Maps. It’s easy to justify because you can tell yourself that you will get SO MUCH WORK done on it, right after you finish watching that YouTube video. Promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8bHVj"&gt;The Fold 2 costs more than most laptops, you have to baby it, and there’s a really good chance the screen will crack or break on you even if you are careful, but that’s just the price you have to pay to be on the bleeding edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jGK8Wn"&gt;The best iPhone for when you’re double-fisting an Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="odv92P"&gt;Look, I know that you know that everyone in the world has an iPhone and it’s the farthest thing from an “interesting” phone. But at the same time, it’s hard to ignore what Apple’s doing, and really, iMessage and the Apple Watch are pretty great. Lots of people carry an iPhone alongside an Android phone, and you could be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgHcF9"&gt;The best iPhone for doing this is the iPhone 12 Mini. It does everything its bigger siblings can do, but it can easily fit in a secondary pocket and isn’t a burden to carry around. The battery life is kinda lousy, but who cares, that’s why you have a second phone on you anyway, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QAq06D"&gt;The best phone for seeing what this “gaming phone” trend is all about&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DYsaub"&gt;Gaming phones are so hot right now (unless they’ve got a great cooling system) — it seems like a new model is released every three months. You can’t call yourself a true phone enthusiast without being up on this trend, and the best one to dip your toes into it with is the Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUdoj9"&gt;The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate has a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of features that can make any mobile accomplisher swoon. A massive battery. A ridiculously high refresh screen. An OLED screen on the back you can customize to show whatever you want. A bunch of accessories to make gaming better. 18GB of RAM! How could you not buy this phone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UxUeAC"&gt;The best phone for pretending you’re going to use a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="62OqLx"&gt;Writing on a phone screen with a pen is so cool! It &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; futuristic and is just so natural. At least, it is for the first week until you forget about it and it never leaves the little garage built into the side of the phone again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYMIss"&gt;If you’ve been telling yourself that little “I’m gonna be a stylus person” lie, you need a phone that supports one and it’s hard to see buying anything other than Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20. It’s got a low latency S Pen, a bunch of software features that can utilize the stylus, and all of the other bells and whistles of a modern smartphone, which means it works quite well long after you’ve forgotten about the stylus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hZjFO7"&gt;The best phone for messing around with the Android 12 beta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oBnkTF"&gt;Okay, I said I wasn’t going to recommend anything rational in this guide, but this is perhaps the recommendation that makes the most sense: if you want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442051/android-12-beta-download-google-io-2021"&gt;mess around with the Android 12 beta&lt;/a&gt; but don’t want to install it on your main phone, you should just buy a Google Pixel 4A. It’s only $350 (that’s just $20 more than it costs to fix a broken screen on an iPhone 12 Pro Max) and can work with Google’s latest and greatest software even before it’s released to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QeuvA"&gt;You know the Android betas are going to be messy — battery life is going to be bad, there will be lots of bugs, certain apps might not work correctly — so you don’t want to put it on a device you actually need to rely on. Once the beta period is over, the Pixel 4A is a great device for experimenting with the aftermarket ROM world. Get a Pixel 4A and flash those ROMs to your heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Microsoft Surface Duo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SrmHOI"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Microsoft Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eiZDop"&gt;The best phone for making people go “Whoa, is that a phone?”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zcDQoO"&gt;As a phone enthusiast, you already know this harsh truth: the Microsoft Surface Duo is not a good phone. It has an old processor. The camera is worse than any iPhone of the past five years. The battery life is decidedly Not Great. It gets hot doing simple tasks. There are SO MANY software bugs. It’s got a generation-old version of Android. It doesn’t even support wireless charging or NFC payments! Oh yeah, and there’s that questionable build quality to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J93WFK"&gt;But there’s something undeniably cool about the Surface Duo, like it’s a device from the future coming here to bless us in the early 21st century. It’s so thin, it has two screens, the hinge is incredibly neat. Open it up in public and you’re sure to get someone to ask “wow, is that a phone?” which we all know is the ultimate goal here. You can then show them all of its cool features, right after it’s done rebooting itself for the fifth time that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qGH04z"&gt;The best phone for telling yourself that you don’t need an actual camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rwPQXC"&gt;For years now we’ve been told that phone cameras are so good that you don’t need an actual camera. The iPhone 12 Pro Max might be the best example of that yet. It’s got a bigger sensor! It’s got three focal lengths! It can shoot video in Dolby Vision HDR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIhX55"&gt;At the end of the day, it’s still a phone camera and can’t really hold a candle to the image quality or creative control you get with a larger mirrorless camera. But hey, it’s fun to live in that lie and you can totally see the difference between the 12 Pro Max images and other phones. When you blow them up on a big screen. And zoom in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KwtDVn"&gt;The best phone for saying “you can’t get this in the US”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oAaPTd"&gt;Perhaps the ultimate phone flex is pulling a phone out of your pocket that nobody else is going to have. If you’re in the US, the Oppo Find X3 Pro is that phone. It’s got features you can’t get on any American phone and a design you won’t see everywhere, like a microscope camera and softly rounded camera bump. Sure, it won’t really work great on the cellular networks here, importing it is an expensive hassle, and you won’t have any warranty whatsoever. But just think of the envy on your friends’ faces when you tell them they can’t have this phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fsQZrc"&gt;The best phone for when you realize that Pixel phones aren’t great, but you don’t want a Samsung either&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7LwpXZ"&gt;Google’s Pixel phones have such great software and then… mediocre everything else. Samsung phones have incredible hardware but are laden with heavy software and actual ads inside of the stock apps. The OnePlus 9 Pro splits that difference — it has software that’s similar to Google’s on hardware that’s virtually a Samsung with a different logo on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMwn3Y"&gt;The 9 Pro is just what the phone enthusiast ordered: a high-end, bells-and-whistles device with All Of The Specs but none of the cruft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yVVHIu"&gt;The best weekend phone for when you’re “disconnecting”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4j7b9k"&gt;Here comes the weekend, with all of its promises of relaxation and enjoyment. You don’t need a phone that’s going to make you more productive, you need something that’s going to slip into your pocket and won’t distract you with a colorful display unless you absolutely need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhFwR6"&gt;The Z Flip 5G is this phone. You can flip it closed to ignore it and then pop it open and have a full smartphone inside, complete with every feature you get on non-flippy phones. You’re making a compromise without &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; making a compromise, because we all know that you had no intention of actually disconnecting for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Check if your Verizon or AT&amp;T phone will keep working after the networks’ 3G shutdowns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cell tower (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TDf8X3YimwrbxzTcsIyKJga5Z18=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69353302/cell-tower-stock_1020.1419980290.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;US wireless carriers plan to shutter their old 3G networks next year.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="93mvKT"&gt;Major US wireless carriers are gearing up to shut down their old 3G networks — a process that has been fraught with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215453/verizon-3g-shutdown-paused-delay-network-old-phones"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;miscommunication&lt;/a&gt; as companies alert customers with older phones that it’s time to upgrade. To that end, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have published guides to which devices will stop working after their 3G networks go offline next year. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qP1RJt"&gt;Verizon has delayed its CDMA 3G network shutdown several times but is now firmly committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358628/verizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022"&gt;shutting the network down by December 31st, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. All 3G basic phones and smartphones will lose service, but some 4G devices will be impacted as well — namely, those that don’t support VoLTE (Voice over LTE). A few connected devices are affected, too; take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/knowledge-base-218813/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s full guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7DbZk"&gt;Taking the opposite approach, AT&amp;amp;T has published a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/idpassets/images/support/wireless/Devices-Working-on-ATT-Network.pdf?source=ECAuAT10600aff12A&amp;amp;wtExtndSource=100122946&amp;amp;CI=CJ_AFFILIATE&amp;amp;RI=CJ1&amp;amp;RD=37922269&amp;amp;tfn=aff&amp;amp;cjevent=38f3c68bbf2911eb81ee1d8c0a1c0e0c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;complete list&lt;/a&gt; (spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/will-my-phone-work-on-att-after-3g-shutdown/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) of exactly which phones, tablets, and smartwatches &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; keep working after its 3G shutdown on February 22nd, 2022. (Separately, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/security/atandts-3g-shutdown-plans-are-harmful-even-deadly-warns-alarm-industry/d/d-id/769737"&gt;concern in the alarm industry&lt;/a&gt;: many home security devices use AT&amp;amp;T’s 3G and it’s possible that users won’t be able to replace them in time.) In any case, AT&amp;amp;T makes it easy to understand which mobile devices will keep functioning after the network shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnH2r5"&gt;T-Mobile’s 3G shutdown is a bit more complicated. It operates a UMTS 3G network, which the company will &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/02/t-mobile-shutting-down-3g-network-on-october-1st/"&gt;reportedly shut down in April 2022&lt;/a&gt;, and Sprint’s former CDMA 3G network, which the company says it will sunset on January 1st, 2022. T-Mobile hasn’t published a list of affected devices, but customers can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fresources%2Fbring-your-own-phone%23find-IMEI&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F27%2F22457255%2Fverizon-att-3g-shutdown-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check their device’s IMEI&lt;/a&gt; to see if it’s LTE and VoLTE compatible, which should indicate whether the device will keep working after the 3G networks are taken offline. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ Digital WellPaper visualizes your app usage as a funky live wallpaper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GpryvxeOLlUMS8rsTpF-lxjp4pg=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69349776/Comp_w_Frame.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apps are put into five categories, each represented by a color in the live wallpaper.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6uugzT"&gt;OnePlus’ new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fwellbeing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F27%2F22456248%2Foneplus-digital-wellpaper-app-usage-visualization-live-wallpaper" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Digital WellPaper app&lt;/a&gt; turns your app usage into one of three live wallpapers on Android. Apps are simplified into six categories — social, lifestyle and communication, entertainment, gaming, information and business, and tools — which translate to six colors within each wallpaper that become more or less prominent as you use the apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TndbK"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17870126/ios-12-screen-time-app-limits-downtime-features-how-to-use"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104987/google-digital-wellbeing-pixel-android-9-pie-exit-beta-features-now-available"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; already have the ability to track app usage at a system level, but generally you have to go into a dedicated menu to actually see the information. The advantage with Digital WellPaper is that it puts this usage information — albeit in an abstract form — front and center, so you’re aware of it every time you look at your home or lock screen. OnePlus says it hopes this will help Android users “visualize and better understand their day-to-day digital habits.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The live wallpapers are also available as lock screens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mvr1pO"&gt;Google has experimented with similar initiatives in the past. In 2019 it released a series of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928613/google-digital-wellbeing-experiments-unlock-clock-we-flip-morph-post-box-desert-island"&gt;experimental Digital Wellbeing apps in the Play Store&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitalwellbeingexperiments.unlockclock"&gt;Unlock Clock&lt;/a&gt;, a live wallpaper that shows a tally of how many times you’ve unlocked your phone that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4BT52"&gt;OnePlus says the new app, which was “curated” by its internal experimental software team OneLab, should work without consuming too much of your phone’s battery. It’s just generating a new image once when you unlock your phone, rather than constantly updating in the background. More details on individual app usage can be found within the Digital WellPaper app.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gAePKc"&gt;Digital WellPaper is now available from the Google Play Store, and works on devices running Android 7.0 and above.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boost Mobile is offering customers an Android 11 phone for $35</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7a1_2zLWm3xpWkXsv4WjEKXFW2s=/0x1:2353x1570/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346801/WikoRide3_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wiko Ride 3 offers a 6.09-inch display and Android 11 out of the box.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wiko Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5umbsn"&gt;With T-Mobile’s older CDMA network shutdown looming and no sign of a delay in sight, Boost Mobile customers looking for a new 4G phone just got a very affordable new option: the Wiko Ride 3. It’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boostmobile.com%2Fphones%2Fwiko-ride-3.html%3Fid16%3Dwiki&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F26%2F22454954%2Fwiko-ride-3-boost-mobile-price-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently marked down to $34.99&lt;/a&gt; from a full retail price of $99.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OATL1x"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/boost-mobile-wiko-ride-3-affordable-android-11-phone-specs-features-price_id132374"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, that promotional pricing somewhat unusually applies to existing customers rather than new ones. It’s unusual but not unexpected: the CDMA network shutdown could leave many Boost customers in need of a new phone. These customers might also start shopping around for a new carrier, so Boost has some extra incentive to offer current customers a good deal. Meanwhile, anyone switching from another carrier can get the Wiko Ride 3 for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CP3Th"&gt;It’s not unheard of to find a phone at this price, especially through MVNOs, but they’re often refurbished devices or run a previous Android OS generation. The Ride 3 stands out by offering Android 11 right out of the box — the current generation, at least for a little while longer, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; arrives this fall. Other specs include a 6.09-inch 720p screen, 13-megapixel main camera, and a 3,400mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j9E1FV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Ride 3 stands out by offering Android 11 right out of the box&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XR6uB1"&gt;Boost Mobile was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquired by Dish Network&lt;/a&gt; as part of last year’s T-Mobile / Sprint merger deal, and it operates on T-Mobile’s networks — including an older 3G CDMA network that Dish says many Boost customers still rely on. T-Mobile plans to shut down this network at the beginning of 2022; Dish contends the shutdown is earlier than expected, calling it an anti-competitive move that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;could leave many of its customers without service&lt;/a&gt; and accusing T-Mobile of trying to poach those customers in the process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVJ582"&gt;Dish has called on federal and state governments to intervene and delay the shutdown, but in the meantime, it appears to be stocking up on low-cost options for customers who may soon need a new 4G device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZAQhH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The affordable Nokia G10 is coming to the US with a great support policy </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-oi9I7P-KVhAD_xvug49ZfCuhVc=/0x0:3242x2161/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340974/nokia_G10_DTC_DESIGN_desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia G10 offers big battery life and two years of Android OS platform updates.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BvUpmj"&gt;HMD’s Nokia G10 is coming to the US with a big battery, a low $149 price, and a surprisingly good security support schedule. &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/nokia-g10-price-release-date-availability-us_id132341"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the G10 — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Android-Unlocked-Smartphone-6-52-Inch/dp/B093QPTSK7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; now at Amazon — will go on sale directly through Nokia’s website later this week. The G10 was first announced in Europe last month alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22371937/hmd-nokia-x20-x10-g20-g10-c20-c10-android-phones-release-date-news-features"&gt;five other midrange devices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjuST1"&gt;Low-cost Android phones aren’t typically known for great software support. It’s common for manufacturers to offer only two years of security updates on an infrequent schedule and typically just one (or no) OS platform updates. HMD is breaking with that norm by offering two years of OS platform updates — Android 12 and 13 in this case — and three years of security updates, a policy that should see the G10 through a few years of use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G10 is offered in the “dusk” color pictured here as well as a dark blue “night” flavor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jElELM"&gt;The Nokia G10’s other specs include a 6.5-inch 720p display, huge 5,050mAh battery, MediaTek G25 chipset with 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 13-megapixel rear camera accompanied by 2-megapixel macro and depth sensors. It’s expected to go on sale Thursday, May 27th at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_int%2Fnokia-g-10&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453332%2Fhmd-nokia-g10-price-availability-security-updates" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now buy Asus’ gaming-ready ROG Phone 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k21J-gQWk1woZxBGM5nLi9PVksc=/0x0:1875x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340185/Screen_Shot_2021_05_25_at_9.54.34_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3x5FZD"&gt;Asus’ ROG Phone 5 is now available in the US &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM210000001/ROG5-ASUS-ROG-Phone-5---6.78%E2%80%9D-FHD%2B-2448x1080-HDR-144Hz-Display---6000mAh-Dual-Cell-Battery---64MP%2F13MP%2F5MP-Triple-Camera-with-24MP-Front-Camera-%E2%80%9316GB-RAM---256GB-Storage-5G-LTE-Unlocked-Dual-SIM-Cell-Phone"&gt;from its official store&lt;/a&gt;, with a price tag of $999.99. It’s Asus’ latest maxed-out gaming phone, with all of the top-notch specifications: a Snapdragon 888 Plus, 144Hz display, front-facing speakers, and a massive 6,000mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpw3uf"&gt;Asus says the Ultimate and Pro versions of the phone will be available later this year. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;reviewed the Ultimate in March&lt;/a&gt; and found that it was a good phone that went a little — okay, maybe a lot — overboard with its specs. The vanilla version available for sale today, though, is perhaps a bit more reasonable: it “only” has 16GB of RAM (as opposed to the Ultimate’s 18GB), has half the storage (256GB instead of 512GB), and features an RGB logo on the back instead of an entire OLED screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpyEWY"&gt;The other thing the regular version is missing is the extra touch-sensitive buttons that provide an alternative to touchscreen controls (though it does still have two of the ultrasonic sensors). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csxmTC"&gt;For those who want more buttons, though, there’s always &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM250000006/ROG5-ASUS-ROG-Phone-5-and-Gamepad-Bundle"&gt;the gamepad bundle&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM220000003/ROG5-ASUS-ROG-AeroActive-Cooler-5"&gt;AeroActive Cooler 5 accessory&lt;/a&gt;, which has two buttons built in. They do cost extra — with the gamepad bundle coming in at $40 more than just the phone and the cooler costing $70 — but that’s still likely going to be way less than shelling out for the Ultimate version.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arm introduces its first Armv9 architecture CPUs and GPUs, previewing 2022’s Android flagships</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQtctN5cpbxAkLhtLsVhGMx5twU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338562/acastro_200804_1777_arm_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JV7M44"&gt;Arm has introduced its latest CPU and GPU designs, including its flagship Cortex-X2 and Cortex-A710 CPUs and Mali-G710 GPU. The new CPU and GPU designs aren’t just Arm’s latest chip blueprints, though; they’re also its first designs to utilize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357951/arm-armv9-architecture-security-artificial-intelligence-performance"&gt;its new Armv9 architecture&lt;/a&gt;, its first in a decade, which means big jumps in performance, along with new security and AI features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDVqss"&gt;Most consumers probably aren’t familiar with the exact Arm cores inside their phones or computers, but Arm’s designs — and particularly, &lt;a href="https://www.arm.com/why-arm/technologies/big-little"&gt;its big.LITTLE configuration&lt;/a&gt; of combining powerful high-performance cores and battery-saving high-efficiency cores — are common to virtually every Android phone. That means the designs introduced here are effectively a preview of what the best Android phones of 2022 will look like. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_-g5zLO6cvSlF-CBmAkGMeX0tGc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536988/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.33.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xxxyD1"&gt;Arm is introducing three new CPU designs this year. First, the Cortex-X2: it’s part of Arm’s Cortex-X custom program that lets partners help design specialized cores for their specific use cases. A successor to last year’s Cortex-X1, it’s also the most powerful design in the lineup, promising up to 16 percent improved performance compared to last year’s model. There’s also the Cortex-A710, the new “big” core, promising up to 30 percent better power efficiency and 10 percent better performance than last year’s Cortex-A78. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aABO4h"&gt;But Arm isn’t just upgrading the performance cores. For the first time in four years, it’s also introducing a new “LITTLE” high-efficiency core, the Cortex-A510, which replaces the Cortex-A55 design that’s been used for major phones since it was introduced in 2017. And it’s here that Arm’s promising the biggest jumps: up to 30 percent better performance, and 20 percent better power efficiency compared to the old model. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SLdqJ0xKZeRVkh1dwYpFy6XepIQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536990/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.33.28_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4FsJt4"&gt;The new Armv9 designs together should result in a big jump in performance once they make their way to chips, too. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt;, for example, uses partially customized versions of last year’s flagship Arm Cortex-X1 and Cortex-A78 as its four “big” cores and the roughly four-year-old Cortex-A55 design for its “LITTLE” cores. &lt;a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2021/01/arm-powerful-compute-and-graphics-platform-at-the-heart-of-the-new-samsung-exynos-2100#:~:text=The%20Cortex%2DX1%20is%20Arm's,relative%20to%20our%20standard%20CPUs."&gt;Samsung’s flagship Exynos 2100&lt;/a&gt; uses a similar configuration, too, along with Arm’s Mali-G78 GPU design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5YvR4"&gt;The new CPU core designs promise to blow both of those chips out of the water: Arm says that a CPU cluster made up of the Armv9 designs (a single Cortex-X2, three Cortex-A710 cores, and four Cortex-A510 cores) should offer up to 30 percent better peak performance (thanks to the Cortex-X2), 30 percent better overall efficiency (from the Cortex-A710), and 35 percent better “LITTLE” performance from the Cortex-A510 when compared to a comparable Armv8.2 cluster like the ones mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hNze8sR9HFrM864ia-uogQqaXdw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536991/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.33.45_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i2baXX"&gt;Arm is also introducing three new GPUs. There’s the flagship Mali-G710, which promises 20 percent better gaming performance and 20 percent better power efficiency; the Mali-G510, designed as a midrange option for more affordable devices; and the entry-level Mali-G310. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Iek8yO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A preview of the best Android phones of 2022 &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVaZIP"&gt;The overall goal is to provide a variety of designs for a wide range of use cases. A computer might rely more heavily on Arm’s Cortex-X2 CPUs and a discrete GPU solution for graphics; a leading smartphone, a CPU cluster of Arm’s range of CPU designs and Mali-G710 GPU; or a smartwatch with fewer demands that just uses a Cortex-A510 and Mali-G310. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00rexU"&gt;It’ll be some time before the new Arm designs show up in phones or devices: Arm still has to give the designs to its partners, who’ll then need to incorporate them into their own semiconductor products (typically announced toward the end of the year), and then those chips have to make their way to phone manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvVlS7"&gt;So it’ll likely be the beginning of 2022 before the new Arm CPU and GPU designs appear in any phones — and that’s assuming the global semiconductor shortage doesn’t push out next year’s products even further. But it’s still an exciting sneak peek at the potential of what might be coming next in the future of smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DFgGfT"&gt;Netflix has dipped a toe in gaming on occasion, with perhaps the hugely-successful “choose your own adventure”-style film &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as the most prominent example. But the streaming giant may be expanding further into gaming with a new bundle for Netflix subscribers, according to several reports over the past few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDsDM0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; had the &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/netflix-seeks-executive-to-expand-game-efforts"&gt;first report on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, writing that Netflix wants to hire an executive to oversee new gaming efforts, and that the company is considering a bundle of games similar to Apple Arcade. (Hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/netflix-looking-hire-executive-gaming-expansion-information-2021-05-21/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; corroborated&lt;/a&gt; that a gaming exec is a planned hire at Netflix.) The company has also chosen not to include ads in the games, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. But &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; also said that Netflix’s plans are still “very much in flux.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsUhBQ"&gt;In a report published Monday, however, &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; shared more details from &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/netflix-gaming-expansion-cde0f3ae-15de-4378-b2b8-fd0aaf0e91f6.html"&gt;its own reporting.&lt;/a&gt; An &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; source said to think of the upcoming service, which would be offered to Netflix subscribers, as “a smaller Apple Arcade” bundle that would include both licensed Netflix IP and games commissioned from indie studios. The service could be a ways out, though, “possibly launching in 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWEmB4"&gt;While Netflix hasn’t publicly confirmed the potential expansion of its gaming efforts, in a statement published by both &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22447410/netflix-executive-games-expansion-the-information-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company left the door open to the idea that it is indeed planning to do more with gaming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="029bIB"&gt;Our members value the variety and quality of our content. It’s why we’ve continually expanded our offering — from series to documentaries, film, local language originals and reality TV. Members also enjoy engaging more directly with stories they love — through interactive shows like &lt;em&gt;Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;You v. Wild,&lt;/em&gt; or games based on &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;La&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Casa de Papel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;To All the Boys&lt;/em&gt;. So we’re excited to do more with interactive entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HLKHeC"&gt;Netflix has &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of titles based on popular video games that are out now or in the works, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;one of Netflix’s biggest shows&lt;/a&gt;), so the company clearly sees the value of video games as IP. It’s not outlandish to think that the company would want to market its series through new games, or, in the ultimate ouroboros, make a new game that eventually becomes a new &lt;em&gt;Netflix&lt;/em&gt; show in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqC2vE"&gt;Netflix seemed to be on its way in 2019 — it had partnered with Telltale Games on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18510849/stranger-things-secret-games-telltale-studio-closed"&gt;a secret &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; game that died before it was announced&lt;/a&gt;, with a source telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “Netflix was just getting into the space and didn’t really have a games group in place yet.” Telltale’s &lt;em&gt;Minecraft: Story Mode&lt;/em&gt; did survive, though, and is still at least partially playable &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80227995"&gt;on Netflix now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3ApuPF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The tragic end of Telltale Games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17934166/telltale-games-studio-closed-layoffs-end-the-walking-dead"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hovQyS"&gt;Many companies are trying to build a service that’s “Netflix, but for games.” Apple Arcade and Xbox Game Pass are just two that come to mind. But these reports and Netflix’s curious non-denial suggest Netflix might like to eat its own lunch this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
