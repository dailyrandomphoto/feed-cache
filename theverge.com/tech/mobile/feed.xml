    <title>FAA estimates 78 percent of US planes can land at airports with 5G C-band</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X5cObI"&gt;The FAA &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that an “estimated 78 percent of the U.S. commercial fleet” have been cleared to land at airports with 5G C-band, even under low-visibility conditions. The agency’s statement comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891634/faa-att-verizon-5g-c-band-rollout-battle-airlines-buffer-zones"&gt;a week of controversy&lt;/a&gt; surrounding the rollout of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891286/att-5g-rollout-select-metro-areas-faa-delay"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available"&gt;Verizon’s&lt;/a&gt; upgraded cellular tech, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;saw US airlines warning of “catastrophic disruption”&lt;/a&gt; to travel and shipping and some international airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;announcing they’d halt flights to some US airports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wN2QVN"&gt;At issue are concerns that some radio altimeters won’t properly ignore signals from the new 5G transmitters. While there are precautions that should keep this from happening, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;creating buffer zones around airports&lt;/a&gt;, an incorrect altimeter reading could cause real problems during a low-visibility landing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0vNnj"&gt;Given the high stakes, the FAA has said that only planes with altimeters that it has tested and cleared will be allowed to land in sub-optimal conditions at airports where the new 5G tech has rolled out. You can read our explainer of the situation, which goes into detail about the last-minute confusion, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="btYEdc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FAA has quickly added altimeters throughout the week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IslnZH"&gt;On January 16th, the agency announced that it had cleared two altimeters, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891725/faa-radar-new-altimeter-clearance-5g-c-band-rollout-airlines-boeing-777"&gt;bumped up to five on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. It said the cleared altimeters were installed in “some” versions of planes like the Boeing 737, 747, and 777. The FAA changed that language on Thursday, saying that the 13 cleared altimeters should cover “all” Boeing 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, 787, MD-10/-11, and Airbus A300, A310, A319, A320, A330, A340, A350, and A380 models. It also notes that “some” Embraer 170 and 190 regional jets are covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRv7Sn"&gt;The FAA is still predicting that some altimeters won’t pass the test and will be “too susceptible to 5G interference.” Planes equipped with those models won’t be allowed to land at airports with the new 5G tech in low-visibility conditions — which could prevent airlines from scheduling any flights using those planes to airports of concern, given the unpredictability of weather and the disruption such a diversion would cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72mUwf"&gt;The carriers have been frustrated with the FAA and airlines for their handling of the situation. Their rollouts have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;been delayed multiple times&lt;/a&gt;, and on Tuesday, AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;put out a statement&lt;/a&gt; lambasting the FAA’s “inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services.” Verizon followed with a similar statement that also mentioned other countries’ rollouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbTyQR"&gt;You can read the FAA’s full statement &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;on its 5G page&lt;/a&gt;, under the “FAA Statements on 5G” heading. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boost Celero 5G review: budget phone with budget battery life</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Boost’s first 5G phone is cheap but unremarkable&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ukL1pq"&gt;Boost Mobile, the MVNO owned by the Dish Network as a result of the Sprint / T-Mobile merger, is in a tricky spot. Not only does it need to expand its user base for nationwide 5G service, but it also needs to migrate over a million Boost customers from Sprint’s CDMA 3G network to its 4G / 5G service (operated by T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T) soon since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/23/22741762/tmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost"&gt;T-Mobile will be shutting down Sprint’s CDMA network by March 31, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. This means the carrier will need to convince its many customers to upgrade to newer 4G or, more preferably, 5G phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJv8Us"&gt;That’s where Dish’s first self-branded phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22697318/dish-5g-game-279-boost-mobile-exclusive-5g-phone-prepaid"&gt;$279.99 Celero 5G&lt;/a&gt; (though often discounted to less), comes into play. This Android phone with iPhone-like looks works better than you’d expect and takes decent photos in good lighting conditions. Unfortunately, it has the exact same price as the popular and well-reviewed Samsung Galaxy A32 5G that’s also available at Boost, making the Celero a direct competitor. So how does the Celero 5G stack up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wloz9j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10954511"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Celero 5G’s silver back cover" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDWJHBxlyr5CXKDjc9NhGN0OSh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098805/gsin_190404_4933_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Celero 5G’s plastic body actually makes the phone more lightweight and comfortable to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Q51CwH"&gt;Celero 5G Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MjNajL"&gt;Like T-Mobile’s REVVL V Plus 5G and AT&amp;amp;T’s Radiant, the Celero 5G is made by Wingtech Technology and custom-designed for Boost (when you plug the phone into a computer, the phone is named “WT Celero 5G”). At first glance, it looks like an iPhone clone: it has an all-round silver trim, square camera array, and the unmistakable rims around the camera lenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tp0or"&gt;While its matte silver back cover is surprisingly smudge-resistant, its smooth surface makes the phone way too easy to slide off tables and hands — you’ll want to get a case to protect it. For a big phone (it measures 6.56 x 3 x 0.33-inch (166.60 x 76.20 x 8.40mm)), the Celero’s all-plastic body and beveled edges make it comfortable to hold, and it’s not too heavy either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Closeup of the Celero 5G’s power button" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZyCvq8Ct59l-U9QZM33Du8cr8ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098806/gsin_190404_4933_0003_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The placement of the Celero 5G’s power and fingerprint sensor is too low and recessed for easy access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A closeup of the bottom of the Celero 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2XTbUN1GuPYJSnR21TiXjH36KR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098807/gsin_190404_4933_0004_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Celero 5G’s 3.5mm audio jack is located at the bottom of the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KYi1dO"&gt;The power button and integrated fingerprint sensor on the Celero are too low and too recessed to use easily, however. As a result, it takes an extra second to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor — because I’m usually fumbling for the power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oqrFrR"&gt;Celero 5G Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4zJeD8"&gt;The Celero 5G’s screen is big but dim: you need to set the screen brightness to around 100 percent to use it comfortably indoors (you’ll be squinting at this screen outdoors). It has a large 6.5-inch LCD display that is only 720p in resolution, which means high-resolution photos and videos won’t look the sharpest here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGKj1j"&gt;For a sub-$300 phone using the &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dimensity-700-vs-Dimensity-720_13199_12994.247596.0.html"&gt;“fast mid-range SoC” MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor&lt;/a&gt; and 4GB RAM for support, the Celero 5G can handle basic tasks without any significant lag. I was able to cycle between my many opened tabs and apps quickly and could even play a YouTube video while I read an article. Like the Samsung A32, the Celero comes with just 64GB of internal storage, but the Celero has a microSD card slot that can support up to a 2TB card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="g2qLIG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Celero 5G’s display is dim and low-resolution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0QbKaI"&gt;I played a round of &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite,&lt;/em&gt; and the Celero 5G handled the game like a champ. The responsive touchscreen made it easy to move my Charmander around the battlefield, even as the attack moves became more complicated. When I plugged in my wired headphones into its bottom-facing audio jack, I could hear a vocal track on the game’s theme music that I’d previously missed. Its bottom-firing mono-speaker is passable: it managed to play the demanding “Dance at the Gym: Mambo” from the 2021 &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack with clarity, if not a bit too loudly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cY4NzL"&gt;Although I appreciate that this phone is running a mostly unmodified version of Android 11, the Celero is unfortunately full of bloatware. In addition to the usual suspects like a folder worth of Amazon apps, there are two folders called “Lifestyle” and “Games’’ that contain a bunch of app shortcuts that the phone will download if you click on the “Add” button. There is even an App Spotlight app that shows you 24 app shortcuts the carrier is encouraging you to download (including &lt;em&gt;The Epoch Times&lt;/em&gt;). To make matters worse, every time you wake or turn on your phone, you will see three apps doing some sort of configuration in the background, but it’s not clear how to disable those processes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWoJmE"&gt;As Dish’s first self-branded phone, it’s hard to know if and when the Celero will receive any OS or security updates to extend its lifespan. This is a far cry from more established brands like Samsung, which have a four-year software commitment on the A32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3xpRV"&gt;The battery life on the Celero 5G is not as long as its 4,000mAh battery would imply. Although I managed to get about 8 hours and 15 minutes of screen time before I had to recharge it, that was with very moderate use. I was only on Wi-Fi to listen to a couple of podcasts, post on Twitter, check email, and chat with family on Google Hangouts. If you use mostly 4G or 5G on this phone, you’ll probably need to keep the charger or a portable battery close by because the Celero might not last a full day of heavy use. The included 15W charger is not exactly a fast charger either: it took over two hours to fully recharge the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A4UaIl"&gt;Celero 5G Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Closeup of the Celero 5G’s rear cameras" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nSiJcKjP46v0jttLhpuJYDH5__o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098808/gsin_190404_4933_0005_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Celero 5G’s cameras are pretty basic and not suitable for night or sports photography.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h3Zgcp"&gt;The Celero 5G’s cameras are the standard fare for its class: it has a 16-megapixel rear camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth sensor, and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies. With good lighting and the right framing, you should be able to get some good photos with good details to share online. However, I wouldn’t use this phone to take action or night photography because these cameras just aren’t capable enough for more challenging situations. The front camera, on the other hand, can capture relatively bright selfies even in dim lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zn42Wa"&gt;Like other budget phones, the Celero’s ultrawide photos tend to skew yellow, especially when you compare a photo taken with the main camera of the same scene. Whether I take outdoor holiday decoration photos or indoors inside a diner, the ultrawide camera has a knack for inexplicably boosting the yellow channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="77JkcT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10954550"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bITS9Q"&gt;Worst of all, the Celero’s camera app is annoying to use. It can take an extra second to switch between the main and the ultrawide cameras or different modes, which might be the difference between you getting or missing the shot. It also takes about two seconds to process a live focus shot, so you’ll need a steady hand and patience when using this mode. When I tried to take a photo that happened to have a QR code, the app kept asking me if I wanted to visit that website, even after I repeatedly tapped “No.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EPlgm0"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Celero 5G’s silver back cover" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4M0ExMH_y5UcI_d8jbdBZvWTxeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098811/gsin_190404_4933_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Celero 5G has tough competition from budget 5G phones from Samsung, Motorola and OnePlus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cdKDPA"&gt;As much as I enjoyed the $279.99 Celero 5G for its iPhone-like looks and capable performance, I have a hard time recommending it over the same-priced Samsung Galaxy A32 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzivR5"&gt;For the same money, the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G offers a bigger battery at 5,000mAh, a better 48-megapixel main camera, C-band 5G compatibility, and four years of software support from Samsung. With the Celero, it’s hard to know if it’ll get software support like security updates, from whom and for how long, not to mention its smaller battery and less powerful cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYk2yt"&gt;Boost also offers the $249.99 Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G, which is $30 cheaper than the Celero, comes with double the internal storage at 128GB, and also features a 48-megapixel camera. The best-in-class OnePlus Nord N200 5G is even cheaper at $239, and it includes a 1080p display with a 90Hz refresh rate, though it’s not clear if this unlocked phone will be compatible on Boost’s network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cq9KHM"&gt;I wish Boost would give the Celero 5G a permanent price cut, like its current promotional price of $139.99 or lower. This would make it a whole lot easier to recommend the Celero despite its shortcomings — shorter battery life, more bloatware, untested brand. But without that significant discount, the Celero 5G is not your best bet at Boost.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The battle between the FAA, AT&amp;T, Verizon, and airlines over 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-Xzg8u4OPAGaRV_gkHXYUO1OyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70409844/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;C-band’s rollout has endured months of controversy&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="u8qDaU"&gt;When AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon spent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;tens of billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; for the rights to use the C-band spectrum for their 5G service, the carriers saw it as a way to expand their networks and make them faster. Those plans, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;sparked a feud&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which warned that the cell signals could interfere with the altimeters that pilots use to land in conditions with low visibility. (&lt;em&gt;Could&lt;/em&gt; is a keyword — if everything is working correctly, there shouldn’t be problems, but with jets that can hold hundreds of people, it’s understandable why the FAA and airlines would want a lot of wiggle room.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSD8JL"&gt;Before the carriers activated their C-band equipment, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;FAA created rules around&lt;/a&gt; how airplanes could land in low-visibility conditions. The carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;agreed to delay their rollouts in November 2021&lt;/a&gt;, pushing the date to January 5th, and also said they’d &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22801008/verizon-att-midband-5g-c-band-lower-power-six-months"&gt;run their equipment at lower power around airports for six months&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873765/faa-verizon-att-airport-5g-carriers-buffer-zone"&gt;creating buffer zones&lt;/a&gt; and allowing the regulator more time to analyze the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFrZ9z"&gt;Then, the FAA requested another delay. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863964/faa-fcc-verizon-att-c-band-5g-airports-proposal-rejected"&gt;The carriers initially rejected it&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;cutting a deal&lt;/a&gt; to push the date back to January 15th. As that deadline neared, there was a flurry of activity. A coalition of airlines and shipping companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;claimed that the rollout could cause “catastrophic disruption”&lt;/a&gt; if it went through, and the carriers announced that they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;put further limits on their rollout around airports&lt;/a&gt; but lambasted the FAA in their statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SH2ca3"&gt;The same day, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;several international airlines announced&lt;/a&gt; that they were canceling flights to certain airports in the US. (The president of Emirates &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/business/emirates-5g-quest/index.html"&gt;had some scathing remarks&lt;/a&gt; about how the situation was handled, calling the rollout “one of the most delinquent, utterly irresponsible issues [...] I’ve seen in my aviation career” and saying that the airline didn’t have vital information until a few days before the rollout.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9p4oBF"&gt;On the 19th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891286/att-5g-rollout-select-metro-areas-faa-delay"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; activated their cell networks, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891725/faa-radar-new-altimeter-clearance-5g-c-band-rollout-airlines-boeing-777"&gt;FAA cleared additional altimeters&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it should allow “an estimated 62 percent of the U.S. commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports where wireless companies deployed 5G C-band.” The story is continuing to evolve as airlines announce delays or that they’ll be continuing service. You can follow the story as it continues to unfold here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FAA says some 777s are cleared to fly to airports with 5G C-band</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dD3Tcr"&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-5g"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that more planes will be able to land in low-visibility conditions despite the rollout of 5G C-band, including some models of the Boeing 777 aircraft that’s used by many international airlines. According to a statement from the regulatory agency, it’s cleared three more models of radar altimeters as safe and reliable, even in areas where the upgraded cellular technology has been rolled out. This change comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;several international airlines announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that they were suspending flights to some US airports due to the 5G C-band rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaDJzM"&gt;According to the FAA’s statement, which you can read in full below, it cleared three additional altimeters on Wednesday morning, after clearing two on January 16th. The FAA has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;been in a back-and-forth with AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that the companies’ cell towers could interfere with equipment needed to safely land planes in low-visibility conditions. Earlier this month the carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;delayed their rollouts&lt;/a&gt; to give the FAA more time to test and clear altimeters, and have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;said they’ll limit C-band expansion around certain airports&lt;/a&gt; that frequently have low visibility conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="imFEfj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new approvals clear an estimated 62 percent of US commercial airplanes for low-visibility landings at airports with C-band&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vNvq3y"&gt;With the additional safety buffer that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon announced on Tuesday, this should clear some models of Boeing 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, MD-10/-11 and Airbus A300, A310, A319, A320, A330, A340, A350, and A380. The FAA says that these new approvals should “allow an estimated 62 percent of the U.S. commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports where wireless companies deployed 5G C-band.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmJlHK"&gt;While 62 percent of airplanes seems low, it’s higher than the FAA’s previous estimates; when the agency announced its new list of approvals on January 16th, it said they covered around “45 percent of the U.S. commercial fleet.” The administration has also said that, despite Wednesday’s clearances, “flights at some airports may still be affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KCQjG"&gt;There were hints that this change would be coming — earlier on Wednesday, ANA and Japan Airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;announced that they would be resuming normal operations&lt;/a&gt; thanks to an FAA notification that cleared the 777 (the FAA’s announcement wasn’t public at the time). In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, US-based Southwest Airlines said that it “expects minimal disruptions today after the telecomm companies announced their delay in 5G expansion near U.S. airports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPLOSE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The FAA’s full statement: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uC5tjQ"&gt;The FAA issued new approvals Wednesday that allow an estimated 62 percent of the U.S. commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports where wireless companies deployed 5G C-band. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvmJDo"&gt;The new safety buffer announced Tuesday around airports in the 5G deployment further expanded the number of airports available to planes with previously cleared altimeters to perform low-visibility landings. The FAA early Wednesday cleared another three altimeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CfYzH"&gt;Even with these approvals, flights at some airports may still be affected. The FAA also continues to work with manufacturers to understand how radar altimeter data is used in other flight control systems. Passengers should check with their airlines for latest flight schedules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boHBij"&gt;Airplane models with one of the five cleared altimeters include some Boeing 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, MD-10/-11 and Airbus A300, A310, A319, A320, A330, A340, A350 and A380 models.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="gzsikH"&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emirates.com%2Fus%2Fenglish%2Fhelp%2Ftravel-updates%2F%234842&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22890080%2F5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Emirates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/airindiain/status/1483509249376329731"&gt;Air India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ana.co.jp%2Ffs%2Fint%2Fen%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22890080%2F5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ANA&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jal.co.jp%2Fjp%2Fen%2Finfo%2F2022%2Finter%2F20220118%2F%3Fm%3Dimportant_notice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22890080%2F5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Japan Airlines&lt;/a&gt; all announced that they were canceling some flights to the US due to this week’s rollout of C-band 5G over concerns it could potentially interfere with some instruments, particularly on Boeing 777 aircraft. This comes as cell carriers, federal agencies, airlines, and airplane manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;struggle to reach an agreement&lt;/a&gt; on policies regarding how the rollout should be handled. The situation has continued to evolve as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891286/att-5g-rollout-select-metro-areas-faa-delay"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; switch on their c-band, but it’s only gotten messier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFj9dm"&gt;ANA cites specific guidance from Boeing, saying that “Boeing has announced flight restrictions on all airlines operating the Boeing 777 aircraft.” Japan Airlines also cites a notification from Boeing, saying that it was told that “5G signals for U.S. mobile phones, which will begin operating in the U.S. on January 19, 2022, may interfere with the radio wave altimeter installed on the Boeing 777.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGaPah"&gt;However, Japan Airlines changed its guidance on Wednesday, saying it “received confirmation from the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) that there is no longer a problem with the operation of the Boeing 777 and we will resume service to the U.S. mainland with Boeing 777 from January 20.” ANA has updated its advisory with similar language, saying that it’s returning to “the normal schedule based on FAA notification that there is no safety issue with the operation of Boeing 777 aircraft to the U.S. airports that we serve.” However, Emirates and Air India haven’t changed their guidance, and the FAA hasn’t publicly released an updated statement. The 777 isn’t currently on the regulator’s list of cleared aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vRHiFa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Emirates says it’s “working closely with aircraft manufacturers and the relevant authorities”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MlWmTF"&gt;Emirates’ announcement clearly outlines what’s being canceled. The airline, described as the world’s largest operator of the Boeing 777 &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airlines-scramble-rejig-schedules-amid-us-5g-rollout-concerns-2022-01-18/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says that it’s “suspending flights to the following US destinations from 19 January 2022 until further notice,” listing Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Miami, Newark, Orlando, San Francisco, and Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="837OGu"&gt;The airline will continue to fly to New York JFK, Los Angeles (LAX), and Washington, DC (IAD). Emirates says it’s “working closely with aircraft manufacturers and the relevant authorities to alleviate operational concerns” and that it hopes to start flying to the US again as soon as it’s able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbuBmU"&gt;More airlines were affected as Tuesday progressed. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airlines-scramble-rejig-schedules-amid-us-5g-rollout-concerns-2022-01-18/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Taiwan’s China Airlines will reschedule some flights, while South Korea’s Korean Air Lines switched away from Boeing’s 777 and 747-8 aircraft on six flights to the US, and Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific says it’s prepared to use different planes if necessary. Lufthansa had canceled at least one US flight and was switching from the Boeing 747-8 to the 747-400 aircraft on some US routes. Air India, Singapore Airlines, and Austrian Airlines were also switching out 777 aircraft for US flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSGmYn"&gt;Airline operators in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;warned earlier on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that the 5G rollout could cause “catastrophic disruption” to their flight schedules. &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;According to the FAA&lt;/a&gt;, the concern is that the C-band 5G signals could interfere with the radar altimeters used in some planes, creating a safety issue.

&lt;aside id="H1s6Mx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pBBjYr"&gt;Boeing didn’t respond immediately to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request to confirm that it had sent out an advisory. Its competitor, Airbus, said that it will be working “as part of a wider industry coalition” to “study the issue further and work toward solutions.” For information on aircraft limitations, it referred to &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-5g"&gt;the FAA’s statements on 5G page&lt;/a&gt;, where a statement from January 16th lists the airplane models that have been approved to land at some airports under low-visibility conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3837yY"&gt;On Tuesday morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon announced&lt;/a&gt; that they would voluntarily delay 5G antenna upgrades near certain airports. The chairwoman for the Federal Communications Commission issued a statement saying it’s “essential that the FAA now complete” the process of assessing altimeter performance and the effect C-band 5G communication can have on it with “both care and speed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cm6hVP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 19th 1:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Japan Airlines saying it’ll be allowed to fly 777s per the FAA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9vwZG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 19th, 5:27AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information on additional airlines that have been affected with emphasis on Boeing 777 aircraft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s faster C-band 5G is live and off to a promising start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/klCou6FBnhd32v1B4r5jzh36x3U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408396/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vXuyvi"&gt;Amid an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;ongoing tussle with the FAA&lt;/a&gt; and airline industry, Verizon today flipped the switch on its mid-band 5G deployment, which uses spectrum that the company spent tens of billions of dollars to acquire in the C-band auction. The new, faster level of 5G connectivity will significantly augment Verizon’s “5G Ultra Wideband” network, which, until now, has relied solely on extremely-fast-but-very-hard-to-find millimeter wave spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZWFbT"&gt;Mid-band 5G overcomes many of the hurdles that have made mmW the brunt of jokes from competitors like T-Mobile: it’s actually available indoors, and coverage doesn’t vary as unpredictably from one street to the next. Customers with compatible phones should experience noticeably faster data speeds compared to Verizon’s “5G Nationwide” network that offers widespread signal but with download and upload performance that in many cases isn’t much better than LTE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KqM4F"&gt;In short, 5G is about to feel a lot more real for Verizon customers than it ever has before. Mid-band is a crucial element of Verizon’s long-term 5G ambitions and bridges the gap between the slow 5G Nationwide and barely existent, ultra-fast millimeter wave 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SYFfnVodaBvNx-MyvG_yE1lnq38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179494/Screen_Shot_2022_01_19_at_10.56.22_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7rmd2/cband_live_in_claremont_iphone_12_pro_max_and/" target="_blank"&gt;r/Verizon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;In many cases, C-band speeds are a substantial upgrade from Verizon’s slower “5G Nationwide” and a true leap over 4G LTE.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MpCLCi"&gt;Even on day one, the improvements are promising. Customers were quick to take to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon"&gt;the Verizon subreddit&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday to post a slew of Ookla Speedtest screenshots, with download rates regularly topping 500Mbps and even 800Mbps in some cases. Many are seeing an average downlink between 200 and 400Mbps, far exceeding the performance of 5G Nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5dJeat"&gt;Which devices support Verizon’s new, faster C-band 5G?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiwHtD"&gt;At launch, the list of supported phones and tablets is fairly short. These are the devices that can already connect to Verizon’s C-band 5G:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nyTl9H"&gt;Apple iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tgp345"&gt;Apple iPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (3rd generation), or iPad mini (6th generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dUkQZr"&gt;Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro &lt;em&gt;(coming soon)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j7667Y"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, S21 Ultra, Z Fold 3, Z Flip 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lGwK67"&gt;Verizon has said that all phones it releases as of now will support C-band 5G, and the carrier expects to offer over 20 compatible phones by the end of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J0MtGT"&gt;Where can I get Verizon’s C-band 5G?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eUWKR5"&gt;Verizon has said it will provide a C-band coverage map at launch, but so far, no such map is available on the carrier’s website — perhaps a consequence of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;eleventh-hour concessions to the FAA&lt;/a&gt;. You can expect just about every major metro market to have some degree of C-band coverage in January: the company has promised to reach “more than 100 million people in 1,700-plus cities around the nation” with the faster flavor of 5G this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cv5XUO"&gt;But it’s a rolling process and won’t be instantly available everywhere. I’m located in downtown Brooklyn and am still riding on the slower 5G Nationwide network. On Wednesday afternoon, Verizon spokesperson Andrew Testa told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the initial rollout had been successfully completed, saying “today’s deployment is complete, but we’re continuing to expand so more and more people can experience 5G Ultra Wideband.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uMjii0"&gt;How do I know if I’m on Verizon’s C-band 5G?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3cv4p"&gt;Verizon’s C-band 5G shares the same “5G Ultra Wideband” indicator in your phone’s status bar as millimeter wave 5G. That makes things a little confusing, but if you’re suddenly (and consistently) seeing “5G UW” appear in places where you never had it previously, that’s the best evidence that your device is taking advantage of the faster 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Cb94xu"&gt;How fast is it really?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Cj8mhW"&gt;Based on many early tests, pretty fast — and on a different level altogether than 5G Nationwide. Upload speeds aren’t anything spectacular, but many Verizon customers on C-band are getting download rates that range &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7pjbf/lake_county_il_north_of_chicago_is_live/"&gt;anywhere from 200&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7p997/indiana_cband_result/"&gt;500Mbps&lt;/a&gt; and, in the very best cases, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7qe1h/cband_live_in_downtown_la/"&gt;over 800Mbps&lt;/a&gt;. And these are in regions where cellular data had previously often topped out around 60 or 80Mbps, so the upgrade is substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y1txFg"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2022-01-19T16:01:56.193427+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7os2i/cband_in_rochester_ny_is_live/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;C-Band in Rochester NY is live&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/"&gt;verizon&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UTc47i"&gt;Do I need to change my plan to get C-band 5G on Verizon?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HkNPVt"&gt;Not necessarily. According to Verizon, its Do More, Play More, and Get More Unlimited plans have access today, as well as the slightly tweaked and rebranded 5G Do More, 5G Play More, and 5G Get More plans that the carrier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867007/verizon-t-mobile-att-unlimited-plan-5g"&gt;announced in early January&lt;/a&gt;. Verizon’s previous Above and Beyond Unlimited plans also have 5G Ultra Wideband / C-band access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQO4A5"&gt;Verizon’s entry-level Start Unlimited plan does not include 5G Ultra Wideband whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0ztXEU"&gt;What about the whole airplane safety thing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YhstDY"&gt;Don’t expect to get C-band speeds at your local airport for some time. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have begrudgingly agreed to delay activating C-band 5G around many airports and are creating exclusion zones to address airplane-related safety concerns that continue to be raised by the FAA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G05uF5"&gt;Both carriers have strongly criticized the FAA for being unprepared for this moment. “The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and our nation’s airlines have not been able to fully resolve navigating 5G around airports, despite it being safe and fully operational in more than 40 other countries,” Verizon said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fESPh"&gt;If you’re a Verizon customer and are already using the faster mid-band 5G, feel free to share some of your impressions in the comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egfQPF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 19th, 1:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon has clarified to &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; that the Pixel 6 series is not yet fully certified for C-band access. Details around supported plans have also been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T begins 5G C-band rollout in limited number of metro areas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="5G Wireless Service To Launch In U.S. Despite Aviation Industry Concerns" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MM_JlKgcNCV4bS6JDyGdiFhbYIs=/53x0:2369x1544/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408374/1365480215.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VvG9W7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.att.com/innovationblog/2022/connectivity.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is lighting up its expanded 5G service&lt;/a&gt; in just eight metro areas in the US on Wednesday, including Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Chicago, Detroit, Jacksonville, Orlando, and South Florida (&lt;a href="https://about.att.com/ecms//dam/snrdocs/pdf/metro-areas-with-c-band.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). This comes after both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;voluntarily limited the activation of C-band spectrum around airports&lt;/a&gt; after facing mounting pressure from airlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRI818"&gt;“Today’s introduction begins in limited parts of 8 metro areas across the U.S. It will expand rapidly as our thoughtful and efficient deployment ramps up throughout the year,” Chris Sambar, AT&amp;amp;T’s executive vice president of technology operations, explains in the post announcing the expansion. “With 17 C-Band-capable devices already available online and in our stores, you can start seeing those speeds today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="89AWZE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meanwhile, Verizon plans on activating towers in 1,700 cities this month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ih1vQ0"&gt;Just one day before Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s scheduled 5G rollout on January 19th, major airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;warned against activating 5G towers for fear of “catastrophic disruption”&lt;/a&gt; to flights operating across the country. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;Air India, Emirates, Japan Airlines, and ANA&lt;/a&gt; canceled some of their flights in advance over concerns that the 5G expansion could &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;interfere with radar altimeters&lt;/a&gt; that aircraft use to make low-visibility landings. Ahead of the rollout, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reached an agreement with both carriers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873765/faa-verizon-att-airport-5g-carriers-buffer-zone"&gt;create 50 buffer zones where AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will shut off transmitters for six months near airports&lt;/a&gt; with high traffic volume and frequent low-visibility conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY1Hnk"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T expressed frustration at the FAA’s failure to “utilize the two years they’ve had to responsibly plan for this deployment,” as well as its “inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services.” AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon’s activation of the C-band spectrum has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;faced pushback by the FAA&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in two delays. And while AT&amp;amp;T is taking a more cautious approach to its rollout, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/get-most-out-of-verizon-5g-ultra-wideband-network" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon plans on activating its network in 1,700 cities&lt;/a&gt; — covering 100 million more people — this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s newest game is a Hearthstone-style card battler</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3soLivgoPmSLClev-hpOUF06kNQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407076/ARC_5.5_SCR8.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: Arcanium: Rise of Akhan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="34taD1"&gt;Netflix’s foray into the mobile gaming subscription market is showing no signs of slowing down. This week it added a pair of new titles to its service, a card-battling roguelike called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1483559835786518528"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcanium: Rise of Akhan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a hidden object game called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1483590028831993856"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krispee Street&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Both are available to download on iOS or Android free of charge if you’re already subscribed to the streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w50EFY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcanium &lt;/em&gt;follows an increasingly familiar template for Netflix’s mobile game releases, in that it’s a pre-existing title added to the subscription service. The game originally launched in &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1056840/Arcanium_Rise_of_Akhan/"&gt;early access on Steam back in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, where it currently boasts “Mostly Positive” user reviews. Its Steam listing describes it as an “open-world, single-player strategy card adventure” and fusion of the roguelike and deckbuilding genres. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fhLkN0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Dive into a fantasy world where good, evil, magic, and technology collide for the ultimate tale of fellowship and bravery. Arcanium, an open-world single-player strategy card game, is now on Netflix. &lt;a href="https://t.co/vWHgiIY8u4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vWHgiIY8u4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1483559835786518528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cNri42"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Krispee Street&lt;/em&gt; is a hidden object game that almost looks like a digital version of Where’s Waldo based on the webcomic &lt;a href="https://krispee.com/"&gt;Krispee&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-launches-two-new-mobile-games-arcanium-rise-of-akhan-and-krispee-street/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s On Netflix&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that it’s the fourth game from developer FrostyPop to release on Netflix since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772480/netflix-games-apple-iphone-ipad-ios-subscription-app-store"&gt;service’s official launch last November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CtcGty"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1kQyJg6DZ8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nyb7W8"&gt;With the release of the two titles, Netflix now has a dozen mobile games available to download and play free of charge as part of its subscription. It’s still probably not enough to warrant a subscription by itself, but they’re a neat addition, especially when all of them are free from annoying in-app transactions. If you’re already paying for a Netflix subscription, what have you got to lose?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T and Verizon are limiting C-band 5G expansion around airports even more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-AVIATION-TELECOMMUNICATION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T4iAQgSV6HjP97Cu82K0kGdmOqU=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70404653/1237809011.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4xeFnP"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have announced that they will push back plans to activate some 5G towers around airports after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;airline operators warned&lt;/a&gt; that the deployment could cause “catastrophic disruption” to travel and shipping. While both carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873765/faa-verizon-att-airport-5g-carriers-buffer-zone"&gt;have an agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; to create buffer zones around 50 airports, AT&amp;amp;T has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s halting the rollout of even more towers than originally planned, and that the decision applies to a “limited number of towers around certain airport runways.” Verizon responded to an email asking if it was planning on doing more than the agreement requires with &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-goes-ultra-wednesday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; that says it’s “voluntarily decided to limit our 5G network around airports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVXv6n"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is clearly unhappy with the situation. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; it said that it will “continue to work with the aviation industry and the FAA to provide further information about our 5G deployment, since they have not utilized the two years they’ve had to responsibly plan for this deployment.” The statement also said that the company is “frustrated by the FAA’s inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it do so in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8wKv8"&gt;Verizon expressed similar frustration, saying: “The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and our nation’s airlines have not been able to fully resolve navigating 5G around airports, despite it being safe and fully operational in more than 40 other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r2GsBH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Airlines claim that C-Band 5G could disrupt sensitive equipment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e6kKSH"&gt;Both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have clashed with airline operators, who claim that their new C-Band 5G towers could disrupt sensitive equipment, making it difficult to land in low-visibility conditions. We have a great explainer that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;breaks down the whole situation&lt;/a&gt;, but the TL;DR is that this is just the latest in a series of delays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kgCgnx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="V5HccX"&gt;In an attempt to finally get the rollout started, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873765/faa-verizon-att-airport-5g-carriers-buffer-zone"&gt;made an agreement with the FAA&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, which would allow them to activate their towers on January 19th, except for in select areas around 50 airports. On Monday, however, several airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;reportedly signed a letter sent to government officials&lt;/a&gt;, again warning about the rollout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7V5CS"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, United Airlines said on Monday that the 5G expansion would “result in not only hundreds of thousands of flight cancellations and disruptions for customers across the industry in 2022, but also the suspension of cargo flights into these locations, causing a negative ripple-effect on an already fragile supply chain.” The airline also said that it “implore[s] the Biden administration to act quickly and apply the same common sense solutions here that have clearly worked so well around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NM6nDi"&gt;For his part, President Biden thanked the carriers “for agreeing to delay 5G deployment around key airports and to continue working with the Department of Transportation on safe 5G deployment at this limited set of locations” in &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/18/statement-by-president-biden-on-5g-agreement/"&gt;a statement on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. He said that his team “has been engaging non-stop with the wireless carriers, airlines, and aviation equipment manufacturers to chart a path forward for 5G deployment and aviation to safely co-exist,” and that work would continue until they found “a permanent, workable solution around these key airports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLhcJG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 18th, 2:53PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add statement from President Biden.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ux39cX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 18th, 2:22PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that Verizon has also stated that it’ll be limiting rollout around airports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US airlines warn of ‘catastrophic disruption’ on Wednesday due to 5G activation</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g0Fg5n"&gt;CEOs from major US airlines including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines warned that the impending deployment of new 5G spectrum on Wednesday, January 19th could cause “catastrophic disruption” for flights across the country. The warning, which was also signed by shipping companies including UPS Airlines and FedEx Express, was issued in a letter from the CEOs &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-major-us-airline-ceos-urge-action-avoid-catastrophic-5g-flight-2022-01-17/"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said that both commercial and cargo flights could be affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAWxrF"&gt;The letter was sent to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, and White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZjV3G"&gt;On Tuesday, ahead of the 5G spectrum push, some of that disruption became a reality — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;Emirates, Air India, All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines, China Airlines, Korean Air Lines, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Lufthansa, and Austrian Airlines all decided&lt;/a&gt; to cancel some flights or switch out some planes, after Boeing reportedly warned that its 777 and 747-8 aircraft would not be able to land at some airports under low visibility conditions. However, early Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jal.co.jp%2Fjp%2Fen%2Finfo%2F2022%2Finter%2F20220118%2F%3Fm%3Dimportant_notice%26inbound%3Dar&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22889141%2Fus-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Japan Airlines clamed that the FAA told it&lt;/a&gt; that “there is no longer a problem with the operation of the Boeing 777” and said it would resume flights to the US on January 20th. It’s not clear what changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yhvv1U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Emirates, Air India, and others cancel flights due to AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon’s 5G rollout","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"},{"title":"AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are limiting C-band 5G expansion around airports even more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="emfBTu"&gt;The 5G spectrum in question is known as C-band, and AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon’s deployments went live on Wednesday, January 19th after suffering multiple previous delays. At the core of the issue are fears that these new C-band airwaves could interfere with sensitive radar altimeters on certain aircraft, my colleague Russell Brandom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;explained earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. Altimeters are critical for landings especially when visibility is limited, and failures in this system were linked to a fatal &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines_Flight_1951"&gt;2009 Turkish Airlines crash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ej6Pz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kxZjie"&gt;“Airplane manufacturers have informed us that there are huge swaths of the operating fleet that may need to be indefinitely grounded” as a result of the new 5G deployments, the airlines wrote in their letter. “Immediate intervention is needed to avoid significant operational disruption to air passengers, shippers, supply chain and delivery of needed medical supplies,” that could cause “chaos” and strand “tens of thousands of Americans overseas.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDyc9K"&gt;“When deployed next to runways, the 5G signals could interfere with the key safety equipment that pilots rely on to take off and land in inclement weather,” United Airlines said in its own statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Without more safeguards, the rollout of this 5G spectrum could “result in significant restrictions on 787s, 777s, 737s and regional aircraft in major cities” and cause “hundreds of thousands of flight cancellations and disruptions for customers across the industry in 2022, [and] also the suspension of cargo flights into these locations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gN5P9R"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;The FAA issued a rule in early December&lt;/a&gt; that keeps flights from landing in poor visibility conditions, if they’re landing at an airport where there’s deemed to be enough interference that their altimeters aren’t reliable. At the time, it wasn’t clear which airports and planes would be affected by the rule, particularly as Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have been continually negotiating with the airline industry over these potential disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CjG21s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When deployed next to runways, the 5G signals could interfere with the key safety equipment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kq9xgz"&gt;Although there’s technically 220MHz of clearance between the spectrum used by the plane’s equipment and the new 5G spectrum, airlines are worried that the older equipment found in some planes might still be affected. Air safety concerns have already delayed the rollout of C-band from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;to this week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glSd7F"&gt;United is calling for 5G to be implemented “everywhere in the country on Jan. 19, except within approximately 2 miles of airport runways at affected airports.” It indicates the size of this buffer could be reduced after further analysis by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA). On January 3rd, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T previously agreed to take steps to mitigate the potential effect on aviation, including placing buffer zones around 50 airports for six months. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;They agreed to halt 5G rollouts at even more towers this week&lt;/a&gt;, after the airline industry’s warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msu3ya"&gt;C-band spectrum has already been rolled out in &lt;a href="https://www.5gandaviation.com"&gt;nearly 40 countries&lt;/a&gt; without causing altimeter failures according to one tech trade group, and United says the right government policies could allow for a safe deployment in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJ1rql"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have a lot riding on this new spectrum, which they paid $65 billion for in an auction last year. Both need the extra spectrum to handle the traffic demands of 5G, especially given AT&amp;amp;T’s plans to shut down its 3G network next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BClQJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 19th, 1:39PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that many airlines have canceled or changed out planes on at least some flights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
