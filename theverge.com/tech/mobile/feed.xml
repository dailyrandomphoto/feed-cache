    <title>We didn’t need an AR version of Snake, but AT&amp;T just gave us one anyway</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lyvzLeI-kJr3MWN6golqBER8L38=/0x50:2100x1450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70279143/5g_snake_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warp Speed Worm is an AR filter for Instagram and Messenger and has tenuous connections to 5G at best.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VBq5av"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has re-imagined the classic Snake game in a new, interactive, and wholly unnecessary way in an effort to promote the capabilities of its 5G network. Called &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/facebook-warp-speed-worm.html"&gt;Warp Speed Worm&lt;/a&gt;, it’s an AR effect that can be used on Instagram and Facebook Messenger video calls.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ugd5HQ"&gt;Snake was, of course, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/27/14749896/nokia-3310-snake-gameplay-preview-mwc-2017"&gt;game of choice&lt;/a&gt; on your early Nokia phone. Or, depending on your age and general level of apathy toward high school mathematics, you may recognize it as the game you played on your TI-83 graphing calculator while you were supposed to be learning about coefficients. Not that I know anyone who would do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuUZ0r"&gt;In any case, this newest contribution to the great Snake game &lt;em&gt;genre&lt;/em&gt; is an AR filter in which the titular worm is controlled by your head movements. You can play with friends, which AT&amp;amp;T would like you to do on their 5G network, or you can be a total doofus and play on your own using the camera in the Instagram app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="upPDP3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can play with friends, which AT&amp;amp;T would like you to do on their 5G network&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mmjSwD"&gt;It’s sort of cute — you tilt your head left or right to direct the worm to pick up little game controller icons. As you’ll recall from AP Calculus, the more the worm eats, the longer it gets. When the worm inevitably eats itself, the game is over, and a sad little dead worm crown appears on your head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9n6WIF"&gt;I gave the game a try by myself after struggling to understand how to save and use an AR group effect on an Instagram video call. I’ll admit that I missed the physical controls of my calculator and that my neck creaks alarmingly loud when I tilt it repeatedly. I also can’t comment on how AT&amp;amp;T 5G would have enhanced the experience — it worked just fine on my home Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s Concept Stanza converts your chicken scratch to digital text</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A worker holds the Dell Concept Stanza in their left hand in portrait mode at a white marble table in a cafe setting. On the screen are some drawings and notes. In their right hand is a black stylus." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oW0lH-srKEIieThxb6c_FZ5tdx4=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277284/Concept_Stanza___lifestyle_image___over_shoulder___embargoed_until_Dec_15.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is.&lt;/em&gt; | Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ar234k"&gt;Dell has shown off a new concept device that (let’s be honest) may never actually come out — but it’s a lot of fun to play with. The Concept Stanza is an 11-inch tablet that’s meant to simplify the process of taking notes at work. The idea is that if you write on the Stanza and then double tap your notes, they’ll be instantly converted to digital text. Connect it to a computer, and your notes will show up on the big screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSK333"&gt;Now, this is obviously not a revolutionary use case — devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Notes&lt;/a&gt; can convert handwritten notes to digital ones already. But the big difference with the Stanza is that it’s &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;for writing — there are no cameras, speakers, or ports on the device, in an effort to create what Dell describes as a “distraction-free experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dy6yaj"&gt;Dell’s tablet can also recognize more than letters. You can draw a line through text to delete it and can theoretically digitize shapes (such as Venn diagrams) as well. Separately, the Stanza can serve as an external monitor to extend your screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell Concept Stanza mounted horizontally on a stand with the stylus magnetically attached to the top, on a desk with a cup of pens and a row of notebooks in the background. The screen displays BioFrame 2.0 software." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7PymGJgdq4gVXkxZTmeWfXHeI2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098700/Concept_Stanza___docked___embargoed_until_Dec_15.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s the stylus, magnetically attached.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRfjb9"&gt;I got to try the Stanza out for a few brief minutes. It was a comfortable writing experience — the stylus is compact and the tablet’s screen is smooth. The device correctly interpreted all of my (fairly messy) writing. In English, that is — though we were told that the device is supposed to support a whole bunch of languages, I tried writing some things in Chinese and Korean characters that it did not recognize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EsY8B"&gt;So, work in progress. Since the Stanza is still in the concept stage, there’s no pricing and availability yet, and no guarantee that it’s going to become a real thing you can buy. But it could certainly be a nifty tool for boardroom and classroom use. It’s the rare concept device that I think seems pretty ready to go — though I hope it figures out how to do multiple languages at once. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo’s Find N is an impressive first folding phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ZzSQzXdM8-wFdPii7o44wIryOU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70275102/IMG_1126.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uTXtZn"&gt;After teasing its first folding phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825716/oppo-find-n-foldable-inno-day-2021"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, Oppo is revealing the Find N in full today. Oppo’s chief product officer Pete Lau told reporters in a briefing that the company has been working on this phone since 2018, with the final Find N the result of six generations of internal development. I can believe it — I’ve been using it since last week, and it’s a surprisingly impressive and refined product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVj84z"&gt;The Find N features a similar design to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, with a large, squarish folding OLED panel on the inside and a smaller screen on the outside that can be used when the phone is closed. The 120Hz inner display is 7.1 inches diagonal and has a slightly landscape 9:8.4 aspect ratio, unlike the Z Fold display, which is taller when unfolded. This means you don’t have to rotate the phone 90 degrees (with the fold horizontal) to watch videos at their largest size. There are dual stereo speakers located at the bottom of the phone, too, which further improves the experience of quickly opening the phone up to watch a video.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m-nndZxBUp20mF0mJ7FCF9phG3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098015/IMG_1128.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Find N’s hinge lets the phone stay unfolded between 50 and 120 degrees.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JoK22U"&gt;The screen looks great. Lau confirmed that it’s a Samsung-made panel, but says Oppo has heavily customized it and holds its own patents. The screen is protected by UTG (ultra-thin glass) and Oppo rates it for 200,000 folds, the same as Samsung. The crease in the panel is wider but much less visible than in the Galaxy Z Fold 3 because it wraps around a unique teardrop-shaped hinge that Lau says is also heavily patented and costs $100 to build alone. Another benefit of this design is that the phone folds shut without leaving a gap between the two halves of the display. You can feel the crease under your finger, but it’s difficult to see in regular use from all but the widest of viewing angles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Yp2CI"&gt;The outer screen is much more like a regular smartphone than the Z Fold’s. At 5.49 inches with an aspect ratio of 2:1, it’s actually very usable — if it weren’t for the folded device being twice as thick as a regular phone, it’d feel like the compact Android flagship that no-one else is making. The hinge does make for a larger bezel on the left side of the screen, of course, but it’s not intrusive. My biggest complaint about the outer screen is that it’s only 60Hz, which wouldn’t necessarily be a problem but feels jarring when the bigger, much smoother inner screen is right there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dkm5lU786QVPT2JBjJ87YUqRewc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098016/IMG_1130.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Find N’s outer display works pretty much like a regular phone, albeit quite a small one.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J3Hw5a"&gt;The rest of the Find N’s spec sheet is what you’d expect from a 2021 Android flagship. There’s a Snapdragon 888 processor and up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The main camera is 50 megapixels, using the same Sony IMX766 sensor from the OnePlus 9 Pro and Oppo Find X3 Pro, and is joined by a 16-megapixel ultrawide and a 13-megapixel 2x telephoto. The battery is 4,500mAh and can be charged at 33W with a SuperVOOC cable or 15W wirelessly. There’s also 10W reverse wireless charging and standard Qi support. A fingerprint sensor is located in the power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OStCPU"&gt;Oppo isn’t quite as ambitious as Samsung with its custom software for multitasking, but there are a few gestures that help make the most of the bigger screen. You can pinch with four fingers to collapse a full-screen app into a smaller floating column, or split the screen in half with a two-finger swipe down. Oppo has also customized many of its own apps with features designed for the folding screen — for example, if you prop it open at an angle, the music app can display lyrics on the top half. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y3bCiHdLkmMLZJgsQj5XCWP8jFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098017/IMG_1127.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Find N’s back panel curves similarly to the Find X3 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8iBTGO"&gt;One obvious concern is durability, and it’s one that I can’t speak to after having had such a short time with the Find N. But I can speak to the design, and I think Oppo has a winner here. The Find N is sleek and easy to use whether it’s open or closed — it strikes the balance between both configurations better than any other foldable phone to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lx0hET"&gt;I would say that the Find N should have Samsung worried, but unfortunately Oppo is only going to sell it in China, a country where Samsung phones have almost no presence. It’ll go on sale from December 23rd for a surprisingly low price of 7,699 yuan (about $1,200) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. 8,999 yuan (about $1,400) gets you a 12GB/512GB model. For comparison, the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at 8,999 yuan in China, so while the Find N isn’t exactly cheap it’s well within mainstream flagship phone territory. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, meanwhile, starts at $1,799 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s not-Chromecast Google TV dongle adds an ethernet jack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ALQF0b48xhB7FxbBoVrATC1QY_Q=/0x0:2058x1372/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70273722/tvision_hub.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TVision Hub offers 4K streaming and ships with a voice-control remote&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gk6wc5"&gt;T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356978/t-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv"&gt;TVision streaming service was not long for this world&lt;/a&gt;, but its name lives on in the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fservices%2Fhub&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F14%2F22834584%2Ft-mobile-tvision-hub-google-tv-chromecast-dongle-ethernet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TVision Hub&lt;/a&gt; — a $50 dongle with Google TV. It appears to function a lot like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Google’s own Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, but along with some T-Mobile branding, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/14/tmobile-google-tv-ethernet-dongle/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; that it offers a feature you won’t find on Google’s streaming dongle: an ethernet jack. That direct internet connection may be a real benefit if your home Wi-Fi signal isn’t quite up to the task of streaming 4K video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38xndx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/12/t-mobile-releases-new-tvision-hub-for-some-reason/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spotted the device last week on T-Mobile’s website, which is a new version of the streaming dongle launched with the TVision service. It comes with a remote bearing Netflix, YouTube, and Google Assistant buttons and connects with accessories like game controllers and headphones via Bluetooth or USB-C. Like Chromecast, it supports 4K HDR streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2Ke8J"&gt;T-Mobile (probably wisely) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356978/t-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv"&gt;shuttered its streaming TV subscription service&lt;/a&gt; just six months after it launched, opting instead to partner with YouTube TV and Philo. While the service is gone, it seems that the company wasn’t ready to let go of the TVision branding. The TVision Hub is available now for $50 and is offered free with a new home internet line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad adds magnets to its Base Station wireless charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-NCiB5ih0nq1SmsE7K1Go1l4fw=/0x0:5899x3933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269880/856500018928_Lifestyle_10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomad Base Station Hub with magnetic alignment&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nomad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2D1pWM"&gt;Nomad is updating its line of wireless chargers with the latest version of the Base Station Hub. A multi-device charger that can wirelessly charge up to two devices at the same time, plus charge two more devices through its USB ports, the new Base Station Hub now has embedded magnets to help align devices in the right spot on the pad. The new Hub costs $119.95 and is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeNomadBaseStation121421/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-station-hub-magnetic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for purchase starting today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMjCHA"&gt;Aside from the magnets, the new Hub is very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeNomadBaseStation121421/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-station-hub" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nomad’s prior version&lt;/a&gt;. It has three charging coils under a leather pad that are each capable of up to 10W charging (iPhones will be limited to 7.5W). On the back of the charger is an 18W USB-C port and a 7.5W USB-A port for other devices. Nomad also sells an attachment that affixes to the back of the Hub and holds an Apple Watch charger (not included) that you plug into one of the USB ports on the back or a separate brick. It’s less elegant than the multi-device chargers that have Apple Watch chargers built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8BAkh"&gt;The biggest challenge with wireless charging pads is making sure your phone or device is put in the right place to actually charge. That’s where the magnets in the new Hub come in: they make it easy to tell when your compatible iPhone (12 or newer), AirPods, or even a Google Pixel 6 is in the right spot to charge efficiently. The magnets are not as strong as those in Apple’s MagSafe charger or most MagSafe accessories — they aren’t designed to hold your phone in place if an earthquake happens. But they do noticeably attach and align the phone in the right place when you put it down, which is the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zytiU21ytftKWHObC2sfBOyWuQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085820/856500018928_G.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Base Station Hub’s leather pad are three charging coils surrounded by magnets, which help align compatible devices so they charge efficiently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="11PnIJ"&gt;The Base Station Hub is not as ambitious as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21399941/nomad-base-station-pro-review-wireless-charger-aira-freepower-price"&gt;Nomad’s old Base Station Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which used a complex array of charging coils and was meant to let you just plop your phone down wherever and have it charge. But that device had significant limitations and compatibility issues with phones that used MagSafe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obtjdT"&gt;Ultimately, when it comes to wireless chargers, the most important thing is knowing that your device will charge when you place it down. The new Base Station Hub makes that just a little bit easier than before.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="PJOxGH"&gt;US mobile carriers are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;delaying their 5G rollout&lt;/a&gt; thanks to an ongoing spat between two government agencies, and it doesn’t look like the situation will be resolving soon. As &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/six-former-fcc-chiefs-concerned-over-aviation-agency-5g-stance?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a group of six former FCC chiefs have sent a letter dated this Monday saying they were “concerned about the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) recent efforts to revisit the FCC’s 2020 decision” to open up the C-band to 5G applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIBL4R"&gt;At heart, the argument is between the federal agencies tasked with regulating airplanes and airwaves: the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The agencies disagree about whether it’s safe to allow 5G equipment to operate within a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum known as the C-band. The FAA says that doing so threatens the safety of aircraft, as 5G signals could interfere with the operation of certain altimeters (used to measure height above the ground). The FCC is complying with the FAA’s requests, but some third-party experts say these air safety fears are overblown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="67hVg7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The FAA position threatens to derail the reasoned conclusions reached by the FCC”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sMUkCx"&gt;“The FAA position threatens to derail the reasoned conclusions reached by the FCC after years of technical analysis and study,” said the authors of the recent letter, former FCC chiefs Ajit Pai, Tom Wheeler, Mignon Clyburn, Julius Genachowski, Michael Copps, and Michael Powell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xepu8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that the letter was sent to current FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel and Evelyn Remaley, acting assistant secretary of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (another agency involved in telecoms regulation). The letter reportedly encourages the FCC and the FAA to work together in finding a solution for this problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYOfDx"&gt;As a result of the FAA’s objections, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have delayed the expansion of their 5G networks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;until at least January 5th&lt;/a&gt;. That expansion was set to use the C-band spectrum, which the FAA says threatens aircraft safety. And just last week, the FAA ruled that certain aircraft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;would not be able to land using guided and automatic systems&lt;/a&gt; because of worries these programs could be affected by 5G equipment. The result of this may well be flight delays, thought it’s impossible to say how widespread these problems could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw2btY"&gt;But for some industry watchers, the delay to the 5G rollout isn’t just frustrating — it’s nonsensical. They argue that a key FAA study supposedly showing 5G interference with altimeters doesn’t really support the agency’s claims, and note that 40 other countries have already approved or operate 5G equipment in the worrisome C-band without any trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14ZEqE"&gt;“Either physics works differently in the US, or the report at the center of this controversy needs to explain why [interference] hasn’t shown up in any other country where deployments are either authorized or have already taken place,” writes Harold Feld, a senior vice president of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, in an &lt;a href="https://wetmachine.com/tales-of-the-sausage-factory/what-the-eff-faa-my-insanely-long-field-guide-to-the-faa-fcc-5g-c-band-fight/"&gt;excellent explainer on the spat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGcE71"&gt;How, exactly, the two agencies will find a resolution and stop fighting over the airwaves is unclear. In a statement reacting to the FCC letter, the FAA told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;: “[W]e continue to work with federal agencies and the wireless companies.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LastPass is going to become an independent company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-HIpULz4Izv-8h5Jq0rbcESdWcw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268897/acastro_210217_1777_passwords_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LogMeIn is making LastPass an independent company.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eOfXkZ"&gt;LogMeIn plans to spin out password management tool LastPass as a standalone company, it announced Tuesday. With the change, LastPass is promising that customers will receive enhancements on an “accelerated timeline” next year. “With a team solely dedicated to its continued innovation and growth, [LastPass] will be able to deliver even more strongly for users,” a spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdyvAY"&gt;LastPass, which LogMeIn purchased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/9/9486343/logmein-buys-lastpass-for-125-million"&gt;for $125 million in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, is a popular password management tool; it’s used by “more than 30 million users and 85,000 businesses worldwide,” according to LogMeIn, and “the significant majority” of its business is corporate customers. LogMeIn’s emphasis on LastPass’ corporate use in its press release could suggest the standalone company is going to focus more on that audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abDw3C"&gt;The change arrives almost a year after LastPass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;added significant restrictions to its free tier&lt;/a&gt;. LastPass now limits free users to only viewing and managing passwords on mobile devices &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; your computer. To access your passwords on all your devices, you need to be on a paid plan. If you’re still on LastPass’ free plan and want to move to another password manager, we’ve got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho"&gt;a guide you can follow right here&lt;/a&gt;. LogMeIn has also been criticized for tripling the price of LastPass Premium &lt;a href="https://www.bruceb.com/2019/06/lastpass-learns-the-wrong-lessons-about-price-increases-from-logmein/"&gt;between 2017 and 2019&lt;/a&gt;, though a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; there are “no plans” to change LastPass’ pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAberS"&gt;The shift is taking place nearly two years after LogMeIn agreed to sell itself to &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/lastpass-parent-company-sold-to-private-equity-firms"&gt;two private equity firms for $4.3 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo announces Air Glass ‘assisted reality’ device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUTMMFUjNxNB3mfUvNkzsXAGqaY=/47x0:1874x1218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268392/3._OPPO_Air_Glass_Weather_Notification.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2OECP5"&gt;Oppo has announced the Air Glass, an AR device that’ll go on sale early next year. Oppo describes the Air Glass as an “assisted reality” product, as opposed to augmented reality, meaning it projects 2D information into your field of view rather than overlaying 3D objects onto the real world. (Yes, sort of like Google Glass.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZB2rG"&gt;The Air Glass has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 4100 processor and weighs just 30g (about 1oz) in total. Oppo says it should last for 3 hours of active usage and 40 hours on standby. There are two frame designs, a silver half-frame and a black full-frame, and each is available in two sizes. The inside of the frame has a magnetic port that allows it to be attached to more conventional glasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzzcU6"&gt;The waveguide display uses a tiny projector with Micro LED tech capable of up to 3 million nits peak brightness, though Oppo says the actual brightness will be up to 1,400 nits in average conditions. It can be operated via touch, voice, hand tracking, and head tracking, as well as through a Smart Glass app on a smartphone running Oppo’s ColorOS 11 or above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lC-mTEjw8u4q7kiM-3yEWhgA6-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086596/4._OPPO_Air_Glass_Teleprompter.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FcQK7P"&gt;Oppo’s proposed use cases for the Air Glass are relatively modest. The company says it can be used for notifications and directions, as you’d expect, as well as features like teleprompting and real-time translation. The display is monochrome with either 16 or 256 levels of grayscale depending on the mode, so the Air Glass isn’t going to be beaming rich content into your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1nrgz"&gt;That said, it probably isn’t going to be a mature, mainstream product, either. Oppo says the Air Glass will receive a “limited release” in Q1 2022, and at least at first it’ll be only sold in mainland China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkNTm1"&gt;The Air Glass was announced as part of Oppo’s ongoing annual Inno Day event. Oppo also revealed its first in-house NPU chip to boost machine learning-related imaging performance; it’s called the MariSilicon X and will feature in Oppo’s next Find X flagship in the first quarter of next year. Last week Oppo confirmed the debut of its first folding phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825716/oppo-find-n-foldable-inno-day-2021"&gt;the Find N&lt;/a&gt;, though that hasn’t broken cover just yet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says bug with Teams and Android can cause 911 calls to fail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jOBeJ4WpBRanuS9TvKelaAsT0aQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250825/jbareham_181010_2989_0455.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wufCfX"&gt;Last week, a Reddit user reported that they &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/"&gt;weren’t able to call 911 using their Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; and later said they were working with Google support to figure out the issue. Yesterday, Google &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/hnrvsr1/"&gt;announced what was causing the issue&lt;/a&gt; in a reply to the post: an “unintended interaction between the Microsoft Teams app and the underlying Android operating system” (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/08/android-emergency-calling-bug/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Auq1G4"&gt;In its comment, Google says that the bug happens when someone is using Android 10 or later and has Teams installed but isn’t logged into the app. The company says that Microsoft will be releasing an update to Teams “soon” to prevent the issue and that there’s an update to Android coming January 4th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vur50g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you’re running Android 10 or above and aren’t logged into Teams, uninstall it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fhvf9I"&gt;Needless to say, you should uninstall Teams until the update is available if you’re not planning on logging into the app. If you have logged into it at one point but don’t use it frequently, you should also go ahead and double-check that you’re still logged in as well. Even though the bug was reported on the Pixel subreddit, Google recommends that you should keep an eye out for the Teams update if you have “any Android device” running Android 10 or up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRVGVP"&gt;As many commenters pointed out, it’s a bit concerning that any app can make it so you can’t contact emergency services. Google does say it’s only received one report about this bug, but it’s a pretty niche set of circumstances that cause the bug (there’s really no reason to have Teams installed if you’re not logged into it). If it had been a more common interaction, it could’ve really caused problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMzSr5"&gt;Google says it’ll update its Reddit comment when the Teams update is rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola Moto Edge 5G UW (2021) review: Pixel envy</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;This middling $549.99 phone with a 144Hz display just can’t catch a break &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zKfjfu"&gt;Timing is everything, and unfortunately for Motorola, any review of the new Moto Edge 5G UW boils down to this one question: how does it compare with the Google Pixel 6? After all, not only did the Verizon variant arrive in stores on October 14th, 2021, just five days before the Google Pixel 6’s launch, it even ended up with near-identical prices as the Google flagship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwLEHj"&gt;The Verizon-locked Moto Edge starts at $549.99 for a 128GB model, and you can double that storage for $599.99, which is $200 cheaper than the unlocked version sold in retail stores. That’s twice as much storage for the same price as an unlocked Pixel 6, plus the Edge supports Verizon’s fast-but-limited millimeter wave (mmWave) network. Given how good a phone the Pixel 6 is, the Moto Edge has its work cut out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fpm2W"&gt;As a midrange phone, the Edge has some impressive specs and features on paper. It has a rare 144Hz refresh rate LCD display, 108-megapixel main camera, 6GB RAM, and the ability to project its screen to a larger display through its Samsung DeX-like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fready-for%2Fp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22824763%2Fmotorola-moto-edge-5g-uw-2021-review-google-pixel-6-android-mobile-verizon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Ready For” mode&lt;/a&gt;. In practice, though, the high-megapixel count camera is not as great as it sounds, and its 5,000mAh battery can drain too quickly, but these aren’t even its worse offenses. The Edge’s biggest crime is that it’s just too middling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BqQNRQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10909816"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto Edge 5G UW (2021)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CyU-H9rno4nHf4pM0rp_Dsa0BTU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053000/gsin_190313_4899_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rims around the Moto Edge 5G UW (2021)’s camera lenses remind me of the iPhone 13’s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nFFuPi"&gt;The Moto Edge is all about the monochromatic look, splashing the same “nebula blue” all over the phone — from the buttons to the plate underneath the camera array. It’s a big phone at 6.65 x 2.97 x 0.35 inches, but it’s skinny and thin enough for one-handed use. That said, it’s just a touch too tall for my fingers to maneuver around the screen &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;hold the phone in the same hand. Despite its all-plastic body, the phone weighs about as much as an iPhone 13 Pro at 0.44lbs (200g or 7.11oz). Its nicely curved edges and back make this phone a pleasure to hold, but that also means its very glossy back cover is a cesspool of smudges and dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgX7Ir"&gt;The rims around the three rear camera lenses remind me of those on the iPhone 13. While their raised edges protect the lenses from scratches, that extra height means the phone can’t really lie flat on the table when the screen is facing up — it ends up rocking side to side. This, combined with its slick back cover, means the Moto Edge is prone to randomly slide off tables and other surfaces, so you’ll want to protect it with a case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlxySE"&gt;Like the Pixel 6 and OnePlus 9, the Moto Edge doesn’t have a dedicated Google Assistant button or a 3.5mm audio jack anywhere. Its volume rocker and two-in-one fingerprint sensor and power button are on its right side. For a $500 phone, it only has a mono speaker that blasts from the bottom of the phone. It’s louder than you’d expect and turns up the bass by default, so you can really hear the percussive beats in &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;theme song. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto Edge 5G UW (2021)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Aieyayiv2c57xo7RUyF9AHQKSQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053009/gsin_190321_4899_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto Edge 5G UW (2021) may only have a mono speaker, but it is loud and has a strong bass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto Edge 5G UW (2021)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xdVF4dTEVvqiSvOzUMmKcgcr0Ng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053002/gsin_190313_4899_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its two-in-one fingerprint sensor and power button makes it convenient to unlock the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VrB0jT"&gt;Unlike Motorola’s G series phones, the Edge has NFC for contactless payments, but doesn’t support wireless charging. Out of the box, the Moto Edge runs Android 11 though it’s unclear when it’ll get Android 12. While Motorola has committed to providing two major OS upgrades and two years of bi-monthly security updates to the Moto Edge, it also said it’ll &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/29/motorola-android-update-policy/"&gt;adjust its software support policy based on how long users will keep using a device&lt;/a&gt;, so its promise can be rather fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMNARX"&gt;The Moto Edge’s side fingerprint sensor and face unlock features work quickly and provide good haptic feedback when the unlocking is successful. Face unlock has some customization options: you can choose to press the power button to activate the feature or to simply lift the phone and face the front camera to unlock the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto Edge 5G UW (2021)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_lRlG7109wqYPEu2q7mCzOjCZWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053003/gsin_190313_4899_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto Edge 5G UW (2021)’s LCD screen has a whopping 144Hz refresh rate that is a pleasure to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xMQjdx"&gt;The highlight of the Moto Edge has to be its 144Hz display, even though it’s just a 1080p, 6.8-inch LCD panel. The high refresh rate makes it a breeze to scroll through Twitter and move my pokémon around in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;. It’s too bad the screen is relatively dim, so I have to set its screen brightness to about 90 to 100 percent for indoor and outdoor use — any dimmer than that and I’d have trouble reading text in direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLlULp"&gt;I’ve been testing the $549.99 model with 128GB of internal storage, which is otherwise identical to the $599.99 256GB version. The Moto Edge uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G processor, a midrange chipset, with 6GB RAM as support. Unsurprisingly, it’s the Pixel 6’s flagship-level components that outperform the midrange Moto Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rt0kui"&gt;I played one round of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; on the Moto Edge, which started out snappy and easy to navigate my Charmander. However, the game became so laggy that it was hard to move my pokémon to avoid attacks or to score a goal in the last minute. I played the same game on the Tensor-equipped Pixel 6 to compare. While I couldn’t move my pokémon as easily with the Pixel 6’s slower 90Hz screen refresh rate, the speed of the game stayed more consistent, making it possible for me to score a last-minute goal.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Moto Edge 5G UW (2021)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HyfrzLG9DNamgdOhL-Aen1dZa8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053006/gsin_190313_4899_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto Edge 5G UW (2021) weighs about the same as the iPhone 13 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TorcDh"&gt;Motorola’s “Ready For” mode is supposed to be able to turn the phone’s 32-megapixel front camera into a webcam for a compatible smart TV or computer, but I couldn’t make it work with my Surface Pro 4 at all. The font on the Ready For PC’s interface was way too tiny to be legible on my 12.3-inch screen. Worst of all, there was so much lag between my mouse clicks and what was happening on-screen that this whole feature was a flop for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NC5bIX"&gt;While its 5,000mAh battery lasts about two days with average use, the Moto Edge’s battery can drain very quickly if you’re doing something intensive. On days where I’m primarily on Wi-Fi and doing lightweight tasks like online shopping, social media doomscrolling, and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CEFwuR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I find it hard to recommend the Moto Edge over others that offer a better value&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iAL9NM"&gt;listening to a couple of podcasts, I could squeeze almost 11 hours of screen time out of this phone. However, when I was gaming and testing its video features, I managed to drain a whopping 29 percent of the battery within just a couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIsdqr"&gt;Recharging the Moto Edge is also unnecessarily annoying, thanks to the lack of a charger inside the box — all you get is a double-ended USB-C cable. I had to plug the Edge into my Pixel 5’s 18W charger for a recharge, which took almost two hours. If you don’t have a compatible charger handy, you’ll need to budget $20–$30 for a new cable or charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto Edge 5G UW (2021)’s 108-megapixel main camera sounds more impressive than it is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qh6T4t"&gt;The Moto Edge has three cameras on the back cover: a 108-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide-angle with Macro Vision (119-degree), as well as a 2-megapixel depth sensor. It also has a 32-megapixel front-facing camera that sits in the middle of the screen, though you don’t really notice that black dot after a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moto Edge 5G UW (2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pixel 6" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yhhpdaxBuMojMy5ZgSEz7n-QEnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074613/PXL_20211204_013930145.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yfuamp"&gt;As impressive as the Moto Edge’s 108-megapixel main camera sensor sounds, its results are surprisingly unpredictable. On one hand, its f/1.9 aperture and larger pixel size means each pixel can capture more light, even in low-light conditions. I was surprised how well some photos from an indoor interactive art exhibit turned out, even though some shots were not as crisp as others and looked a bit noisy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0mJbh9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10910732"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7yMmj9"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo samples from the Moto Edge 5G UW and the Pixel 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjSxAK"&gt;On the flip side, the Edge’s cameras have trouble finding and focusing on subjects, whether I’m taking outdoor photos of Christmas decorations or well-lit photos in portrait mode. It often takes several shots and several processing seconds before the camera figures out which part of the image is the subject and which is the background that should be blurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel 6: portrait mode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto Edge 5G UW (2021)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B1sbbomPhpAQWNPOLO_EFakrqc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074628/IMG_20211203_205150700_MF_PORTRAIT.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAhpXX"&gt;I used the Pixel 6 to take photos of the same scenes, and the ones from the Google flagship are consistently sharper, with colors that are more true to life. Photos from the Moto Edge tend to look flat, skew blue, or are overexposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Motorola Moto Edge 5G UW (2021) in Nebula Blue." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4HU8OsJsLbSLv8O2YonGiHnufEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053007/gsin_190313_4899_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With cheaper and better competitors around, I find it hard to recommend the Moto Edge 5G UW (2021) to consumers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EkInNA"&gt;The Moto Edge 5G UW (2021) may be a decent phone: its unusually high 144Hz refresh rate on the LCD screen works great; and it has two days of battery life, with a camera that can handle low-light photography if you can get it to focus. But that’s no longer enough to be competitive in the midrange phone race. Unless Verizon or Motorola further drop its price, I find it hard to recommend the Moto Edge over others that offer a better value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tLhIL"&gt;For the price of the 256GB Moto Edge, you might as well get the unlocked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; instead. It features a faster processor, faster and sharper cameras, and a more energy-efficient battery. While the $599.99 Moto Edge offers double the onboard storage as the base Pixel 6, its flagship-class components and early access to Android software and security updates make it the better investment in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ulswep"&gt;If you’re a Verizon customer, the Moto Edge might seem like a better deal than the $699.99 mmWave-equipped Pixel 6, but don’t be fooled by the Edge’s lower price tag. The flagship Google phone is worth the extra $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVsAgW"&gt;If the $549.99 Moto Edge is slightly beyond your budget, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;$499.99 Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; is an even more affordable 5G phone alternative. The A52 features a 120Hz OLED display and a headphone jack but doesn’t support Verizon’s mmWave network. That’s not something that matters to most people, but the Edge does have it if you want to use Verizon’s 5G network. Plus, you’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;guaranteed four years of software support from Samsung&lt;/a&gt; for the A52  — who knows if Motorola will even follow through on its two-year promise.&lt;/p&gt;
