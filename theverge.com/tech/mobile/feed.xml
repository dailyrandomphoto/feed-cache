    <title>New Qualcomm CEO sees former Apple execs as key to beating M1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0mltVZY3kM-rUP2rOcALXXWqBM=/26x0:455x286/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535459/ca_mwc.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7p0LX3"&gt;Qualcomm’s new CEO, Cristiano Amon, has big plans for competing with Apple when it comes to laptop performance, thanks to the ex-Apple employees Qualcomm brought on when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;it acquired Nuvia earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-ceo-focus-idUSKCN2E75QY"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he believes Qualcomm could make the world’s best processor, which would require designing a chip better than Apple’s M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvbyn8"&gt;Before assuming his new role as CEO, Amon was head of Qualcomm’s semiconductor division and was in charge of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;acquisition of Nuvia for $1.4 billion&lt;/a&gt;. The startup was founded by three former Apple engineers who specialized in chip design and worked on Apple’s A-series SOCs. Those founders joined Qualcomm, and it’s apparent now that they’ll be focusing on making chips for consumer computers (though the company wouldn’t turn down the chance to license its tech to data centers, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;). Qualcomm hopes to start selling Arm laptop chips, powered by Nuvia’s designs, next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jm3rlX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple hasn’t added 5G, or any cellular compatibility at all, to its M1 Macs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="soFLVj"&gt;Amon also hopes to use the company’s experience in making 5G chips and smartphone processors to help provide a better laptop experience, by building 5G connectivity into its laptop-focused CPUs. Adding 5G, or any cellular compatibility at all, is something that Apple hasn’t done yet for its M1 Macs, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/macbook-air-and-pro-with-m1-opens-the-door-to-5g-it-cant-come-soon-enough/"&gt;despite demand from some&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;M1-powered iPad Pro has a 5G option&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NehvPD"&gt;It’s safe to say that if Qualcomm wants to become a dominant player in powering laptops like it is in the smartphone market, it has a lot of work to do. While Microsoft does use Qualcomm-designed chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496677/microsoft-surface-pro-x-refresh-sq2-processor-new-platinum-color-option"&gt;in its Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; (which made an appearance at the Windows 11 event), the list of &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile-computing/mobile-pcs"&gt;Windows PCs with Qualcomm inside&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a long one. It’s also unlikely that Intel is planning on just letting Arm take over the laptop space without a fight — the &lt;a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313803-intel-makes-it-official-hybrid-cpu-cores-arrive-with-alder-lake"&gt;company is working on hybrid CPUs&lt;/a&gt; that, like Arm, mix high-power and efficiency-focused cores to provide better battery life, but using an x86 architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxBCE8"&gt;Amon &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-ceo-focus-idUSKCN2E75QY"&gt;also talked to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about challenges and opportunities the company faces due to sanctions in China and about the company’s struggles to become a household name like Intel or AMD.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus is merging OxygenOS with Oppo’s ColorOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aPHIxc6qbeKB7raEULtvG27U7zw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535023/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0063_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sxGtmt"&gt;Following last month’s announcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;that OnePlus was integrating with Oppo&lt;/a&gt;, effectively becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543184/oppo-oneplus-merger-brand-pete-lau-bbk-memo"&gt;a sub-brand of the phone manufacturer&lt;/a&gt;, the company &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/update-to-the-oxygenos-codebase-and-software-maintenance-schedule.1462181/"&gt;announced on Friday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s also merging OxygenOS with Oppo’s ColorOS operating system (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/02/oneplus-android-update-schedule-years-oxygenos-coloros/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuNLqJ"&gt;Both companies’ software will remain separate and continue to serve their individual regions (OxygenOS for OnePlus phones globally, ColorOS on OnePlus and Oppo devices in China) but share a common codebase, which OnePlus says should standardize its software experience and streamline the development process for future OxygenOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14iqGm"&gt;OnePlus says the change will also allow the company to guarantee better Android update  support going forward, something Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;has also tried to improve on&lt;/a&gt; in the last few years. OnePlus lays out the life span for updates as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="exG21w"&gt;Flagship phones including the T and R models get three major Android updates and four years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dpAw7u"&gt;Nord and Nord CE phones get two major Android updates and three years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FOtNuJ"&gt;Nord N phones will get one major Android update and three years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jIYDoF"&gt;OnePlus does limit those update commitments to the OnePlus 8 and up, so older OnePlus devices will be out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsAxF6"&gt;As the next step in whatever is going on with OnePlus, Oppo, and the wider BBK Electronics umbrella, merging the companies’ software on the backend seems like a net positive for OnePlus users. How independent OnePlus is now that it’s “integrated” seems about as unclear as when it was independent, owned by BBK, and seemingly sharing some parts with Oppo, but as long as phones are supported, it hopefully shouldn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ex8yvg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Monster Slayer&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go-like&lt;/em&gt; augmented reality game for mobile devices set in &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe, will be released on July 21st, &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/the-witcher-monster-slayer-launches-globally-on-july-21st/"&gt;CD Projekt Red announced on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. It will be available for free on both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHTN79"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Monster Slayer&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll explore the world around you and fight menacing virtual monsters in AR. You’ll also go on “story-driven quests that propel you through epic adventures inspired by the &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; series, taking you deep into the heart of what it means to be an elite monster slayer,” &lt;a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/monster-slayer"&gt;according to the game’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The game was first announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402495/the-witcher-monster-slayer-ar-game-iphone-android-pokemon-go"&gt;in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mJgj5P"&gt;If you’re on Android, you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa3ZaOVk4RF8zVGZEc01RU3RPZXRVV08zYTVkQXxBQ3Jtc0ttaHVqWjdXUE82cEJ3VnZHZnlyNGJfV1l0bEJCMUg1VkR3OHUwdC1mSEFYMC13ME1uTEpuelBXOXlqUDF5VlFlSHNzWFBBNXk0YjlJTXo5QTQxX2dHUC1Uckxfd3k3aHZfZWhjTURaVGFWWEExdTE3VQ&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.spokko.witchermonsterslayer"&gt;pre-register for the game on Google Play right now&lt;/a&gt;. If you do, you’ll be able to play the game as soon as it launches and you’ll get access to a special sword that gives you extra experience for each monster kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESt0ht"&gt;The announcement comes a week before &lt;a href="https://www.witchercon.com/en"&gt;WitcherCon&lt;/a&gt;, a celebration of the franchise hosted by CD Projekt Red and Netflix, which streams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;the hit TV series&lt;/a&gt;. There could be some exciting news from the event as it seems likely we’ll hear more details about the second season of the show (which Netflix has already shared a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22462967/the-witcher-season-2-trailer-netflix-geeked-week"&gt;very brief teaser of&lt;/a&gt;), and CD Projekt Red has already promised that a next-gen update for &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-witcher-3s-next-gen-update-will-be-released-in-the-second-half-of-2021/"&gt;set to release this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s camera-centric Xperia 1 III to ship on August 19th for $1,299</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/51YwlW54zMbn6cAuknjyqSuLwAk=/547x0:6454x3938/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530326/Xperia_1_IIIcameraZeiss_frostedBlack.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia 1 III puts an emphasis on advanced camera features and high-end display specs.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Go4M5"&gt;Sony’s next flagship phone, the Xperia 1 III, will ship on August 19th in the US — for a whopping $1,299.99. It’s available to preorder today, the company announced. The new photography-focused phone is designed as a complement to Sony’s Alpha camera range, and it introduces a variable periscope-style telephoto lens. It’s also equipped with just about everything you’d expect from a flagship Android phone in 2021, including a Snapdragon 888 processor, 5G, and a 6.5-inch display with 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQSJmb"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/24/21268097/sonys-xperia-1-ii-ships-july-24th-1199-us-united-states"&gt;Xperia 1 II launched at $1,200&lt;/a&gt; — pricey even for a top-of-the-line device — and Sony isn’t backing off by pricing this one at an extra $100. In this case at least, users in the US will be able to utilize its 5G connectivity; last year’s model had the right hardware but couldn’t use US 5G networks. The 6.5-inch 4K display has also been upgraded to a faster 120Hz refresh rate compared to last year’s model (which had a standard 60Hz rate), and you’ll get a bigger 4,500mAh battery, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j6bena"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony Xperia 1 II review: it’s a stretch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21322518/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-smartphone-new-camera-photo-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fDWEEb"&gt;If the Xperia 1 III sounds appealing but paying $1,300 does not, the Xperia 5 III is a smaller-screen variant that will likely cost a bit less, though US price and shipping are still unannounced. In the meantime, if you are willing to shell out top dollar for the 1 III, Sony’s offering a healthy preorder incentive by throwing in a pair of WF-1000XM3 noise-canceling earbuds for free on orders placed by September 26th. The Xperia 1 III will be sold &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/"&gt;directly from Sony&lt;/a&gt; and other third-party retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is building support for digital COVID vaccine cards into Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2NdixgkE_2rijXpFkTiMdbzV9ag=/0x27:1600x1094/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69527264/_GD_BLOG__Covid_cards_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A digital COVID vaccine card in Android.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a1e3j5"&gt;Google is opening up Android’s built-in passes system to &lt;a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/google-updates-passes-api-to-save-covid-testing-and-vaccination-information-on-Android-devices.html"&gt;let Android users store a digital vaccine card&lt;/a&gt;, which it calls a COVID Card, on their phone. The feature will initially roll out in the US, and it will rely on support from healthcare providers, local governments, or other organizations authorized to distribute COVID vaccines. The feature will also support storing COVID test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKcq4t"&gt;For vaccinations, your COVID Card will show info on when you were vaccinated and which vaccine you received, according to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pay/answer/10890261"&gt;a Google support page&lt;/a&gt;. The card can be saved from your healthcare provider’s app or website as well as from texts or emails sent to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnhL79"&gt;Google recommends that you add a shortcut to the card on your home screen and will offer the option when you save your card to your device. Google says that the card won’t be saved the cloud and that it won’t use the information you provide for advertising purposes, but &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pay/answer/10890261#zippy=%2Cwhat-information-is-provided-to-google-when-i-save-my-covid-card%2Chow-your-information-is-used%2Cwhat-information-is-provided-to-google-when-i-use-my-covid-card"&gt;it does say&lt;/a&gt; that it will collect some information, like how many times you use your card and on which days. And you won’t have to have the Google Pay app downloaded to save and access cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJfDvs"&gt;It’s good to see that Google is making it easier for people to save their vaccination status digitally on their phones, though whether you’re actually able to use the feature or not will still depend on your healthcare provider or government. Some states, like &lt;a href="https://epass.ny.gov/home"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/vaccine/vaccinationrecords/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, have implemented their own digital vaccine cards, but Google’s version could streamline the process for other authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ktub7U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fpress%2Ft-mobile-calls-are-100-stir-shaken-compliant&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557539%2Ft-mobile-verizon-carriers-fcc-stir-shaken-certification-deadline-spam-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile announced&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that it is fully compliant with the FCC’s new anti-spoofing protocol, telling the FCC that its now certifying that calls from its network are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;protected against impersonation by scam callers&lt;/a&gt; using the STIR/SHAKEN protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5kh04"&gt;Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/over-78-million-verizon-customers-protected-over-13-billion-unwanted-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s verifying that the number that shows up on your caller ID is actually the number that’s calling you using the same STIR/SHAKEN protocol. The two major carriers announcing their progress on the same day isn’t a coincidence — Wednesday, June 30th, is the deadline the FCC set for major carriers to implement STIR/SHAKEN. An AT&amp;amp;T spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the carrier also met the deadline, as it filed on the 29th, and said that “all LTE and 5G calls originating on [its] wireless network are STIR/SHAKEN compliant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wo2aX0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The protocol works to prevent scam and spam callers from spoofing their number&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="31Lb2O"&gt;The protocol, with its James Bond-themed name, works to prevent scam and spam callers from spoofing their number and showing up on your caller ID as a local caller. The FCC hopes that carriers implementing it will help stem the tide of robocalls that have made many of us scared of our phones’ actual phone function. &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-373714A1.pdf"&gt;In a press release put out on Wednesday (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;, the commission stated that over 1,500 voice providers have filed to be included in its Robocall Mitigation Database, with over 200 of those providers being fully certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4obFxo"&gt;The Wednesday deadline set by the FCC is only for major carriers — smaller carriers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers will be exempt until June 30th, 2023, though the FCC &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-373714A1.pdf"&gt;is considering shortening that timespan (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;. The major carriers that haven’t certified themselves as compliant may face an unspecified “appropriate enforcement action” from the FCC and will run into even more trouble come September. Beginning September 28th, &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/062199369474/DA-21-727A1.pdf"&gt;according to the FCC (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;, carriers will have to stop accepting traffic from providers that aren’t in the robocall database — it’s hard to imagine customers being too happy that they’re not able to reach their friends or family who are on T-Mobile or Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pxxocJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;While this may mean a significant drop in spam calls, it’s not bulletproof&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sl16xb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fpress%2Ft-mobile-calls-are-100-stir-shaken-compliant&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557539%2Ft-mobile-verizon-carriers-fcc-stir-shaken-certification-deadline-spam-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In its press release&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile says that its STIR/SHAKEN network covers calls from 98 percent of US wireless customers, including those using carriers like AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, Google Fi, and Comcast. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/over-78-million-verizon-customers-protected-over-13-billion-unwanted-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon says&lt;/a&gt; that its validation network covers 80 percent of the US wireless industry, and &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/robocalls.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said in a recent press release&lt;/a&gt; that it blocks or labels over a billion robocalls a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oH7IG"&gt;The STIR/SHAKEN protocol &lt;a href="https://blog.hiya.com/stir/shaken-does-it-reduce-illegal-call-spoofing"&gt;isn’t a total solution&lt;/a&gt; to the robocall problem, and it won’t keep your phone from ringing when a scammer calls you unless your carrier is doing additional blocking using the data from it. &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/fcc-deadline-for-stir-shaken-caller-id-authentication-nears"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fierce Wireless&lt;/em&gt; also points out&lt;/a&gt; that carriers still have to contend with international calls, which is no small task, and legacy phone systems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;are exempt from the requirements&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the next time you get a phone call, you may be able to see whether the number that’s calling you is actually who it claims to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2tGPU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, June 30th, 6:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added more info about AT&amp;amp;T’s compliance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s Revvl V Plus 5G offers a huge display and battery with a tiny $199 price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PPwSFHkhNKNr8Mf8QgigKb2R2nk=/0x0:1666x1111/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525847/revvl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The newest Revvl phone offers 5G, a massive 6.8-inch screen, and a rear-facing triple camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ken1yu"&gt;The year of cheap 5G phones is upon us, and T-Mobile is offering its customers yet another low-cost 5G phone with today’s announcement of the Revvl V Plus 5G. The T-Mobile-branded device will cost $199, with a huge 6.8-inch 1600 x 900 display and 5,000mAh battery. It’ll go on sale first through &lt;a href="https://www.metrobyt-mobile.com/revvl-best-budget-smartphones"&gt;Metro by T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; starting on July 12th, with sales through T-Mobile starting on July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsBwsY"&gt;The Revvl V Plus 5G comes with Android 11 and uses a MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor designed with inexpensive 5G phones in mind. It’s paired with 4GB of RAM plus 64GB of built-in storage, which is expandable via microSD. It offers a main 16-megapixel rear-facing camera along with two more unspecified 5-megapixel and 2-megapixel sensors on the back as well as a 16-megapixel selfie camera. There is, of course, 5G connectivity available, and while you won’t get the ultra-fast mmWave flavor (no big loss; it’s hard to find), you do get access to T-Mobile’s more widespread and relatively strong sub-6GHz 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NzrWNz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Nord N200 5G review: T-Mobile’s best phone under $250","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2PXtdy"&gt;The V Plus 5G undercuts the OnePlus N200 5G — another inexpensive big-screen-big-battery 5G phone — by about $15 to $40, depending on where you buy it. (It’s $216 through T-Mobile and $239 unlocked from OnePlus.) The N200 5G is actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;our current top pick&lt;/a&gt; for T-Mobile customers looking for 5G on the cheap. And while the Revvl offers some similar features at a lower price, it will be hard pressed to match the N200’s very good 1080p 90Hz display. What we can say for sure is that the 5G price of entry continues to drop, and it likely won’t be long before we see 5G devices priced well under $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShcyZS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T joins T-Mobile in switching all Android phones to Google’s Messages app for RCS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5 in “Sorta Sage” green" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Onc7aDdjRRR6knxYhMJrqsbo55k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69524342/akrales_201012_4137_0117.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E5OHuj"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Google have announced that all Android phones on the network will use Google’s Android Messages app for SMS and RCS services. T-Mobile made the exact same partnership deal with Google in March, which leaves Verizon as the only US carrier who hasn’t committed to switching its customers to Android Messages by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxk7X0"&gt;Along with the switch to Messages comes another important shift: real interoperability with RCS on other networks. AT&amp;amp;T has supported RCS for awhile now, but that support has been as haphazard as it was half-hearted. The new deal also means that AT&amp;amp;T customers will benefit from the rollout of end-to-end encryption for RCS that Google is rolling out to all customers this year (that rollout has already begun, in fact).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U49JPZ"&gt;Google has been pushing RCS as its default texting solution for Android for some time now, touting it as an open standard that any carrier can easily adopt as the next generation of SMS. RCS has a lot of advantages over SMS: there are no character limits, it can send larger files, it can show typing indicators, offer better group chats, Wi-Fi support, and offer end-to-end encryption for one-on-one chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NwciLa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yes, it’s confusing — blame Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YJUsec"&gt;When Android Messages detects that you’re texting with another phone that supports RCS, your text entry window will switch to say that you are sending a “Chat” and that you have “Chat features” enabled. This is not the same thing as Google Chat, the company’s other messaging service. Yes, it’s confusing — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;blame Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jv8BwT"&gt;In any case, despite Google’s best efforts, carriers were slow to adopt RCS. In fact, in October 2019 they announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;doomed attempt to form an RCS consortium&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382715/us-carriers-ccmi-rcs-abandoned-sms-messages-texts"&gt;went nowhere&lt;/a&gt;. Google eventually had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271186/google-rcs-t-mobile-encryption-ccmi-universal-profile"&gt;take matters into its own hands&lt;/a&gt;, years into an overlong transition by offering RCS services directly to any Android user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NBVjq"&gt;In all, the RCS Chat rollout has been a huge mess because of politics, corporate fights, and plain old confusing Google messaging app strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2entOW"&gt;Now, with these carrier deals, Google has gone one step further to make it a true default. Unfortunately, it’s just a step. Verizon will need to get on board, too, as will another big company: Apple. The iPhone does not support RCS and Apple has yet to make a peep about whether it will. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is offering iPhone owners no-hassle network ‘test drives’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-1kBqP2Ll5BefEiR2iNNntXf0eY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69519885/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you own a compatible iPhone, you can try out T-Mobile just by downloading an app.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gMRljy"&gt;T-Mobile is offering a new, low-stakes way to try out its network for free for 30 days with no additional equipment required. &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ossbsscx/t-mobile-taps-esim-tech-for-free-network-test-drive/d/d-id/770535?"&gt;Identified by &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile’s existing &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Ffree-trial&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F29%2F22555810%2Ft-mobile-test-drive-iphone-esim" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Test Drive program&lt;/a&gt; now works over eSIM with compatible iPhones. All you need to do is download an app, follow the instructions to start the trial with eSIM, and you’re up and running — no billing information required. There’s no change to your current carrier plan or phone number, but you’ll be using T-Mobile data on your device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyeTK3"&gt;The Test Drive program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/15/17693228/t-mobile-free-30-day-trials-network-cities"&gt;has been around in one form or another&lt;/a&gt; since 2014. With the most recent iteration — which is still available to those who can’t use the eSIM feature — T-Mobile will send you a free Wi-Fi hotspot you can connect to with your current phone to try out the network. This new eSIM version offers the same kind of trial (30 days or 30GB, whichever you reach first) with less hassle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwsLJWL1Bz9EiIpop6RzCgoKj0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689051/Tmo_trial.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download the app, enter some information, follow the prompts, and you’re good to go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LXRjoU"&gt;T-Mobile says the eSIM option is a pilot program that it introduced last week. Currently, it only works with unlocked iPhones starting with XS and newer devices that are running iOS 14.5 or higher. If you have an iPhone 12-gen device, you’ll also have access to T-Mobile’s 5G network during your trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr4ZsC"&gt;We gave it a shot and it actually is as easy as it looks — just follow the set-up prompts and you’re good to go. It definitely beats visiting a store or carrying a Wi-Fi hotspot. It is, of course, particularly beneficial for T-Mobile, too; the carrier is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425022/verizon-t-mobile-att-phone-promotion-magenta-max-5g-c-band"&gt;looking to flex its relatively strong 5G spectrum holdings&lt;/a&gt; before Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T start catching up later this year with newly acquired C-band frequencies. Getting more customers to try the network and convert now would help it make the most of its 5G “lead.” But in any case, this is one of the easiest ways we’ve seen to try out a new network without ditching your current provider, and if you’re curious what T-Mobile service is like in your area, it’s not a bad way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ZenFone 8 review: an Android iPhone mini</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The ZenFone 8 delivers flagship-level build quality and performance in a small package&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4C38dH"&gt;After a couple of generations making phones with flip-out cameras and increasingly large displays, Asus has taken the ZenFone 8 in a totally different direction: small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSrT9H"&gt;The flipping camera concept lives on in the also-new ZenFone 8 Flip, but it’s no longer a standard feature across this year’s ZenFone lineup. Instead, starting at $629 for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the ZenFone 8 lands in the upper-midrange class with a conventional rear camera bump and a much smaller 5.9-inch display. An 8GB RAM / 256GB storage configuration is also available for $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwwRdC"&gt;Rather than an attention-grabbing camera feature, the focus of this design has been to create a smaller phone that’s comfortable to use in one hand, which Asus has done without skimping on processing power or higher-end features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1hmwn"&gt;It’s an Android iPhone mini, and it’s fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u3cT9V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10494874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Go0J86tAcMmzjPPXSpyPncCJlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499353/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus designed the ZenFone 8 with one-handed operation in mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FW7hIJ"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 screen and design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IhH9SM"&gt;The ZenFone 8 may be small, but that hasn’t kept it from offering the latest flagship processor: a Snapdragon 888 chipset, coupled with 6, 8, or 16GB of RAM (my review unit has 16GB). I can’t find fault with this phone’s performance. It feels responsive, animations and interactions are smooth, and it keeps up with demanding use and rapid app switching. This is performance fitting of a flagship device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cElERS"&gt;The display is a 5.9-inch 1080p OLED panel with a fast 120Hz refresh rate that makes routine interactions with the phone — swiping, scrolling, animations — look much more smooth and polished than a standard 60Hz screen or even a 90Hz panel. By default, the phone will automatically switch between 120 / 90 / 60Hz depending on the application to save battery life, but you can manually select any of those three refresh rates if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EFkcZ"&gt;The display’s 20:9 aspect ratio was carefully considered by Asus. The company says it settled on this slightly narrower format so the phone would fit more easily into a pocket, and it does. I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits. More importantly, it fits well inside a jacket pocket and doesn’t feel like it’s going to flop out if I sit down on the floor to tie my shoes. The ZenFone 8 is rated IP68 for dust protection and some water submersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2grdcK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o69ULu"&gt;The front panel is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus and houses an in-display fingerprint sensor, while the back uses Gorilla Glass 3 with a frosted finish that’s on the matte side of the matte / glossy spectrum. The front panel is flat, but the rear features a slight curve on the long edges for an easier fit in the hand. At 169 grams (5.9 ounces), it’s heavy for its size, and it feels surprisingly dense when you first pick it up. The phone’s frame is aluminum, giving the whole package a high-end look and feel. There’s even a headphone jack on the top edge as a treat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8XM4b"&gt;The power button (an exciting shade of blue!) is well-positioned so my right thumb falls on it naturally with the phone in my hand. Same for the in-screen fingerprint sensor: the target appears to be positioned higher on the screen than usual, but that actually puts it within a comfortable reach of my thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w8VC5"&gt;I’ll admit up front that I have a personal bias toward smaller phones, but the ZenFone 8 just feels great in my hand. I’ve spent a lot of time using big devices over the last six months, and I’ve gotten used to it. But the ZenFone 8 is the first device that feels like it was adapted to &lt;em&gt;me,&lt;/em&gt; not something I’ve had to adapt to using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UuUZnwxRe3j921AYa4ifsE1k5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499355/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A smaller phone means a smaller battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kpaymP"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 battery and software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8mbHH8"&gt;The phone’s small size makes a smaller battery a necessity — 4,000mAh in this case, much smaller than the ZenFone 6 and 7’s 5,000mAh. I felt the difference in using this phone versus a battery-for-days budget or midrange phone, but I had no problem getting through a full day of moderate use. I even left Strava running for 20 hours by accident, and the battery still had some life in it the next morning. The ZenFone 8 supports 30W wired charging with the included power adapter, which takes an empty battery to 100 percent in a bit more than an hour. Wireless charging isn’t supported, which makes the ZenFone 8 a bit of an outlier in the flagship class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPNxId"&gt;Asus offers a ton of options to help stretch day-to-day battery life as well as the overall lifespan of your battery. There are no fewer than five battery modes to optimize phone performance or battery longevity on a daily basis, and different charging modes let you set a custom charging limit or stagger charging overnight so it reaches 100 percent around the time of your alarm for better battery health. You won’t find class-leading battery capacity here, but rest assured if you need to stretch the ZenFone 8’s battery, there are plenty of options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kj8abO"&gt;The ZenFone 8 ships with Android 11, and Asus says it will provide “at least” two major OS with security updates for the same timeframe. That’s on the low side of what we’d expect for a flagship phone, especially compared to Apple’s typical four- or five-year support schedule. An important note for US shoppers is that the ZenFone 8 will only work with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s LTE and Sub-6GHz 5G networks; you can’t use this phone on Verizon, and there’s no support for the fast, but extremely limited, millimeter-wave 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctgUaWF69tS9vSVEdPG5w8MwvQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507533/DSC00661_rear.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 offers standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8l2mPu"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MbIlch"&gt;There are just two cameras on the ZenFone 8’s rear camera bump, and they are both worth your time. Rather than cram in a depth sensor, macro, or some monochrome nonsense, Asus just went with a 64-megapixel main camera with OIS and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. They’re borrowed from last year’s model, minus a telephoto camera and the flipping mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5utE4G"&gt;As in the ZenFone 7 Pro, the 8’s main camera produces 16-megapixel images with vibrant color and plenty of detail in good light. Images can lean a little too far into unnatural-looking territory, and some high-contrast scenes look a little too HDR-y for my liking. But overall, this camera does fine: it handles moderately low-light conditions like a dim store interior well, and Night Mode does an okay job in very low light, provided you can hold the phone still for a few seconds and your subject isn’t moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bFBXWG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10494947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xx4klZ"&gt;A skin-smoothing beauty mode is on by default when you use portrait mode, and it is not good. Skin looks over-smoothed, unnaturally flat, and brightened, like your subject is wearing a couple of layers of stage makeup. Turning this off improves things significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBkFNw"&gt;The ultrawide camera also turns in good performance. Asus calls it a “flagship” grade sensor, and while that might have been true in 2018, it’s at least a step up from the smaller, cheaper sensors often found in ultrawide cameras. Likewise, the front-facing 12-megapixel camera does fine. Beauty mode is turned off by default when you switch to the selfie camera, and thank goodness for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maIBzp"&gt;There’s no telephoto camera here, just digital zoom. On the camera shooting screen, there’s an icon to jump to a 2x 16-megapixel “lossless” digital zoom to crop in quickly, which works okay, but it isn’t much reach, and it just makes the limitations of the small sensor and lens more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wAwwx"&gt;On the whole, the camera system is good but not great. The lack of true optical zoom or a telephoto camera is a disappointment, but you can’t have everything on such a small device, and I’d personally take an ultrawide before a telephoto any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2yyJwz2m9mIkB8t4cUpzDgDLbuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499354/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 doesn’t sacrifice a flagship experience to achieve its small form factor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZDiMQY"&gt;The ZenFone 8 fills a void in the Android market for a full-specced, small-sized device. The Google Pixel 4A is around the same size, but it’s decidedly a budget device with a step-down processor, plastic chassis, and fewer niceties like an IP rating or a fast-refresh screen. Aside from battery life, which is manageable, you give up very little in the way of flagship features to get the ZenFone 8’s small form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzbIbh"&gt;You have to look to iOS for this phone’s most direct competition: the iPhone 12 mini, which it matches almost spec-for-spec from the IP rating down to the camera configuration. The 12 mini is actually a little smaller than the ZenFone 8, and when you factor in storage capacity, it’s the more expensive choice at $829 for 256GB. However, when you consider that the 12 mini will probably get a couple more years of OS and security support, it may be the better buy in the long run, if you’re flexible in your choice of operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jc0CEI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEL2JQ"&gt;I like the ZenFone 8 a lot, but I’m not sure it’ll find a big audience, at least in the US. Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;having trouble selling the iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, and if there’s one thing Apple is good at, it’s selling phones to US customers. As much as I hate to entertain the idea, maybe we’ve gotten used to giant phones. I love how the ZenFone 8 feels in my hand and in my pocket, but I do notice how much smaller the screen and everything on it seems compared to the bigger phones I’ve used recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Etfrj"&gt;There are also a few important considerations, like the lack of compatibility with Verizon and the comparatively short support lifespan of the phone. If you need the absolute best in battery life the ZenFone 8 can’t offer that, and if you want a class-leading camera, you’ll need to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OIO7v3"&gt;All that said, the ZenFone 8 will be the right fit for a specific type of person, and I can heartily recommend it to my fellow small phone fans. You’ll get flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
