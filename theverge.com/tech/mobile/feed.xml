    <title>Yes, your Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro can be MagSafe-friendly with this Moment case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vhnDp0sypwlk5vjmT5IbaSogRzA=/403x490:5654x3991/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102491/Moment_Pixel6_mforce_magsafe_1126.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moment has a whole ecosystem of accessories that will now work with the Pixel 6, thanks to its new M(force) case.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Moment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EJACZV"&gt;Your dangerously slippery Pixel 6 or 6 Pro just arrived, and you’re scrambling to find an available case that will protect your new baby. Whether you are a MagSafe-curious Pixel owner or recently ditched your iPhone for the Pixel but have some MagSafe accessories you don’t want to waste, Moment’s (M)Force case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro could be the bridge to more platform agnostic mobile accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ei1Rb"&gt;As a mobile accessory maker, Moment embraces the idea that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22417836/moment-magsafe-iphone-camera-accessories-review-price-features-specs"&gt;ecosystem of lenses and mounts for content creators&lt;/a&gt; should be compatible with different phone brands and models. After all, each case is compatible with Moment’s catalog of accessories that shares the same mount design — just like the way camera lenses work with various camera bodies. This is not the first time that Moment has made a cross-platform case: earlier this year, the company released some &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fgalaxy-thin-case-m-force%2FS21-ultra-5g-black&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22753313%2Fpixel-6-magsafe-pro-moment-mforce-case-mobile-accessories-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe-compatible cases for the Samsung Galaxy S21s&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbZ6dn"&gt;According to Alec Ploof who is in charge of partnerships at Moment, the thought process to make its cases compatible with MagSafe was simple: “We included our proprietary M(Force) magnets into all of the Moment cases we made for iPhone 11, 12, &amp;amp; 13, so we figured to also include them in our new Pixel 6 or Samsung S21 cases to also make these devices compatible with our MagSafe mounting products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vhyFs7Qe1cZa8SVGtGPrPpxDu1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989736/P6_Pro_3_Front.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moment’s case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro with (M)Force has an array of 36 magnets that help MagSafe accessories attach to the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhwhAroeCg3z1lFRPrR2c79fBtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989743/P6_Pro_1_Back.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike Moment’s other cases which feature wood or canvas panels, the (M)Force case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro is made of textured polycarbonate and TPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JqOnHi"&gt;Unlike Moment’s previous cases that feature wood and canvas panels, there is just one case design for both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s case with (M)Force. It’s all black and made of a textured and a “grippy material” called high-strength polycarbonate and TPU. Its three-layer exterior should protect your Pixel 6 from up to six-foot drops and even has a provision for a wrist strap (sold separately). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mB1209"&gt;On the inside is a layer of premium microfiber liner that wraps around your Pixel 6 or 6 Pro, as well as an array of 36 of Moment’s proprietary (M)Force magnets. Those magnets are equivalent to about 15lbs of force, so your MagSafe accessory should be able to attach easily yet securely to your Pixel. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QxaowMFWrVtDjSkWqkQHutEX60M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989835/Moment_Pixel6_mforce_magsafe_1134.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moment case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro with (M)Force, attached to the Pro Tripod Mount with MagSafe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CeZL9W"&gt;Not only will this Moment case with (M)Force work with its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fmoment-pro-tripod-mount-for-magsafe%2Fpro-portrait-landscape&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22753313%2Fpixel-6-magsafe-pro-moment-mforce-case-mobile-accessories-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Tripod Mount with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, it will be able to charge wirelessly with any battery that is Qi- and MagSafe-compatible. This means your Pixel 6 might just be able to make use of other Qi- and MagSafe-friendly accessories out there, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744362/anker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile"&gt;Anker’s adorable 8-in-1 637 Magnetic Charging Station&lt;/a&gt;. Just don’t expect to get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;15W fast charging from Apple’s official MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jj6ZX1"&gt;Both (M)Force cases for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are available now on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fmoment-case-for-pixel-6%2F6-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22753313%2Fpixel-6-magsafe-pro-moment-mforce-case-mobile-accessories-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Moment’s website for $50&lt;/a&gt;. While the Pixel 6 case is currently in stock, the Pixel 6 Pro case won’t ship until December 4th due to the global supply shortage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Code suggests Google’s folding Pixel will return to 12-megapixel camera next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-UDdpgPW5i6DLdApNvtrnMrWNRs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099537/dbohn_210820_4722_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JhPdxC"&gt;Google’s rumored foldable device could release next year with similar camera hardware to what older Pixel phones used prior to this year’s big Pixel 6 overhaul, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/04/googles-pixel-foldable-coming-in-2022-cameras-will-be-a-step-down-from-pixel-6/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Reports about the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;first emerged this summer&lt;/a&gt;, at which point it was expected to launch before the end of the year. Now the device, whose codename appears to have changed from “Passport” to “Pipit,” seems to be on track for a launch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD9huF"&gt;These latest details have emerged thanks to code discovered in the Google Camera app. In particular, they suggest that the foldable will use a 12.2-megapixel IMX363 sensor for its main camera. That suggests the foldable won’t be equipped with the same 50-megapixel Samsung GN1 camera sensor Google used on this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the IMX363 is the sensor Google used for the Pixel 3 through 5. Its lower resolution suggests the foldable might struggle to match the excellent camera quality of the Pixel 6 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z77dsh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google switched to a 50-megapixel main sensor with the Pixel 6&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nwxnjy"&gt;Aside from the main sensor, the code snippets suggest the Pixel foldable’s other cameras will be more in line with the Pixel 6. There’s a 12-megapixel IMX386 that’s expected to handle ultrawide shots and two 8-megapixel IMX355 sensors for its selfie cameras. Two selfie cameras appear to be necessary to allow selfies to be taken while the foldable is both open and closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sfjZd"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes, it’s not uncommon to see companies equip foldables with less powerful camera hardware than their flagships. The recent Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, for example, had a 12-megapixel sensor rather than the 108-megapixel sensor Samsung used in the Galaxy S21 Ultra. But it might be a disappointment for anyone expecting Google’s rumored foldable to match the camera quality of its latest flagships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="duYy3l"&gt;A release date of next year makes sense for the foldable given what we know about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746599/android-12l-feature-drop-big-screens"&gt;Android 12L&lt;/a&gt;, the upcoming Android update that’s due to launch early next year and is designed to offer a range of improvements for devices with larger screens, including foldables. The update, which has previously been referred to as Android 12.1, also contains code suggesting Google might have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683566/google-jumbojack-foldable-passport-android-12-1-code-discovery"&gt;second foldable device in development&lt;/a&gt; under the codename “Jumbojack.” It’s unclear when, or even if, this second foldable may be released.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’s latest overkill gaming phones arrive in Europe with up to 18GB of RAM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AwUsM0jHvmwjR7mNiHB8BMW66kI=/0x0:1145x763/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099241/msedge_5BtFPuHiJl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROG Phone 5S Pro, which has a small display on its rear.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dPFt5t"&gt;Asus has announced pricing for the ROG Phone 5S series in Europe, following their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630283/asus-rog-phone-5s-pro-gaming-smartphone-android-price-release-date-features"&gt;launch in Taiwan in August&lt;/a&gt;. The ROG Phone 5S costs €999 for 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, while €1,099 gets you a step-up model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The top of the line 5S Pro has an excessive 18GB of RAM and the same 512GB of storage and retails for €1,299. Meanwhile in the UK, &lt;a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/asus/158977-asus-rog-phone-5s-pro-specs-price-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pocket-Lint&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the 16GB model will cost £999, and the 18GB Pro model will set you back £1,099, but there’s no mention of pricing for the 12GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhmTIR"&gt;The ROG Phone 5S and 5S Pro are functionally minor updates to the ROG Phone 5 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; that Asus released earlier this year. They have a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Plus processor and their screens have a more responsive 360Hz touch-sampling rate (their 144Hz refresh rates are unchanged), but the core specs remain the same. They still have 6.78-inch 1080p displays, 6,000mAh batteries, and triple-rear camera array with 64-megapixel main sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GF2DBifVWw0Z2mNXy6H_kAYIcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22987984/h732.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gJJAmG"&gt;Although European pricing for the phones has now been announced, exact release dates seem to vary from country to country. In the UK, for example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fuk%2FMobile%2FPhones%2FAll-series%2Ffilter%3FCategory%3DGaming-Phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765036%2Fasus-rog-phone-5s-pro-europe-launch-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus’ online store&lt;/a&gt; currently doesn’t offer links to preorder the phones. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Ffr%2FMobile%2FPhones%2FAll-series%2Ffilter%3FCategory%3DGaming-Phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765036%2Fasus-rog-phone-5s-pro-europe-launch-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In France&lt;/a&gt; the 16GB model of the ROG Phone 5S is available to buy now, but the 12GB and 18GB RAM variants are due to ship on November 19th. We’re yet to hear about any US release plans for the new phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and AT&amp;T delay crucial 5G expansion over aircraft interference concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SKhuTLlvOCWA4ClbJtBF3P9odDs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094027/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MR2uYu"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are delaying the rollout of their wider 5G networks after the Federal Aviation Administration warned that the new wireless technology could interfere with the safety systems of some aircraft, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-verizon-to-delay-5g-rollout-over-faas-airplane-safety-concerns-11636039555"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBNlyf"&gt;The two companies planned to light up new 5G networks that use so-called “C-band” frequencies on December 5th. That rollout will now be delayed until at least January 5th, the companies said Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQLr73"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T still currently offer ultra-fast 5G connectivity in specific areas using high-band millimeter-wave technology and much slower 5G over low-band frequencies. But the two companies have been banking on using the C-band — which covers midrange frequencies with good-to-great speed — to dramatically expand access to 5G across the country. The two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;collectively spent nearly $70 billion earlier this year to gain access to a bunch of C-band spectrum&lt;/a&gt; that was up for auction. T-Mobile, the other major player in the wireless market, already has a lot of mid-band spectrum that doesn’t operate in the C-band (though it will in a few years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="inoXgW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T need this spectrum to keep pace with T-Mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k7AlJO"&gt;The aviation industry has voiced concerns over C-band interference for a while now. In an &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/faa-has-deep-concern-about-5g-network-plan-aviation-safety-letter-2021-10-29/"&gt;August meeting&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Communications Commission, for instance, industry reps said that “major disruptions to use of the National Airspace System can be expected” with the rollout of C-band 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDKp1g"&gt;Those concerns &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-faa-warns-potential-interference-new-5g-technology-2021-11-02/"&gt;came to a head this week&lt;/a&gt; when the FAA released a “&lt;a href="https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgSAIB.nsf/(LookupSAIBs)/AIR-21-18?OpenDocument"&gt;special information bulletin&lt;/a&gt;” about potential interference issues with safety equipment that relies on radio altimeters. While the agency said that there have been no documented incidents of “harmful interference” in other countries to date, it nonetheless warned aircraft operators that they “should be prepared for the possibility that interference from 5G transmitters and other technology could cause certain safety equipment to malfunction, requiring them to take mitigating action that could affect flight operations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5QOcq"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said Thursday that it is working with the FAA and FCC to better understand the aviation industry’s concerns. “It is critical that these discussions be informed by the science and the data,” the company said in a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That is the only path to enabling experts and engineers to assess whether any legitimate co-existence issues exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfFHfJ"&gt;The major wireless trade group, the CTIA, said last week that companies should be able to use C-band 5G “without causing harmful interference to aviation equipment,” &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/faa-has-deep-concern-about-5g-network-plan-aviation-safety-letter-2021-10-29/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The group pointed to the many successful C-band deployments in other countries as evidence. “Any delay in activating this spectrum risks America’s competitiveness,” the group wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VRSpB1"&gt;T-Mobile is once again offering its customers a free streaming deal: starting on November 9th, any T-Mobile or Sprint customer (new or existing) on post-paid cellular or home internet plans can sign up to get a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fparamount-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763109%2Ftmobile-free-year-paramount-plus-essential-plan-promotion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free year’s subscription of Paramount Plus Essential&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMcGIX"&gt;As always, there are caveats for the deal. The promotion only includes access to &lt;a href="https://help.paramountplus.com/s/article/PD-What-plans-are-available-for-Paramount-and-how-much-do-they-cost"&gt;Paramount Plus’ Essential plan&lt;/a&gt;, which typically costs $4.99 per month and has “limited commercial interruptions.” Additionally, unlike the $9.99 per month Premium plan, it doesn’t include a live feed of your local CBS station, although NFL and Champions League games are still available on the lower tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHCAEA"&gt;For new Paramount Plus subscribers, or customers who are already subscribed to the Essential monthly plan, you’ll be able to go to T-Mobile’s promotional site on November 9th, log into your account, and either sign up for a free account or get a coupon code for your existing Paramount Plus subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cx7IJ1"&gt;If you’re a Premium customer looking to take advantage of the deal or bought an annual subscription to the service, you’ll have to cancel your existing account, wait until the end of your billing cycle, and then make a new account through the T-Mobile offer. (Additionally, if you’re on the grandfathered in “Limited Commercials plan” from CBS All Access, Paramount  Plus warns that you won’t be able to get it back if you do cancel.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pGW844"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Paramount Plus will not send a reminder alerting you of your upcoming offer expiring.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aDkbCX"&gt;Additionally, in order to sign up for the deal, you’ll have to give Paramount Plus your credit card information — which the company &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; use to start charging you for your subscription after the year is up. And in a rather off-putting move, the promotional page clearly warns that “Paramount Plus will not send a reminder alerting you of your upcoming offer expiring,” — so you’ll want to make sure you keep an eye on when your free year is up if you’re looking to avoid getting charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdZJsT"&gt;The new deal is by no means T-Mobile’s first free streaming promotion: the company has given unlimited customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637681/tmobile-unlimited-data-plans-magenta-netflix-basic"&gt;free Netflix for years&lt;/a&gt; and recently offered Magenta and Magenta Plus subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637797/tmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans"&gt;a free year of Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;, too. It even once gave customers with multiple active lines a year of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204260/t-mobile-quibi-subscription-free-access"&gt;free Quibi access&lt;/a&gt; (although, given that Quibi only lasted for seven months, that may not have been the best of deals.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite is shutting down next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwEGbxkcnUfR3-PHgOuJKORLc7c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70080422/cgartenberg_190621_3508_3510.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gw74sD"&gt;Niantic, the developers of the smash hit &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, will be shutting down its Harry Potter-themed AR game &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizard’s Unite &lt;/em&gt;on January 31st, 2022. The game will be pulled from the App Store, Google Play, and Galaxy Store on December 6th, and that same day, you will no longer be able to make in-game purchases, according to the game’s website. The game’s community forum and social media channels will be closed on January 31st as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNJAzb"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.harrypotterwizardsunite.com/"&gt;blog post and FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Niantic didn’t specify why it decided to shut down &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizard’s Unite&lt;/em&gt;. But we weren’t impressed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18716146/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-review-ar-augmented-reality-game-foundable"&gt;when we first tried it in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and the game never reached the same level of popularity as &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, which is still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;incredibly relevant&lt;/a&gt; despite being more than five years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCUqob"&gt;There hasn’t been another AR hit quite on the level of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;; Niantic’s AR adaptation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680166/niantic-catan-world-explorers-shutdown-early-access"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catan &lt;/em&gt;will fully shut down this month&lt;/a&gt;, while Microsoft closed down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215253/minecraft-earth-closing-down-june-2021-microsoft"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; in June&lt;/a&gt;. That hasn’t stopped Niantic from trying, though, as it just released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746427/pikmin-bloom-niantic-nintendo-pokemon-go-release-trailer"&gt;Pikmin-focused AR game &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and has an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22529378/transformers-heavy-metal-niantic-pokemon-go-location-game-ar"&gt;AR &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt; game in the works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefox’s new mobile homescreen makes it easier to jump back to pages you’ve recently visited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOfPYJofQ88gskq3TZNmGEujYlg=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70078678/Untitled_1.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of Firefox’s new mobile homescreen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Mozilla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qJN2fq"&gt;Mozilla is updating the homescreen on its Firefox mobile apps to help you more easily jump back to pages you had viewed recently. With Firefox 94, which will be available Tuesday, you’ll be able to see things like your last open tab, recently-viewed bookmarks, and recent searches grouped by topic right on the mobile homescreen. You can get an idea of what it looks like in this image from Mozilla:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h47cQnpUGKcDqk8EmInS14Oab8w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977842/Untitled.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Firefox mobile homescreen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xKQcuX"&gt;Firefox 94 is also giving Android users the ability to tailor Pocket recommendations that show up on the homescreen by selecting different story topics they are interested in. According to a screenshot shared by Mozilla, topics include things like technology, health, food, and science. This feature isn’t yet available for iOS users, Mozilla says, though they will still see be able to see Pocket recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kGLzqcdmX5hla10YQ1a6LONgdR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22979055/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mozilla&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are some of the Pocket story topics you can pick from.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B5ToY8"&gt;The desktop version of Firefox 94 brings some updates, too, including 18 new themes you can use to customize the way the browser looks for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The smartphone, circa 2031</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m0uSK-jagKFFbl4vRhVW99It9YI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073692/acastro_futurePhones_lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Small improvements can go in surprising and strange directions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4jZPAe"&gt;What will the smartphone look like in 10 years? The most likely answer, I’m afraid, is one of two options: it’s either completely unknowable or disappointingly predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27vqaP"&gt;The story of the smartphone thus far began with technological breakthroughs paired with ingenuity (Camera + Data = Instagram) but eventually evolved into a yearly cadence of iterative improvements (better camera). Ten years from now, when we gaze upon the devices in our hands (or, less likely, consider the implant in our spinal columns), I expect we’re going to be telling one of those two stories again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeSxP5"&gt;The most likely story, as always, is iteration. Absent some breakthrough, we’ll likely have much more impressive versions of the things we can buy today. Nearly every time somebody says that there will be a massive breakthrough in five to 10 years — be it self-driving cars or augmented reality — the safest bet is that they’ll be making the same prediction five years later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jc4Hyk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s easy to underestimate how important iterative changes can be&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="36BPI7"&gt;Even with iterative updates, smartphones will be radically better than they are today, and they’ll be different in some ways, too. The screens will be brighter and fold in different ways, the cameras will be so advanced that they’ll threaten to obviate even higher-end SLRs, and the digital assistants inside them will be smarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaFnCJ"&gt;It’s easy to underestimate how important iterative changes can be. Would Instagram have been born if the original iPhone camera hadn’t been kind of junky? Would it still exist if that camera hadn’t become so good it has destroyed entire categories of products? OLED is just a new way of displaying pixels, but it can flex and uses very little power, so now our phones fold in half, and we take calls on our wrist computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HO93Vi"&gt;A simple, incremental advancement in a component can simply make our phones faster — or it can surprise everybody by catalyzing a shift in culture. More of those changes are in our future, and many of them will be emergent behaviors catalyzed by some seemingly insignificant spec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Yv9zz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Each phone launch will be less exciting than the last — but that doesn’t mean phones will become less important or impactful&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RVhTLB"&gt;Take ultra wideband, for example. It’s the chip in top-end phones that allows them to locate other devices in space and also transmit small bits of data — to unlock a door, for example. Right now, it’s used to locate gadgets in the couch cushions, and there’s a promise it’ll unlock your car door soon. But just as we didn’t initially realize that GPS + Data = Uber, we don’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; know yet what else UWB could unlock (pardon the pun). I could guess, but such guesses often end up looking like the naive predictions of overly optimistic futurists. UWB could come to naught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1dB3Z"&gt;Whatever happens, the iterative path for smartphones will inevitably mean each phone launch will be less exciting than the last — a trend we’re already familiar with today. But that doesn’t mean that phones will become less important or impactful. Instead, they’ll become more familiar and (forgive another pun) part of the fabric of our culture. We’ll begin to more clearly see that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652375/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-phones-fashion"&gt;phones function as a kind of fashion&lt;/a&gt;. That they will follow yearly trends that will be a lot more about style than function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPGhgH"&gt;With any luck, we’ll also have a deeper and more self-conscious awareness of the smartphone’s place in our culture, just as we have with fashion. My hope is that phones will be ever-present without being all-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5b0wV"&gt;I hate to start on a down note about the future of technological progress, but it’s important to stay a little grounded in reality. I could spin a tale about phones that project their displays into mid-air between your fingers. I could predict that we won’t have phones at all but, instead, high-bandwidth jacks plugged right into our brains, connecting us into a 6 or 7G network of wordless, emotive communication. But getting from here to there requires more leaps than can responsibly be made, both ethically and imaginatively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="D7DSEA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That’s the way with some technological advancements: they can drive changes in culture that head in surprising and strange directions. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1KR6o3"&gt;Fourteen years ago, Palm founder Jeff Hawkins unveiled his last big idea for tech. He had beat the tech giants in PDA with the PalmPilot and created the Treo smartphone well ahead of the iPhone or Android. His third and final act was to be a different kind of computer, a dummy terminal that simply acted as a window into your phone, where all your real data lived. It was called the Foleo, and it never launched — Palm had more immediate worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD2vIE"&gt;Today, the Foleo seems naive. We don’t need to store our lives in our phones — all that data can live in the cloud. And the phones themselves would become more engaging in and of themselves than Hawkins could have predicted. They’re the engines of content creation and consumption that drive an ouroboros economy worth billions, if not trillions of dollars. Instead of the Foleo, we have Chromebooks and iPads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbhGxQ"&gt;None of those developments had happened in 2007, and few of them would have been predictable. That’s the way with some technological advancements: they can drive changes in culture that head in surprising and strange directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ugd3mR"&gt;We can try to guess what some of those advancements might actually be. Certainly, there are some promising directions like AR glasses, folding displays, the chance that modularity will finally work, and even that our phones will stop consolidating into a single device and instead explode out into a mesh network of tinier, more bespoke gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnyDUC"&gt;We can’t say what phones &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; look like in 10 years. But here are some guesses of what they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; look like. –Dieter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="dPJtjB"&gt;Foldables&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="6WcXfG"&gt;Wouldn’t it be better if our phones could shape-shift into a size fit for the task at hand? That’s the promise behind foldables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0T9d1"&gt;Before foldable devices really take off, a couple of things need to be figured out, starting with the issue of cost. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 takes folding phones a little closer to the mainstream with a $999 price tag, but that’s still out of reach for many people, and the bigger foldables like the Fold 3 remain closer to $2,000. Manufacturers will need to be able to make those folding components more efficiently at a lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTC58SUgGZxWe47wxCYdS451C7w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967707/acastro_211028_0002.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DCK6yF"&gt;Durability is another major concern — foldables require more delicate screens, along with hinges and moving parts that are much more difficult to seal against dust and water than the components of a standard candy bar-shaped phone. Samsung has gotten creative to make its folding phones more durable (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;when in doubt, inject it with cure-in-place goo!&lt;/a&gt;), but many more solutions will be needed for screens that roll and flex. It doesn’t help that we’re all conditioned to expect a certain level of durability from our devices that phones of the future will need to meet. –Allison&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itMC2U"&gt;Modular&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="RgiF7k"&gt;The smartphone industry has dabbled in modular phones over the years, teasing a future filled with devices that can morph and upgrade as needed, adding on better cameras, different sensors, and surprising new capabilities. But time and again, the idea has failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZEXRO"&gt;There was LG’s G5, which let you slide out its bottom section to add on a hi-fi DAC or a camera attachment with a dedicated shutter button. But LG gave up on the entire concept by the next year. Then Motorola gave it a go with its Moto Z lineup, creating a system where accessories could magnetically attach to the back of the phone. There were battery packs, a JBL speaker, a Hasselblad camera, and even a competent movie projector, and they worked across several generations of devices. But sales figures didn’t measure up, and eventually, the modular push fell by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3oda8GG_rOloHvewsc59p2TgMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967721/acastro_211028_0001.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wPaRZj"&gt;By comparison to those efforts, Google’s Project Ara seemed like the true modular dream. As the company pitched it, you’d someday be able to swap out individual components of a phone — processor, camera sensor / lenses, battery, and even the display — and keep your original device up to date with the latest hardware advancements by regularly replacing its guts. But the company threw in the towel on Project Ara and its LEGO-style upgrades before ever shipping hardware to developers. It’s a damn shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLE7A0"&gt;There’s certainly a technical challenge to pulling off our sci-fi modular phone fantasies. Google had to pull back on its ambitions with Ara and ended up integrating the CPU and display into the device’s frame, meaning they wouldn’t be replaceable. And perhaps the biggest reason that piecemeal smartphones would never work is profit margin. When Samsung, Apple, and other companies can charge $1,000 for fresh devices every year, what’s the incentive for them to adopt a modular approach that allows consumers to spend less money and upgrade their phones with the latest groundbreaking tech? Maintaining compatibility with a modular system over years could also slow companies from trying to push forward with more inventive, futuristic designs. It’s hard to look at something like the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and see how there’d be an easy way to swap out its components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbVmXA"&gt;But in 10 years, maybe the mobile industry will have evolved to a point where modular phones make a comeback. That, or the right to repair initiative could win so big that companies will make it so much easier to repair our gadgets that it almost feels like they’re modular. We can dream, right? –Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Bi61Bf"&gt;Smart glasses&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="iHmNjZ"&gt;The most tempting prediction to make is that in 10 years’ time, the handheld smartphone as we know it will be replaced — or at least relegated to our pockets more often than not — by smart eyeglasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKpYf8"&gt;We’re already on the path, though early attempts like Google Glass were too rudimentary, creepy, and strange-looking. More recent tries from companies like Focal still depend on the phone for too much of their functionality. Meta, the newly rebranded company behind Facebook, is continuing to explore the concept, and Apple’s oft-rumored mixed reality glasses remain in development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="phwHeW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The main obstacle is being able to shrink all the necessary technology down into a pair that normal people would want to wear&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PUJBCM"&gt;But it doesn’t take much to imagine a sleek future pair of fully independent smart glasses with lenses that double as private displays for things like our notifications, real-time AR directions, and video streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUDbQn"&gt;The main obstacle between existing and more capable smart glasses is being able to shrink all the necessary technology down into a pair that normal people would want to wear in public. Display technology also isn’t quite where it needs to be just yet. Some past smart glasses have projected their UI onto the lens glass, but that’s where things get bulky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQfEDH"&gt;The other fundamental challenge is coming up with an interface that makes sense and feels like the right fit between your eyes and the outside world. Eye tracking would have to play some part in that. Think of how often you check your phone throughout the day. No one would want to be constantly futzing with swipe and tap gestures on their glasses that frequently. Voice dictation also needs to evolve beyond its current performance on mobile devices if we’re going to be comfortable leaving our foldable phones or slabs at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtDR8F"&gt;Even if this is all figured out, the tried and true smartphone won’t be history in 10 years — productivity and other tasks simply lend themselves better to a device with a screen and keyboard.  –Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YGtT7L"&gt;Ambient computing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="q3kBcs"&gt;In the most sci-fi-fueled visions of the next 10 years, a phone isn’t something we carry around with us — it’s everywhere. Every room in your home has a smart speaker, a screen, a lamp, and who knows what, that’s connected to the network and ready to do whatever you would have asked of your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkZoBO"&gt;Outside of the home is more of the same. We don’t carry a personal device with us — it’s in our cars, at our bus stops, in every public trashcan and streetlight. Rather than face the onerous task of taking a phone out of your pocket, unlocking it, opening the right app, and typing words on its little screen, the world around us will simply be equipped to do the tedious stuff for us. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="509FI2"&gt;Need to send a message to your mom asking how she’s feeling after her bionic limb replacement? Your bathroom mirror was two steps ahead of you and sent the message this morning. Running into the store for last-minute dinner ingredients? Your shopping cart already talked to your refrigerator and knows what you need to buy, which aisle it’s on, and how to pay for it all once you’re done. We’ll outsource the personal bits from personal computing, freed from the confines of little glowing screens and just moving through the world like Sims. It’ll be great. Or awful! Probably awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q89t9K"&gt;There are very obvious and serious ethical problems with this scenario. Equipping the world around us to anticipate and solve our needs requires us to surrender an incredible amount of information about ourselves. And what happens when the almighty algorithm decides that we’re acting suspiciously by analyzing our sleep patterns, purchases, and oral hygiene habits? Just take a look through the last 70 years of sci-fi movies and literature if you want to know how &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; works out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MbIKP4"&gt;Maybe a fully ambient computing life isn’t in our future, but it’s not a stretch to imagine that aspects of this vision could come to life. –Allison&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor 50 review: lose a Huawei, gain a Google</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Google’s software makes the Honor 50 a contender rather than competitive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="kUBDaT"&gt;It’s rare that you need to get into geopolitics at the outset of a smartphone review, but it’s impossible to avoid with the Honor 50. It’s the first Honor-branded device to release outside of China since the brand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;spun out from parent company Huawei last year&lt;/a&gt;. It means that despite Huawei’s continued presence on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;USA’s entity list&lt;/a&gt;, Honor is now able to include Google’s apps and services on a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bho8iK"&gt;Having access to these services, which include critical parts of the Android ecosystem like Google Play in addition to apps like Google Maps and YouTube, means that the Honor 50 is the first Honor phone in years to actually have a shot at being a viable purchase for customers outside of China. Its midrange starting price of €529 (about $616) doesn’t hurt, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVw4Hm"&gt;But while leaving its former parent company has opened a Google-shaped window for Honor, it’s also closed a Huawei-shaped door. Honor is now on its own, without the backing of one of the most well-resourced technology companies in the world. As a result, while not a bad phone, the Honor 50 ends up not feeling competitive with other handsets in its price range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MhIbgR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10834487"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7L1usZ"&gt;The Honor 50 starts at €529 (around $616) for 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, which is the version I’ve been using, but stepping up to €599 (about $698) gets you 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Regardless of which option you go for, you get the same Snapdragon 778G processor and a 4,300mAh battery that can be fast charged at up to 66W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NC0vPA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You get the choice of 6 or 8GB of RAM&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NjxZsU"&gt;Honor’s phones have always been available with loud designs, and the Honor 50 is no different. My model came in a shiny white colorway, with the letters “HONOR” tiled across its back, and there’s also a garish sparkly silver color option available alongside more conventional black and green options. While I don’t love the color options, I think Honor deserves credit for its approach to the dual-ring camera bump on the Honor 50, which is a lot more interesting than the generic rectangles found on the backs of most devices (Huawei’s Nova 9 uses a very similar design, which Honor says is because the design was developed before the split).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVMwc7"&gt;Around front, the Honor 50 has a 6.57-inch 1080p OLED display, with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a small centrally orientated hole-punch notch for the phone’s 32-megapixel selfie camera, which moderately curves around the left and right edges of the phone. I can’t fault the screen’s rich blacks or vibrant colors, and the under-display fingerprint sensor is fast and responsive. If you don’t like curved displays, then you won’t like the Honor 50’s, but at least the phone doesn’t suffer from any palm-rejection issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t82WZd3sISbJxPFlNaKC4jF-PuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963228/jporter_211025_4826_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A curved screen might not be to everyone’s tastes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d-r-IsZluIIa_rXonBd_Y9D03Ss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963226/jporter_211025_4826_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I like the camera bump more than the color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y7l4aF"&gt;The Honor 50’s screen has a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes it feel fast to use and smooth to look at, and the Snapdragon 778G processor happily keeps up, even while the screen quickly scrolling through visually intensive apps like Twitter. I had no problems with performance during my time with the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TjJhn1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no IP-rating and no wireless charging&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TggGOl"&gt;The rest of the specs are more basic. There’s no IP rating for dust and water resistance and no wireless charging, and when it comes to audio, the phone outputs sound from a basic downward-firing speaker. It’s loud enough for listening around the house, but you’ll be reaching for a pair of headphones in noisier environments. Honor includes a pair of USB-C headphones in the box, which is fairly unusual these days, and almost makes up for the lack of a headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulJlYu"&gt;Honor’s Magic UI software, which runs atop of Android 11 on the Honor 50, is broadly inoffensive. However, it has its annoyances and, by default, is set up in a way that I think most people are going to want to tweak. For starters, it uses Microsoft’s SwiftKey rather than Google’s Gboard keyboard that I think most Android users will be more familiar with. There are also a ton of stock Honor apps that I disabled in my first couple of days with the phone, and I don’t love the way Honor’s software defaults to eschewing Android’s typical app drawer for an iOS-like homescreen. It’s easy enough to rectify with some tweaks, but it feels a little cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eq6YfkE9SHvOAV1u0qIM91qD_Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963224/jporter_211025_4826_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone has four rear cameras in its camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tsf43s"&gt;I had no complaints with the battery life of the Honor 50, averaging a little over seven hours of screen on time between charges. I never had to put the phone on to charge at the end of the day with less than 40 percent charge remaining. The Honor 50 supports 66W fast charging via an included charger that’s branded as Honor’s own “SuperCharge” charging standard, which isn’t compatible with third-party chargers. Honor claims the included charger can get the phone from 0 to 100 percent charge in 45 minutes (unfortunately, my review sample came with an EU plug, so I was unable to verify this claim myself). But a full charge in under an hour is nothing to be sniffed at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S043nr"&gt;The headline camera specs of the Honor 50 appear to be impressive at first glance, but the devil’s in the detail. Yes, it’s a 108-megapixel quad-camera array, but there’s no telephoto camera, and beyond the main sensor, the three additional cameras are a comparatively low-resolution 8-megapixel ultra-wide angle, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e5rzBK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10834528"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AH69Sq"&gt;Things don’t get off to a great start with the Honor 50’s main camera. Even in daylight, there can be a distinct lack of detail in its shots, like in the shot of the black cat above, where there’s very little definition or texture in its fur. Colors are vibrant at the risk of being a little oversaturated, and faces come out looking a little too bright and textureless. White balance is at least pretty natural, and I think selfies come out generally looking OK, helped by the fact that there’s an easily accessible shortcut to turn on background blurring and a beauty mode slider (if that’s a feature you’re interested in). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caOsnn"&gt;Low light performance leaves a lot to be desired, where the Honor 50 produces shots that are dark and muddy. But the bigger problem is that the phone takes way too long to take photographs in low light. When trying to take a shot of a group of people at a party, the Honor 50 refused to take a photo for several agonizing moments, which is far longer than people at a party are willing to wait to have their photo taken for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVLEUhGmjx-P5x--gjLjWPl3NmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963229/jporter_211025_4826_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C and bottom-firing speaker, but no headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/648NqA0oDE6Rqeo032kNax-Cqm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963225/jporter_211025_4826_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 120Hz display is hard to fault.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9VgiQb"&gt;At its starting price, the Honor 50 is a comfortably midrange device. But there are a lot of accomplished smartphones available at similar prices. Phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt; (€499 for its step-up 12GB RAM / 256GB storage model) or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt; (€539 for its 128GB storage variant) are both excellent phones that offer a much more rounded experience than the Honor 50. And if you’re considering the Honor 50 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, then you’re just €50 away from the recently announced Pixel 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFEUIv"&gt;It’s a crowded part of the market, and simply having access to Google’s apps and services isn’t enough to make an impact. Honor’s software can feel bloated, and its camera is sluggish and lacking in detail. Speedy 66W fast charging and a slick 120Hz display aren’t enough to distract from the fact that the Honor 50 has some weak spots when compared against the best midrange handsets available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="jX6wqK"&gt;Honor might be a viable purchase now that it can once again include Google’s apps and services on its devices. But it has more work to do if it wants to be truly competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="VegvPD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10834541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Cricket Wireless removes speed caps from several plans and offers 5G to everyone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SPAIN-TELECOM-WMC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lfQs7GcvbqyYi3yy4Rxla4kgcNQ=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062348/1233713968.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JOSEP LAGO/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uzij4E"&gt;Cricket Wireless suddenly has several more options if you’re looking for access to 5G on a prepaid wireless plan. That’s because starting today, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fthe-cricket-connection%2Fsubscriber-milestone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it will offer nationwide 5G access across all of its plans&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397001/cricket-wireless-5g-samsung-att"&gt;launched a year ago with support for only one device&lt;/a&gt; and only on its more expensive unlimited plans. Cricket Wireless also revealed it’s added 2 million customers in the last two years and is now serving some 12.4 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzFH24"&gt;The other big change for Cricket Wireless is removing an 8Mbps speed cap on its cheaper $30, $40, and $55 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fcell-phone-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt;. How much bandwidth Cricket Wireless can reliably provide — using AT&amp;amp;T’s network — after the caps go away is something we’ll only find out as people try it out. Reading the fine print at the bottom of the announcement points us to Cricket’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fmap.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;coverage map&lt;/a&gt;, as well as lists of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fsupport%2Fgreat-big-network%2F5g-compatible-phones.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;compatible 5G devices&lt;/a&gt;. It also points out that the $55 per month plan still carries a stipulation that “Cricket may temporarily slow data speeds if the network is busy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnyUSw"&gt;Of course, the benefits customers see from 5G, no matter which wireless carriers they use, have been pretty disappointing so far. With the changes, now you can potentially get 5G access for as little as $25 per month, per line, on a plan with four phone lines. And with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s plan to expand the reach of its mid-band 5G connections over the next couple of years&lt;/a&gt;, even if things aren’t significantly faster for you right now, that could change.&lt;/p&gt;
