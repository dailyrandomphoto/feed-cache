    <title>Qualcomm is updating its Snapdragon branding to try and simplify its chip names</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRRIycVMvXNE5EBFFqLOL92m2h0=/44x0:644x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70178166/eye_688.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Qualcomm’s teaser for its new branding scheme | Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dwFiJC"&gt;Qualcomm has &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2021/11/22/welcome-new-era-snapdragon"&gt;announced some key changes&lt;/a&gt; to how it brands its Snapdragon chips, including a shift away from the three-digit numbering system it’s been using to differentiate between its products for years. The news comes ahead of the company’s expected next-gen flagship chip debut at the Snapdragon Tech Summit on November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pWRjX"&gt;To start, Snapdragon will now exist as a standalone brand, separate from the “Qualcomm” brand (which won’t be showing up as much on its chips). It’s a direction the company has started moving in earlier this year (the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550723/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-cpu-ai-performance-mwc-2021"&gt;Snapdragon 888 Plus badge&lt;/a&gt;, for example, notably lacked the word “Qualcomm”), but today’s news solidifies that plan going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-4_slc_dklqiNlCeBUSKf8UNpVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23034691/Screen_Shot_2021_11_22_at_11.46.46_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The already “Qualcomm”-less Snapdragon 888 Plus icon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HDVufZ"&gt;But the biggest change might be in how the company handles actually naming its semiconductor products. For years, Qualcomm has labeled its chips with three-digit names, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Snapdragon 480&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995714/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-chip-affordable-5g-phones-processor-low-price"&gt;Snapdragon 765&lt;/a&gt;, or Snapdragon 888. The first number broadly informed customers how powerful the chip was (with the 8-series chips serving as flagships, while 4-series models were for entry-level products). The second number typically indicated annual generational releases (going from a Snapdragon 865 to an 875), while changes in the third number generally showed more minor updates (like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995714/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-chip-affordable-5g-phones-processor-low-price"&gt;Snapdragon 765G&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/11/21252114/qualcomm-snapdragon-768g-5g-processor-765g-improvements-cpu-gpu-update"&gt;Snapdragon 768G&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0SHGj2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Qualcomm was running out of numbers to use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="idLfJk"&gt;The problem, though, is that in addition to being slightly jargony and confusing to keep track of, Qualcomm is also simply running out of numbers in its naming scheme. The 8-series lineup hit Snapdragon 888 last year, the 7-series is already at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350079/qualcomm-snapdragon-780g-888-5g-mobile-chipset-phone-android"&gt;Snapdragon 780&lt;/a&gt;, and the 6-series is already on the brink with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22740748/qualcomm-snapdragon-695-778-plus-480-680-5g-4g-smartphone-chips"&gt;Snapdragon 695&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyucHw"&gt;Going forward, though, Qualcomm says that it’ll be shifting to “a single-digit series and generation number, aligning with other product categories,” starting with the upcoming announcement of its next 8-series flagship (which had previously been expected to be called the Snapdragon 898, based on Qualcomm’s old pattern). Qualcomm already uses a generational naming scheme for its Snapdragon PC processors, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020"&gt;Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451392/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-arm-processor"&gt;Snapdragon 7c Gen 2&lt;/a&gt;, too, so the change isn’t coming out of nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QPaqkX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lx6qXW9FP18?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YumLEV"&gt;Unfortunately, Qualcomm isn’t actually &lt;em&gt;saying&lt;/em&gt; what that new branding scheme will be, although that announcement is expected to come at the Snapdragon Tech Summit next week. Instead, the company has published a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx6qXW9FP18"&gt;vague hype reel&lt;/a&gt; that features the number eight a lot to tease out the new, top-secret naming scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nP3NLL"&gt;In addition to the as-yet-unrevealed naming scheme, Qualcomm also announced a few other details about its Snapdragon branding plan. Going forward, the company plans to emphasize the use of gold to indicate top-tier flagship products. It’s going to stop explicitly calling out 5G on chips, noting that “5G has become ubiquitous” across its product lineup and will be “a given.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MediaTek’s new Dimensity 9000 flagship could compete with Qualcomm’s top-tier Snapdragon chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4slEI1ao4vAnpgNt-xQBvC0A7xI=/121x0:1654x1022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70162443/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_5.12.45_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="goAfye"&gt;MediaTek has just announced its latest flagship processor: the Dimensity 9000, the company’s most powerful chip ever that looks like it should be able to go head to head with the best chips that more popular competitors like Qualcomm and Samsung offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZACaL"&gt;Where previous top-tier Dimensity chips (like last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartphones/dimensity-1000-series"&gt;Dimensity 1000)&lt;/a&gt; were still less powerful than contemporaries like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 or Samsung’s Exynos 2100, the new Dimensity 9000 is coming out of the gate to make a case for 2022 Android flagships. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hd9pC8mvi0gT5J0qduWPN2LjCsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025826/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_5.14.00_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7kU3pO"&gt;The new Dimensity 9000 is the first mobile chip to be built on TSMC’s 4nm process, in addition to using Arm’s new v9 architecture. It’s also the first announcement CPU to use Arm’s new core designs: a single Cortex-X2 performance core clocked at 3.05GHz, three Cortex-A710 cores at 2.85GHz, and four Cortex-A510 efficiency cores at 1.8GHz. The GPU, meanwhile, is a 10-core Arm Mali-G710, along with MediaTek’s fifth-generation APU with six total cores for AI processing (which the company says offers four times the performance and power efficiency compared to its previous generation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sldTPx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first 4nm smartphone processor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4IHP3V"&gt;The new 18-bit Imagiq Gen 7 ISP claims to be the world’s first chip to be capable of capturing a 320-megapixel image (assuming your phone has a sensor that can shoot at that level), capable of transferring data at 9 gigapixels per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SL4KM"&gt;As one might expect for a modern smartphone chip, the Dimensity 9000 offers an onboard 5G modem with support for the 3GPP’s Release 16 specification. Notably, though, the new chip still lags behind competitors by only offering built-in sub-6GHz 5G support, without the faster mmWave standard. The Dimensity 9000 does claim to be the first smartphone to support Bluetooth 5.3 and will work with Wi-Fi 6E, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hz0lq3"&gt;It’s likely that MediaTek won’t be alone for long when it comes to using the latest Arm technologies — Qualcomm, for example, is widely expected to announce a successor to its Snapdragon 888 chipset at its annual Snapdragon Tech Summit on November 30th. But even if MediaTek finds that the Dimensity 9000 is merely in the same weight class as whatever Qualcomm announces this year, instead of a leap ahead, that’s a big win for MediaTek, which has largely lagged behind until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSRCZ1"&gt;MediaTek has long been an also-ran when it comes to major Android devices, but the Dimensity 9000 shows that it’s finally looking to really compete. The question now is whether phone manufacturers are ready to join it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will finally let you preorder the new 23W Pixel Stand for $79</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel Stand wireless charger." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6oYkGhRyRFps8PrUOzgjqc3YJoI=/282x0:1361x719/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159858/pixelstand2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Pixel Stand wireless charger.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aeAeDq"&gt;Despite more than a few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735046/google-pixel6-store-r013-r008-error-preorder-buy"&gt;issues with the preorder process&lt;/a&gt; and shipping, Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro have made their way into the world, and now the company is ready to sell an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22732918/google-pixel-stand-23w-wireless-charging%5D"&gt;upgraded version of its Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt; for wireless charging on your desk or side table. &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen"&gt;This new stand costs $79&lt;/a&gt;, just like the first-gen model did when it launched in 2018 with the Pixel 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qalBMB"&gt;Like the original, it automatically adjusts the phone’s UI for docked use to pull up photo frames or shortcuts to your Nest Security cameras and can switch into do not disturb mode at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAt7Yn"&gt;However, this time around, Google is trying to justify that relatively high price by offering faster charging. The new Pixel Stand can charge compatible phones at up to 23 watts, which, coincidentally, is the fastest rate you can get with the Pixel 6 Pro, while the Pixel 6 tops out at around 21 watts. That’s a bit disappointing when plugged into a 30W charger but gets more acceptable with the convenience of wireless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Plxw1e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google explains the tradeoffs that led to Pixel 6’s slow charging complaints ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788960/pixel-6-pro-charging-speeds-30w-21w-23w-slow-charge-battery-life"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wJoLgu"&gt;How does that compare to the newest iPhone 13 models? The fastest charging available falls short of the iPhone 13 Pro Max that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700491/iphone-13-pro-max-faster-charge-times-27w-charging-brick"&gt;capable of 27W when plugged directly into a powerful enough charger&lt;/a&gt;. But for wireless charging, Apple’s fastest &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211829"&gt;MagSafe standard peaks at 15 watts&lt;/a&gt; on most of its new phones and 12 watts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691602/iphone-13-mini-slower-magsafe-charging-speeds-12w"&gt;on the iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nfXBI4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Meet the second-gen Pixel Stand from Google.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a superfast wireless charger with up to 23W of power. It works with compatible Pixel phones, Pixel Buds, and Qi-certified mobile devices.*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more at the Google Store: &lt;a href="https://t.co/mHKgynxEEY"&gt;https://t.co/mHKgynxEEY&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/RisoqJzIKw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RisoqJzIKw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Made By Google (@madebygoogle) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1461335150856388608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x2UI8w"&gt;As promised, the new Pixel Stand has a fan inside that Google says is quiet enough to keep things cool even if you’re charging while taking a long video call, a 30W PD 3.0 USB-C power adapter, and it can charge non-Pixel Qi-certified devices at up to 15W. The 30W charger and cable alone cost $35, but you won’t get faster charging whether you’re plugged in or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lnihwo"&gt;Orders for the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen"&gt;new 23W Pixel Stand on the Google Store are open now&lt;/a&gt;, with shipping dates predicted for early- to mid-December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SZ6B4"&gt;If you like the design and the software tweaks but don’t need the speed, the original Stand is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgoogle-pixel-stand-fast-wireless-charger-6&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22788072%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-stand-wireless-charging-fast-23w-qi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available on Woot for $28.99&lt;/a&gt;. While that’s a deep discount from the original price, and it comes with an 18W power adapter in the box, it’s still $5 to $10 more than similar wireless chargers that may work just as well, like Belkin’s 10W stand for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086KZWRDB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$24.99&lt;/a&gt; or Anker’s PowerWave Stand that doesn’t come with a power adapter but is on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBXZZN3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$19.49&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GaPyc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2:50PM ET):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified charging speed vs. iPhone Pro Max 13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Moto G Power offers a 50-megapixel camera and three days of battery life for $199</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JhpbTvC4yBbwcmF0XOk-AdIa9kw=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159667/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Luu2qu"&gt;Motorola has announced the latest version of its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fblog%2Fpost%3Fid%3D380&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22789061%2Fmoto-g-power-2022-model-specs-release-date-battery-life-motorola" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;budget Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; smartphone, which keeps the $199.99 starting price point and three-day battery life, but with additional camera, display, and spec improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZprSy"&gt;The new Moto G Power (which I’m referring to as the 2022 model for sanity’s sake, especially considering that it’ll be out sometime in “the coming months”) has a lot in common with the company’s previous model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The new model looks to improve on most aspects of the device in one way or another, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTyl0M"&gt;The screen is now slightly smaller, at 6.5 inches instead of 6.6 inches, but adds a faster 90Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling. RAM has been bumped up from 3GB to 4GB, and the two storage tiers have been doubled to 64GB and 128GB for $199.99 and $249.99, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/azDOML46taGxD_nFLQ67jJ3HC0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024340/moto_g_power_Dark_Grove.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3bDAlh"&gt;Motorola has also slotted in a new processor, switching away from the Snapdragon 662 processor in last year’s model to a MediaTek Helio G37, which should provide better performance and power efficiency. The star of the spec sheet, however, is still the massive 5,000mAh battery which, while still the same size as last year, also makes the same promise of three days of use off a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrXst8"&gt;Lastly, there’s the new camera system, which has a new 50-megapixel main sensor, a 2-megapixel macro camera, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor on the back for adding blurred bokeh effects to shots. There’s also an 8-megapixel front facing camera (which has been centered again) with a new “Dual Capture” feature that lets you shoot with both the front and rear cameras at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dm9g3v"&gt;Motorola isn’t announcing specific release information for the new Moto G Power at this time. We do know that it’ll be coming first to Republic Wireless and Metro by T-Mobile sometime “in the coming months,” before becoming more broadly available at Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, Google Fi, Boost, Xfinity Mobile, US Cellular, and Cricket. It’ll also be sold unlocked at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola’s website sometime in “early 2022.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For casual users, this $160 4G phone is good enough&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PfY8IN"&gt;The Moto G Pure is the rare $160 phone that works well enough that you forget you’re using a sub-$200 device. Yes, Motorola made some compromises to deliver a phone at this low price point, but it still nails all the basics that you should care about: good build quality, good battery life, and good cameras for the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik6WHn"&gt;That is not to say the Moto phone is perfect. Its processor is just a second slower in most tasks, it only works on 4G networks, and its paltry 32GB of internal storage is just not enough space to use for long. But for its price, it’s hard to argue against the Moto G Pure — it gets a lot right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VDmDAF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10871077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7hQaep"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DI4Ddk"&gt;For a big phone with a 6.5-inch screen, the Moto G Pure feels relatively compact, measuring 0.34-inch thick and weighing 0.41lbs. Thanks to its rounded corners and sloped edges, the G Pure is comfortable to hold for long stretches, though it’s a bit tall (the screen has a 20:9 aspect ratio) to use single-handed for my small hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OM443k"&gt;Available in deep indigo, the G Pure has a subtle sheen to its textured, matte back cover. Its plastic material is very hard and slippery, despite that texture. In fact, I’ve lost count of the number of times the phone has magically slipped off an ottoman or table and still works. Yes, this $160 Moto phone is quite durable, but I wouldn’t test the smartphone gods — you’ll still be better off with a case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DncdMx"&gt;It has a snappy fingerprint sensor under the Motorola logo, as well as Face Unlock to give you a hands-free option to unlock your phone. I like that the Moto software gives you more control over how this works. You can use your face to unlock the phone (no need to press the power button first), and ask the phone to bring you to the last app or webpage that was opened (rather than the lockscreen). With good lighting, Face Unlock works well enough, but the fingerprint sensor is faster and more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Motorola Moto G Pure" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W2NRUxvZ044iPffFsdlFOZ-z8VM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956983/gsin_190203_4806_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a big phone with a 6.5-inch screen, the Moto G Pure feels relatively compact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CuYpZV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware &amp;amp; Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Md2AB3"&gt;As part of the cost cutting to hit the G Pure’s low price, Motorola decided to use a weak processor and minimal RAM, and it shows. At the heart of the Moto phone is the MediaTek Helio G25 processor, which is &lt;a href="https://www.giznext.com/chipset-compare/qualcomm-snapdragon-439-vs-mediatek-helio-g25"&gt;comparable to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 439&lt;/a&gt; but actually lags behind that 2018 Snapdragon chipset. Everything from opening a website, switching between apps, to opening the camera app to take a photo just takes an extra second on the Moto phone. While this doesn’t sound like much, those extra seconds really add up over the course of a day and can make you question your sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvxvTM"&gt;It has just 3GB of RAM to support its under-powered processor and a meager 32GB of internal storage. At this point, 32GB is simply not enough capacity for a phone, especially when most people are hanging onto their phones for longer. After just two weeks of light use — installing updates and a few apps, plus taking some photos — I’ve already burned through 18.04GB (56 percent of storage) on the G Pure. With Motorola promising one OS update and two years of security updates, you’ll likely run out of space before you run out of software support. Good thing it has a microSD card slot, where you can expand its limited capacity with up to a 512GB card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto G Pure’s fingerprint sensor and side buttons." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mLvv2alnMT6GmDuVEDNdMV3fEfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956981/gsin_190203_4806_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Motorola logo is the Moto G Pure’s fingerprint sensor for securing your phone against intruders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkHLGK"&gt;The G Pure’s 6.5-inch LCD screen may look vibrant with its brightness set to 100 percent, but it is only a 720p display, with a low 269 pixel density. At 1600 x 720p resolution, &lt;em&gt;The Spider-Man: No Way Home Trailer&lt;/em&gt; looks more pixelated and dim on the Moto than on the OnePlus 9’s 2K display. Day to day, you probably wouldn’t notice just how low-res the display is, but if you have any higher-quality screens in your life, it will stand out and not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlHPgF"&gt;I played some &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt; to stress test it, and performance was better than I expected, at least once I was able to launch the game fully. It took three tries and multiple force quits on it before I could actually play. Once the game finally loaded, I was able to move my pokemon around the battlefield without lag, with the battle music blaring from the lone speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qch758"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s hard to deny that the Moto G Pure will be good enough for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ISV0DW"&gt;Using only 4G service to test the G Pure’s 4,000mAh battery, I spent the day toggling between two email accounts, sharing content on Twitter and Hangouts, and playing some &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt;. The G Pure stayed cool to the touch no matter how much I was stressing it. Although the battery didn’t quite live up to the two days of use claim from Motorola, I got about 16 hours out of it (or about seven hours of screentime) before needing to hit the charger. Don’t expect a fast charge, though: It took me about two hours to recharge this battery with the included 10W charging brick. In all, the battery should last you a full day at minimum, or maybe as long as two days for a light user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto G Pure dual camera system closeup." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VaoTg8icuZpo5S9iQOv6bht5kBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956982/gsin_190203_4806_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure kept it simple with a rear, dual-camera system, rather than add a sub-par ultrawide or macro camera onto the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r3rGf7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="BMQtq0"&gt;For a $160 phone, the cameras on the Moto G Pure are better than expected, especially for photos that you’ll likely only share online. Rather than squeeze another lackluster ultrawide or macro camera onto the back, Motorola made a smart decision to keep it simple with just a rear dual-camera system — a 13-megapixel main camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor — plus a 5-megapixel front-facing camera (f/2.4) for selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7rMJcS"&gt;The 13-megapixel main camera with f/2.2 aperture was surprisingly capable at capturing details in low-light situations. At a recent indoor event with tricky lighting, it had no problems focusing with various light sources in dark rooms, and it managed to photograph small details in the art installations. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dfXCY6jPNW5r6UjmjnZ8cazmtg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022110/IMG_20211022_222531879_MP_1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moto G Pure camera test image: the main camera is able to capture fine details even in low light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dt1zjg"&gt;Like other smartphone cameras in this class, color accuracy seems to be an issue with the G Pure. Most photos look fine, but there are a few issues, like the pumpkins that look too red with stems that look too blue to be realistic. Likewise, the yellow door should look more orange, and the blue door should look more teal (with more green) than blue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWULVm9mnhfqf8fsESdpz8TbjOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021849/IMG_20211016_163007674_1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moto G Pure camera test image: the two doors’ colors are not true to life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3XpYO"&gt;My biggest gripe with the G Pure’s camera is its slider interface for zooming. Unlike other camera apps where you can tap to select the most optimal digital zoom presets, Moto’s zoom slider doesn’t automatically appear in the app. In addition, your hand will probably block your screen as you try to frame your shot and navigate the slider bar at the same time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zCoupo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10870825"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BII4oi"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the Moto Pure G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto G Pure’s camera app UI." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0StNfiklM-I1IDQqHb5VdPxkTNE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956986/gsin_190209_4806_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure’s zoom slider bar is not as easy to use as other phones’ camera app UI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3355Ti"&gt;
&lt;p id="BCUmNa"&gt;At $160 — or less if you catch a sale or carrier deal, as this phone works on many 4G networks in America — it’s hard to deny that the Moto G Pure will be good enough for most people looking for a basic budget phone for under $200. After all, it has an all-day battery, a versatile main camera, all in a well-designed, durable package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDQZ0q"&gt;It’s a shame it doesn’t have a faster processor, more RAM, or more onboard storage, which would make it a clear winner. I’d rather Motorola charge a slightly higher price like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;$190 TCL 20SE&lt;/a&gt;, which offers 128GB of internal storage, has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 processor, and is supported by 4GB of RAM. At least you wouldn’t have to constantly worry about backing up the files from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pmtp8a"&gt;But these issues might not be deal-breakers for more casual users or those with a strict budget. Not many great phones are available at this price point, and the Moto G Pure is quite the catch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boost Mobile’s new plan offers $100 for one year of service, includes 1GB of data per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Boost Mobile’s new logo under Dish Network." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ib4DIJ1lCUZOjL7VpQ4haHd5r7Y=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158723/boost_dish.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boost Mobile is introducing a full year of service for just $100.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dish&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zZjSX9"&gt;Now that Boost Mobile will be on the AT&amp;amp;T network, after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;owner Dish signed with AT&amp;amp;T back in July 2021&lt;/a&gt;, the MVNO is changing things up with its service plans. Today, Boost is announcing the first of many so-called “Carrier Crusher” plans it will be rolling out this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5Y8xP"&gt;If you’re paying for your unlimited cellular service plan but have been living on a Wi-Fi connection since 2020, Boost Mobile is offering an interesting proposition for new and existing customers. You can get 12 months of unlimited talk and text, plus 1GB of 4G or 5G data per month, for just $100 for the year (plus tax) from Boost. This works out to $8.33 per month (again plus tax), considerably less than even the lowest cost prepaid plans. Both current and new customers who have an active Boost phone, and can commit to using Boost for a year, will be eligible for these new plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Et0yd8"&gt;Once you reach your data cap, your speed will be throttled, but you can always &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boostmobile.com%2Fsupport%2Ffaq%2Fplans-services%2Fdata-pack-add-on.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22788074%2Fboost-mobile-new-plan-1gb-data-100-4g-5g-carrier" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy more Data Packs&lt;/a&gt; in the amount you need. They can be added to your plan on a as-needed basis (you have 30 days to use it up), or automatically added to your plan every month until you cancel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7JgOfr"&gt;$5 for 1GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SKXpJR"&gt;$10 for 2GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JuPra0"&gt;$15 for 5GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7st1u0"&gt;$30 for 10GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="tTzXzd"&gt;Alternatively, if 1GB of data is not enough, and you don’t want to bother paying per gigabyte of data, then a $240 per year plan ($20 per month plus tax) with unlimited talk and text and 15GB of data per month, is also available. This way, you won’t have to worry about getting throttled anytime you watch a few 4K movie trailers by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YMtVd"&gt;For those who prefer to pay for your cellular service each month rather than make one lump sum payment once a year, Boost Mobile is introducing two additional new plans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="D3Njvr"&gt;$25 per month with unlimited talk and text, with 5GB of high-speed data per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TpEqxG"&gt;$15 per month with unlimited talk and text, with 2GB of high-speed data per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UxzVXv"&gt;With the ongoing pandemic and many of us still working from home, you might be using more Wi-Fi than cellular data these days. If you’re within Boost Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T’s coverage area and not currently tied to a plan, you might want to look at pre-paid services that might better suit your current mobile needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTvkyC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says it’s improving fingerprint scanner performance with a Pixel 6 update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uN_XFSCdx54aHN63T8GT35iSso4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156269/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qnscZx"&gt;Google quietly rolled out a Pixel 6 update that addresses fingerprint scanner issues, as first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pixel-6-november-update-fingerprint-bug-fixed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The update details have been confirmed in a post on a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/135866170/november-software-update-for-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-us-and-japan-only-selected-carriers"&gt;Google Support page,&lt;/a&gt; which vaguely notes that it includes “minor bug fixes and some fingerprint sensor performance improvements for Pixel 6 and 6 Pro,” without really giving us any details about how the sensor was improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9NzPW"&gt;Dan Siefert called out the fingerprint reader in our reviews of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro last month&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it’s often finicky to use or slow to recognize your print. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768853/google-explains-pixel-6-fingerprint-scanner-unreliable"&gt;Google responded&lt;/a&gt; by saying that the scanner’s “enhanced security algorithms” may result in sluggish or unreliable performance. Google never really indicated whether the scanner’s performance had something to do with issues in the device’s software or hardware, and its initial response implied that the scanner was supposed to be slow for its security features to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y1ts1F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPm4ouSR_NI?rel=0&amp;amp;start=288" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LANtM2"&gt;But now that Google has rolled out an update, the issue might be software-related after all. To see if the update actually made a difference, I asked some of my colleagues at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;about their experiences with the fingerprint scanner after downloading the Pixel 6 update. Here are our findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="G6OY1P"&gt;I haven’t noticed a difference in the scanning, but it seems like it’s making me use my fingerprint less to unlock the phone. —Richard Lawler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUQj0P"&gt;I think the fingerprint reader does work better — I never had trouble with the left thumb, but the right thumb always took two or three tries, and now it seems to work pretty quickly. —Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbN0jN"&gt;It’s certainly not so much faster (or more accurate?). But even best case, it’s still slower than an S20. —Dieter Bohn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X2GE4n"&gt;Overall, the results of the Pixel 6 update are a mixed bag. It seems like it offers &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; improvement, but it still doesn’t put it on par with fingerprint scanners from other companies. Reactions from users on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qvg2nz/google_releases_surprise_pixel_6_november_update/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; offer the same kind of varied results; while &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qvg2nz/comment/hkxbxai/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;some say&lt;/a&gt; the update fixed the problem, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qvg2nz/comment/hkyc83e/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;others say&lt;/a&gt; the difference is there, but only slightly. It’s unclear whether the update to the fingerprint scanner will be the last of its kind or if Google has another one planned in the future. Then again, the issue may be related to the fact that Google decided to use an under-the-screen optical scanner instead of an ultrasonic one — and in that case, Pixel 6 owners may be stuck with the issue. For now, the sensor seems to be &lt;em&gt;just good enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baH1vl"&gt;Google says that the update — which consists of two software builds: one for Verizon-specific devices (SD1A.210817.037.A1) and one for international models (SD1A.210817.037)  — has started rolling out today and will “continue over the next week.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41vb7N"&gt;It’s also worth noting that while the update is just 14.56MB, Google says it takes about 25 to 30 minutes to download and install depending on the number of apps you have, which my colleagues can also attest to. The update will be available to you in November if your device is on any of the major wireless carriers in the US or Japan, including AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Google Fi. You can view the full list of carriers on &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/135866170/november-software-update-for-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-us-and-japan-only-selected-carriers"&gt;Google’s website&lt;/a&gt;. If your carrier isn’t listed, the update will be pushed to your device in December.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="jvIeDE"&gt;Verizon’s new Number Share Home plan gives you the ability to make and receive calls from your Echo Show, Echo Dot, and Echo using your existing phone number, as noted in a post on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-introduces-hands-free-calling-alexa-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GKqGOs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“Alexa, call Keith.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introducing Number Share - Home, a new feature that allows &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Verizon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Verizon&lt;/a&gt; customers to make and receive hands-free audio calls through their supported Amazon Alexa-enabled devices. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexa99?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@alexa99&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@amazonnews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/S3bfgHJskP"&gt;https://t.co/S3bfgHJskP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon News (@VerizonNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonNews/status/1460630466063654917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4lRA0K"&gt;The feature costs an extra $5 / month, but Verizon will waive the fee for three months if you purchase an Alexa-enabled device through them. And if you already have an Alexa device that you’d like to use, Verizon will only give you one month for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8c3e5t"&gt;Once enabled, you make hands-free calls in the same way that you’re probably already familiar with. Say, “Alexa, call [name],” or “Alexa, dial [phone number]” to make a call, and then say, “Alexa, answer,” when a call comes in. You can also use your device to contact emergency services with the “Alexa, dial 911” command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwztGG"&gt;When you place a call through your Echo device, your Verizon phone number will display on the recipient’s caller ID. Verizon also notes that you can switch between your Alexa device and a “Verizon-distributed Android mobile phone” during calls, but it remains unclear how to do so, as well as which devices that specific feature is available on. From the phrasing Verizon uses, it appears as if live call swapping excludes iPhones, as well as Androids not purchased through Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v5ooyP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon’s Number Share plan lets you make as many calls from your Echo device as your mobile plan allows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIS94u"&gt;If you’re interested in setting up the service, you can connect your Verizon number with your Alexa account by opening the Alexa app and hitting “More.” Then, select “Settings” followed by “Communication.” From here, tap “Verizon,” and then follow the steps outlined on the screen. Amazon offers more details about the service &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=23680112011"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZpLjW"&gt;Echo devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/29/16387398/amazon-echo-free-voice-calls-us-canada-mexico"&gt;already give you the ability to make free calls&lt;/a&gt; through its Alexa Communication feature, but it can be sort of limiting. While Alexa-enabled devices support unlimited phone calls to other Alexa Communication users, it only lets you call up to 10 phone numbers in the US, UK, Mexico, and Canada (excluding 911). Plus, you can’t receive incoming calls from regular phone numbers — it only supports inbound calls from other Alexa users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWm9aH"&gt;Verizon’s Number Share Home plan lets you make as many calls from your Echo device as your mobile plan allows, and it lets you receive calls from anyone. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428700/amazon-att-phone-number-calls-alexa-link-feature-smart-home-echo"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T rolled out a similar partnership with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; as an extension of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428700/amazon-att-phone-number-calls-alexa-link-feature-smart-home-echo"&gt;NumberSync program&lt;/a&gt;. This lets you make and receive calls from your AT&amp;amp;T number on Alexa-enabled devices, as well as from your iPad, Mac, and smartwatch. And unlike Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T’s NumberSync doesn’t tack an extra charge on top of your existing phone bill (aside from any data charges that you may rack up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MmiN5"&gt;Verizon offers a separate plan to share your mobile number with any non-Alexa devices, called &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/numbershare-faqs/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Number Share Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21438693/verizon-apple-watch-carrier-plan-lower-monthly-cost-price"&gt;make and receive calls from your smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18054516/palm-smartphone-lifemode-phone-numbers-verizon-message-plus"&gt;Palm device&lt;/a&gt; at an added cost of $10 / month. Combining both of Verizon’s unbundled Number Share plans means you’ll be paying an extra $15 / month, which is more than you’d be paying on AT&amp;amp;T. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Verizon about the possibility of a bundled Number Share plan in the future but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s next-gen CPU for PCs will take on Apple’s M-series chips in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/edX4v77nA3kW2EvQsAhvtIRNTd4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149215/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TLQ8zg"&gt;Qualcomm is looking to seriously beef up its PC processors, with the company announcing plans for a next-generation Arm-based SoC “designed to set the performance benchmark for Windows PCs” that would be able to go head to head with Apple’s M-series processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUUJaB"&gt;Dr. James Thompson, Qualcomm’s chief technology officer, announced the plans for the new chips at the company’s 2021 investor day event, with the goal of getting samples to hardware customers in about nine months ahead of product launches with the new chip in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P-dwsweD-t8IQVEQQbEqDEMFVUI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018587/Image_from_iOS__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PlzmE3"&gt;The new chip will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;designed by the Nuvia team&lt;/a&gt;, which Qualcomm had bought earlier this year in a massive $1.4 billion acquisition. Nuvia, notably, was founded in 2019 by a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/three-of-apple-and-googles-former-star-chip-designers-launch-nuvia-with-53m-in-series-a-funding/"&gt;trio of former Apple employees&lt;/a&gt; who had previously worked on the company’s A-series chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcd7zn"&gt;The company is making big promises, too: in addition to offering competition to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;stellar M-series chips&lt;/a&gt; (which power its latest MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops and iMac and Mac Mini desktops), Qualcomm is aiming to lead the field for “sustained performance and battery life,” too. Additionally, Qualcomm promised that it would be scaling up its Adreno GPUs, too, with the goal of offering desktop-class gaming capabilities for its future PC products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eb6seA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"New Qualcomm CEO sees former Apple execs as key to beating M1","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560967/qualcomm-apple-cristiano-amon-nuvia-laptop-processors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Z0C1X0"&gt;Qualcomm has tried to break into PC chips before, with products like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020"&gt;Snapdragon 8cx line of processors&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;partnership with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; on the Surface X’s SQ1 and SQ2 chips. But where Apple’s Arm-based chips offered a revolutionary experience of power and battery life when it launched the M1 lineup last year, Qualcomm’s PC efforts have been lackluster so far. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let’s chat about RCS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFTZFuwe0dIZFlvcOl-0Xn2lpXY=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149133/acastro_211115_4880_0002.0.gif" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oUdhTU"&gt;Every Tuesday on &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we’re pulling apart a different new tech standard that is designed to replace tech standards before it. Last week, we explored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772024/vergecast-podcast-usb-c-future"&gt;the fractious history and fraught future of USB-C&lt;/a&gt;. This week, we’re talking about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/12/18137937/rcs-rich-communication-service-messaging-explainer-what-is-google-chat"&gt;Rich Communication Services, or RCS&lt;/a&gt;. Will it replace SMS? Google is trying to make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CoDK7x"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP4498295924&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pmmytB"&gt;To really understand why Google is going all-in on RCS, you have to understand that there’s &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/7/"&gt;a rich and complicated history of messaging apps at Google&lt;/a&gt; and also RCS’s own history that’s entirely separate from Google. On the &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; RCS special, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dieter Bohn walks you through the messy past and uncertain future of the texting standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pr5g2w"&gt;Dieter also talks with Sanaz Ahari, senior director of communications products at Google, and Ron Amadeo, reviews editor at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to help explain how RCS works, why it’s dependent on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;the big three US carriers&lt;/a&gt;, what features can be added to the service in the future, and of course, whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715696/svp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;Apple will ever support it on the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZe9mT"&gt;Listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full episode of our RCS special. &lt;/p&gt;
