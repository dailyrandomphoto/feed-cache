    <title>OnePlus Nord CE 5G review: stripped down, stripped back</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Gain a headphone jack, lose some unnecessary cameras  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="EJ3x77"&gt;One year after OnePlus loudly stepped into the midrange and entry-level phone market with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;, it’s back with the OnePlus Nord CE 5G. That “CE” at the end of its name stands for “Core Edition.” OnePlus claims the new phone strips back some of its predecessor’s less necessary features to focus on offering its “core” features at a more affordable price, similar to what Samsung offers with its “FE” (fan edition) devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6Cb6R"&gt;First and foremost that means the Nord CE comes with a more affordable &lt;a href="https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/482924/1086811/12532?sharedid=VergeOnePlusNordCE5gReview062121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fuk%2Foneplus-nord-ce-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;£299&lt;/a&gt; / €329 starting price, down from £379 / €399 for last year’s phone. It keeps the 1080p 90Hz OLED display, and even adds a headphone jack, but it’s got one fewer camera on both the front and the back, and a less premium design with a plastic rear panel instead of glass. Alongside the £299 model, which gets you 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, there’s also a £369 / €399 model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. I’ve been using the 12GB version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLoKhg"&gt;Like the original Nord, the OnePlus Nord CE is only getting a release in Europe and India, while US buyers instead have the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533723/oneplus-n200-5g-price-specs-availability"&gt;Nord N200&lt;/a&gt; coming later this month. The question for all of them is whether OnePlus has stripped back one feature too many or has it found the right balance of price and performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lmEqkb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10616763"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fGclCO"&gt;Look at the Nord CE next to last year’s phone and it’s clear they’re cut from the same design cloth. Both have an edge-to-edge OLED display on the front with minimal bezels, selfie cameras in a hole-punch to the top left of their screens, and a rear camera bump that arranges their sensors into a line. Like the original Nord, there’s no official IP rating for dust and water resistance, and no wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VodIGf"&gt;Peer closer, however, and the differences become more obvious. For starters, there’s now only one selfie camera on the phone: the original Nord’s secondary ultrawide camera is gone, while the main selfie camera’s resolution has been bumped down from 32 megapixels to 16. On the back the main camera’s resolution has increased from 48 to 64 megapixels, and there’s still an 8-megapixel ultrawide, but the 5-megapixel depth and 2-megapixel macro sensors are gone, replaced with a single 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hpT64"&gt;The Nord CE is a slender device to hold. OnePlus claims this is the thinnest phone it’s made since the OnePlus 6T, and at 170g (6oz) it feels relatively light considering its 6.43-inch screen. It’s tempting to claim that heavier devices feel somehow higher quality, but I think there’s something to be said for a device that’s thin and light enough that you can forget about it when it’s sitting in your pocket. Despite its thinness, the Nord CE includes a headphone jack, which was absent on last year’s phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-OHTjlnf_R4R8ZL60fPR5LOuR6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674753/jporter_210621_4640_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus claims this is its thinnest phone since 2018’s 6T.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/btYOSU4eH0zb5wGpMUVPwhme5II=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674752/jporter_210621_4640_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It might have one fewer cameras, but otherwise the Nord CE’s design is very similar to the original Nord. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YHXo6J"&gt;The Nord CE’s battery is also technically bigger than last year’s Nord at 4,300mAh. But in my testing its battery life worked out a little worse in everyday usage. While the original Nord got upward of eight hours of screentime, the Nord CE was closer to six and a half in my experience. That was still enough to get me through a day’s use of Twitter, Slack, and WhatsApp with some battery to spare, and after a weekend of lighter usage, the phone lasted me until the middle of Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6HxI5"&gt;For charging, the OnePlus Nord CE 5G uses the Warp Charge 30T Plus fast-charging standard, so you won’t see the kinds of ultra-fast charging speeds we saw with the 65W-compatible OnePlus 8T and 9. Warp Charge 30T Plus is still fast enough to charge the Nord CE from 0 to 99 percent in an hour. In my testing it hit 32 percent after 15 minutes, 64 percent after 30, and 88 after 45. That should be fast enough for all but the most demanding of users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UntEOG"&gt;Similar to battery life, which came out slightly worse despite ostensibly having better hardware, the overall performance of the Nord CE was a little more sluggish than last year’s phone. The CE is powered by a Snapdragon 750G processor. As you might guess from its name, the new processor technically sits further down Qualcomm’s range than the 765G in last year’s phone. But because it’s a more modern chip, OnePlus claims it’s actually faster, with 20 percent better CPU performance and 10 percent better GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmERc4Aay8stUGcMFS3CeJ1YFZg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674755/jporter_210621_4640_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biometric security is handled with an in-display fingerprint sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mYnHAYx-Mcd_O5MfvwQynpBLii4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674754/jporter_210621_4640_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord CE’s camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xlNYX8"&gt;The switch has addressed one of my quibbles with the original Nord, which was that its display would hitch slightly when quickly scrolling through an app like Twitter, impacting the otherwise silky smoothness of its high refresh rate display. But the Nord CE’s performance just didn’t feel as snappy overall. Hopping between apps would occasionally cause the interface to hitch slightly or stutter as the system keyboard loaded in. That’s not an unusual tradeoff at this price (we observed similar performance with last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;, for example), but it’s worth mentioning in light of OnePlus’ claims about performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Izfsu"&gt;For the most part I think OnePlus has made some smart decisions with how to approach cameras on the Nord CE, even though, unfortunately, OnePlus’ much advertised partnership with Hasselblad with the recent OnePlus 9 hasn’t brought any benefits here. Three rear cameras is a more reasonable amount of cameras compared to the overkill of four on the original Nord. OnePlus has still allowed itself one useless rear camera on the Nord CE — a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor — but it’s easy to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WlsE3"&gt;Personally, I would have loved to see the ultrawide selfie camera return from the first Nord. It might not have been the most useful feature on an everyday basis, but it’s always great to have around when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EzBtfw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10616455"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FKLu4G"&gt;Otherwise, I generally liked the photos I got out of the Nord CE. Daytime shots are bright and vibrant, even if the phone tends to lose some detail in shadows. In particular, colors are handled accurately when it comes to landscapes, with my only complaint being a slightly over-processed look I got when photographing trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDXMdX"&gt;But it’s in the edge cases where the Nord CE’s cameras stumble. Trying to take close-up shots of flowers left the phone struggling to make things look crisp and sharp, and faces had an unnatural smoothness to them. It can also struggle with detail in low light, like in the shot above of an apartment block where many of the individual railings aren’t discernible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ip1c0lYu2ROrdrRmmiLPCb8r0nQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674751/jporter_210621_4640_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, it has a headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eaKYVx8ertnorwQrSk3xZ4tjZps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674750/jporter_210621_4640_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available colors include blue (pictured), black, and silver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kDGQwh"&gt;On paper, there shouldn’t be any competition between the OnePlus Nord CE 5G and the original OnePlus Nord. It’s the less expensive phone that still offers a high-refresh rate OLED display, 5G, plus improvements like a headphone jack, a higher resolution main camera, a bigger battery, and a faster processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1OAZD"&gt;But in practice the Nord CE just doesn’t feel as polished as the original Nord did. Its battery might be bigger, but you don’t get any more usage out of it, and its processor is technically faster but still leaves the phone hitching in heavy usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AB7stW"&gt;Those might be reasonable compromises considering the price difference, but as of this writing the original OnePlus Nord is available at a discounted £299 (about $418) price point &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OnePlus-SIM-Free-Smartphone-Camera-Warranty/dp/B08BPGX4B2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Amazon UK&lt;/a&gt;. At that price, the original Nord feels like the better option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="5X1eHz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10620114"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JESJIAZbpsRlslH85lLB92oWP7Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69496210/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fi4TH7"&gt;One of tech’s biggest problems in the past few months has been due to one of its smallest components: chips. Months into the shortage, the effects have spread far beyond the difficulty of buying an Xbox Series X or PS5. Car companies are being hit the worst, and even &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9a497f21-e3e4-4c74-8737-07cd13209475"&gt;home appliances&lt;/a&gt; might start to see issues with supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oliYeU"&gt;Earlier this year, companies expected to have supply chains sorted and products more consistently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;back on shelves by summer&lt;/a&gt; — but June is nearly over and there’s seemingly no end in sight. And with the upcoming slate of big tech releases and the holiday shopping season coming up, expect things to get worse before they get better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8jotJ"&gt;“We had thought probably six or seven months ago, like everybody else, that it would be relatively short-term.” Jahmy Hindman, chief technology officer at John Deere, commented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors"&gt;on The Verge’s &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “But I think we’re into this for the next 12 to 18 months.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bmSk8R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chips could be in short supply for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSWfIj"&gt;It’s not just tractors and trucks, though. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger voiced similar sentiment, commenting in a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-earnings-first-quarter-2021-11619043954"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; back in April that it could be two years before production is able to ramp up. “This will take a while until people can put more capacity in the ground.” And AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/chip-shortage-causes-amd-to-pivot-away-from-lower-end-pc-processors"&gt;noted at a May investor event&lt;/a&gt; that the company was being forced to prioritize its higher end chips over lower-powered parts due to shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpT1Lt"&gt;There’s two different forces at work here. For some products, there’s too much demand, which impacts the higher-end chips like the GPUs in a PlayStation 5 or an RTX 3080 graphics card. While chip shortages have undoubtedly played a part, there’s also simply more people who want to buy these products than there are enough to go around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4Jm2S"&gt;Take the PS5, for instance, which is the &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-17-ps5-the-fastest-selling-console-in-us-history"&gt;fastest selling console in US history&lt;/a&gt; despite the continued difficulty in purchasing one months after its launch. “Even if we secure a lot more devices and produce many more units of the PlayStation 5 next year, our supply wouldn’t be able to catch up with demand,” Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki said in a private analyst briefing, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/sony-warns-tight-playstation-5-supply-to-extend-into-next-year"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JoP3av"&gt;Or take GPUs, which have &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3138130/bitcoin-crackdown-sends-graphics-cards-prices-plummeting-china-after"&gt;finally started to drop in price&lt;/a&gt; over the past few weeks — not because Nvidia has magically figured out how to churn out more parts, but because demand is finally slowing down following plummeting Bitcoin prices and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aSuly"&gt;It’s in chipmakers’ interests to keep trying to churn out those parts: newer chips are more lucrative. If you’re TSMC or Samsung, it’s in your best interest to focus on making (and expanding) those production efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZ0U0H"&gt;On the flip side, though, are supply issues, particularly for older chip designs. Unlike a new iPhone or Xbox, a Ford truck or a John Deere tractor doesn’t need bleeding-edge chips using TSMC or Samsung’s 5nm process. They use older chips, which are less powerful (and less pricey) than ones using brand new technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LDuK9M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Older chips — like the ones used in cars — are being hit particularly hard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qUeMSE"&gt;The impact here is already being felt. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/chip-shortage-forces-carmakers-to-strip-out-high-tech-features?srnd=premium-europe&amp;amp;amp;sref=ctSjKj2N"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; from last month notes that carmakers are starting to skip out on offering premium features like navigation systems or extra screens in order to stretch their supply of chips further. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/18/22290362/nvidia-will-not-reduce-3060-ti-3070-3080-3090-eth-mining"&gt;Nvidia repurposed old GPUs&lt;/a&gt; into special cryptocurrency mining boards to free up more supply of newer ones for gamers. Even Apple noted that it was running into trouble getting ahold of those older chips, due to the extra competition. “Most of our issue is on licensing those legacy nodes, there are many different people not only in the same industry, but across other industries that are using legacy nodes,” Cook said in Apple’s Q2 earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLy76S"&gt;Revathi Advaithi, CEO of Flex — the world’s third largest electronics manufacturing company — noted a similar issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451309/flex-revathi-advaithi-interview-decoder-manufacturing-covid-19"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “Automotive semiconductors have been pretty outdated,” she explains, noting that automakers either have to invest in upgrading to newer technologies more on par with consumer devices, or foundries need to build out more capacity for those specific legacy chips — parts which aren’t really useful for phones or laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWVuHy"&gt;Exacerbating the issue is that on a broader scale, the semiconductor industry has become increasingly consolidated. Despite the increasing importance of computer chips in virtually every hardware product across multiple industries, the number of companies that make those chips — especially specialized chips at the high end of the market — have grown increasingly fewer in number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsR2Az"&gt;TSMC alone accounts for 92 percent of the supply of cutting-edge chips, with Samsung providing the rest, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-relies-on-one-chip-maker-in-taiwan-leaving-everyone-vulnerable-11624075400?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;according to a&lt;em&gt; Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. The company also reportedly makes about 60 percent of the chips for car manufacturers around the world. Which means that when those companies run out of capacity, there’s not a lot of other places to go to get those processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yyl6s4"&gt;That’s also why chip shortages likely won’t hit some of the biggest devices, like Apple’s next iPhone or whatever Samsung’s fall flagship ends up being, at least not as hard as they hit Ford trucks or GPUs. &lt;a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210621PD212.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digitimes&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that TSMC is already &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/22/tsmc-to-prioritize-apple-and-automaker-silicon-orders-as-global-semiconductor-shortage-continues/"&gt;prioritizing Apple’s orders&lt;/a&gt; (along with those of car manufacturers) heading into the fall. Because of the size and scale of Apple’s orders — think of how many iPhones it sells every year, all using cutting-edge chips from TSMC — it has the pull to stay at the front of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04dBvl"&gt;The bad news is that the crunch will probably get worse before it gets better. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung are all heavily investing in expanding and building new fabs. The Biden administration is also trying to help, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22457293/semiconductor-chip-shortage-funding-frontier-china-competition-act"&gt;pushing to pump billions into US semiconductor manufacturing&lt;/a&gt;. But as Intel’s CEO noted, it’ll take months, if not a few years, for those investments to mature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JkcgD"&gt;And with the holiday season fast approaching and a new wave of products from across market segments all fighting for chips, there’s almost certainly bound to be more product delays, cut corners, price jumps, and part shortages to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpfiyO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCUXRt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We regret to inform you that T-Mobile is selling a 5G-branded gin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCOhGBVo2e8RQPnT2cd8PGEkZNk=/0x160:3833x2715/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69494965/5gin_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s 5G-branded gin and ginger beer go on sale tomorrow.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FCFBBq"&gt;Whatever the reason, 5G-themed gin is now something that exists in the world, courtesy of T-Mobile. Ostensibly, “Ultra Capacity 5Gin” exists to celebrate a T-Mobile milestone: covering 300 million people with its low-band extended range 5G network and 150 million covered by its better midrange ultra capacity 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJtDl0"&gt;But maybe it just came down to the company seeing Ryan Reynolds having a good time, selling gin*, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/25/20982199/ryan-reynolds-mint-mnvo-t-mobile-ownership-deadpool-detective-pikachu"&gt;enjoying ownership of a wireless company&lt;/a&gt; and it thinking, “Let’s get in on that.” Or perhaps as the Mariners were &lt;a href="https://www.lookoutlanding.com/2021/5/18/22443250/tigers-make-justin-dunn-look-good-mariners-make-spencer-turnbull-historic"&gt;on the receiving end of yet another no-hitter&lt;/a&gt;, some marketing execs out for a night at ol’ T-Mobile Park drowned their sorrows in one too many $20 G&amp;amp;Ts and got to thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Yo9VQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With notes of pine, citrus, and unfulfilled Sprint acquisition promises&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Giq2mj"&gt;The corporate-branded gin nobody asked for is &lt;a href="https://heritagedistilling.com/"&gt;produced by Heritage Distilling&lt;/a&gt;, the Northwest’s preferred purveyor of flavored vodkas and Seahawks-themed whiskey. There’s a non-alcoholic option, too: Extended Range 5Ginger Beer, made by Jones Soda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPyy9h"&gt;If this sounds appealing and your home bar would benefit from a gin with “approachable piney notes” and a label with loud magenta branding, then you can &lt;a href="https://t-mobile5gin.com/"&gt;order a bottle for $30 starting tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;. The ginger beer also goes on sale tomorrow at $10 for a six-pack. Just do us a favor if you order some: maybe pour one out for that fourth wireless carrier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;T-Mobile was supposed to help set up&lt;/a&gt; after the Sprint merger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfunIO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Technically, Ryan Reynolds &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.diageo.com/en/news-and-media/features/diageo-to-acquire-aviation-gin-and-davos-brands/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;sold his gin company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for $610 million last August. Spiritually, he’s still kicking around as part-owner, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA continues to spend big on mobile games with $1.4 billion Playdemic acquisition </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Irn2xXyAD4JZUlFd1SuiM4zWFPI=/0x0:1520x1013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69494935/970613582.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MJtKBV"&gt;EA is adding to its roster of mobile game developers &lt;a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Electronic-Arts-Acquires-Playdemic-Makers-of-the-Highly-Successful-Golf-Clash-Mobile-Game-From-Warner-Bros.-Games-and-ATT/default.aspx"&gt;by purchasing Playdemic&lt;/a&gt;, known for &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt;, from WarnerMedia for $1.4 billion. The company says it plans on using Playdemic’s experience to help make future mobile games and that it’s interested in using &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt;’s mechanics with other franchises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJ25s3"&gt;It’s possible that EA could be purchasing Playdemic not only to gain ownership of a successful mobile game (&lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt; has over 10 million installs &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdemic.golf.android&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;on the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;), but because there’s opportunity for EA to incorporate some of its other series — &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22440408/ea-sports-pga-tour-release-date-course-list-majors"&gt;it makes the PGA golf games&lt;/a&gt; after all, which could tie in well with a mobile golf game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGbdXX"&gt;EA seems to be focusing on mobile gaming recently — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273187/ea-glu-mobile-acquisition-kim-kardashian-hollywood"&gt;also purchased mobile developer Glu&lt;/a&gt; in February for $2.1 billion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Tz28y"&gt;WarnerMedia, Playdemic’s former owner, is currently going through a transition, as it’s being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444031/warnermedia-discovery-merger-hbo-max-streaming-giant"&gt;spun out from under AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; to join with Discovery. &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/electronic_arts.html"&gt;The company says&lt;/a&gt; that it’s divesting from Playdemic as “part of [its] overall strategy to build games based on Warner Bros. storied franchises.” Indeed, if you go to &lt;a href="https://www.warnerbrosgames.com/games"&gt;Warner Bros. Games’ website&lt;/a&gt;, it’s dominated by franchises like Lego, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat (with &lt;em&gt;Scribblenauts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt; being the only real exceptions). It also has upcoming games like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340247/gotham-knights-delay-release-date-2022"&gt;DC universe-based &lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. WarnerMedia says the rest of its games will become part of the combined Warner-Discovery company after the deal is settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nHEWk"&gt;Mobile gaming has become a big focus for companies as the market has exploded. EA competitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9662214/actvision-blizzard-buys-candy-crush-king-5-9-billion"&gt;Activision purchased &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;-maker King&lt;/a&gt; for $5.9 billion in 2015, and its &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/static-files/af35383a-0db9-44de-b0b2-180eac785930"&gt;recent earnings&lt;/a&gt; show that the division is now bringing in more money than Blizzard. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22458279/valorant-mobile-spinoff-riot-games"&gt;Many popular PC and console games&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and EA’s own &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; have also gotten mobile ports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Entire London Underground to receive mobile coverage by end of 2024</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oi7tmLPQ_VhIi2tPFTYTTD-p4AA=/0x0:3508x2339/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69485133/32177.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TfL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STMn8o"&gt;By the end of 2024, passengers on the London Underground will have mobile reception across the entire network of stations and tunnels, London’s mayor Sadiq Khan &lt;a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2021/june/mayor-fulfils-commitment-and-confirms-high-speed-mobile-coverage-across-tube-network"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Popular stations, including Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Bank, Euston, and Camden Town will be hooked up by the end of 2022, with coverage expanding in phases over the ensuing months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCWmIi"&gt;The announcement comes just over a year after 4G coverage was introduced on the eastern half of the Jubilee line, between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700451/london-underground-4g-tunnels-cellular-reception-mobile-phones"&gt;Westminster and Canning Town, in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Transport for London (TfL), the city’s transport authority, says the upcoming infrastructure will support 5G networks as well as 4G, but that it will be up to mobile operators themselves to offer support for the next-generation mobile network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f3HhcE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Full internet access will be available across the tube”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mKJkb8"&gt;“I promised Londoners that if they re-elected me for a second term as mayor I would deliver 4G throughout the tube network,” London’s mayor Sadiq Khan said in a statement. “It’s already up and running on the eastern half of the Jubilee line and I’m delighted to announce today that I am fulfilling that commitment and full internet access will be available across the tube, with key central London stations such as Oxford Circus and Euston set to benefit before the end of next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhHeKw"&gt;TfL is working with BAI Communications to offer coverage across the network. The work will involve laying over 2,000km (1242 miles) of cabling within tunnels and stations. As well as offering mobile coverage to tube passengers, the project should also have benefits for mobile coverage in the city more generally. The fibre cabling installed in the London Underground’s tunnels will also connect to buildings and other infrastructure like street lighting and bus stops, allowing small mobile transmitters to be installed and increase coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYSYnP"&gt;The announcement comes as ridership on the London Underground has plummeted as a result of the pandemic, with huge financial implications for the transport authority. In June, the UK government &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-57315385"&gt;agreed to give TfL a third bailout&lt;/a&gt; to keep services running, bringing the total to over £4 billion (around $5.6 billion). TfL says providing mobile reception across the network will bring in more revenue over the 20-year contract term with BAI. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked memo confirms OnePlus will become an Oppo sub-brand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eazb8F1EOXEhg_jl4VVlp5HArkE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69480030/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0073_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xzw8gJ"&gt;Last week OnePlus CEO Pete Lau said in a forum post that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;the company will “further integrate” with Oppo&lt;/a&gt;, but didn’t elaborate on how that’d work in practise. Now, leaker Evan Blass has obtained a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1405914905363034118"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; that serves as a talking points memo for use by OnePlus PR, and it explains the integration in plainer terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78T6vb"&gt;“With the integration, OnePlus becomes a brand within Oppo, however will continue to function as an independent entity,” reads the most pertinent answer. The memo also says that Lau’s role as chief product officer at Oppo will make him responsible for the product strategies of both Oppo and OnePlus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldYpRL"&gt;This isn’t particularly surprising. Here’s what I wrote last week following Lau’s post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vNtQy6"&gt;Reading between the lines, it sounds like OnePlus will essentially be treated like a label of Oppo’s, maintaining a separate consumer-facing operation but with business activities merging in areas beyond product development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xmfGUq"&gt;The memo confirms that this is essentially what’s going to happen, removing any need to read between the lines. “With the merging of both the firms, we will have more resources at hand to create even better products,” it says. “It will also allow us to be more efficient in our operations.” OnePlus and Oppo had already merged their R&amp;amp;D departments around the turn of the year, so the further integration is more to do with streamlining day-to-day business operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLYfgZ"&gt;OnePlus customers shouldn’t necessarily expect too much to change — the shared ownership and supply chain meant that there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/15/17467348/oneplus-6-vs-oppo-r15-pro-vivo-bbk"&gt;similarities&lt;/a&gt; between Oppo and OnePlus phones for as long as OnePlus has existed. But now that OnePlus is acknowledging the relationship out loud instead of acting like it’s a scrappy startup, all eyes will be on the company’s next round of flagship phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Unite will launch first on Nintendo Switch in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gYafg7bSO3pT3ZxUlJNXiCJ9w5Y=/0x0:1329x886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466685/unitenew.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3984Wl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301541/pokemon-unite-team-game-strategy-tencent-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the team-based, five vs. five strategy game co-developed with Tencent’s TiMi Studio Group, now has a release window — and it’s soon. It’s coming first to Nintendo Switch in July 2021, followed by a release on mobile devices in September. Presumably, it’ll be released on both iOS and Android, but specific platforms weren’t confirmed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B10MAj"&gt;In case you can’t decide which platform you want to play the game on, don’t fret too much, as &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; will support cross-play between Nintendo’s console and mobile devices. &lt;a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/NEW-INFORMATION-REVEALED-FOR-Pokemon-UNITE"&gt;The Pokémon Company announced&lt;/a&gt; that the game will also support cross-progression, which can be enabled by signing in with either your Pokémon Trainer Club account or Nintendo Account on the devices that you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFCoJW"&gt;The game will be free to start, with optional in-game purchases available, including the paid “Aeos gems” currency. You’ll get Aeos coins and tickets just from playing the game, which can unlock cosmetics and other items. There will be season battle passes that you can level up over time to earn in-game rewards. Those paid Aeos gems I mentioned earlier will let you pay to get rewards in the battle pass if you don’t want to put the time in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nynjC"&gt;Like my colleague Andrew Webster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21302958/pokemon-unite-esports-competitive-gaming-league-of-legends"&gt;said last year when the game was announced&lt;/a&gt;, a strategy-laced &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game might seem like a strange combination, and it’s splashing onto the scene years after MOBAs like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; exploded in popularity. Yet, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; has a familiar cast of characters, and that might be enough to open the genre up to a new wave of fans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus integrates further with Oppo, if that’s even possible</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PreLxGWjXgAkVLh2rVaTwuyIo_8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465329/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro. | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DTWuj"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has announced a “new journey” for the company including a plan to “further integrate our organization with Oppo.” Lau made the announcement by way of a &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/a-new-journey-for-oneplus.1454492/"&gt;post on OnePlus’ forums&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we’re at a turning point for the future of OnePlus” and “we must adapt as a team and a brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85hr9Q"&gt;It sounds like a dramatic move for OnePlus, the company Lau started with Carl Pei after ostensibly leaving Oppo in 2013. OnePlus made its name with rebellious marketing and hype-driven online retail strategies, portraying itself as a smarter alternative to bigger smartphone brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1xwGeW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was always clear that OnePlus had ties to Oppo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3aHu8H"&gt;But it remained a private company with ownership tied up in Oppo and the shadowy BBK Electronics empire, and it was clear from OnePlus’ phones that there were still at least some ties to Oppo. Components like display panels were often seemingly identical, and even supposedly proprietary technology like the Dash fast-charging system was cross-compatible with Oppo’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXKvIi"&gt;“OnePlus and Oppo are two completely independent companies,” a OnePlus representative told me &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/15/17467348/oneplus-6-vs-oppo-r15-pro-vivo-bbk"&gt;three years ago&lt;/a&gt; by way of explanation. “R&amp;amp;D, finance, sales channels, daily operations, etc operate independently. The two parties share some common investors. OnePlus leases Oppo’s manufacturing line and shares part of the supply chain resources with Oppo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aO5T4K"&gt;Lau says that OnePlus will continue to operate independently, despite the further integration with Oppo. But he hasn’t said exactly what would be integrated, and given the existing commonalities between the two brands’ products, it’s not obvious what this will actually mean for consumers. Lau says OnePlus will continue to operate its own events and customer feedback channels, for example, but adds that Oppo’s greater resources should help OnePlus be more efficient with software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lwW0B4QWWEGX6noYMYXJbc3Y74s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664475/DSC_0784.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Oppo Find X3 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qZaPx2"&gt;It’s not a big secret that OnePlus and Oppo have been coming closer to an explicit reunion in recent years. Lau became Oppo’s chief product officer last year while keeping his role at OnePlus, and the two brands merged R&amp;amp;D departments back in January. More recently, OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344054/oneplus-9-oppo-coloros-in-china-hydrogenos"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’d start using Oppo’s ColorOS for its phones in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFOvaO"&gt;Reading between the lines, it sounds like OnePlus will essentially be treated like a label of Oppo’s, maintaining a separate consumer-facing operation but with business activities merging in areas beyond product development. Will this manifest itself in tangible changes to OnePlus devices? Who can say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DHs4XT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Oppo Find X3 Pro review: the Chinese phone to beat","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Kr3ROx"&gt;If you’re a OnePlus fan, though, there’s no reason to view the closer ties as a bad thing. The company has long left its “flagship killer” roots behind, now competing at the high end with expensive “Pro” phones while offering a range of cheaper Nord devices at the low-to-mid range. Oppo, for its part, releases far more phones a year than OnePlus (mostly in Asia), but its high-end flagships are every bit as good. The latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"&gt;Find X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite phone of the year so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qarkGX"&gt;Whether OnePlus would admit it or not, the company has always been associated with Oppo behind the scenes. The biggest change here is that OnePlus is now saying so out loud — while making the association even tighter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leica phone announced by SoftBank in Japan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOBU2_fK_41ENIQWpT0H1W67TMs=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465217/leitz.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zzd58N"&gt;SoftBank has announced a Leica-branded phone for the Japanese market. Leica has lent its name to phone camera systems before, but this Leitz Phone 1 is the first time the Leica brand and iconic red dot has taken precedence on a smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYoJyG"&gt;The camera system is of course going to be paramount for a device like this, and the hardware here is certainly unusual. There’s a single 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor — the biggest in any phone — with a 19mm-equivalent f/1.9 ultrawide lens, meaning other focal lengths need to use digital zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SB59G"&gt;If that sounds familiar, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439883/sharp-aquos-r6-japan-biggest-phone-camera-sensor-1-inch"&gt;Sharp announced the exact same thing a month ago&lt;/a&gt;. The Aquos R6 has the same Leica-branded camera system — though the Leitz Phone 1 makes it look a lot bigger — and other specs like its 120Hz Pro IGZO OLED screen are also a match. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jCzqb7S-ARMaHwm6Nw-C6Wl1s8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664394/leitz2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Bundled accessories for the Leitz Phone 1.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wrYfpg"&gt;On the other hand, the Aquos R6 doesn’t come with a lens cap and matching case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vqucke"&gt;SoftBank is also selling the Aquos R6 alongside the Leitz Phone 1, and isn’t attempting to hide the similarities behind the two phones. Instead, it’s positioning the R6 as a model for someone who just wants the Leica camera, and the Leitz Phone 1 for those who value Leica’s hardware design. And besides, what could be more in keeping with Leica tradition than tweaking existing products with a red dot? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LO6MRq"&gt;Preorders for the Leitz Phone 1 start tomorrow in Japan. It’ll cost 187,920 yen, or about $1,700.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo’s rollable concept phone is pure potential lacking polish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/td2nqlX7F45OVr3-qrdFdSELt60=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69461161/akrales_20210604_4621_07.0.gif" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But no sign of a commercial release&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="JHp5O3"&gt;Two hundred thousand. That’s the magic number of times Oppo wants its rollable X 2021 concept phone to be able to expand and contract before it’ll consider it durable enough to turn into a commercial device. That’s 200,000 times the device will need to be able to transform from a 6.7-inch phone into a 7.4-inch mini tablet, and 200,000 times it’ll need to successfully contract back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v44URM"&gt;But as it stands, Oppo says the Oppo X 2021 is durable enough to manage just half that, at 100,000 cycles. In theory, that’s already enough for around five and a half years of use if you open and close it 50 times a day, but as we’ve seen with early foldable devices, these figures sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18411510/samsung-galaxy-fold-broken-screen-debris-dust-hinge-flexible-bulge"&gt;don’t translate into the real world&lt;/a&gt;. The number shows the scale of the work Oppo still has to do on its concept, which it unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;last November&lt;/a&gt; during its second annual “Inno Day” celebration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1DKwlP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Oppo wants it to be durable enough to survive 200,000 transformations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vnx2QA"&gt;In durability terms, Oppo thinks it’s halfway toward turning its rollable phone from a concept into reality. But after having spent an afternoon using the company’s prototype device for myself, it’s clear that hitting this arbitrary number is far from the only challenge Oppo is facing in bringing this device to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEbDMH"&gt;At first glance, the Oppo X 2021 looks like a regular 6.7-inch smartphone, designed to do everything you’d expect a regular smartphone to be able to do. But at the tap of a button, the phone starts to whir and unroll its display to 7.4 inches in size, bringing it closer to the form factor of a small tablet. Similar concepts have been announced by competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;ranging from LG&lt;/a&gt; (prior to its announcement that it’s quitting the smartphone industry) to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;TCL&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first such functional device we’ve actually been able to try out for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="ZEGdci"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10609222"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZtRAz"&gt;It’s a cool magic trick, so naturally there’s a series of complicated mechanisms working behind the scenes to make it all possible. That whirring sound is coming from a pair of motors inside the X 2021, which are expanding the phone’s dynamic frame into its full size. Meanwhile, the screen itself is rolling around the left hand side of the phone, curving around a 6.8mm axis that Oppo says allows the screen to unroll with “virtually no trace.” Behind this screen are a series of metal slats, which slot together to support the screen regardless of whether it’s expanded or contracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWth97"&gt;There’s a lot going on inside the phone, which puts the overall device on the heavier, bulkier side. Held next to my own iPhone 12 Pro, the Oppo X 2021 is thicker at 10.7mm compared to 7.4mm, and heavier at 278g (compared to 189g). That’s a substantial difference, but it’s in a similar ballpark to existing plus-sized devices on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RSIILO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A bigger screen for gaming, reading, or watching a film&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h5rzzd"&gt;A transformation from 6.7 inches to 7.4 inches might not sound like too big a change, but it’s much larger when you consider the phone’s aspect ratio is also changing. You start with a roughly 19.85:9 widescreen display (with a resolution of 1175 x 2592) and end with a screen that’s got an aspect ratio closer to 4:3 (or 4.36:3 to be exact, 1785 x 2592). Effectively, it turns into a device that’s just a tad smaller than a 7.9-inch iPad Mini. It might not be enough to turn it into a productivity powerhouse, but it’s enough to make watching films, gaming, reading, or looking up a map a less cramped experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCeXDf"&gt;On the face of it, it’s a similar promise to the one the likes of Samsung and Huawei have made with their foldable phones, wrapped up in an even more unproven form factor. But Oppo’s approach has a number of theoretical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSUqPy"&gt;For starters, Oppo’s rollable design means the telltale crease that has sat along the middle of every foldable released so far is all but absent from the X 2021. Look closely and you’ll spot a slight rumple on the left hand side of the screen, but it’s barely visible, even when the phone is showing a mainly black image. We’ve long held that the creases found on foldable devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; aren’t nearly as much of a problem once you’re actually using the device, but that’s not much consolation when you’re spending over $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2i7aHz3ogG8lqH-32INWGKhsrBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657752/akrales_20210604_4621_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slight imperfection can be see on the screen while unrolled...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iF_pBRLQul-2u0ZYIghTPIEXmRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657749/akrales_20210604_4621_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;... but it’s much less obvious when the screen is turned on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ykq2Q4"&gt;The X 2021’s minimal crease is thanks to the fact the screen doesn’t need to bend anywhere near as sharply as it rolls round the edge of the phone. Oppo says the screen’s bend radius is 6.8mm, a comparatively gentle curve. The Oppo X 2021 currently uses a plastic display, but this radius leaves the door open for the company to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;folding glass in future iterations&lt;/a&gt; (one manufacturer, Schott, says its glass can be bent at a radius of under 5mm). However, Oppo would not reveal any firm plans to use folding glass in future models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ai1oPv"&gt;There’s also the fact that a rollable design gives you access to a lot more potential screen sizes than a folding one. Its maximum and minimum sizes will always be the same, but there’s no reason it couldn’t stop expanding at the 7.2, 7, or 6.8-inch mark. Similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524338/lg-rollable-tv-available-price-on-sale-korea"&gt;LG’s rollable TV&lt;/a&gt;, the phone could theoretically adapt to different aspect ratios, rather than leaving you with unsightly black bars while you’re playing a game or watching a film at a specific aspect ratio. But none of this functionality was available on the prototype I used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cneoi"&gt;That’s not to say that a rollable design doesn’t come with its own tradeoffs. The most obvious of these is that unlike a foldable, which lets you open up its display as quickly as a book, Oppo’s device takes the better part of two or three seconds to fully extend. It felt slow enough that you might not bother if you were in a hurry to check map directions. The company admits its electric motors also introduce another potential point of failure, which would need to be solved ahead of a commercial release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/biwz-hmrvJTdjjOkjRQYnOA7EZ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657750/akrales_20210604_4621_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone’s USB-C charging port saw a lot of use during the demonstration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DccVXm8Fvahd6qR1LSi56Gvs23E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657753/akrales_20210604_4621_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oppo X 2021 (right) vs an iPhone 12 Pro (left).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d55Leo"&gt;There’s also the question of what effect having these motors inside a phone will have on its battery life. During my demonstration (which, granted, involved repeatedly expanding and contracting the phone in a way you’d never do in normal usage), the X 2021 needed to be recharged more than once. It was a prototype, which wouldn’t have any of the battery optimizations of a consumer product, but it’s still unclear what effect these motors could have on the eventual device’s battery life in more normal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20Yccv"&gt;Beyond simple practical concerns like these, there are also questions about whether Android is equipped to deal with devices with changing display sizes. When we reviewed Samsung’s latest foldable, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;, last September, we found that the company effectively had to build a completely new layer of software on top of Android to make its foldable device work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrLitJ"&gt;Oppo has ambitious plans for the X 2021’s software. The prototype runs Oppo’s ColorOS fork of Android and is able to run dual apps side by side, or display two windows of the same app to make use of the extra screen real estate. But so far, most of these features are limited to Oppo’s own built-in apps, and it’s still working with third-party developers to get them to enable support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0od3HV9ydpZHToWtxSEB4rsODcM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657751/akrales_20210604_4621_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear of the phone gives few hints about the device’s flagship feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DujENx"&gt;Oppo is making no attempt to hide the fact that its X 2021 concept is a work in progress. The device I used lacked many of the basic features you’d expect out of a modern smartphone. There was no biometric security, no selfie camera, and adjusting the device’s volume involved awkwardly tapping the side of the display in the absence of physical volume buttons. Even its flagship feature, the rolling, was a bit clumsy and unpredictable — you’re supposed to be able to expand and contract the phone with a simple swipe, but I could only reliably get it to work with a double tap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJBLh4"&gt;But even as an in-development device, Oppo’s X 2021 represents one of the most advanced rollables we’ve seen. TCL may have announced a similar device, but at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/5/21165069/tcl-foldable-trifold-phone-hands-on-rollable-concept-prototype-display-tablet"&gt;last hands-on event&lt;/a&gt; its prototype was nonfunctional. Oppo’s prototype might be light on both hardware and software features, with an unproven level of durability, and a finicky transforming process. Ultimately, though, it fundamentally does the thing Oppo promised it’d do, and the company is happy to let press handle the device in a way that its competitors have yet to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TgePAY"&gt;In an industry that’s dominated by increasingly anonymous black rectangles, it’s hard not to root for new form factors like the one Oppo is showing off with the X 2021. Now it needs to actually make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anMWyF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isfffc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
