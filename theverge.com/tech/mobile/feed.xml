    <title>The OnePlus 9 Pro supports seriously fast 50W wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dG01GnSbVB8Nosjmfthf-AFsIbo=/59x0:1942x1255/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986172/OP_charge_white.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With a new wireless charger, the OnePlus 9 Pro can charge in either portrait or landscape orientation.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OyFUhs"&gt;It’s not often that the actual spec is better than the rumor, but that’s the case here: the OnePlus 9 Pro supports 50W wireless charging — a little faster than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;45W rumor we reported on&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. We’ve been able to test drive this feature ahead of the phone’s official debut on March 23rd, and can confirm: the 9 Pro offers really, really fast wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1udiA"&gt;OnePlus claims that the phone will charge wirelessly (with the new Warp Charge 50 charger) from 1 to 100 percent in 43 minutes, and our own testing confirmed this down to the minute. That’s a big boost over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;OnePlus 8 Pro’s 30W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;, which supplied a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes. The improvements aren’t limited to wireless charging, or the 9 Pro for that matter; the 9 and 9 Pro have 65W wired charging that takes the battery from empty to full in 29 minutes. While the base model OnePlus 9 doesn’t get those fast wireless speeds, it can be used with the new charger at up to 15W. Additionally, both the 9 and 9 Pro support standard Qi wireless charging at 15W.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6u9e5nAlDJmvfBFl4hiaOnAeuOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378643/OnePlus_9_Pro_Warp_Charge_50_Wireless_Dock_Dark.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Warp Charge 50 wireless charger now features a detachable cable based on user feedback.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2yw65a"&gt;Fast charging has definitely been OnePlus’ “thing” for a while, and according to Kinder Liu, COO and Head of R&amp;amp;D, it’s been a hit with customers. “Since introducing our first fast-charging technology with the OnePlus 3, we have heard a lot of positive feedback, with many OnePlus users saying it has fundamentally changed the way they charge their devices. They can simply top up for a day’s charge while getting ready in the morning instead of charging overnight.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVgrX0"&gt;The OnePlus 9-series uses a twin-cell battery design first introduced in the 8T, which is part of the 9 Pro’s formula for achieving such fast wireless charging speeds: each cell is charged at 25W simultaneously. OnePlus uses higher voltage power, which produces less heat than using higher amps, and avoids frying the phone by channeling the power through a proprietary charge pump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0CHA9M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The newly-designed charger supports charging in either horizontal or vertical orientation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AyfXvH"&gt;The 9 Pro’s twin-cell battery design also helps mitigate the heat produced by wireless charging, along with some other design tweaks to help with heat dissipation, like thicker copper foil and a larger heatsink. There’s also a key feature on the charger itself that we were grateful for in our testing: a fan. The added fan noise isn’t ideal if the charger is on your nightstand, but for the Pro 9 owner who wants to keep their nighttime charging routine, there’s support for quieter charging during bedtime mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nG92w"&gt;The newly designed charger also includes two charging coils, making it possible to charge the phone in either horizontal or vertical orientation. That’s useful if you want to multi-task your charging time and watch a video too, which OnePlus says shouldn’t affect charging speed. We couldn’t confirm that in our initial testing, but it’s something we’ll be following up on. As for the cost of the charger, we don’t have pricing yet, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;last year’s Warp Charge 30 chargers&lt;/a&gt; didn’t come cheap — the pad version was introduced at $69.95 and the stand version for $79.95.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile customers will get access to a better version of Pandora, free of charge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPs-KlZv8vmGY_LhkP8zd7i44Qo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68982123/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The T-Mobile Tuesdays promotion is included on most of the company’s postpaid plans.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ppYOQC"&gt;T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Ffirst-of-its-kind-pandora-experience-gives-t-mobile-customers-exclusive-benefits&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F17%2F22335993%2Ft-mobile-tuesdays-pandora-ad-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new perk for its customers: a year of access to a version of Pandora with ad-free stations on weekends, along with a few other benefits, at no extra cost. This is not to be confused with &lt;a href="https://www.pandora.com/upgrade/premium"&gt;Pandora’s paid premium service&lt;/a&gt;, but rather a version of the free service with a handful of extras. It starts on March 23rd as part of the company’s T-Mobile Tuesdays promotion, which is included on most postpaid plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7JqNz"&gt;Beginning next Tuesday, customers can get access by logging into the T-Mobile Tuesdays app and redeeming the offer through their Pandora account. After — ironically — watching a short ad each week, they’ll have access to music stations without ads over the weekend. They’ll also get early access to SiriusXM podcast episodes, SiriusXM original podcasts, and special “top tracks” stations. All of the features included with the standard free version of Pandora are also available, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ksln3oXujTMMlg1RRsq5A-ZcuGU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22377499/T_Mobile_Deep_Page_PR_v2__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FPWPag"&gt;Access to this version of Pandora will last through March 2022, at which point T-Mobile’s users’ accounts will revert back to the standard free version. There are no current plans to offer this type of account to other customers, either during or after the promo period. It’s not exactly a promotion worth switching to T-Mobile for, but if you’re already a customer and you use a free Pandora account, it’s a nice bonus — so long as you don’t mind watching an ad to get it every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPD9Em"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s midrange phones now feature fast refresh rate screens, stabilized cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69CPj9-NiG1F8ABRAFuhYmI4OH4=/0x330:4000x2997/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980752/32_galaxya52_a72_white_black_210310001526.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 and A72 feature quad rear-camera arrays, though the A72 includes a telephoto rather than depth-sensing camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tJQJa4"&gt;At its second Unpacked event of the year, Samsung officially unveiled three of its next A-series phones: the Galaxy A52, A52 5G, and A72. While the company isn’t sharing US pricing or availability yet, it has confirmed European pricing: €349 for the A52 (about $415), €429 for the A52 5G (about $510), and €449 for the A72 ($534).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laK8jm"&gt;Key specs across the board include IP67 water and dust resistance, brighter screens with faster refresh rates, and a 64-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization. All three models include a microSD card slot for expandable storage and will ship with a charging brick in the box — features that you won’t find in the S21-series flagships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="24r4ZA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The A52’s display will offer a 90Hz refresh rate, while the A52 5G will have a 120Hz screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N4Lex2"&gt;Each is built on an unspecified octa-core (dual 2.3GHz + hexa 1.8GHz) processor and will ship with Android 11 and Samsung’s One UI 3.0. Storage variants of 128GB and 256GB will be offered for all models, with RAM configurations that will vary by region. The devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;meet the hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt; to receive three generations of Android OS platform updates, and, like all recent Galaxy phones, are guaranteed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;at least four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdPhNi"&gt;The Galaxy A52 and A52 5G will both feature 6.5-inch Super AMOLED screens. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;As rumored&lt;/a&gt;, the A52’s display will offer a 90Hz refresh rate, while the A52 5G will have a 120Hz screen. Each will feature a rear “quad” camera array, though one of those four cameras is a 5-megapixel depth sensor. The main 64-megapixel f/1.8 camera is accompanied by a 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide 5-megapixel macro and 32-megapixel f/2.2 selfie cam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tM8wo9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10396022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TFaxC9"&gt;Samsung says the A52 models feature brighter screens — up to 800 nits as compared to last year’s 600 — and 4,500mAh batteries capable of two days’ use on a single charge. And naturally, the A52 5G includes 5G connectivity, though Samsung hasn’t confirmed yet which frequencies it will support in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQP3P2"&gt;The Galaxy A72 offers a slightly larger 6.7-inch Super AMOLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate. It offers the same basic rear camera array but includes an 8-megapixel f/2.4 3x telephoto camera instead of the depth sensor. The A72 is an LTE-only model; a 5G version is likely to come but Samsung hasn’t confirmed this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oVmRRQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10396033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LhkerI"&gt;We should find out US pricing and availability for these devices — and potentially other A-series models — in the next few weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21212085/samsung-galaxy-a01-a11-a21-a51-a71-5g-mid-range-android-price-release-date"&gt;Last year’s&lt;/a&gt; A51 and A51 5G were introduced at $400 and $500, respectively, with the 5G version of the A71 coming in at $600. If this year’s models are priced similarly, these devices will be well-positioned to tempt midrange shoppers with features like fast refresh rate screens, stabilized main cameras, and IP ratings, which aren’t common in this class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvSpSx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 17th, 10:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Added information about Android platform OS updates.&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung says it might skip the Galaxy Note this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Note 20" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXUBlu67qThdoqzNvjiUniBOhqs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68979722/dbohn_201004_4226_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A1PW2J"&gt;Samsung has warned that it might not be able to ship a Galaxy Note phone in 2021 after all, citing difficulties in launching two flagship phones in one year, in comments at its annual shareholders meeting &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/samsung-warns-of-serious-imbalance-in-the-chips-industry"&gt;reported on by Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3IGzu"&gt;“[The] Note series is positioned as a high-end model in our business portfolio,” said mobile chief DJ Koh. “It could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year so it might be difficult to release [a] Note model in 2H. The timing of [the] Note model launch can be changed but we seek to release a Note model next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcbvgQ"&gt;The comments came as Samsung sounded the alarm about a global semiconductor shortage, saying that its business will likely be affected next quarter. The potential delay or cancellation of a 2021 Galaxy Note is apparently separate, however; Koh says it’s more about streamlining the lineup, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0euKFz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Note 20 review: stylus tax","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21506471/samsung-galaxy-note-20-review-price-stylus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C0ofMo"&gt;The release of a Galaxy Note this year was already far from a sure thing. Samsung had indicated plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;bring its key stylus feature to more phones&lt;/a&gt; in the Galaxy lineup, sparking speculation that the line may come to an end. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22177972/galaxy-note-21-still-happening-yonhap"&gt;A Yonhap report&lt;/a&gt;, however, said that Samsung was still preparing to release a new Note phone in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3kweW2"&gt;Samsung declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on the existence of this device at the time, reiterating its plans to “bring some of the most beloved features of the Galaxy Note to more device categories in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei has a plan to get a bigger cut of 5G, even with its phone sales limited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cglpkfAQTGNKIcIEEPlMzMCaB7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977880/acastro_190520_1777_huawei_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o1pAUQ"&gt;Huawei has a plan to compete in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;5G&lt;/a&gt; without being able to sell its 5G phones everywhere. Today, the technology company announced that &lt;a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/news/2021/3/huawei-releases-whitepaper-innovation-intellectual-property-2020"&gt;it intends to seek royalties&lt;/a&gt; from companies like Apple and Samsung in exchange for the use of its patents, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/huawei-to-start-demanding-5g-royalties-from-smartphone-giants"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Huawei believes it can strike licensing deals despite sanctions in the US, and it plans to use its earnings to invest even further into research and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVoDTZ"&gt;Huawei obtained patents on new technology during the development of the larger 5G standard — alongside companies like Qualcomm and Ericsson — that are needed for interoperability between different 5G networks, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/huawei-to-charge-royalties-to-smartphone-makers-using-its-5g-tech-.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. “Huawei has been the largest technical contributor to 5G standards,” Huawei’s head of intellectual property rights, Jason Ding, said in a statement.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The company intends to charge up to $2.50 per phone that uses its 5G patents. Huawei believes its patent business shouldn’t be impacted by ongoing sanctions, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3TXKw"&gt;The company’s patent earnings are already large. Ding estimates Huawei will earn between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion from patent licensing between 2019 and 2021. Huawei also plans to charge less than other manufacturers like Nokia and Ericsson for access to its 5G standard essential patents (SEPs), according to CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZH7mJ"&gt;Huawei is still banned from doing business in the US by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;Department of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133631/huawei-china-spying-claims-us-officials-blacklist-5g"&gt;concerns of spying&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s networking technology is also still required to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21422939/huawei-zte-us-phone-networks-fcc-congress-reimbursement-cost"&gt;removed and replaced&lt;/a&gt; in the US and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21322880/uk-bans-huawei-5g-network-infrastructure-trump-administration-pressure"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. Aggressively pursuing patent royalties seems like a way to profit off the 5G business Huawei was already building. And with no indication that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22273729/huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-biden-trump-us-sanctions"&gt;the Biden administration will renegotiate&lt;/a&gt; with the company or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274575/huawei-fcc-lawsuit-national-security-ban-broadband-rollout"&gt;reverse the ban&lt;/a&gt;, it might need it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will reduce Play Store cut to 15 percent for a developer’s first $1M in annual revenue</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xe9ZA4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/boosting-dev-success.html"&gt;Google is reducing&lt;/a&gt; its long-standing 30 percent cut, which it takes from each Play Store digital purchase for all Android developers around the world, on the first $1 million they make on the digital storefront each year, starting on July 1st. According to Google, that change means that 99 percent of Android developers that “that sell digital goods or services” will see a 50 percent reduction in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="al4tx8"&gt;Google’s news follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;Apple’s announcement of a reduced 15 percent fee&lt;/a&gt; last year as part of a new small business program, with one critical difference: &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;Apple’s fee reduction&lt;/a&gt; only applies to developers that make under $1 million per year. But if an app maker goes over the $1 million threshold at any point in the year, they’ll be booted from Apple’s program and subject to the standard 30 percent rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TGVgNE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple will reduce App Store cut to 15 percent for most developers starting January 1st","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Srf6VB"&gt;Google’s program is a flat cut to the first $1 million developers make each year. That means whether you’re a student making your first app or a multibillion-dollar company, the first $1 million you make on the Play Store each year will only get charged a 15 percent service fee by Google. Any money you make after that will then be subject to the usual 30 percent cut. A Google spokesperson says the company felt that applying the reduced fees equally to all companies was a fair approach in line with Google’s goals of helping developers of all sizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpyMF5"&gt;Google has charged a 30 percent cut for any purchases through the Google Play Store since it first launched as the “&lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2008/10/android-market-now-available-for-users.html"&gt;Android Market&lt;/a&gt;” — although originally, the company claimed that “Google does not take a percentage,” with the 30 percent cut going toward “carriers and billing settlement fees.” In its more modern incarnation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/6/2848223/google-play-store-rebranded-android-market"&gt;as the Play Store&lt;/a&gt;, Google now puts &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/112622?hl=en"&gt;that 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; toward its “distribution partner and operating fees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mGOg33"&gt;The 30 percent fee has been constant for the lifespan of Google’s storefront. The only exception is subscriptions: in 2018, Google (in another similar move to Apple) announced that it would reduce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16502152/google-play-store-android-apple-app-store-subscription-revenue-cut"&gt;its cut down to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for subscription products after users had been subscribed for a full year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ira93E"&gt;The number of developers that make more than $1 million each year — and will end up still being charged the full 30 percent — is proportionally tiny. Google notes that only about 3 percent of Android developers actually charge for either downloading their apps or for digital in-app purchases to begin with, and only 1 percent of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; developers make more than the $1 million threshold that would see the 30 percent cut kick in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ulioxr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite for Android has also been kicked off the Google Play Store","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368079/fortnite-epic-android-banned-google-play-app-store-rule-violation"},{"title":"Epic is suing Google over Fortnite’s removal from the Google Play Store","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RCZbld"&gt;The new policy also comes at a critical moment when Google (and Apple’s) app store policies are under intense public scrutiny, kicked off by the removal of Epic Games’ &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from both the App Store and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;Play Store&lt;/a&gt; and the game developer’s subsequent antitrust lawsuits against Apple and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2DBj5"&gt;The issue is also coming to a head in legislation, with states like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt; debating new laws that would force Apple and Google to offer more alternative software distribution methods and payment options on their platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAScal"&gt;Epic Games, however, still says that Google’s new measure isn’t nearly far enough, noting that it “does not address the root of the issue,” and arguing that “Android needs to be fully open to competition, with a genuinely level playing field among platform companies, app creators, and service providers. Competition in payment processing and app distribution is the only path to a fair app marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9YfGJP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's scary for the tech industry to that see Google and Apple aligning their monopolistic policies in near lock-step. In a free app market, rates would be much lower for all due to competition, and not subject to their divide-and-conquer tactics.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1371854312507330561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nMQfnT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 16th, 11:50am:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Epic Games statement, and clarified Android developer groups that will see a reduction of fees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will court independent writers to its Substack competitor with paid deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JB94WfARePpUrN2whCKy0ln10Ao=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68974589/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kDNMAO"&gt;Facebook wants to be a part of the newsletter business, and it’s willing to pay for it. &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-paying-writers-journalists-pages-0b96d3cd-e61b-4435-9f54-99aed136f932.html"&gt;reports today&lt;/a&gt; that the company will soon start testing its newsletter product, which will integrate with Pages. As part of that test, Facebook will also court writers, some of whom the company will pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Enshkz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t name any writers and says the product itself is still unnamed, but it also reports the initial user group will be composed of small and independent writers. This newsletter tool will also help writers set up a website outside Facebook. The idea is that writers can charge for subscriptions to their work and potentially create additional revenue streams while relying on Facebook to engage their community. Facebook will let them create Groups for their work as well, and it will also provide metrics on their newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mxeu4N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The product is still unnamed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2cV2A"&gt;The push from Facebook comes as the newsletter business is building significant momentum across the industry. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159571/substack-ceo-chris-best-interview-newsletter-subscription-model-journalism-decoder-podcast"&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt;, most notably, has paid advances to multiple writers in order to bring them over to its platform. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s former Silicon Valley editor Casey Newton now runs his newsletter, &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;Platformer&lt;/a&gt;, through Substack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DLrfxc"&gt;Seeing the success that writers are having on the platform, Twitter acquired newsletter platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;Revue in January&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to keep them in the Twitter ecosystem. The difference between Twitter’s efforts and Substack and Facebook’s is Twitter hasn’t yet specifically sought out writers to pay. Doing so could suggest an editorial slant, although Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie &lt;a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers"&gt;views them&lt;/a&gt; as “business decisions, not editorial ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7GskE"&gt;Facebook, which already receives criticism from both liberals and conservatives in the US for the way it moderates its platform, might face backlash to its newsletter product, particularly depending on which writers it seeks out for the program.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook strikes News Corp deal to license news from Australian media outlets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ISMtkvnt2MdvraASgbPRgaLmKiQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971020/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RCbuNr"&gt;Facebook last month shut off the ability for Australian users and media organizations to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;share news links in the country&lt;/a&gt;, and now it seems the company’s extraordinary measure has resulted in a compromise for the most interested parties as media giant News Corp has &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/03/15/news-corp-and-facebook-reach-agreement-in-australia/"&gt;struck a licensing deal with the social network&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jgd8HD"&gt;Financial terms were not disclosed, but the deal is a multi-year one that gives Facebook’s news platform access to major News Corp Australia properties, including news.com.au, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;. Google similarly struck a deal with News Corp last month, as the threat of a new Australia law regulating tech company payments to news organizations loomed overhead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEl2Rb"&gt;Facebook’s news shutdown in Australia wasn’t designed specifically to increase pressure on News Corp. Instead, Facebook wanted concessions from the Australian government about the then-forthcoming media bargaining law, which stipulated that major tech platforms like Facebook and Google would need to pay news publishers to access their content. Google also threatened to shut down its search engine in Australia, but it ended up &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/02/17/news-corp-and-google-agree-to-global-partnership-on-news/"&gt;striking its own deals instead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="U1Mt8t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook pushed back against Australian’s media bargaining law, and it won&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1cTyAd"&gt;In a predictable turn of events, Facebook received its desired concessions, the largest of which involved negating the forced arbitration portion of the bill that Silicon Valley reviled if prior commercial agreements were struck, and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296778/facebook-ends-australian-news-ban-bargaining-code-google"&gt;restored the ability to share news&lt;/a&gt;. Australia then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22283777/australia-new-media-bargaining-code-facebook-google-paying-news"&gt;passed the law&lt;/a&gt; and everyone more or less came out unscathed. Yet part of Facebook’s initial opposition to the law was that it gave the most powerful publishers too much negotiating power, and News Corp is &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/how-much-influence-does-the-murdoch-media-have-in-australia-20201015-p565dk.html#:~:text=A%202016%20study%20by%20academics,print%20newspaper%20readership%20across%20Australia."&gt;far and away the largest and most pervasive media conglomerate&lt;/a&gt; in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9nMYX"&gt;“Facebook would have been forced to pay potentially unlimited amounts of money to multi-national media conglomerates under an arbitration system that deliberately misdescribes the relationship between publishers and Facebook — without even so much as a guarantee that it is used to pay for journalism, let alone support smaller publishers,” Nick Clegg, Facebook’s global policy chief, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299229/facebook-one-billion-investment-news-industry-australia-google-regulation"&gt;argued at the time&lt;/a&gt; in a public blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0K52d"&gt;Following the Australia showdown, Facebook said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299229/facebook-one-billion-investment-news-industry-australia-google-regulation"&gt;commit $1 billion to news industry deals over the next three years&lt;/a&gt; to foster partnerships with media organizations, with the unspoken stipulation that it not have to face another media bargaining law like Australia’s. (Facebook said it reserves the right to shut down news in Australia again if it so chooses.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lb8fc"&gt;It appears Facebook and News Corp have made up, and this new deal will make News Corp-owned publishers accessible on the Facebook News platform in Australia. In addition to news.com.au and &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;, the latter of which has a separate deal as a broadcast organization, News Corp says it’s also licensing content from major newspapers like &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt; in Victoria, and &lt;em&gt;The Courier-Mail&lt;/em&gt;, as well as numerous regional publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVvao9"&gt;“The agreement with Facebook is a landmark in transforming the terms of trade for journalism, and will have a material and meaningful impact on our Australian news businesses,” said News Corp CEO Robert Thomson in a statement. “Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch led a global debate while others in our industry were silent or supine as digital dysfunctionality threatened to turn journalism into a mendicant order.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZvNLI"&gt;“We’re glad to have this deal in place and look forward to bringing Facebook News to Australia,” wrote Faceboo’s global news partnerships chief Campbell Brown. Andrew Hunter, Facebook’s head of news partnerships for Australia and New Zeland, said in a statement that “the agreements with News Corp Australia and Sky News Australia mean that people on Facebook will gain access to premium news articles and breaking news video from News Corp’s network of national, metropolitan, rural and suburban newsrooms.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Companies can silently reroute your texts to hackers, sometimes for just $16</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ItHDnY_V1jYkVxkKkyUSYNDOJdY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970810/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tm63Om"&gt;There’s a newly discovered attack on SMS messaging that’s almost invisible to victims, and seemingly sanctioned by the telecom industry, uncovered in &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The attack uses text-messaging management services that are aimed at businesses to silently redirect text messages from a victim to hackers, giving them access to any two-factor codes or login links that are sent via text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZYiLU"&gt;Sometimes, the companies providing the service don’t send any sort of message to the number that’s being redirected, either to ask permission or even to notify the owner that their texts are now going to someone else. Using these services, attackers are not only able to intercept incoming text messages, but they can reply as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egjkJP"&gt;Joseph Cox, the &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reporter, had someone successfully carry out the attack on his number, and it only cost the attacker $16. When he contacted other companies providing SMS redirection services, some of them reported that they had seen this sort of attack before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGr2de"&gt;The specific company that &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;used has reportedly fixed the exploit, but there are many others like it — and there doesn’t seem to be anyone holding the companies to account. When asked why this type of attack is even possible, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon simply directed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to contact CTIA, the trade organization for the wireless industry. CTIA wasn’t immediately available for comment, but it told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;it had “no indication of any malicious activity involving the potential threat or that any customers were impacted.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xxie2"&gt;Hackers have found many ways to exploit the SMS and the cellular systems to get at other people’s texts — methods like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/15/17695132/att-sued-over-lost-cryptocurrency-sim-swap-theft"&gt;SIM swapping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/18/16328172/sms-two-factor-authentication-hack-password-bitcoin"&gt;SS7 attacks&lt;/a&gt; have been seen in the wild for a few years now and have sometimes even been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping"&gt;used against high-profile targets&lt;/a&gt;. But with SIM swapping, it’s pretty easy to tell that you’re being attacked: your phone will completely disconnect from the cellular network. But with SMS redirection, it could be quite a while before you notice that someone else is getting your messages — more than enough time for attackers to compromise your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcFGQV"&gt;The main concern with SMS attacks are the implications they could have for the security of your other accounts. If an attacker is able to get a password reset link or code sent to your phone number, they would then have access to it and be able to get into your account. Text messages are also sometimes used to send login links, as &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; found with Postmates, WhatsApp, and Bumble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTlhuP"&gt;This also serves as a reminder that SMS should be avoided for anything security related, if possible — for two-factor authentication, it’s better to use an app like Google Authenticator or Authy. Some password managers even have support for 2FA built in, like 1Password or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22285499/password-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho"&gt;many of the other free managers we recommend&lt;/a&gt;. That said, there are still services and companies that only use text messages as a second factor — the banking industry is infamous for it. For those services, you’ll want to make sure that your password is secure and unique, and then push both for them to move away from SMS and for the cellular industry to work on making itself more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will soon let you use a security key as your only 2FA method</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bfXYWmJAZML_gypRtluWOgh9y4M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970117/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c8wiVA"&gt;Twitter is planning a future update that will allow accounts enabled with two-factor authentication to use security keys as the only authentication method, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1371510300973875201?s=20"&gt;the company said on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. At present, you can use a security key to sign in to your Twitter account, but you need to have another 2FA method — like an authenticator app or SMS codes — enabled as backup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJMioX"&gt;While authentication apps like Google Authenticator or Authy are more secure than using SMS codes for 2FA, security keys — physical keys that connect to your computer using USB or Bluetooth — are the most secure way to protect an account online. Users don’t have to type in a code that could be intercepted by a malicious third party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8KgI3"&gt;You connect the key, your browser issues a challenge, then the key cryptographically signs the challenge and verifies your identity. Another benefit of using a security key: users don’t have to give Twitter any additional personal information, such as a telephone number, to be able to log in to their accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Secure your account (and that alt) with multiple security keys. Now you can enroll and log in with more than one physical key on both mobile and web.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And coming soon: the option to add and use security keys as your only authentication method, without any other methods turned on.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1371510300973875201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EmEKbK"&gt;Twitter also said Monday it will allow multiple security keys on a single account; until today, it only allowed one key per account, in addition to the other 2FA methods. In December, Twitter announced it was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334229117978497024"&gt;adding support&lt;/a&gt; for security keys for 2FA-enabled accounts when users log in to its mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpAI2k"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson said Monday there wasn’t a timeline for when security key-only 2FA would take effect. &lt;/p&gt;
