    <title>Apple AirPods update to arrive later this year with iPhone SE refresh coming 2022: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-generation AirPods will reportedly have a shorter stem than current models (above). &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CtMfh8"&gt;Apple will start production on updated AirPods next month, with plans to launch the third-generation earbuds later this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-to-go-all-in-on-5G-for-its-2022-iPhone-lineup"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the latest rumor regarding Apple’s product schedule, which will reportedly include an all-5G iPhone line-up in 2022, including a revamped iPhone SE sporting the as-yet-unannounced A15 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5QeOa"&gt;A refresh of Apple’s entry-level AirPods have been rumored for a while now, with previous generations launched in 2016 and 2019. Back in May, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the earbuds will have a design similar to the AirPods Pro, with “a new case and shorter stems poking out of the bottom of each one.” If &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; is right about production starting next month, we can expect to see the new-look AirPods revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;alongside the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; this September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4qe52"&gt;In addition to the earbuds, Apple might also release new versions of the MacBook Pro later this year, says &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;. This rumor seems pretty solid, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that the new laptops will be available in 14-inch and 16-inch screen sizes, with next-gen Apple-designed Arm processors, the return of MagSafe charging, and the end of the Touch Bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhhfLd"&gt;Looking ahead to 2022, Apple is expected to equip all new iPhones that year with 5G compatibility. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; says the company will not update the smaller iPhone 12 Mini in 2022 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;disappointing sales&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/05/2021-iphone-13-name-report/"&gt;reports suggest&lt;/a&gt; it will offer an iPhone 13 Mini later this year). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0zPpn"&gt;Instead, in 2022, the company will refresh the cheaper iPhone SE with 5G and an A15 processor. The updated iPhone SE will reportedly use a Qualcomm chip for 5G compatibility, an interesting note given that Apple is reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168779/apple-leak-cellular-modem-johny-srouji-town-hall"&gt;building its own modems&lt;/a&gt; in order to further wean itself off third-party designs. The new iPhone SE will also reportedly keep its 4.7-inch LCD displays, says &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;, making it the obvious choice for consumers who prefer a smaller device. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/23/2022-iphone-se-details/"&gt;Earlier reports&lt;/a&gt; about the third-generation SE said it will also retain the home button and Apple’s Touch ID sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s gaming expansion starts with mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wT03y_BYKhH9s7Od7inytuRN6MQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608381/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SWOM4W"&gt;Netflix revealed that its initial efforts in gaming will be focused on mobile games and that the games will be included with users’ Netflix subscriptions, the company announced as part of its second-quarter earnings report on Tuesday. The news comes just days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;the company said it hired&lt;/a&gt; former EA and Oculus exec Mike Verdu to head up its gaming work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyHJ5A"&gt;Here is exactly what Netflix said about gaming, &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;from its letter to investors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sm3E6C"&gt;We’re also in the early stages of further expanding into games, building on our earlier efforts around interactivity (eg, &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;) and our &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; games. We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV. Games will be included in members’ Netflix subscription at no additional cost similar to films and series. Initially, we’ll be primarily focused on games for mobile devices. We’re excited as ever about our movies and TV series offering and we expect a long runway of increasing investment and growth across all of our existing content categories, but since we are nearly a decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about how our members value games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OPRa37"&gt;There are still no details on what types of games will actually be available, though Netflix recently extended its TV deal with Shonda Rhimes &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/netflix-shonda-rhimes-extend-deal-to-include-feature-films-gaming-and-virtual-reality-content-1235014998/"&gt;to include feature films and gaming content&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also no word on how games will be delivered to Netflix subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXDMdT"&gt;The company has acknowledged in the past that it competes with games for time and attention, with co-CEO Reed Hastings writing that “we compete with (and lose to) &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; more than HBO” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18187357/netflix-views-numbers-disney-amazon-fortnite-youtube-earnings-bird-box"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. COO Greg Peters discussed the company’s interest in games in April (&lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Netflix-Inc.-Q1-2021-Earnings-Call-Apr-20-2021.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) as part of its first quarter earnings. And the company has already dipped its toes into gaming with experiences like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152973/netflix-carmen-sandiego-interactive-special-black-mirror-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carmen Sandiego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV1aJe"&gt;But with the recent hiring of Verdu and the new information shared Tuesday about its initial plans, now it seems like Netflix is more focused on games than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is also switching to Android Messages as default for RCS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zZHxdIDdhTmygFE3Ihttsj-XPac=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69605640/rcs_static.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T2m9QY"&gt;Beginning next year, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-google-messaging-services-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon will join AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile in preloading Android Messages&lt;/a&gt; as the default texting app on all Android phones it sells. It’s the final step for making RCS Chat — the next-gen standard designed to replace SMS — the default experience for Android. In the US, that only leaves one large cohort that will not use RCS as a default SMS replacement: iPhone users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QbOmp"&gt;Verizon has also said it will fully support interoperability between carriers, so in theory the improved images, video, read receipts, and group chats should just work — assuming everybody you’re texting with is also using Android Messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Oy5tR"&gt;Verizon was the last of the big three US carriers to get on board with Google’s latest strategy to push RCS as the new default for texting. After years of cajoling, shaming, and downright pleading, the company has made deals with carriers to simply use the standard Android Messages app, which supports RCS by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UdagT8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AT&amp;amp;amp;T joins T-Mobile in switching all Android phones to Google’s Messages app for RCS ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556686/att-android-phones-rcs-google-messages"},{"title":"T-Mobile is betting big on Google’s Android services: RCS, YouTube TV, Pixel, and more ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"},{"title":"EXCLUSIVE: CHAT IS GOOGLE’S NEXT BIG FIX FOR ANDROID’S MESSAGING MESS ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/19/17252486/google-android-messages-chat-rcs-anil-sabharwal-imessage-texting"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dLNUl0"&gt;Hiroshi Lockheimer, senior vice president of Android, Chrome OS, and the Play Store, is quick to note that end-to-end encryption for RCS inside Android Messages is also in the process of rolling out. It’s available for “peer-to-peer” chats (i.e. a chat with one other person), but group chats are on the roadmap as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ah3HiB"&gt;Default, end-to-end encrypted chats between Android phones raise an interesting conundrum for Apple. Next year, texts between Android phones and iPhones will be less secure than texts within those two ecosystems — because they will be on SMS instead of RCS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2PUe2"&gt;Apple’s Messages app offers end-to-end encryption if all users are on the iMessage system, and it has shown no appetite to either offer iMessage on Android nor to adopt RCS on the iPhone. Google, meanwhile, is happy to take the opportunity to needle Apple by openly inviting it to use RCS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IiDxaT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I would hope that as everyone focuses on security and privacy it becomes an important part of the discussion.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="container"&gt;“Going forward, the default messaging experience on Android is going to be more secure,” says Lockheimer, who has previously invited Apple to adopt RCS. “The fallback messaging experience on the other platform will not have encryption if it’s still SMS. I think that that is a pretty interesting dynamic and I would hope that as everyone focuses on security and privacy it becomes an important part of the discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaFqbW"&gt;Lockheimer wouldn’t confirm if Google is in active discussions with Apple, but it doesn’t seem as though RCS is likely to come to the iPhone soon and the company has declined to comment on the matter several times over the years. But there is clearly a pressure campaign on, even if it’s not very strident. Speaking about Apple adoption, Lockheimer says, “I actually do think getting the three major carriers in the US to adopt RCS in a consistent manner is a big part of the equation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiSTq3"&gt;Currently, there are 473 million monthly active RCS users around the globe, &lt;a href="https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/rcs/"&gt;according to the GSMA&lt;/a&gt;. Adoption in the US is likely to boost that number by quite a bit. Google has no plans to try to introduce a messaging app that supports RCS on the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kbd3J"&gt;Although RCS has been closely associated with Google, the company often points to the fact that it is meant to be a standard that is shared by the entire mobile industry and managed by the GSMA. Carriers are able to use their own RCS infrastructure instead of Google’s. Still, RCS is closely tied to Google in many people’s minds and Google offers RCS services to carriers and will even allow consumers to directly use RCS via its services if their carrier doesn’t offer it. Google began pushing RCS as the new texting experience on Android after its own messaging attempts (notably Hangouts and Allo) floundered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xlX5hJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The RCS rollout has been a long, complicated slog&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LTm6tu"&gt;Lockheimer claims that Google prefers the slightly more open RCS approach to a Google-owned texting solution being the default on Android. “We don’t think there should be one messaging app to rule them all. We fully realize people are going to use multiple messaging apps,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BERDuW"&gt;As for Verizon, it will continue to offer its Verizon Message+ (VM+) application alongside Android Messages for customers who wish to use it. It’s a maligned app and for good reason: it’s rife with awkward interface controls and Verizon branding — but since it’s really the only way to sync Verizon text messages across different devices, it’s going to stick around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7TrxU"&gt;Apparently Verizon and Google intend to find a way to ensure that VM+ and Android Messages share a text message database so that messages stay in sync. That’s potentially a first step toward opening up RCS to third-party applications — something that’s been impossible so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJUX3W"&gt;Google’s deal with Verizon caps a flurry of RCS activity that kicked off this past March with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;T-Mobile deal&lt;/a&gt;, then the end of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534173/google-android-summer-features-earthquake-messages-emoji-kitchen-auto-voice-access"&gt;encrypted chat beta in June&lt;/a&gt;, and finally a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556686/att-android-phones-rcs-google-messages"&gt;deal with AT&amp;amp;T in June&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4Junm"&gt;Unfortunately, as with all things Android and RCS, the results of that activity won’t be felt by users until later. Verizon won’t be making the switch to Android Messages until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGXtCf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish cuts a 10-year, $5 billion deal to make AT&amp;T the primary service provider for its MVNO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqQWkZfflK3-Dud_Zc1jQyamkjE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602744/acastro_200804_1777_dish_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dish is on a mission to become the US’ fourth wireless carrier.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D5m5WV"&gt;Dish Network has a new network operator partner for its MVNO brands: AT&amp;amp;T. The companies &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001001082/000100108221000019/dish-20210714x8k.htm"&gt;have signed a network services agreement (NSA)&lt;/a&gt; that will see Dish pay AT&amp;amp;T at least $5 billion over the course of the next ten years to use its 4G and 5G networks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;as Dish brings its own 5G network online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1A6h6"&gt;The deal takes effect immediately and comes at a time when relations between Dish and T-Mobile — currently a major network partner — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;are particularly strained&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a nonexclusive agreement, and Dish says that some of its customers will likely continue to connect to T-Mobile’s network. The arrangement also gives AT&amp;amp;T the right to request access to use some of Dish’s wireless spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Se1Rrl"&gt;Dish owns Boost Mobile, Ting, and Republic Wireless MVNOs, which operate on other carrier networks. Dish &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquired Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in the T-Mobile / Sprint acquisition deal, as part of a scheme to set the company up as the fourth wireless carrier in the US. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352496/dish-ting-mobile-acquisition-tucows-network-tech"&gt;Dish’s Ting and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319621/dish-network-acquires-republic-wireless-5g-cell-carrier-mvno-t-mobile"&gt;Republic Wireless acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; also gave the company access to backend infrastructure and subscribers in anticipation of its launch as a full-fledged mobile carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wWwqet"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile’s responses on the matter have had strong “stop hitting yourself” vibes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QK2dvs"&gt;Things haven’t exactly gone smoothly. There’s the impending T-Mobile CDMA shutdown — a network many Boost customers still rely on — that Dish says is happening sooner than expected (T-Mobile’s responses on the matter have had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;strong “stop hitting yourself” vibes&lt;/a&gt;).  Dish has also been &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/dish-sheds-363k-wireless-subs-warns-t-mobile-3g-shutdown"&gt;losing wireless subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in the hundreds of thousands over recent financial quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YpZqw"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T doesn’t operate a CDMA network, so this new deal isn’t meant to address that problem. At the very least it does include a two-year transition period when the agreement ends during which AT&amp;amp;T must cooperate to help users continue their service, so Dish can hopefully avoid additional potential setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRqZce"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxBidU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s Xperia 1 III is pricey, performant, and perplexing</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A good camera system and top-notch features, but it’s priced too high to recommend&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="dfjjAK"&gt;The Sony Xperia 1 III is a great phone that I won’t recommend to many people. Once again, Sony has created a beautiful device with some unique, marquee features like a 4K-ish OLED 120Hz screen, great photo-taking amenities like a physical shutter button and a high-quality manual camera app, and top-notch hardware for entertainment consumption, like dual front-facing speakers and an honest-to-god headphone jack. You won’t find that combination among the other big-name flagships on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCxImC"&gt;But reader, it is $1,300. That’s a $100 increase over last year’s model, and more than an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; ($1,199) or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; ($1,249, but often on sale for less) with an equivalent 256GB of storage. That is simply a lot to ask someone to pay for a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d6JQED"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10655594"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5jQQEl"&gt;For that $1,300, you get a top-notch experience on basically every level (except for its relatively short security-support timeline), but I struggle to see any one way in which it sets itself apart from the established competition. There are serious photo and video recording capabilities within the native camera apps, but nothing that could be considered unique to Xperia or a must-have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9gD3D"&gt;It all amounts to a very expensive device that does a lot of things well, but without a strong value proposition for any one kind of person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 6.5-inch OLED offers a fast 120Hz refresh rate." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/40QEc54OgGSoyHWpbJVK_9DltRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721851/ajohnson_210712_4667_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 6.5-inch OLED offers a fast 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sEOx0N"&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III screen, battery, and ergonomics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="togdaC"&gt;The Xperia 1 III’s screen stands out among its fellow flagships both in terms of its slimmer 21:9 aspect ratio and its higher 1644 x 3840 resolution, which Sony calls 4K (it’s close). It’s also an OLED panel, and this year’s version offers a 120Hz maximum refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rozvbw"&gt;There’s no variability, unfortunately, so you’ll need to choose between locking it in at a standard 60Hz (the default) or that higher 120Hz rate for the smoothest of smooth scrolling experiences. Opting for 120Hz comes with a warning that the battery will drain faster, and it does, but not unreasonably so. I kept it enabled throughout my time using the phone. Overall, it’s a lovely screen, with a couple of notes: Auto brightness is sometimes a little squirrely indoors, and the panel itself doesn’t get terribly bright outdoors. It’s still usable outside in bright light, but it can feel like a strain to see what’s on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6oFm7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322518/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-smartphone-new-camera-photo-pro"&gt;Dieter was a fan of the Xperia 1 II’s look when he reviewed it&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m in agreement about the III: it’s a sophisticated, understated design and I dig it. I like the slight matte treatment for the back panel glass, and all-around build quality (including its IP65/68 durability rating) measures up to the flagship class with a metal frame and Gorilla Glass Victus on the front. The Sony branding is so unobtrusive it practically disappears into the back panel, until the light catches it, and the whole thing looks at home next to an RX100 series camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DgBdAZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I both like and dislike the phone’s unique tall-and-slim profile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ImnDmd"&gt;The Xperia 1 III gets an upgraded 4,500mAh battery compared to the previous-gen’s 4,000mAh, likely a necessary move given the 120Hz display. Battery life is adequate, not stellar. I averaged two hours of screen time on a day of lighter use, which drained the cell to only about 50 percent by the end of the day. I was concerned about how it would hold up on a day of heavier use recording some 4K video clips, but even in that case, the battery lasted through the end of the day. I’d pack a charger or a backup if I planned on shooting video extensively, or on a long travel day where I anticipated more than four hours of screen-on time, but for day-in-day-out use, the Xperia 1 III does fine. There’s also support for 30W wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJX0hJ"&gt;I both like and dislike the phone’s unique tall-and-slim profile. It fits my hand more easily, and it is possible to reach your thumb across the screen in one-handed use (forget about reaching the far upper corner, though). But it’s also more prone to slipping out of pockets. I do like the fingerprint sensor embedded in the on / off button on the side; it’s quick and it doesn’t care if I’m wearing a mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9MHt9B"&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III performance and software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="f95l9Q"&gt;Spec-wise, the Xperia 1 III is a flagship through and through. It uses a Snapdragon 888 processor with 12GB RAM and 256GB of built-in storage. There’s 5G connectivity here, and unlike last year’s model, those in the US will be able to take advantage of it — as long as you’re on Verizon or T-Mobile. The Xperia 1 III doesn’t support AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G, and there’s no mmWave support, just sub-6GHz on T-Mobile and Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FxIJz"&gt;Sony doesn’t have a firm security-support timeline for the Xperia 1 III but tells us that owners can expect two years of support. The phone ships with Android 11, and the company doesn’t have plans for future OS version upgrades. That puts it well behind Samsung’s and Apple’s support policies, both of which offer at least four years of security updates and multiple OS version upgrades. Considering its high price tag, this is a significant shortcoming against its peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgTU1v"&gt;Sony has equipped the Xperia 1 III with dual front-firing speakers and says they’re louder than those in the 1 II. Paired with the high-res OLED screen, it makes watching videos a high-quality experience. I was delighted when I heard a car offscreen and the audio tracked as it passed through the scene from the left to right speakers. Maybe I’m easily impressed by these things, but I can see myself genuinely enjoying watching a movie or a show on the Xperia 1 III, rather than as a last resort to stave off boredom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Xperia’s rear panel includes three cameras and a time-of-flight sensor." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXKsDD5HelikwPsT6w2NkRxN1Y4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721853/ajohnson_210712_4667_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia’s rear panel includes three cameras and a time-of-flight sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KiwB8t"&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gr0Vh8"&gt;Sony is a highly regarded maker of mobile imaging sensors, and in the past few years has gotten more serious about the camera hardware in its own Xperia phones. This year’s iteration includes a total of three 12-megapixel rear-facing cameras, including a telephoto lens with a folded-optic design that includes two focal lengths: 70mm and 105mm equivalents. All three cameras, including that telephoto unit, use a sensor with dual phase-detection autofocus, a technology that helps Sony Alpha cameras achieve class-leading autofocus speeds. If you’re a numbers kind of person, here’s the quick rundown on the rear-facing camera hardware in the Xperia 1 III:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ifAERS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10655682"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="idAAgP"&gt;The Xperia’s Photography Pro camera app now includes a “basic,” auto-everything shooting mode as the default. Switching over to one of the semi-auto or manual modes brings up an interface resembling an Alpha camera’s quick menu. The basic mode is refreshingly minimal — there are quick shortcuts to different focal lengths, to turn bokeh mode on or off, enable continuous shooting, and access flash settings, but not much more than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCrGBF"&gt;Manual modes introduce a lot more control and more display options like a big, beautiful (to me, at least) horizon level. It will all feel very familiar to anyone who’s used a conventional camera, especially if that camera is a Sony. I like both the basic and advanced shooting mode experiences, and a two-stage shutter button is a very welcome addition, but my one complaint is that there’s no real on-screen indication when a photo is taken. I live with all of my phone’s notifications and audio signals on mute, so without the audio cue, I missed it when I only half-pressed the shutter on a few occasions, thinking I’d fully pressed it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Switching to manual mode in the camera app brings up an Alpha-camera-esque interface." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RxNFFZfF_vVxqUomxKr0ZAR8jNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722492/Screenshot_20210713_110258.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switching to manual mode in the camera app brings up an Alpha-camera-esque interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U74oaP"&gt;I’ll admit that it took a minute for me to warm up to the Xperia’s telephoto camera. I tend to like a wider lens, and I’ve used too many bad or mediocre smartphone telephoto cameras to get too excited about them. But once I started trusting it — especially at the 70mm focal length — I started to really enjoy using it to layer foreground and background elements, or bring more attention to a subject I can’t get closer to. You know, stuff you use a telephoto lens for. The image quality won’t put your dedicated zoom lens out of work, but it’s good enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnARwU"&gt;There’s a tendency for smartphone telephoto lenses to just amplify the shortcomings of the small-sensor-small-lens combo working to create them, which manifests as ugly purple fringing or obviously smeary details. The images I took at 70mm are blessedly free from these artifacts, especially if you’re looking at them at social media sizes. The 105mm focal length starts to look a little artifact-y, and details are noticeably soft, but as long as there’s plenty of light, images don’t look distractingly bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u7gKYP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10655721"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cN5UIu"&gt;That’s the good stuff. I’m a little less excited about one of the other marquee camera features on the Xperia: autofocus. Namely, Sony’s dual phase-detect and tracking AF technologies, which it has imported to the Xperia series from its Alpha range. Don’t get me wrong, Sony autofocus is amazing. It’s why I own a Sony camera. You can see it at work in the Xperia 1 III when it effortlessly identifies a human or animal subject and tracks it around a scene, keeping up even when the subject turns away or becomes obscured behind something else. I’m just not convinced that it does much good here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7beOL"&gt;First, it seems to contribute to some distracting autofocus fluttering between near and distant subjects in some situations with the telephoto lens. Combined with the inherently less stable ergonomics of taking pictures with a phone versus a dedicated camera, it can make for a real challenge trying to get a photo of something in the distance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMlzUT"&gt;Taking closer-range photos of moving kids and pets in dim conditions is probably a more common use case for many people, and it’s one that no phone manufacturer has been able to crack just yet — including Sony. In these situations, dual phase-detect will keep up with your subject, but that doesn’t mean you’ll get a sharp shot. Just like every other phone camera system, it’s bound by the laws of small-sensor-small-lens physics. Situations where there’s just not enough available light to keep shutter speed high enough will still result in some blur, no matter how well the subject tracking is keeping up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bIKqBG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Just like every other phone camera system, it’s bound by the laws of small-sensor-small-lens physics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lurjns"&gt;In very low light, the camera will assemble data from multiple frames to create a brighter, less noisy image. This actually happens automatically in darker conditions, and doesn’t require a trip to a separate night mode, which I appreciate. But it does require you to hold the camera steady for a second or two, and isn’t well suited for moving subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQg3aa"&gt;Sony has included a darn good camera system on the Xperia 1 III, and it’s one I enjoyed using. I got to flex some creativity that I’d normally avoid with a smartphone and reserve for when I have a dedicated camera on hand. But it hasn’t found a way yet to bend the laws of optics and physics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sEq1s"&gt;We noted in our Xperia 1 II review that rather than leaning into computational photography the way Apple and Google have, Sony seems to be leaning into its traditional camera chops, applying the technology that has pushed the company’s mirrorless cameras to the top of the game. That approach has paid off in some ways — a great native camera app, a surprisingly good telephoto lens — but it doesn’t always translate, and I’m not sure how much further Sony can take that approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QSr8BE"&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III video recording&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JoT4PE"&gt;The Xperia 1 III is also well equipped for the serious mobile video shooter, with up to 4K / 60p recording and a native video app that includes plenty of manual control over video settings. You can set shutter angle, manually set points for pull focus, and apply one of Sony’s pro-video-esque color profiles. I have no problem telling you that this was all way over my head, but I played with it anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utMOBC"&gt;Your video files are associated with projects, and certain parameters like frame rate are preserved from clip to clip within a project. You also have the choice of recording to internal storage or directly to a microSD card if you don’t want to burn up your storage space with 4K video files. I’m happy to report that the SIM tray where the microSD card slot lives simply pops out of the side of the device, so you won’t have to hunt down a safety pin every time you want to grab your card to transfer files. That’s a nice touch, especially if you’re going to be taking that card out often to transfer footage to a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sony’s Cinematography Pro app offers plenty of manual control and the ability to set points for pull focus." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h24D8LTqCd5810QQd_drApEhcN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722485/Screenshot_20210714_122747.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s Cinematography Pro app offers plenty of manual control and the ability to set points for pull focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1x1d09"&gt;There’s not much you can do in the way of editing files — you can trim them or grab a still frame — so they’ll need to be exported for anything more than that. It’s also possible to use the Xperia 1 III as an external monitor for video recording with a dedicated camera (doesn’t need to be a Sony), or to use it for live-streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFhbYh"&gt;This is all much more robust than any native video-recording options you’ll find on a Samsung, Google, or Apple flagship. For someone who’s entrenched in the Alpha camera ecosystem, it could make sense as a compact, lightweight option for recording clips, or as part of a live-streaming setup. But there are also strong third-party apps and accessory options for mobile video shooters, especially those using iOS, that have benefited from years of development and use in the field. While the Xperia packs more of this into its native app experience, it’s not exactly a unique proposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qTmg7XSGoePrqQ6MrvdlJjeJPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721849/ajohnson_210712_4667_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia 1 III doesn’t offer enough above and beyond the established flagships to justify its high cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="q9JTBb"&gt;In the Xperia 1 III, Sony has created a sophisticated device that both looks good and delivers flagship-level performance. It offers sophisticated camera hardware and software and a lovely high-resolution OLED that’s not quite like anything else in its class. And yet I’m struggling to think of anyone who should buy this phone over an iPhone 12 Pro Max or a Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H41KPh"&gt;There’s the basics: for $1,300, you’d be getting a device that’s likely to only see a couple of years of security updates. And if you’re on AT&amp;amp;T, you’re paying top dollar for a 5G device that can’t access the carrier’s 5G network. It’s hard to make a case for the Xperia just based on those facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MvGfsc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;things just don’t add up in the Xperia 1 III’s favor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uEnGxD"&gt;But suppose you plan on trading in your phone in a couple of years anyway, and you’re not on AT&amp;amp;T or don’t care about 5G (still a reasonable response to have toward 5G right now). The Xperia 1 III will deliver a very good picture-taking experience with camera hardware as good as anything else out there right now. You’ll get a great entertainment consumption device, with good audio and a lovely screen. And if you’re interested in shooting video, you’ll have a powerful tool in your hands right out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rg4v1c"&gt;But none of these features go far enough above and beyond what you can get with an iPhone or Galaxy flagship to make the Xperia stand out. Factor in the shorter time frame for device support and uncertainty of any OS platform updates, and things just don’t add up in the Xperia 1 III’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi overtakes Apple as number two smartphone vendor for first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RoEJx-ejU8P8R7snEItUUlFIHFo=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69589716/DSCF5698.jpg_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F52BFY"&gt;Xiaomi is now the second largest smartphone vendor based on worldwide shipments in the second quarter of 2021, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-q2-2021?ctid=2143-0b9f92413ead631983febced55e12cd8"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from Canalys. The Chinese company captured 17 percent of global market share, according to the research firm, just behind Samsung’s 19 percent but ahead of Apple’s 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gn7Ak"&gt;BBK’s Oppo and Vivo rounded out the list of top five vendors at 10 percent apiece. All five companies grew their shipments year on year, but what’s notable is just how much Xiaomi has managed to increase its volume — it shipped 83 percent more phones than in Q2 2020, whereas Samsung grew shipments 15 percent and Apple by just one percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vxj4as"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've moved up one more spot! Just in from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Canalys?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Canalys&lt;/a&gt;, we are now the 2nd largest smartphone brand worldwide in terms of shipments. This amazing milestone couldn't have been achieved without our beloved Mi Fans! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoMiWithoutYou?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NoMiWithoutYou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RT with ✌️from your Xiaomi smartphone :) &lt;a href="https://t.co/kKfuTK8K7J"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kKfuTK8K7J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1415731357368471553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXhzMt"&gt;“Xiaomi is growing its overseas business rapidly,” Canalys Research Manager Ben Stanton says, citing sales boosts in regions including Western Europe, Africa, and Latin America. “It is still largely skewed toward the mass market, however, and compared with Samsung and Apple, its average selling price is around 40% and 75% cheaper respectively. So a major priority for Xiaomi this year is to grow sales of its high-end devices, such as the Mi 11 Ultra.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McMFbf"&gt;Canalys says global smartphone shipments grew by 12 percent last quarter. Much of the growth seen by smartphone makers is at the expense of Huawei, however, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114885/huawei-overtakes-apple-2019-analysts-strategy-analytics-counterpoint-research-canalys"&gt;itself overtook Apple in 2019&lt;/a&gt; but has since been essentially shut out of the worldwide market due to US-imposed sanctions and trading bans. So far, Xiaomi appears to be the biggest beneficiary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the finalists to be included in Emoji 14.0 this September</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rows of emojis including biting lip, a troll, coral, lotus flower, bird nests, beans, glass spilling water, slide, tire, ring buoy, hamsa, disco ball, low battery, crutch, X-ray, bubbles, ID card, and heavy equal sign." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVTMrl7gx2BJSH5qvr3CzNf7wos=/70x0:615x363/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586504/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_12.52.47_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/new-emojis-in-2021-2022/" target="_blank"&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ikbVom"&gt;The draft list for the next round of new emoji was &lt;a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/new-emojis-in-2021-2022/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;, two days ahead of &lt;a href="https://worldemojiday.com"&gt;World Emoji Day&lt;/a&gt; on July 17th. Contenders include a melting smiley face, a low battery, a disco ball, and several new hand shapes — like heart hands and index finger pointing at viewer — for courting your sweeties or taunting your enemies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cG8b2v"&gt;The release of new emoji was delayed this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21214865/unicode-emoji-delay-2022-android-ios-mobile-release"&gt;because of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, and proposal submissions were on pause &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387628/new-emoji-submissions-unicode-subcommittee"&gt;until April&lt;/a&gt;. This list won’t be finalized by the Unicode Consortium until September, but in general, most candidates shown in the draft make it through. The final versions should roll out to different devices and platforms starting in late 2021 through 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Emoji shown in the prior image, in addition to a melting face, face with hand over mouth, face with eye peeking through fingers, saluting face, face with dotted lines around it, face holding back tears, as well as heart hands, snapping fingers, pointing index finger, and handshakes, all with different skin tones." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwRPFh-9t83V-nILuDkvUtE7wH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719624/emojipedia_14_draft_world_emoji_day_july_2021.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drafts of new emoji that will likely make their debut in Emoji 14.0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uhl7GW"&gt;The new emoji show a continued expansion of race and gender inclusivity. The current lineup has customizable skin tones for the handshake emoji, a person with crown to hang out with the existing prince and princess emoji, and a pregnant man and pregnant person join the pregnant woman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRL4Nf"&gt;I am personally very excited for the beans emoji, something I’ve longed for ever since I named my dog Bean a few years ago. I also plan to get a lot of mileage out of the X-ray emoji, because I can’t get enough emoji that have a little eeriness to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJpZnn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s own Jay Peters contributed proposals for the saluting face and bubbles emoji. You can also thank him for the yawning face and waffle emoji that were introduced in 2019, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327599/how-to-make-emoji-yawning-face-waffle-proposal-unicode"&gt;read about that creative journey here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus says the base OnePlus 9 Pro actually won’t be sold in North America</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/abwW_Zeb-zdZl3IGCvW1HnAMCMU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583432/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Gg8nu"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro went on sale on April 2nd, but to date, the $969 base model, which comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, hasn’t been available to actually buy in North America. The company had told &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/03/oneplus-delays-sales-of-the-9-pros-969-base-model/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; on April 3rd&lt;/a&gt; that the base version was still on the way, but now, according to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/14/the-969-base-model-oneplus-9-pro-is-never-coming-to-the-us/"&gt;a new statement given to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it actually won’t make its way to the US or Canada due to “unforeseen supply constraints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V23oP9"&gt;Here’s the full statement, from &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6KWun5"&gt;“The OnePlus 9 Pro 8x128 GB variant was originally set to be sold in North America for $969. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen supply constraints specific to North American devices, we recently concluded it is no longer possible to bring this configuration to the United States and Canada. In North America we are prioritizing the 12x256 GB version to ensure our users have access to the highest spec device.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wKPcL9"&gt;This decision means that that the only OnePlus 9 Pro model available for US and Canadian consumers is the more expensive $1,069 version with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. But if you’re looking for a more affordable OnePlus phone, the OnePlus 9 is still a good option, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;my colleague Allison Johnson’s review&lt;/a&gt;. While it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the 9 Pro, it starts at $729, making it $340 cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T says it will bring mmWave 5G to seven US airports this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YAK_Y4vUCoSNCnTOWhYM8bpwr8g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69582233/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company is partnering with Boingo to deploy 5G Plus in parts of US airports.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RwlOut"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has announced a partnership with Boingo Wireless to bring its fast mmWave 5G — which it calls 5G Plus — to more US airports, with a goal of seven by the end of the year and 25 by the end of 2022. That’s counting its &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/5g_plus_airports.html"&gt;first deployment in Tampa International Airport&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. There’s a little bit of a catch, though; travelers will only find 5G Plus in certain areas of the airport, like major gates and concessions areas. Still, it’s one place where range-limited but powerful mmWave might actually make sense. When else do you need to download an entire movie while you wait for your latte?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iC9Gnh"&gt;Boingo is known for providing Wi-Fi to air travelers, but what AT&amp;amp;T is deploying isn’t 5G-branded Wi-Fi. Any AT&amp;amp;T subscriber with the right phone and a 5G plan will be able to connect automatically to the network. As a reminder, not all 5G phones include mmWave support; the iPhone 12 and Galaxy S21 series do, but it’s scarcer among midrange and budget devices. And AT&amp;amp;T isn’t the only one teaming up with Boingo on airport 5G: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20827985/verizon-5g-indoor-boingo-partnership-problem-solution-phoenix"&gt;Verizon announced its own partnership in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and it currently offers its fastest 5G flavor in a dozen airports, including Tampa International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3Puhk"&gt;Bringing mmWave 5G from the outside to indoor locations presents some unique challenges: the higher frequencies it uses provide huge capacity and speeds but don’t travel far and are easily stopped by walls, windows, and other obstacles. However, according to AT&amp;amp;T’s SVP of Network Infrastructure Mo Katibeh, focusing deployment &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; high-traffic indoor locations is in many ways easier than bringing mmWave to an open-air location like a city block. Working with one building owner tends to be easier than with many building and land owners to lease space for equipment, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sT2uAf"&gt;Katibeh sees strategic 5G Plus deployments like these as an important piece of its overall 5G strategy in the next few years. Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, he emphasized that the company has first focused on extending its 5G coverage nationwide, using mmWave for dense urban areas and venues, which he says are the places “where 5G plus really shines.” Verizon, on the other hand, put more emphasis on mmWave 5G early on, which &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/the-age-of-mmwave-5g-sputters-to-dusty-death/a/d-id/770838?"&gt;hasn’t panned out very well&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.opensignal.com/2021/07/13/quantifying-the-mmwave-5g-experience-in-the-us-july-update"&gt;according to Open Signal&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon users that it tracked over a recent 90-day period spent less than 1 percent of the time connected to mmWave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRIpGn"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T still has plenty to prove with its 5G network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;after a rocky start&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, the company made a bunch of other partnership announcements today, mostly centered on entertainment and augmented reality applications. The company has introduced interactive AR &lt;em&gt;Space Jam&lt;/em&gt; characters, thanks to &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/5g_facebook.html"&gt;a partnership with Facebook Reality Labs&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s working on &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/newsroom/2021/5g_nba_wnba.html"&gt;more AR features for the WNBA’s app&lt;/a&gt;, among other things. While potentially useful and sensible 5G developments are underway, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"&gt;the 5G hype machine&lt;/a&gt; sure hasn’t gone anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9QXXG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction July 14th, 3:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Mo Katibeh is the Senior Vice President of AT&amp;amp;T Network Infrastructure and Build. A previous version of this article misspelled his last name as Kabiteh; we regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s new filter blocks spoofed phone numbers that are too close to yours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zmeq82VnnfNfhyIc8T3ld_6wExA=/98x0:1133x690/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572851/Call_Filter_Hero_image_0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon rolls out new Neighborhood Filter tool to help curb spoofed calls.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Verizon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PDSTGH"&gt;Verizon wants to help curb those obnoxious “spoofing” calls from similar area codes to your own with a new tool called Neighborhood Filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtWjZ6"&gt;Spoofing is the method used by spammers to make a number appear similar to your own so you’re more likely to answer the call. Verizon’s new Neighborhood Filter will allow Verizon customers to send these calls directly to voicemail, as well as any other prefix and area code combinations that the company thinks might be suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOjJ2x"&gt;The tool is available to Call Filter Free and Call Filter Plus customers through the company’s separate &lt;a href="https://myvpostpay.verizon.com/ui/acct/secure/productApps/downloads/sfo120005"&gt;Call Filter&lt;/a&gt; app. Call Filter Free costs nothing to enroll and offers basic filtering from those dreaded and persistent spam calls. Call Filter Plus, which costs an additional $3 per month per line (or $8 per month for three or more lines), comes with additional tools like access to a database of over 100 million spam numbers, a personal block list, and a spam risk meter for real-time call assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eFCXkL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The tool should help make spam calls a little less painful&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qk1jOD"&gt;To activate the Neighborhood Filter for blocking spoofed calls, head to the Call Filter app on your mobile device. (If you’re on iOS, you’ll need to toggle on filtering from your Call Blocking and Identification in your Phone settings.) From the lower navigation menu on the main screen in the app, select Management. From this menu, select Other Filters. Here, you should see the Neighborhood Filter, which will prompt you to enter a six-digit prefix and area code similar to your number. Make sure to toggle it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwHfDi"&gt;Verizon launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/28/18285643/verizon-spam-calls-robocalls-blocking-identifying-service"&gt;free version&lt;/a&gt; of its call filtering tool in 2019. Prior to that, it charged $3 per month for its call filtering tools, even while those services were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/30/15906800/verizon-anti-spam-robocall-call-blocking-att-t-mobile"&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; through some of its competitors T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWFAlX"&gt;From your Spam Filter settings in the Call Filter app — whether you’re paying for it or not — you’ll be able to determine how you want spam calls to be filtered. Blocked calls can either be terminated or sent to voicemail based on your selection. This menu will also let you determine how you want calls flagged based on a perceived level of risk. The Call Filter &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/call-filter/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;app is available&lt;/a&gt; both on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
