    <title>Samsung launches EKG support for latest Galaxy Watch devices in 31 more countries</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vr5afU"&gt;Samsung has launched support for electrocardiogram (EKG) readings and blood pressure monitoring on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20903452/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-fitness-tizen-apps-features-android-price"&gt;Galaxy Watch Active 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Watch 3&lt;/a&gt; devices, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/ecg-support-for-galaxy-watch-2-galaxy-watch-3-rolling-out-to-31-markets/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The feature comes courtesy of the Samsung Health Monitor app, which is now available to download from the company’s app store in 31 additional countries. Prior to today, the features were restricted to owners of one of those two devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452541/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-active-2-ekg-ecg-electrocardiogram-update"&gt;in South Korea and the US only&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYgQdV"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251411/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-active-2-ekg-blood-pressure-health-monitor"&gt;first announced last month&lt;/a&gt; it would be adding the features to its latest Galaxy Watch devices through software updates, considering both smartwatches have the requisite sensors used for measuring heart rate and blood pressure and performing an EKG. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5IgP8dTfI_Iz4vIYnji5V5zCOPw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320177/Watch3_Three_UIs_ECG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fDLB4N"&gt;Now, users in 31 more countries — mostly in Europe — should have access after Samsung was given the CE marking clearance for its Samsung Health Monitor app in the EU. That regulatory approval signals the software meets the health and safety standards required for distribution in the region. &lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;notes you’ll need the app downloaded and updated to the latest version on both a compatible Galaxy Watch and Samsung phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPFhQh"&gt;The full list of countries includes Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UAE, and the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s Mate X2 foldable adopts Samsung’s dual-screen design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s1J-_p6smxsTD9tnRewI5aZrcjM=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68853932/image_178.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mate X2 has an 8-inch screen that folds inward.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dVrUeQ"&gt;Huawei has announced the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Fphones%2Fmate-x2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22294983%2Fhuawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mate X2&lt;/a&gt;, its first all-new foldable device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238269/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-price-release-date-specs-mwc-2019"&gt;since 2019’s Mate X&lt;/a&gt;. The new phone has received a radical redesign compared to the original device, with a large screen that unfolds from the inside of the device rather than around the outside. For using the phone while folded, the Huawei Mate X2 has a second screen on its outside, similar to Samsung’s approach with the Galaxy Fold series. Images of the phone were leaked minutes ahead of its official announcement by &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/huawei-mate-x2-first-official-images-1613994247-1984855950"&gt;Evan Blass on &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUTUPv"&gt;This being a Huawei device, the Mate X2 will launch without support for Google’s apps or services, which is likely to severely limit its appeal outside of China. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Fphones%2Fmate-x2%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22294983%2Fhuawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Huawei’s site&lt;/a&gt;, the phone will run on EMUI 11.0 based on Android 10. However, during its live stream, the company said it plans for the Mate X2 to be among the first phones to be updated to its own operating system, HarmonyOS, starting in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjKndz"&gt;The internal screen on the Mate X2 measures 8 inches with a resolution of 2480 x 2200, while the exterior screen is 6.45 inches with a 2700 x 1160 resolution. Both are OLED and have refresh rates of up to 90Hz. They’re also both slightly bigger than the 7.6-inch internal display and 6.2-inch external displays found on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;. Internally, the phone is powered by the company’s flagship Kirin 9000 chip, the processor that debuted in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529915/huawei-mate-40-pro-hands-on"&gt;Mate 40 Pro&lt;/a&gt; last year. This is paired with 8GB of RAM and a battery with a rated capacity of 4,400mAh that can be fast-charged at up to 55W. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Yg-uODZq9hpnIhWL4-EpjdiE2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320067/msedge_6RvUDEI1g5.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Huawei&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mate X2 is available in four colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GsHFfr"&gt;There are four cameras on the rear of the phone: a 50-megapixel wide-angle, a 16-megapixel ultrawide, a 12-megapixel telephoto with a 3x optical zoom, and an 8-megapixel “SuperZoom” camera with a 10x optical zoom. The selfie camera on the outside of the phone has a 16-megapixel resolution, and there doesn’t appear to be a selfie camera in or around the foldable inner screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMPOaj"&gt;The Mate X2 is technically the third phone in Huawei’s foldable lineup. Last year, it released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;Mate XS&lt;/a&gt;, an updated version of the original Mate X, which featured a more durable display and faster Kirin 990 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjsHSx"&gt;Huawei says the Mate X2 will be available in China with 256GB of internal storage for ¥17,999 (around $2,785) or for ¥18,999 (around $2,940) with 512GB of storage. Available colors include blue, pink, black, and white. It’ll be available to buy in China on February 25th, but it’s unclear when the phone could be released outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oatmeal’s creator says his new game is a way to ‘play the comic’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Comic-Con International 2014 - Day 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BrlV92tZLzkZlnYs9emVkFrDbxQ=/0x73:2000x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68847517/452705690.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Daniel Knighton / WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="00tbrs"&gt;The creator of &lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt;, Matthew Inman, released a new cat-themed mobile word game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278773/kitty-letter-mobile-game-ios-android-the-oatmeal-exploding-kittens"&gt;called &lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that feels like playing one of his silly comic strips. That feeling was intentional, Inman told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwvZN4"&gt;“My comics have always been rhetorical,” he said. “You don’t interact with the comic, you have no say in it, you’re just experiencing it. So, with [&lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;], I got a chance to introduce some elements where people get to play the comic, and I thought that was a lot of fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtO5ki"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt; has a structure that Inman described as “&lt;em&gt;Scrabble&lt;/em&gt; combined with &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt;.” Your goal is to beat your opponent by spelling words from a combination of letters at the bottom of your phone’s screen. When you spell a word, you’ll send a small army of cats up an invisible “lane” toward your opponent. Meanwhile, your opponent is sending armies of cats to try and defeat you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UFbbBu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dbI4NA6K63I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H6K8fD"&gt;The game was actually going to be multiplayer-only at first, Inman told me. This might be surprising for those who’ve played the game, since it has a robust story mode spanning 13 chapters. But that story mode was born from creating the game’s tutorial, said Inman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQDdsc"&gt;“I started drawing this tutorial on how to play, and then the tutorial became that single-player mode, where you have this neighbor that moves in and tells the whole story about him,” Inman said. But then, he realized, “I got in too deep. I had written all this stuff, I was like, ‘I have to end this,’ and I ended up writing like 12 chapters. But it became my favorite part of the whole thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99w4WH"&gt;Inman also discussed the game’s free-to-play model, which is very generous. Unlike many free-to-play games, &lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter’s&lt;/em&gt; single-player story mode and multiplayer are completely free, with no restrictions. The decision to offer all of that came from what Inman disliked about other free games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43BnPa"&gt;“I play free-to-play games, but I play them because I like the games,” Inman said. “The actual mechanics involved, like grinding and unlocking chests and getting gems and coins, I hate them. I fucking hate them. If [developers] were like, ‘pay us $20 and we’ll give you everything,’ I would do that. I much prefer that model.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxNC8R"&gt;The game does offer paid cosmetics for multiplayer, but they don’t provide any gameplay benefit and they’re buried in a menu. And Inman says that revenue from them has been “pretty much non-existent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EfuEXM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Kitty Letter is a new mobile word game from the creator of The Oatmeal, and it’s good","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278773/kitty-letter-mobile-game-ios-android-the-oatmeal-exploding-kittens"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="n0IOEg"&gt;Inman acknowledged that he can offer the game largely for free because of his other successful ventures, which include&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/28/7927121/exploding-kittens-most-backed-kickstarter-project-ever"&gt;hugely successful card game Exploding Kittens&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m not just some altruistic guy that doesn’t want to make a living from his work,” he said. “To be completely candid, we make a great living from our card games, and we make a great living from some of the other things that I do. With [&lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;], it felt like we could just get away with making it as enjoyable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTJ8Vt"&gt;“This app more generates that currency of — and this is so fucking corny — currency of love and joy, like you have a joyful experience with the game,” he said. “So, in turn, you love Exploding Kittens more, and maybe one day, if you want to buy a card game from us, you can.” It’s a business model similar to that of &lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt;. Inman offers the comics for free online, but sells books and has offered merch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="utkPUl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was cats from day one”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IBCcn6"&gt;Inman has a lot of ideas for what’s next for the game. He’d like to improve the arcade mode, add more single-player levels, and squash bugs. He’d also like to port the game to Steam and the Nintendo Switch, but those might be a little further away. “I would probably call it six months,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz63Ig"&gt;And I had to ask: were cats always the focus of the game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUI9AQ"&gt;“It was cats from day one,” Inman said. “It was called &lt;em&gt;Cats Royale&lt;/em&gt;, originally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPYzum"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztD67Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Australia’s ABC News shot to the top of the App Store charts following Facebook’s news ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yb82vmdANKzGW2j2LQPDDeuIAa4=/233x522:1793x1562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68844399/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_8.51.34_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ABC News&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R6m0UT"&gt;The Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s ABC News app shot to the top of Apple’s App Store charts in Australia over the course of the last few days, not long after Facebook banned Australian news sources on its platform. As &lt;em&gt;Financial Times’ &lt;/em&gt;Uma Patel suggests &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/umabp/status/1362714384368361477?s=20"&gt;in a tweet thread&lt;/a&gt;, that’s possibly because ABC capitalized on Facebook’s news ban with an ad sending users to its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj4g75"&gt;ABC News currently sits at No. 2 in the App Store’s overall app rankings in Australia, according to the analytics firm &lt;a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/"&gt;App Annie&lt;/a&gt;, and No. 1 in the news app charts. When Patel noticed the change, the app was also briefly No. 1 overall, ahead of Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and the Facebook app itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qFkBnJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;ABC has used facebook's ban to prompt visitors to download its app.. it became the most downloaded app in Australia.... although the next four are all owned by Facebook and the 6th is a company fb tried to buy &lt;a href="https://t.co/jGxeXYxv6x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jGxeXYxv6x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Uma Patel (@umabp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/umabp/status/1362714384368361477?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MDiF39"&gt;Facebook’s ban was in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;an expansive Australian regulatory measure&lt;/a&gt; that will force tech platforms to pay Australian media companies for the content users share (and that platforms earn ad revenue from). Facebook took issue with the change and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;prohibited Australian news and media organizations&lt;/a&gt; from sharing news posts, and Australian users from seeing news from international sources as well. The ban also seemed to accidentally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288256/facebook-australia-news-ban-governmental-agency-accounts"&gt;wipe out the posts&lt;/a&gt; from government pages and some other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/StT4aNIHgZhgr9gzqM_12d_aBek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315492/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_8.51.34_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ABC News&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC News’ banner ad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YJubEU"&gt;Facebook’s ban dramatically shrunk the audience for some Australian news outlets, sending traffic down 93 percent the day after the ban was put in place, &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/02/in-australia-facebooks-ban-on-sharing-news-stories-has-sent-publishers-traffic-tumbling/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NiemanLab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But ABC News responded by &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news"&gt;adding a banner&lt;/a&gt; to its home page. “Missing our news on Facebook?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Get the latest news and live notifications with the ABC News app,” it reads. Since then, the app has risen from the high 400s to its current spot at No. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rV0MZe"&gt;Whatever the reason, readers heading directly to news sources over the social media sites that cannibalize them seems like a positive, and other news organizations could potentially take advantage of the ban in similar ways. It’s an unintended effect of Facebook’s hardline approach compared to its competitor Google, which struck a partnership deal with three of Australia’s largest media companies — &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-australia-news-technology-seven-west-media-2021-2#:~:text=Google%20signed%20up%20a%20major,force%20payments%20to%20media%20outlets."&gt;Seven West Media&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/17/nine-agrees-to-join-google-news-showcase-in-australia-for-reported-30m-a-year#:~:text=Australia's%20biggest%20locally%2Downed%20media,laws%20being%20debated%20in%20parliament."&gt;Nine Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/17/news-corp-agrees-deal-with-google-over-payments-for-journalism"&gt;NewsCorp&lt;/a&gt; — for its News Showcase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo Find X3 Neo leaks, showing off third handset in upcoming X3 lineup  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IYPAfAMFk3RMlM4_Q-6O4iJlpfg=/0x0:1078x719/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68841745/find_x3_neo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oppo Find X3 Neo.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.nieuwemobiel.nl/022356/16021/Exclusief-Alle-persafbeeldingen-van-de-Oppo-Find-X3-Neo-5G.html" target="_blank"&gt;NieuweMobiel.nl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zoieCF"&gt;Images of the unannounced Oppo Find X3 Neo have leaked again, this time giving us our best look yet at the third phone in Oppo’s upcoming Find X3 phone lineup, &lt;a href="https://www.nieuwemobiel.nl/022356/16021/Exclusief-Alle-persafbeeldingen-van-de-Oppo-Find-X3-Neo-5G.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NieuweMobiel.nl&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. As tipster Evan Blass has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1362703973522751489"&gt;subsequently pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, the handset appears to be a rebranded version of Oppo’s Reno5 Pro Plus 5G. The phone is expected to be announced next month alongside the Find X3 Pro and Find X3 Lite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYnlF5"&gt;Since the Find X3 Neo is based on an existing phone, we already have a pretty good idea of what its specs might be. These include a Snapdragon 865 processor, 4,500mAh battery with 65W fast charging, and a 6.55-inch 90Hz OLED display. Around back there are four cameras: a 50-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 13-megapixel telephoto, a 16-megapixel ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dNZCj4JGf0QZIF5sOLHXEy2sSiU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22314505/find_x3_pro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/oppo-find-x3-pro-first-official-images-1610466378-772606832" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oppo Find X3 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4LVmcn_D8aqFgjAdAfOE-_eIeBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22314504/find_x3_pro_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/oppo-find-x3-pro-first-official-images-1610466378-772606832" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oppo Find X3 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MyuaG6"&gt;The Find X3 Pro, meanwhile, appears to be an all-new device. Blass detailed many of its features in a &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/oppo-find-x3-pro-fussi-detailed-1607361964-1"&gt;post on &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last December, noting that it’ll be powered by a Snapdragon 888 processor and will have a 6.7-inch 1440p display with a dynamic refresh rate that goes up to 120Hz. It also has a 4,500mAh battery with support for 65W fast charging, but it’ll also be able to wirelessly charge at up to 30W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N91mR7"&gt;The Find X3 Pro’s cameras are particularly interesting. It’s reportedly got a pair of 50-megapixel sensors — one wide-angle and one ultrawide — as well as a 13-megapixel camera with a 2x optical zoom and a 3-megapixel macro camera. According to Blass, this macro camera could offer a 25x zoom, allowing it to work like a microscope. Check out more images of the upcoming phone &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/oppo-find-x3-pro-first-official-images-1610466378-772606832"&gt;over on &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zf5BhLI2sGUiGBCv0D6e-TH8mQI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22314507/2a78e57b7f5cc9b6fc8073d395b216cfedd3bc70779c4acef193f98d73e40ba9.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oppo Find X3 Lite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lwBc52"&gt;Finally there’s the Find X3 Lite, which &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/oppo-find-x3-lite-will-be-a-reno5-rebadge-1610105255-1817111864"&gt;Blass notes&lt;/a&gt; appears to be a rebranded Oppo Reno5 5G. That means it’s likely to have a 6.43-inch 90Hz OLED display and four rear cameras: a 64-megapixel wide camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth camera. Internally, it’ll be powered by a Snapdragon 765G, and there’s a 4,300mAh battery that’s also capable of 65W fast charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91Z1yv"&gt;All three phones are expected to be announced soon, with a release in April.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 developer preview feature roundup: improved emergency calls, bigger notifications, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AI3Ezq7mZQa4ZStX2MPROKiSB2I=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68839346/VRG_1777_Android_12_006.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DM9Pmo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;The Android 12 developer preview is out&lt;/a&gt;, and the internet is busy poring over it to find any new features or hints at the OS’s future. So far, there have been a few interesting things discovered, such as an Emergency SOS feature, some redesigns, and other useful, if minor, finds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2qBspY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-you-can-now-enable-or-disable-specific-app-quick-settings-media-controls/"&gt;The ability to prevent specific apps from showing media controls in quick settings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7RYQ6b"&gt;The ability to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-wifi-passwords-nearby-share/"&gt;wirelessly share Wi-Fi passwords to people nearby with the tap of a button&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R2QfJU"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-markup-screenshots/"&gt;update to Markup that lets you put emoji (and text) on screenshots&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lp8afp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362478110583775232"&gt;Bluetooth pairing options are now included in the media picker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="20Djz1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362463236294135812?s=20"&gt;A reduce bright colors accessibility option&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Rouxm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/18/gaming-with-a-controller-could-feel-a-lot-better-on-android-12/"&gt;Improved gamepad rumble support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tX9x3b"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/18/android-12s-new-toggle-design-is-big-and-bold-and-were-not-sure-what-to-think-of-it/"&gt;A toggle switch redesign&lt;/a&gt; (that looks really nice in my opinion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dbQGkK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/18/pixel-5s-hole-punch-can-be-hidden-on-android-12/"&gt;A developer option to hide the Pixel’s hole-punch camera cutout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CKGBLR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-pixel-launcher-4x5-grid/"&gt;The addition of a 4 x 5 grid option to the Pixel Launcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xQwE0S"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/18/android-12s-gestures-navigation-works-better-in-full-screen-and-immersive-views/"&gt;You can now gesture out of full-screen apps with a single swipe instead of two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="VSyb1A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/18/android-12-adds-emergency-sos-with-five-taps-of-the-power-button/"&gt;As pointed out by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Emergency SOS feature is also much easier to access now. Before, making an emergency call required you to hold the power button down, tap the emergency button, then tap twice on the Call 911 button. In Android 12, however, it can be activated by rapidly pressing the power button five times, which will trigger a countdown telling you that an emergency call is about to be placed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cl5aG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; notes that, by default, it calls 911. You can set it to call a different number, but if the number isn’t a government-run emergency line, your phone will have to be unlocked for the call to go through.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rl0gcF3ID8VwV9yKK6p3OuH3UxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313233/Screenshot_20210218_121043.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12 developer preview’s emergency call UI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oBs2NF"&gt;There have been a few minor redesigns of the &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-settings-app-gets-revamp-w-new-search-bar/"&gt;Settings app search bar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-lockscreen-and-notification-shade-media-player-gets-minor-ui-redesign/"&gt;the lock screen and notification media player&lt;/a&gt;, but Mishaal Rahman found a feature flag that “dramatically” changes the settings UI to be easier to use one-handed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zL3kvp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BIG change: If you enable the "Silky home" feature flag that I previously mentioned, you'll get a DRAMATICALLY changed Settings UI that's MUCH more one-handed friendly. Here are a few screenshots: &lt;a href="https://t.co/EcwqnU0LlB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EcwqnU0LlB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mishaal Rahman (@MishaalRahman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362462608826195976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sIbt8K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-settings-app-gets-revamp-w-new-search-bar/"&gt;has also found that some screens in the settings app&lt;/a&gt; have blue-tinted backgrounds. It speculates that it could be part of a rumored theming system, but at the moment, it seems very unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2s6V4j0taoI9ZQhK7Ddm-Wz7Tk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313204/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_12.43.18_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-settings-app-gets-revamp-w-new-search-bar/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5hJw8Y"&gt;Of course, notifications have also gotten a redesign, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-notifications-redesigned-w-bigger-icons-dedicated-snooze-button/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; noting&lt;/a&gt; that there’s a dedicated snooze button now, and the icon bubbles are now much larger. This looks like it reduces the density of notifications, but it’s still very early days for Android 12, so it’s possible changes could be made or toggles could be added to control whether you want to see the larger app icon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KUErMwjizN3A6eaHU8juCNCrMJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313267/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_1.07.22_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-notifications-redesigned-w-bigger-icons-dedicated-snooze-button/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The app icon bubbles are now larger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ2BNW"&gt;There are also a few features that are hinted at, or even have settings present, but currently don’t seem to work or aren’t enabled, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hpQbX6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-scrolling-screenshot/"&gt;Scrolling screenshots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eyLggC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-pixel-double-tap-gesture-assistant-columbus/"&gt;A Pixel 5 double-tap feature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lJruiC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362498569081618435"&gt;A one-handed mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sDPTlG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-privacy-toggles/"&gt;Privacy toggles to turn cameras and microphones off system-wide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="D98pvo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362518136113815556?s=20"&gt;Pinch-to-resize picture-in-picture video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Go0CgL"&gt;Given the early state of the developer preview, it’s not really meant for day-to-day use on your main phone. And as with all betas, these features and designs are subject to change in new releases. Still, it’s a tantalizing glimpse at the future of Android and the features Google is adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285299/android-11-beta-features-notifications-bubbles-permissions-smart-home-video-google"&gt;to an already feature-packed mature OS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOuK9b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 18th, 8:25PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added some new features that have been found since this article was first posted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp is having another go at explaining its privacy policy to users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="WhatsApp stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W8F9yHgB-gRXv5FBQwFwWmGhkHs=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838853/WhatsApp1_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cGM3dT"&gt;WhatsApp has a new plan to explain its contentious privacy policy — the one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;came under fire&lt;/a&gt; when users grew concerned the platform would share their messages with parent company Facebook. In an announcement on Thursday, the company explained how users can read through the new policy and learn how business and personal messages — which have different privacy standards — are handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaTmBM"&gt;The new privacy policy primarily concerns messaging businesses on WhatsApp and what parts of your data those businesses have access to. Most WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted, meaning they can only be accessed by the people actually talking. But WhatsApp also lets users message businesses, and those messages aren’t extended the same protections. The data in business messages can be used for commercial purposes like ad targeting on Facebook, and some of them are also stored on Facebook’s servers. WhatsApp’s privacy policy was an attempt to explain that change, but many users interpreted it as WhatsApp comprising the privacy focus it was known for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mk5JhiEgy3brAIplu44ieGNlXdI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312921/image002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: WhatsApp&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;WhatsApp’s new banner and privacy policy explainer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="92FNL4"&gt;Ahead of the new May 15th launch (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;moved from February 8th&lt;/a&gt;), WhatsApp plans to offer users the ability to review this new privacy policy inside its app. The company already tried to reassure users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22257721/whatsapp-status-privacy-facebook-signal-telegram"&gt;through WhatsApp’s Status feature&lt;/a&gt;, but now WhatsApp will include a banner that can be tapped to pull up the explanation of the new policy. The company says it will eventually remind users to read the new policy and accept it to continue using the app as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REd6tD"&gt;WhatsApp also notes that businesses pay for the right to use WhatsApp to reach customers, and that’s one of the ways WhatsApp is able to provide its app for free. The main features of WhatsApp remain as private as ever. Of course, it’s not as private as some users might think: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12638698/whatsapp-to-start-sharing-user-data-with-facebook"&gt;WhatsApp started sharing some personal information&lt;/a&gt; like phone numbers and profile photos with Facebook in 2016 to improve friend recommendations and ads on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R81gUH"&gt;WhatsApp’s tone in this redo of its policy change is somewhat apologetic. It didn’t explain what was changing well enough to users, and it’s owning up to that. But WhatsApp also managed to sneak in a dig at other companies that welcomed the exodus from WhatsApp prompted by the policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0irFGs"&gt;During this time, we understand some people may check out other apps to see what they have to offer. We’ve seen some of our competitors try to get away with claiming they can’t see people’s messages — if an app doesn’t offer end-to-end encryption by default that means they can read your messages. Other apps say they’re better because they know even less information than WhatsApp. We believe people are looking for apps to be both reliable and safe, even if that requires WhatsApp having some limited data. We strive to be thoughtful on the decisions we make and we’ll continue to develop new ways of meeting these responsibilities with less information, not more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gVSiP3"&gt;WhatsApp is obliquely referencing Telegram, an app that, along with Signal, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1349014065931284480%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F12%2F22226792%2Fwhatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;seemed to benefit&lt;/a&gt; from the confusion over what was changing in WhatsApp. Telegram &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-you-should-stop-using-telegram-right-now-1782557415"&gt;has dealt with its own criticism&lt;/a&gt; over not enabling end-to-end encryption by default — and clearly, WhatsApp doesn’t want you to forget that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to easily install the Android 12 developer preview</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9HBAEQVKp6e725lbGLfEysg0bU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66886289/jbareham_181010_2989_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlhtBR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 18th, 2:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Google released the first of its &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12 developer previews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, so we’ve updated the info in this post to be relevant if you want to install it on your phone. The instructional photos might include a mention of Android 11, but we’ve ensured the steps are still accurate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEa7Ku"&gt;You can try out the Android 12 developer preview software right now if you have a Pixel 3 or later, but it’s understandable if the idea of flashing your device to install the OS is intimidating. It can be a tricky process, and the steps differ slightly depending on what phone you have and what kind of computer you’re going to use to download the software. But Google itself makes this process much more streamlined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6mztn"&gt;Google’s &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/download"&gt;Android Flash Tool&lt;/a&gt; is a web application that handles most of the steps of flashing for you. There are a few steps that you’ll need to do yourself before the new software can be installed, which we’ll walk you through below, but Google’s tool basically eliminates most of the hassle and complexity that makes it easy to mess up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnBR1D"&gt;There are a few important notes to make up here at the top. First, once you flash your phone with the developer preview, your device will get all future developer preview and beta updates over the air. In other words, you won’t need to flash your phone again when new builds of Android 12 are released. Just head to your system settings and fetch an update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58Olby"&gt;The second note is just your standard disclaimer that you do this at your own risk. This is unfinished software, and installing it could lead to malfunctions with your device or to software that you usually use. And depending on settings that you adjust in the Android Flash Tool, you might have to wipe all of the data from your phone. So proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nIGG-Z2OspcNqk1d8fR6JICl6vc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19303885/vpavic_191018_3725_0231.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SPg2X6"&gt;Is my phone compatible with Android 12?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JOSEp5"&gt;The Android 12 developer preview is compatible with the Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3A, Pixel 3A XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, and the Pixel 5. It’s possible that Google will broaden the list of devices supported by Android 12 in the upcoming beta, but for now, you’ll need one of those phones to get the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nWnG91"&gt;What browser do I need to use to flash my phone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fwlb97"&gt;Google says that you can use any browser that supports the WebUSB API, which is supported by Chrome as well as Microsoft Edge version 79 and later. The Android Flash Tool works with all the major operating systems, including Linux, macOS, Chrome OS, and Windows 10, though browser compatibility may vary depending on your OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wxx6Rr"&gt;Step 1: Activate these three settings on your Android phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BMI7cK"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enable the Developer Options menu&lt;/strong&gt; in your phone. First, open the Settings app. For phones running Android 8 (Oreo), click System. Otherwise, if your phone has Android 7 (Nougat) or later, scroll down to About Phone, then find Build Number. Tap Build Number seven times to enable Developer Options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dO4knj"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Turn on USB debugging&lt;/strong&gt; (this lets your phone and computer communicate via USB) within the Developer Options menu. To do this, head to Settings &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Developer Options. You’ll find USB debugging with just a little scrolling down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ElHgpn"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enable OEM unlocking&lt;/strong&gt;. This option is also part of the Developer Options menu, further up the page than where you found USB debugging. If that option isn’t available for you to enable, that might be because it’s already enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csscsUs89Ir1CKE5Rd299XIo9bU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16213698/vpavic_190503_3404_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HzryhV"&gt;Step 2: Connect your phone to your computer and get started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OSeB6k"&gt;If you use Windows 10, &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb"&gt;you’ll need to install this driver&lt;/a&gt; first for your phone to be recognized.  People using macOS or Linux don’t need a driver. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="weswdD"&gt;Connect your phone to your computer with a USB cable. Then &lt;a href="https://flash.android.com/preview/dp1"&gt;visit this page to proceed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NbuEfq"&gt;The Android Flash Tool will ask for permission to access ADB keys in a pop-up window, which is necessary to install software on your phone. You’ll need to tap “OK” to proceed with this process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android Flash Tool for Android 11" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R3SlZ5sAdLEg5Bm14ClFdb7XjIs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20014977/4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll need to hit OK to proceed with the installation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WpBss1"&gt;Click “Select device.” Your device should appear in a pop-up window on your computer, so go ahead and click it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0ljh0M"&gt;Once you do that, you should now see a request on your phone that says “Allow USB debugging?” You’ll also see a long string of numbers and letters that should match up with what your PC shows if you click the gear icon on the Android Flash Tool page. On your phone, check the box next to “Always allow from this computer,” then tap Allow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jHjb7D"&gt;After that, your device should show up on the Android Flash Tool as being connected. Click on the box with the name of your device to proceed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oqEnVwEk_QE3UUVA0Z1kLBWYGvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20014998/8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once your device shows up as being connected, click into it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="sjTlzI"&gt;You’ll want to pay attention to what appears in the “Selected build” section of the Flash Tool (see below). It should say “Android 12 Developer Preview 1.” Before you hit the blue “Install” button at the bottom of the page, I recommend tapping the pencil icon next to “Selected build” and checking the “Lock Bootloader” box. This will lock the bootloader after this process is complete, leaving you with a more secure device than if it remained unlocked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n4ejoA2xy7n9DiZCVdq1AtGd6ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20014994/6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the “Lock Bootloader” option, which will lock your bootloader after the software installation is complete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="QyzbSn"&gt;The next window basically tells you to stop interacting with your phone during the rest of this process unless asked to do so and to not unplug your device. If you’re in a position to proceed, go ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRc70KHCAQGodzC1Gat0h2vS2PM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015001/1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make sure your data is backed up before you proceed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XlJyBQ"&gt;One more prompt before getting started: a license agreement. You need to agree to the terms of the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement, which you can find &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/terms"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0FIfKs"&gt;After you hit “I accept,” your phone will reboot into its bootloader screen. If nothing happens for a few seconds, don’t worry. You may also see a window pop up on your computer that says “Reselect your device.” In that case, leave your phone alone and select “Reselect device” on the computer. According to Google, your phone might be renamed “Android,” though it might just be identified with the model name (e.g., Pixel 3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Zdpkzo"&gt;If you haven’t flashed software before, Google will probably need to unlock your bootloader to proceed with the installation. Keep in mind that doing this will trigger a factory reset on your phone. If you haven’t backed up your data, you’ll lose everything. Once you agree, you’ll need to allow the bootloader to unlock on your phone. To do this, use the volume keys to navigate to the option that says “Unlock the bootloader,” then hit the power button once to confirm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0LiOV5"&gt;After that, the Android Flash Tool will begin to download and install the software. You can continue to watch along, but don’t touch your phone at this point, even though it will restart several times. Just keep an eye on the progress using the Android Flash Tool page on your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JAaw6d7-Vu3g4ted-MHrdzXS7bA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015017/9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At this point, you can just sit and wait for the Android Flash Tool to wrap things up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wQDNXV"&gt;Once you’re all done, the phone will reboot one last time, and over on your PC, you’ll be met with a celebratory screen. You’re all done! And thankfully, you won’t have to go through this process again for the next Android 12 update — easy as this was. You’ll automatically receive updates to the developer preview over the air.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WegRO7aOJMtF7tnpQvdwsPwvMN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015030/10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re all done!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JwgANf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 12 series is already driving 5G adoption in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3vAkeyL_t_xPNV7uq5rUlpNvT38=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832611/cgartenberg_201105_4276_006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The $1,099 iPhone 12 Pro Max is currently the top 5G phone in the US, according to research firm M Science.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ArLmxh"&gt;Some new data &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/one-phone-dominates-us-5g-sales-can-you-guess-what-it-is"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicates that the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-12-pro%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287683%2Fiphone-12-pro-max-5g-sales-adoption" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; Max, 12 Pro, and 12 are already the three top-selling 5G phones in the US. That the phones are just four months old speaks to the continued popularity of the iPhone in the US and just how big of a role it will play in driving 5G adoption in this country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04QSPM"&gt;These reports come from research firm M Science’s sales data and information gathered from Ookla Speedtest users. M Science tracks cumulative sales of 5G phones in the US. This data set includes sales as of the week of January 23rd and notably does not include Galaxy S21-series phones, which hadn’t started shipping at that point. These are third-party reports, so they should be taken with a grain of salt, but M Science’s findings line up with previous reports of &lt;a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/iphone-12-series-launch-review/"&gt;strong 12 Pro Max sales&lt;/a&gt; out of the gate and &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/iphone-12-mini-sales-reportedly-well-below-expectations/"&gt;less-good 12 mini sales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LSPm5E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is responsible for a bit less than half of all mobile phone shipments in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfB53P"&gt;Apple, as it is wont to do, took its time adding 5G to its phones. Samsung started in 2019 with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18231384/samsung-galaxy-s10-5g-verizon-announcement-specs"&gt;Galaxy S10 5G&lt;/a&gt; and added 5G &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21128230/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-ultra-price-camera-5g-features-video-hands-on"&gt;across its S20 series&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. Outside of those two manufacturers, 5G has trickled down from a once-premium feature into the budget phone class more recently. Despite this growing range of options, adoption has been slow. Since Apple is responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/us-market-smartphone-share"&gt;a bit less than half of all mobile phone shipments&lt;/a&gt; in the US, it makes sense that a 5G iPhone would give adoption rates a nudge. So far, that seems to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x21j74"&gt;In the US, 5G’s slow start certainly hasn’t been helped by a less-than-stellar product. While each major carrier offers nationwide 5G coverage, performance is often about the same as 4G — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196060/verizon-5g-slower-than-lte-speed-test"&gt;sometimes even worse&lt;/a&gt;. That’ll change when more spectrum becomes available to the carriers later this year and into next, but not before a lot of new iPhone 12 owners (unfortunately?) experience 5G for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will block Australian users and publishers from sharing news links in response to new bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s8H1TJFTo6zIjS1epADmSHhtp80=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831733/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RDeqE"&gt;Facebook has decided to block both Australian users and media companies from sharing links to news articles and related content on its main social network, following the country’s proposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;landmark regulatory measure&lt;/a&gt; that would force tech giants to pay Australian news organizations for using their content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcX3WV"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6652"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; passed the Australian House of Representatives today and is believed to have enough votes to pass the Senate, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/media/australia-google-pay-for-news.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The bill also targets Google, which at one point last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243468/google-threatens-to-remove-its-search-engine-from-australia-if-new-law-goes-into-effect"&gt;threatened to leave the country entirely&lt;/a&gt;. However, Google has since decided to start cutting deals with major Australian media organizations, like &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/02/17/news-corp-and-google-agree-to-global-partnership-on-news/"&gt;Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, to comply. Facebook, it appears, will not follow suit — for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DC2f8J"&gt;“The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content,” reads a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from William Easton, the managing director of Facebook Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand. “It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJHhnU"&gt;The policy change from Facebook will have stark consequences for both users and media organizations. Easton’s blog post outlines four distinct categories that will be affected and in what ways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Wc8FXj"&gt;Australian publishers: “They are restricted from sharing or posting any content on Facebook Pages. Admins will still be able to access other features from their Facebook Page, including Page insights and Creator Studio. We will continue to provide access to all other standard Facebook services, including data tools and CrowdTangle.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hkhp2I"&gt;International publishers: “They can continue to publish news content on Facebook, but links and posts can’t be viewed or shared by Australian audiences.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mCdssv"&gt;Australian users: “They cannot view or share Australian or international news content on Facebook or content from Australian and international news Pages.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cB095A"&gt;International users: “They cannot view or share Australian news content on Facebook or content from Australian news Pages.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qMuOuX"&gt;Facebook says it’s using a “combination of technologies” to restrict news content and it will have processes for reviewing content that was removed inadvertently, although it is not sharing those processes at this time. It also says the news content changes won’t affect any of the company’s other products or services in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Er8R0O"&gt;Easton’s blog post makes clear Facebook saw this measure as a last resort. The company cites statistics, like how news content makes up less than 4 percent of what people see in the News Feed and how Facebook drove an estimated AU$407 million in referrals to Australian news publishers, as reasons why it felt the bill unfairly penalizes tech platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z5H1kK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fECUJC"&gt;Facebook also draws a distinction between how news publishers and readers access news content on its social network versus Google’s search engine. “Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content. On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue,” Easton argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuF9M0"&gt;“We were prepared to launch Facebook News in Australia and significantly increase our investments with local publishers, however, we were only prepared to do this with the right rules in place,” Easton goes on. “This legislation sets a precedent where the government decides who enters into these news content agreements, and ultimately, how much the party that already receives value from the free service gets paid. We will now prioritise investments to other countries, as part of our plans to invest in new licensing news programs and experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;
