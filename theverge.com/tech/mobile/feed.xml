  &lt;p id="DBH7mo"&gt;The T-Mobile variant of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1600544-REG%2Foneplus_610214661821_7t_t_mobile_smartphone_frosted.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2020%2F12%2F28%2F22203289%2Foneplus-7t-sale-deal-b-and-h-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 7T is on sale at B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; for $300, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-7t-tmo%3Ffrom%3D7t&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2020%2F12%2F28%2F22203289%2Foneplus-7t-sale-deal-b-and-h-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;undercutting OnePlus’s own sale&lt;/a&gt; at $350. This matches the lowest price the phone has ever been, so if you’ve been looking for a flagship-specced phone at a budget price, this deal may be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnqpQD"&gt;This being the T-Mobile variant, there are some caveats that B&amp;amp;H lists on its site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WStSqS"&gt;The OnePlus 7T is an unlocked T-Mobile variant. It may be used in other parts of the world; however, LTE access may be limited or unsupported, depending on the network. Please choose your country/carrier above to confirm the network compatibility of this phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGLcV6"&gt;This phone may also be T-Mobile branded and come pre-loaded with T-Mobile firmware and applications. The phone was originally manufactured and locked for T-Mobile, but T-Mobile has since unlocked it for resale. The phone is new and not pre-owned, though the box has been opened in order to unlock the phone. The phone may be used on any compatible carrier; however, certain features like Wi-Fi tethering may not work on other carriers. The phone is also dependent on T-Mobile for software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Vqxk6w"&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540535/amazon-motorola-razr-fingerprint-folding-phones-screen-protection"&gt;don’t like the idea of the phone having previously been opened&lt;/a&gt;, you can also get a fully unlocked version for $350 from B&amp;amp;H, or the T-Mobile locked variant for $350 from OnePlus themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUJkAP"&gt;The 7T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20881638/oneplus-7t-review-specs-features-price-availability"&gt;was a good deal when it launched&lt;/a&gt; at $599, and has &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-7t-long-term-review-1164176/"&gt;only improved after a year of updates&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s worth remembering that you’ll be reliant on T-Mobile for those with this version). When compared to the market now, it does lack some features: it doesn’t have 5G, and it’s screen is slower at 90Hz &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"&gt;than its successor’s&lt;/a&gt;, which runs at 120Hz. But if you value savings more than those features, you may want to hop on the deal — it expires this Wednesday, December 31 at 11:59PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s Mi 11 announced with Snapdragon 888 and 120Hz OLED display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAEq6xpraw7ojkKZx2URtoWIbOI=/0x0:678x452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68589222/Xaomi_Mi11_series.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Xaomi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7tA1G3"&gt;Xiaomi has announced their new flagship for 2021: the Mi 11. The Chinese variant of the phone sports a modified design and upgraded specs that give a good look at the kind of high-end features top Android phones will ship with in the coming year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16339/xiaomi-announces-mi11-first-snapdragon-888-device"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There’s bound to be some changes to the European and global versions of the Mi 11, but for now this is an early peek into what’s likely to be 2021’s first major Android flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaGmfR"&gt;The changes to the design of the Mi 11 in comparison to the Mi 10 appear minor. From the front, the display is slightly larger at 6.81-inches in comparison to the Mi 10’s 6.67-inch screen. That extra space seems to have come from shrinking the bezels of the device (always welcome), while increasing the height and maintaining the curved sides and hole-punch camera on the front. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3M3vWuAnyO7kt4x45XeYG4-LjsU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22200423/Xaomi_Mi11_frontback.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Xaomi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xiaomi Mi 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KpmSyt"&gt;What’s more exciting is the 3200x1440 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate on the new OLED display, two features that have fast become must-haves on modern flagships, though of course they’re sorely missed on the latest iPhones. In another notable difference, the Mi 11 will also feature an under-display fingerprint sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9GMNo"&gt;The back of the Mi 11 holds the more visible changes. The iPhone X-esque vertical camera “pill” of the Mi 10 is gone, and in it’s place is a thin glass “layer cake.” The Mi 11 features three rear cameras: a 108 megapixel main sensor, a five megapixel telephoto, and a 13 megapixel ultra-wide. The Mi 11 also has faster 50W wireless charging (previously on the Mi 10 Pro) to pair with its 4600mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzbC8h"&gt;Moving from the battery to the rest of the internals, the Mi 11 is powered by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;the Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; and offers either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. Storage starts at 128GB or 256GB, which is unfortunately still generous in the smartphone world. Like most new smartphones, the Mi 11 also has Wi-Fi 6 and support for 5G. Notably missing from the Mi 11 is a charging brick. The CEO of Xiaomi, Lei Jun, confirmed the Mi 11 will follow in Apple and (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197394/samsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt;) Samsung’s footsteps in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/26/22200610/xiaomi-ceo-phone-no-charger-mocking-apple-iphone"&gt;removing the charging brick from the box&lt;/a&gt; for environmental and cost-saving reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajmHSG"&gt;The Chinese version of the Xiaomi Mi 11 is available for pre-order today, and will start shipping January 1st. The price for the entry level 8GB RAM/128GB of storage model is listed at ¥3999.00 (around $611). Details on the pricing and features of the other versions of the Mi 11 will come at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQTnro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T recovers from multi-state outage after Nashville bombing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="“Intentional” Explosion Rattles Nashville On Christmas Day" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VTorug-xz_DIIUBjfWbyolXxHg4=/0x64:3885x2654/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68588371/1293079213.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thaddaeus McAdams/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X9ClSY"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says its services &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/pages/disaster_relief/nashville.html"&gt;have mostly recovered&lt;/a&gt; from a bombing that caused multi-state internet outages on Christmas. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/26/us/nashville-bomb-explosion.html"&gt;The explosion of an RV in Nashville&lt;/a&gt; injured three people and destroyed a section of the city’s downtown, including “significant damage” to a key AT&amp;amp;T transmission facility. This brought down wireless and wired networks across parts of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama — disrupting cell service, some 911 networks, and communications at the Nashville International Airport, which briefly grounded flights as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATeyZA"&gt;The AT&amp;amp;T building, located blocks away from the company’s better-known office tower, provides a regional network connection point in addition to local service. The blast reportedly damaged the building’s structure and facade. Combined with water and fire damage, it disabled backup generators that were supposed to keep AT&amp;amp;T’s network functioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXDvFC"&gt;The result was days of partial service outages, mitigated partly by emergency cell sites. AT&amp;amp;T is also suspending data overage charges across parts of Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, and Missouri over the final five days of December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ycvaqx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T deployed portable cell sites around Nashville while rerouting regional network traffic and attempting to restore the building’s power. It reported on Sunday that it had restored 96 percent of its wireless network, 60 percent of business services, and 86 percent of consumer broadband and entertainment. As of today, “nearly all” consumer service had been restored. However, AT&amp;amp;T is maintaining 11 portable cell sites, and according to the company, it is still limiting power consumption in the building to avoid overloading its generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuhkYP"&gt;“We have begun to turn down portable sites that are no longer needed given the recovery of service,” said CEO Jeff McElfresh &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/pages/disaster_relief/nashville.html"&gt;in a statement on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, “but we will have resources standing by in the region as needed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYjc2k"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/27/us/anthony-quinn-warner-dead.html"&gt;Federal law enforcement named&lt;/a&gt; 63-year-old Anthony Quinn Warner as the bomber, and they’ve reported that Warner died in the explosion. Although Warner parked his RV close to the AT&amp;amp;T transmission building, investigators haven’t concluded whether he intentionally targeted it, nor have they declared a motive for the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVQIKs"&gt;Local news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.wsmv.com/news/fbi-agents-investigating-if-5g-paranoia-was-behind-nashville-bombing/article_952f937e-47f9-11eb-b1c3-bfda1689fb18.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSMV&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that law enforcement agents had asked an FBI tipster whether Warner might be motivated by 5G network paranoia — an unfounded conspiracy theory that has led people to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21276912/5g-conspiracy-theories-coronavirus-uk-telecoms-engineers-attacks-abuse"&gt;harass network engineers&lt;/a&gt; working on the tech. But the tipster, a real estate agent who had worked with a “Tony Warner,” said the man had not discussed 5G with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSGiPU"&gt;The FBI &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2020/12/27/downtown-nashville-explosion-terrorism-anthony-warner-motive/4055803001/"&gt;said on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that it was “still early in the investigation.” Whatever the motive, the bombing shook a significant section of American internet infrastructure for days — even if it’s now largely recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE Axon 20 5G teardown shows how the world’s first under-display selfie camera works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2SE8iGUcYuaSqb3Dwmvdau7kkTo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68587923/DSCF7470.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A2L0tq"&gt;The quest to banish the notch from modern smartphone design has resulted in some pretty clever innovations, the latest of which happens to be the under-display selfie cam on the ZTE Axon 20 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgczhJ"&gt;The 32-megapixel camera hiding underneath the screen didn’t quite impress us in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;our review of the device earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a worthy sidestep to the hole punch or the pop-up selfie cam we’ve seen in past devices. Now, a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2J_5JnqQ8Y"&gt;new teardown video from YouTuber JerryRigEverything&lt;/a&gt; gives us a closer look at how exactly the Axon 20’s under-display camera works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8OXmQ"&gt;Beyond being just a generally insightful breakdown of the various components of a modern smartphone, the Axon 20 teardown shows us how ZTE is actually using two screens stacked on top of one another (a small, square, and low-resolution one on top of the selfie cam and the OLED top panel) to let the under-display camera peer out toward the user from beneath the top layer display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yW1AU"&gt;It’s a first-gen device, but it’s undoubtedly a signal of where phone design will go in the future, as companies aim to preserve the edge-to-edge display without compromising on notches and cutouts for things like selfie cams and fingerprint scanners. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now reserve a preorder for Samsung’s Galaxy S21</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVNpLnt6J04v6TrOVg7IxmoO4A4=/52x0:616x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68587701/samsung_galaxy_s21_668_leak.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UTr0uz"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 lineup of phones will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;reportedly debut on January 14th&lt;/a&gt;. If there’s even a slight chance you might pick one up, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can now place a reservation&lt;/a&gt; to guarantee a preorder slot when those become available, which they usually do right after an Unpacked event ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MauAqD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s page&lt;/a&gt; will take down some basic information like your name, email address, and zip code in exchange for dibs on buying one of these new phones. You won’t pay anything to reserve your preorder — Samsung will collect that once you actually order the phone yourself. But what you can also do now is get a quote for a phone you might like to trade in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VzbT3"&gt;You can get up to $700 of instant trade-in credit toward the purchase of a Galaxy S21 if you trade an iPhone 12 series phone, or one of Samsung’s own Note 20 and S20 phones. It’s even offering up to $550 of trade-in credit for certain phones with cracked screens. Samsung just &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wants you to preorder one of these new phones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung reservation page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uU72Ifc_EzhWQygEdN3FUOzIXqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22200108/galaxys21reservation.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung isn’t showing off the Galaxy S21 yet, but it will soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CWqc09"&gt;Reserving one of Samsung’s upcoming phones before the preorders begin will net you $50 to use on accessories like smartwatches and earbuds, and by using the Shop Samsung app for Android, you’ll get an extra $10 on top of that. There’s usually another nice preorder perk announced when the phones launch. For previous launches, Samsung has offered at least $100 in gift cards in addition to other goodies, so it should be a great value if you’re in the market for a new device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeAHy2"&gt;You’ll likely want to catch up on the rumors and leaks if you haven’t already, as there are plenty of them. For starters, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;Samsung itself confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the Galaxy S21 will support the S Pen stylus. We’ve also seen what appears to be a leak of the official teasers for the S21 series, showing off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;some phone colors and the revamped rear camera array&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Your guide to the current state of 5G carrier plans in the US, what they cost, and whether it’s worth upgrading your plan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0STAxL"&gt;You’re the proud owner of a new 5G phone — congratulations! We’ve got some bad news, though: if you live in the US, 5G &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/study-finds-that-us-5g-speeds-are-slower-than-14-other-countries"&gt;probably isn’t going to be the mind-bogglingly fast experience&lt;/a&gt; that you’ve been promised. For most regions, it’s just a little faster than the 4G speeds we’re used to using. But here’s the good news: 5G is going to get better, so if you have a 5G phone you may want to make sure your plan delivers it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUbp57"&gt;If you got a phone recently, there’s a good chance it supports 5G. Pretty much every new phone in 2021 — with the exception of some budget models — will offer some form of 5G support. Whatever your preferred brand or operating system, 5G is coming your way soon if you don’t have it already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1ylmN"&gt;Your phone is ready for the next big thing, but what about your data plan? Across the board, the major US carriers’ unlimited plans already include access to 5G. However, carriers offer a mix of 5G bands that vary in speed and coverage. It’s complicated, as all things 5G have been since it first appeared in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ov9vPM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s complicated, as all things 5G have been since it first appeared in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AeQgSC"&gt;Consider this your guide to the current state of 5G and data plans in the US — which ones include 5G, which don’t, what variety of 5G they include, and whether you should consider upgrading depending on your carrier’s implementation of 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7M860"&gt;One important note for those with a 5G phone: even if you discover that your current plan does include 5G and it’s available in your area, you may still need to upgrade to a new SIM card if you moved it over from an older device. A SIM card that was activated in a 4G device will still work with a 5G device, but you may have trouble connecting to the 5G network. Check with your carrier if you’re not seeing the little 5G logo pop up on your screen and you think you should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6877V"&gt;For comparison purposes, the prices listed in this article are for one line of service per month before taxes and fees. Additional lines bring down the monthly cost per line, but your total bill increases, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5eQLb4"&gt;Verizon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E2ySFp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Unless you live in one of the few areas with Verizon’s truly fast UW 5G, we don’t think there’s a reason to change your plan just yet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yeRjtT"&gt;Verizon offers two varieties of 5G, the faster of which it calls “Ultra Wideband” (also referred to as millimeter wave or mmWave) and is available only in certain parts of certain cities. It’s scarce, but it is mind-bogglingly fast, and you’ll see a 5G UW logo on your phone screen if your phone is using that network. Oh, and 5G UW signals don’t reach indoors for the most part, so if you’re spending most of your time inside your house or apartment right now, you probably wouldn’t pick it up even if you live in a place where it’s available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="vsmFJ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ultra Wideband is scarce but mind-bogglingly fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="AxSy3H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wnDLVU"&gt;“Nationwide” is the company’s other 5G, a low-band variety that’s slower than mmWave but offers much broader coverage. In fact, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/heres-why-verizon-iphone-users-must-turn-off-5g-right-now"&gt;sometimes a bit slower than 4G&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re not happy with the 5G speeds you’re getting, you may want to try limiting your phone to LTE and see if things improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wc9Ye8"&gt;Check &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fcoverage-map%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s coverage map&lt;/a&gt; to see what’s available in your area. If you do live in a city with UW 5G, be sure to zoom &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way in to see the exact areas and streets with coverage — they’re marked in a darker shade of red that will appear once you zoom in close enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt3rAT"&gt;Verizon’s Shared Data (data capped) plans and its $80-per-month basic unlimited plan include the lower-tier Nationwide 5G only. For access to UW in addition to Nationwide 5G, you’ll need at least the $90 “Play More” unlimited plan. Verizon offers $10 off those monthly prices if you enroll in auto pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkrFa3"&gt;Verizon also includes 5G on its prepaid data plans, which start at $65 per month for unlimited data or $40 per month for a 5GB data-capped plan. There’s a $5 monthly discount for auto pay as well. For now, UW 5G isn’t available for prepaid customers, but Verizon says that’s changing in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H6XaJU"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dGY28e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Don’t worry about switching up your AT&amp;amp;T plan for 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Rje9sa"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s history with 5G is… fraught. Early on, the company marketed what was essentially LTE technology as “5G E” and (rightfully) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;caught a lot of flak for it&lt;/a&gt;. You won’t see that term in any of the company’s marketing these days, but AT&amp;amp;T customers still might see a 5G E logo on their phone screen when connected to this service. If you do see it, know that what you’re getting is not really 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;
&lt;aside id="P0HVlL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G really isn’t worth upgrading for yet, but if you’re on any of the company’s unlimited plans, you wouldn’t need to anyway&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="gXk39F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248430"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C6XNQm"&gt;Outside of that debacle, AT&amp;amp;T has invested in its true 5G offerings, which are structured similarly to Verizon’s: a fast mmWave version called 5G Plus in limited places and slower but more widespread standard 5G coverage. However, 5G Plus may be even more scarce than Verizon’s UW 5G. The company doesn’t provide any coverage maps for it, and it says only that it is deployed in “select innovation zones” in parts of certain cities. Testers for &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks/2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;’s annual mobile network test&lt;/a&gt; didn’t encounter 5G Plus in cities where AT&amp;amp;T offers it. The carrier’s standard 5G is of the low-band variety similar to Verizon’s Nationwide, and &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; testers also found that it sometimes lagged behind 4G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCcuum"&gt;All of this is to say that AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G really isn’t worth upgrading your plan for yet, but if you’re on any of the company’s unlimited plans, you wouldn’t need to anyway. Both 5G and 5G Plus are included in all postpaid unlimited plans, which start at $75 per month ($65 with auto pay). The Unlimited Plus prepaid plan also includes it at $75 per month ($60 with auto pay). AT&amp;amp;T’s only postpaid 4GB data-capped plan doesn’t include 5G and neither do its other prepaid plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNimDg"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T may have had a somewhat rocky start with 5G, but the technology will improve. And for now at least, the company isn’t charging a premium for its fastest 5G variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5N4Cb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fmaps%2Fwireless-coverage.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T 5G coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZW3lLd"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="z7bVnx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: All of T-Mobile’s postpaid plans include 5G. If you’re on the base unlimited plan and live in a congested area you might find you have more reliable access to 5G by upgrading. But no need if you don’t notice slowdowns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PxCgUp"&gt;Of the three big carriers, T-Mobile might be in the best position to bring truly faster-than-LTE 5G to the most people — but it doesn’t seem to be there quite yet. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s efforts have been concentrated around high and low-band offerings. T-Mobile offers both, too, but it’s also working on converting Sprint’s former midband frequencies to 5G. This might be a sweet spot: not as fast as the mmWave stuff, but genuinely faster than 4G. &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/race-to-5g-5g-limps-to-nationwide-status"&gt;Recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; shows the network isn’t delivering on that promise just yet, but T-Mobile promised to extend midband 5G to 100 million people by the end of this year and doesn’t look to be slowing down any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpSW0x"&gt;All of the company’s postpaid plans include 5G, starting with the $65 per month ($60 with autopay) Essentials plan. One caveat: customers on that base-level plan are the first ones subject to slowdowns when the network is congested. T-Mobile does not offer 5G on its prepaid plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="wjFqsx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248478"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TFa17r"&gt;For now, we think T-Mobile customers can stay put on their current plan. Essentials plan customers who are happy with their network speeds and don’t notice slowdowns probably wouldn’t gain much from upgrading just yet. But it will be interesting to see if T-Mobile can make good on its ambitious promises to bring meaningfully fast 5G to more of its customers in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA0ipT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcoverage%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile 5G coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m4L2q7"&gt;US Cellular&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tQnXJX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: All plans (pre- and postpaid) include access to 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJEhwO"&gt;US Cellular 5G is of the low-band variety, so it’s still only a little faster than 4G. But the good news is if you’re on US Cellular, you have access to the company’s 5G: all plans (pre- and postpaid) include it. And if you’re in a rural area, US Cellular is more likely to offer 5G to you now, while major carriers’ coverage is still mostly concentrated around bigger cities. So there’s not much to deliberate here, if you have a 5G phone and your area is covered, you should be able to connect. We just wouldn’t advise anyone to switch to US Cellular only because it offers 5G where they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xH1tu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uscellular.com%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US Cellular coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x37LzS"&gt;MVNOs: Cricket, Metro by T-Mobile, etc.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jpsQGR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: If you’re happy with your MVNO plan, don’t switch things up just for 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAFgq4"&gt;Most mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs, do include 5G on their plans. Cricket’s unlimited plan offers 5G access using AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network ($60 per month for one line). All Mint Mobile plans include access to 5G on T-Mobile’s network, and Metro by T-Mobile prepaid plans come with 5G access, starting with a 10GB plan for $40 / month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rpGfnM"&gt;A significant caveat though: since MVNOs don’t own the networks they use, carrier subscribers are likely to get preferential treatment when there’s congestion. If you’re looking for the best of the best speeds, one of the big three might be the way to go. But again, that reality is still a ways off. Chances are, you wouldn’t be upgrading to a night-and-day experience if you did switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gExXvj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9hcLa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s nationwide 5G can be slower than its LTE network, tests show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ey6Zvi67ahwauofHpqKcjEfHho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569332/vzw-042.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoFTeg"&gt;Verizon’s new nationwide 5G network is reportedly slower than its LTE network, to the point that users are apparently better off just disabling 5G entirely unless they’re near a mmWave network. The results come from &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/heres-why-verizon-iphone-users-must-turn-off-5g-right-now"&gt;testing done by &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;’s Sascha Sagan&lt;/a&gt;, who points to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509364/verizon-5g-network-ultra-wideband-nationwide-apple-event"&gt;Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, or DSS&lt;/a&gt;, as the culprit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8EPRy"&gt;The tech lets carriers run LTE and 5G networks side by side, which is useful if, like Verizon, you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418981/verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-auction-winner-fcc-dish"&gt;don’t yet have enough dedicated 5G spectrum&lt;/a&gt;. While the carrier has largely focused on its mmWave network until recently, it also has begun rolling out a mid-band nationwide 5G network, which promises to avoid mmWave’s range issues by using DSS. The only catch is that, with Verizon, it seems like this tech leads to worse performance in most cases for phones running in 5G mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ggJFH4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It may be worth checking to see if you’re actually getting faster speeds with 5G on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8WWL2r"&gt;The solution, at least for now, is to just turn 5G off if you’re a Verizon customer. If that has your concerned about speeds compared to your T-Mobile customer friends, don’t worry too much: in it’s &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks/2020"&gt;nationwide speed test&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; found that T-Mobile’s 5G can often still be slower than Verizon’s LTE, even though it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418289/t-mobile-mid-band-5g-81-new-cities-towns-coverage-gigabit-speeds"&gt;uses dedicated 5G bands&lt;/a&gt;. That same nationwide test also revealed that AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G can be slower than its LTE as well — which makes sense, given that it also uses the DSS technology for it’s 5G network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAZuIE"&gt;The results from &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; were only done in New York City, so if you have a 5G phone on Verizon, it may be worth checking to see if you’re actually getting faster speeds with 5G on. If you’re not, it may be worth turning it off entirely for now. This is also likely just a temporary issue — as Verizon continues to add dedicated 5G spectrum, their speeds are going to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKURvA"&gt;It’s important to note that this doesn’t apply to Verizon’s mmWave technology, which is much faster than anything any other carrier has to offer. However, while mmWave &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8G_4FocrA&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;has the speed, it doesn’t have the range&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be blocked by trees, buildings, and sometimes even windows. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516518/apple-iphone-12-5g-uw-verizon-mmwave-logo-reveal-ad-chris-rock"&gt;if you often find that 5G UB logo&lt;/a&gt; popping up on your phone, and you need that speed, it may be worth keeping 5G on, even if it could lead to slow downs when you get outside its range.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile won’t claim it has a more reliable 5G network following ad board decision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/931zRO0Gh-AIwkcC0fag7OjUwyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562292/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWEAvQ"&gt;T-Mobile has been asked to stop advertising its 5G network as more reliable than the competition by the National Advertising Review Board (NARB), which investigated T-Mobile’s claims made primarily in an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F405228998&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F21%2F22193839%2Ftmobile-5g-reliability-claims-verizon-competition-nad#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad featuring celebrity scientist Bill Nye&lt;/a&gt; after complaints from Verizon earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koZpLU"&gt;But the NARB also says T-Mobile shouldn’t have to mention the speed of its network when broadly discussing coverage superiority in future ads. T-Mobile has said it will comply, but it cast the recommendations as a partial win in a statement saying it “appreciates that the panel agreed that T-Mobile can continue to advertise its superior 5G coverage without qualification.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2X7Y2"&gt;T-Mobile’s compliance is notable because telecom giants don’t have to follow the recommendations offered by the NARB, which, as a self-regulatory body under the umbrella of a nonprofit organization, has no governmental regulatory power. For instance, AT&amp;amp;T flatly ignored a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265048/att-5g-e-misleading-advertising-recommendation-narb"&gt;request it stop using its misleading “5G E” logo&lt;/a&gt; to reference a superior form of 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m4kXop"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile was using Bill Nye to tout its 5G networks as more reliable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TTIJbG"&gt;Today’s decision from the NARB breaks partly with the recommendation from the National Advertising Division (NAD), the other half of the self-regulatory body that oversees telecom advertising in the US. (The NARB is the appellate division, designed to settle disputes that arise when a company appeals a recommendation, as T-Mobile did.) The NAD &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/t-mobile-advised-to-stop-claims-about-5g-reliability"&gt;ruled in August&lt;/a&gt; that T-Mobile should have to disclose the speed of its network when claiming its 5G network offers superior reliability. T-Mobile appealed, kicking the decision to the NARB and resulting in a slightly more favorable outcome for T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aewelk"&gt;The video in question, one of a few starring Nye after he was hired by T-Mobile to be a king of 5G spokesman for the brand, features claims from Nye that Verizon’s 5G coverage, because it’s based on mmWave technology, has abysmal range equivalent to about the size of a bus stop. T-Mobile, because it was using much slower but more reliable low-band 5G, said its network had more reliable coverage while also making claims about superior reliability when compared to 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqHc8g"&gt;“Other carriers have 5G signals that drop if you move two feet. That’s because their 5G is based around millimeter wave, otherwise known as high band. For instance this is how far 5G reaches with our carriers,” Nye says in the video, showing a small red circle around an outdoor bus stop filled with mannequins. Nye then shows how moving the arm of one of the mannequins holding a smartphone from within the red circle to outside it would switch coverage from 5G to 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6en6Ft"&gt;The NARB says T-Mobile should “discontinue claims and an accompanying demonstration that imply that other carriers’ 5G coverage is so limited in any area as to cover only the space taken up by a single bench.” The board also recommended T-Mobile “discontinue claims that imply that its 5G service is generally available in locations that have traditionally been challenging for cellular service” unless it’s willing to say what speeds it can achieve in those locations. Lastly, T-Mobile can’t imply that its 5G coverage is more reliable than 4G coverage, either its own or that of competitors’ networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Yahy7"&gt;Here’s a more in-depth explanation from the NARB as to how it came to the conclusion that T-Mobile’s claims were misleading: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="zYegPw"&gt;The NARB panel determined that T-Mobile’s express reliability assertions would be understood as comparing its 5G network to 4G networks, and that this message cannot be supported based on coverage, as T-Mobile’s 5G network does not equal or surpass its own 4G coverage or that of competitors. Further, the panel concluded that, in context, the claim that T-Mobile’s low-band 5G signal is more reliable than competing 5G signals should be evaluated with at least some insight concerning network performance beyond coverage. Because T-Mobile offered no such support for its 5G network reliability claims, parity or otherwise, the panel recommended that T-Mobile’s 5G reliability claims be discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nSteVE"&gt;Much of this is semantics-based arguing that arises as a result of just how messy and confusing the 5G rollout in the US has been. Because 5G has been distributed across different wireless bands, each with its own trade-offs between coverage and speed, the major US telecoms have gone to great lengths to cast their own networks as superior to the competition. This often coincides with the same ads trying to mask the complexity of what type of 5G is being delivered and just how materially different from 4G it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgwUWP"&gt;This has led to quite a few advertising disputes between the major telecoms, with T-Mobile and Verizon sniping at one another in ads and in complaints to bodies like the NAD / NARB. By the time most consumers are actually using 5G, which requires they have a newer phone and live in an area with reliable coverage, most of these pointless ad squabbles will likely have been forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvLFiN"&gt;But that won’t stop these corporations from nitpicking one another’s advertising spots for any little discrepancy they can find, nor will it stop those same companies from complaining about inaccuracies from probably peddling one of their own in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The world’s first under-display selfie camera isn’t very good</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oG4ZqKZXbNTE6IF6MrurOOYVBDE=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559011/DSCF7475.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;ZTE’s Axon 20 5G is a better phone if you don’t care about selfies&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="DHBPJf"&gt;In a perfect world, everything would fit under the surface of smartphone displays. That’s been the principle behind the past few years of phone design, at least, ever since the iPhone X escalated the bezel wars with its conspicuous notch. From in-display fingerprint sensors to pop-up selfie cameras, we’ve seen phone manufacturers take creative approaches to achieving the highest possible screen-to-body ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blwqBj"&gt;The latest advancement in the bezel wars is the ZTE Axon 20 5G, which goes on sale today and is the world’s first phone to integrate its front-facing camera underneath the screen. While in-display fingerprint sensors are commonplace now, doing the same for selfie cameras has proven to be more difficult. Companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18759380/under-display-selfie-camera-first-oppo-announcement"&gt;Oppo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650166/xiaomi-under-display-selfie-camera-weibo-teaser-mi-9-notch-hole-punch"&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt; have been showing off demos for years, but ZTE has beaten them to the punch with the first commercial device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUjZn6"&gt;In theory, the advantages are obvious. You get an unbroken display that doesn’t need to account for a notch or hole-punch, and you don’t have to build in a motorized mechanism for a pop-up camera module. Again, if the world were perfect, the camera would just magically exist under the display without compromising image quality on either end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBqPrU"&gt;Readers, the world is not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/65plfj17NdcpU5n3L8Fy7TbzGCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22185694/DSCF7476.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SiU2sa"&gt;Before we talk about the camera, we should talk about the display that lies on top. I doubt this has anything to do with the camera technology itself, but the fact is that the Axon 20 5G is one of the biggest smartphones I’ve ever seen. The 90Hz OLED panel is a massive 6.92 inches diagonal, which means its 1080p resolution is a little less sharp than you’ll find on other phones. It’s not a problem in regular use, though, and the screen generally looks pretty good beyond some rough off-angle color shifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S1VWaA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It sometimes looks worse than a notch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AwiFjW"&gt;What does not look good is the comparatively huge “chin” bezel at the bottom. Even though it would have been considered extraordinarily slim just a few years ago, it really stands out on the Axon 20 5G considering the supposedly breakthrough nature of the device. I’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18715232/meizu-16s-hands-on-price-specs-design"&gt;phones&lt;/a&gt; that have managed to integrate conventional selfie cameras into thinner bezels than this, which kind of undermines the point of putting one under the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VB7cfA"&gt;That feeling only intensifies when you go through the Axon 20 5G’s setup process, which  shows the camera in the worst possible conditions. The under-display integration is extremely noticeable on light backgrounds, like what you tend to see on settings screens. There’s a square patch of the screen that exhibits a clear dithering effect, making it appear much lower resolution than the rest of the panel. I will just say right now that I think it looks worse than a notch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eWiNB"&gt;In more general use, it’s harder to notice. If you’re viewing photos or a full-color wallpaper, you can see the lower-resolution area if you look closely, but it isn’t quite as distracting. And as with other companies who’ve shipped Android phones with notches or hole-punches, ZTE’s default software uses a black background for the top part of the screen where status and notification icons are displayed, which does make the camera near-invisible. But really, if you need to resort to the same old notch-hiding techniques to disguise your under-display camera, what are we even doing here?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ny8TgkEmYfp4JvywJeSlQxmLx8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22185690/DSCF7470.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rXDOyId2Gufsvk43likwoVILZtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22185691/DSCF7468.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5NbEO_pIxn41JwM22cLzctw-30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22185692/DSCF7472.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hUeGt6"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The above images show how visible the camera is on colorful, white, and black backgrounds.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AFfALE"&gt;Of course, the next obvious question is how the camera actually performs. The news here is not great either. I don’t want to diminish the technical achievement of getting a halfway functional camera under an OLED screen at all — it involves new types of transparent materials, pixel filters, and demosaicing algorithms to make sense of the light that hits the 32-megapixel sensor. But the result, unfortunately, is a bad selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rf3Opi"&gt;In good light, the Axon 20 5G’s selfie camera takes hazy, soft photos with weak colors and blown-out highlights. Compare it to the Pixel 5 below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="lUrEbC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10243932"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0z8cxn"&gt;Just to be clear, that Axon 20 5G photo was taken with the portrait mode and smoothing filters turned &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RfPxRt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10243988"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXgJn2"&gt;The disparity is just as stark in low light, with a ton of noise and obliterated detail. I turned off the Pixel 5’s night mode here to make it more of a fair fight, and it still crushed the Axon 20 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y31v2m"&gt;This under-display selfie camera is merely functional, and that’s being generous. It can capture images through the screen, yes, which is indeed a minor miracle. But you probably wouldn’t want anyone else to see them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BYaOmL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is otherwise a pretty credible phone for $449&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="r6q6SX"&gt;This isn’t the most effusive compliment I can give a phone with a supposedly breakthrough selfie camera, but the ZTE Axon 20 5G is actually a much better proposition if you don’t care about selfies or video calls. It’s otherwise a pretty credible phone for $449, though despite providing a dollar price ZTE says it won’t be available in the US or Canada for now. (&lt;a href="https://events.ztedevices.com/zte-subscription-page"&gt;It’s €449 in the EU and £419 in the UK.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px9VQC"&gt;While the Axon 20 5G has a huge footprint, it’s still slim at just under 8mm thick, and ZTE has included a reasonably large 4,220mAh battery inside. The processor is a Snapdragon 765G with an integrated 5G modem, same as the Pixel 5 and the LG Velvet, and it can be configured to have up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeKuUA"&gt;Other specs include an optical in-display fingerprint sensor that works fine, 30W fast charging over USB-C, and a headphone jack. There’s a 64-megapixel main camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide, along with 2-megapixel macro and depth sensors that you can probably ignore. The main areas where ZTE has cut corners are its mediocre haptics system and an unimpressive downward-firing speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oN1L1Y"&gt;The fact that ZTE finally got a phone like this onto the market is a notable milestone, but I’m not sure who the device is really for. The under-display selfie camera often looks worse and more distracting than a notch, and the image quality is clearly compromised. It’s ironic that a phone might be more appealing to an audience that actively doesn’t care about its key selling point, but that’s where we’re at with the Axon 20 5G.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is now testing its Clubhouse-like voice chat rooms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot showing the interface for joining a Space" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cBlhvPFHEjfvsexzxbCcEXGiitA=/0x6:1123x755/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544274/IMG_0335.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iJZnx6"&gt;Twitter has begun testing its Spaces feature, the voice-based chat rooms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570150/twitter-spaces-clubhouse-voice-rooms-testing"&gt;it first announced last month&lt;/a&gt;. In the thread announcing the test, the company said a very small group of users would be given the ability to create Spaces, but that in theory anyone could join them — though who would be allowed into any given space depends on the user who created it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P91Gwb"&gt;Twitter outlined last month how the first people to be given access to Spaces would be women and people from other marginalized communities, groups who are more likely than others to be subjected to abuse and harassment when trying to engage in conversations in regular, comment-based discussions on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pDeiSP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;aye we’re live! what up y’all, we're the team behind Spaces––a small experiment focused on the intimacy of the human voice &lt;/p&gt;— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1339639767089238019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnVdaw"&gt;Moderation seems to be a big focus of Spaces. Creators can control who can or cannot speak in the Space, and there are reporting and blocking features included in the first version. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Spaces interface for a listener" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yfz8xwggONqUcWtcPp7JaspAgmc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22180498/IMG_0337.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spaces interface for a listener.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vN08Ux"&gt;Other features that are being tested include emoji reactions, being able to share tweets in a Space, and a “very early version” of live voice transcription. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the reaction feature in a Space" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6N2kZDedYz7abWhcXG3YsFEjjh0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22180483/IMG_0339.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users in a space can react with certain emojis, which will show over their profile picture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xqXPlx"&gt;At the moment, it seems like joining a Space only works from the Twitter mobile app — trying to join from the web just takes you to a “page not found” error. Strangely enough, joining one requires having Periscope integration enabled. That’s the live-streaming service that Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176842/twitter-periscope-shut-down-live-video-streaming-apps-2021"&gt;just announced it was shutting down&lt;/a&gt;, so it remains to be seen how Twitter plans to handle the technical backend of its voice chats once Periscope does disappear. &lt;/p&gt;
