    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UuPbBJ"&gt;In the shadow of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, and an aggressive new &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2021/All-new-iPhone-13-Pro-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-iPhone-13-iPhone-13-mini-iPad-and-iPad-mini-Come-to-T-Mobile-With-Forever-Upgrade/default.aspx"&gt;“Forever Upgrade” plan to sell them&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile executives are complaining about Samsung’s phones, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/t-mobile-cfo-blasts-samsung-device-supply"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fierce Wireless &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the lack of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiMQdB"&gt;“Samsung has really fallen behind the eight ball relative to other OEMs on the global supply chain issue,” T-Mobile chief financial officer and executive vice president Peter Osvaldik said &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/BofA-2021-Media-Communications-and-Entertainment-Conference/default.aspx"&gt;at a BofA Securities investor event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. The issue seems to be that a majority of T-Mobile’s customers are “very significant Samsung lovers,” according to Osvaldik, so Samsung “discontinuing” the Galaxy Note — which “customers just loved” — combined with a shorter supply of S-series phones had a negative impact on the carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tiHjH2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile customers apparently love the Galaxy Note&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5iPnL"&gt;Despite what Osvaldik said, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;Samsung has not yet officially discontinued the Note&lt;/a&gt;, so far skipping a 2021 version in favor of adding S Pen support into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;the Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not sure if Osvaldik is revealing some secret decision Samsung has made based on his comments. When asked, Samsung declined to comment, but the company’s mobile chief DJ Koh &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/samsung-warns-of-serious-imbalance-in-the-chips-industry"&gt;stated in March&lt;/a&gt; that “we seek to release a Note model next year,” leaving some possibility for a 2022 model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kuViPC"&gt;It’s possible that in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620397/samsung-fold-flip-future-galaxy-s-past"&gt;the effort to make foldables mainstream&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung has decided to ignore &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;the positives of the Note&lt;/a&gt;, but the company has also been affected by the global semiconductor shortage, just like everyone else. Samsung was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;reportedly considering halting production&lt;/a&gt; of the Galaxy S21 Fan Edition (FE) in June and was also rumored to be &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2776"&gt;running into chip issues&lt;/a&gt; with its lower budget A-series phones. In general, it’s hard to release multiple flagship phones, even in a normal year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKsPi3"&gt;T-Mobile’s comments are a testament to Samsung’s reach, though, and taking Osvaldik at face value, maybe also further confirmation that the Note should stick around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5P6xno"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 15th, 7:21PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;Added comment from Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dxr9JW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi announces 11T Pro with 120W fast charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhAPOCZbLCfCVQXtrGr5lsi7aIg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860918/DSCF7771.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uoaOXZ"&gt;Xiaomi has launched its 11T series, the headline of which is the 11T Pro and its previously announced 120W HyperCharge fast charging system. The phone has a 5,000mAh battery, and Xiaomi says the bundled 120W charger can fill it from zero to 100 percent in just 17 minutes. A 10-minute charge will get you to 72 percent, meanwhile. That’s even faster than the 120W Mi 10 Ultra Xiaomi released in China last year, and the 11T Pro is coming to Europe and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EtPTw"&gt;For more on the 11T Pro’s fast charging technology — like whether it’ll destroy the battery or burn down your house, for instance — you can read my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666347/xiaomi-11t-pro-120w-fast-charging-battery-interview"&gt;interview with Xiaomi’s Dan Desjarlais&lt;/a&gt; from last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IESXpq"&gt;The 11T Pro is an entirely different phone to the Mi 11 flagship released earlier this year. It has a different, boxier design with a plastic back, though the specs are similar — there’s still a Snapdragon 888 processor and a 108-megapixel camera. The screen is a 6.67-inch 120Hz 1080p OLED panel with no curves on the side, unlike the Mi 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qSGeaQL2KwfDf7LrbYZOJoeKDTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852257/DSCF7772.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iUgnmF"&gt;Xiaomi is also announcing two lower-end phones in the 11T range, neither of which have the 120W fast charging system. The 11T has a MediaTek Dimensity 1200-Ultra processor and 67W fast charging that fills the battery in 37 minutes, while the 11 Lite 5G NE has a Snapdragon 778 and a 4,250mAh battery that Xiaomi says fills in “no time,” which may not be a scientific measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stIIW8"&gt;The Xiaomi 11T Pro starts at €649 ($768) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, going up to €749 ($886) for 12GB/256GB. The 11T starts at €499 ($590) for 8GB/128GB or €50 more to double the storage, while the 11 Lite 5G NE starts at €369 ($437) for 6GB/128GB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is rolling out a new ‘5G UC’ icon for iPhones to tell when you have real 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/trrIzyhQcMhRtojb8X5MdWnBIQo=/0x19:934x642/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860859/Screen_Shot_2021_09_15_at_8.24.46_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qe3Npq"&gt;5G branding is going to get even more confusing, soon: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NevilleRay/status/1437854783184916481"&gt;T-Mobile has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be rolling out a new “5G UC” icon on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;upcoming iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; lineup to let customers know when they’re connected to T-Mobile’s “5G Ultra Capacity” network, instead of the regular old 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qF9MYF"&gt;The difference here is one of bands and brands: at T-Mobile, an unadorned “5G” icon will soon refer to the company’s low-band network, which it calls “5G Extended Range.” As the name suggests, it’s a slower network (closer to legacy LTE speeds) but it reaches a broader area. From a spectrum perspective, it exists in largely the same areas as LTE but uses 5G technologies and techniques for improved speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gO6qtH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mnPKuN"&gt;A “5G UC” icon, though, will mean that you’re either connected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325857/t-mobile-5g-coverage-ultra-capacity-extended-range"&gt;T-Mobile’s mid-band network&lt;/a&gt; (which it inherited from Sprint as part of the major merger between the two companies) or its high-band mmWave network (branded as “5G Ultra Capacity”) — both of which offer dramatically faster speeds. As &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fastest-mobile-networks-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;’s annual 5G speed test&lt;/a&gt; showed this year, that mid-band coverage in particular (hitting the sweet spot of speed increase and range) has been a big contributor toward T-Mobile’s vastly improved network offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="58JHWy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhone13?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPhone13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhone13Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPhone13Pro&lt;/a&gt; will let &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TMobile&lt;/a&gt; customers know when they are in an area with⚡️  fast speeds with Ultra Capacity 5G!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Just keep an eye out for the below icon.   users will see it more and more as we continue to rapidly roll out this   spectrum combo. &lt;a href="https://t.co/EirfCk8pjl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EirfCk8pjl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Neville (@NevilleRay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NevilleRay/status/1437854783184916481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p4LJqy"&gt;And while yet another 5G brand standard is confusing, it’s not without precedent. Verizon has been differentiating between its low-band 5G (also called “5G”) and its mmWave coverage (“5G UW,” or ultra-wideband) since it started rolling out those networks years ago. AT&amp;amp;T does something similar, too, referring to low-band 5G as “5G,” while its mmWave networks are “5G Plus.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="240QJO"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also has the unfortunate tendency to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265048/att-5g-e-misleading-advertising-recommendation-narb"&gt;misleadingly refer to its LTE networks as “5G E,”&lt;/a&gt; which, unlike the other flavors of 5G on this list, is not actually 5G at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rj1rXT"&gt;But T-Mobile’s change is arguably a necessary one: the rush to sell customers on 5G and slap the next-generation networking’s branding everywhere has meant that the low-band networks most people currently experience as “5G” is actually fairly similar — practically speaking — to LTE. But now that carriers are actually rolling out the bigger improvements that do bring meaningful speed and latency increases, they’re caught in a problem of their own devising: regular “5G” is too diluted of a brand to make an impact, hence the more bombastic ultras and pluses being appended to icons and logos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39Qhap"&gt;The new 5G UC icons should start rolling out soon on the iPhone 13 models once they’re released, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/po9aqn/tmobile_to_add_5g_uc_icon_to_iphone_13_when_in/hcvei91/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;last year’s iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it every year, but the iPhone 13 cameras do seem much improved</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7u5nyjXL1Lj3DAf27mMr4pPXV8=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860644/i13p2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPEBtq"&gt;Cameras continue to be one of the biggest differentiators in smartphones, and Apple’s iPhone lineup is no different. Apple says the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the company’s “most advanced dual-camera system ever,” while the 13 Pro and Pro Max have “our three most powerful cameras ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dWYGH"&gt;Which you’d hope for, of course. But this year, Apple really does appear to be making a big push with its cameras, particularly with the Pro models. As ever, the question will be what Apple is able to wring out of its hardware with image processing and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQGoWi"&gt;The iPhone 13 lineup represents the first time Apple has increased the primary camera’s sensor size across the board since the iPhone XS and XR in 2018, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21515571/iphone-12-pro-max-camera-quality-features"&gt;last year’s 12 Pro Max had a 47 percent bigger sensor&lt;/a&gt; than the 12 and 12 Pro. Sensor size is a key factor in image quality because, together with lens aperture, it determines how much light the camera is able to capture. More light, less noise and blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tK52o"&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini’s main cameras have bigger sensors, which is part of the reason why it and the ultrawide are now arranged diagonally in the camera bump. Apple also added sensor-shift optical image stabilization, a feature first seen on the 12 Pro Max. It’s not clear exactly how big the 13’s sensor is, but Apple says it’ll capture 47 percent more light than the 12. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zEUG2VZhfv8_aShe9BOhPHTybhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852177/i13p.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nyxfXN"&gt;The 13 Pro and Pro Max have a even bigger primary sensor and slightly faster f/1.5 lens that capture 2.2 times as much light as before, according to Apple. Again, the exact sensor size hasn’t been advertised, but Apple did give the pixel size: it’s 1.9μm, which is bigger than any modern smartphone I’m aware of. Apple can do this because the sensor is a relatively low-resolution 12 megapixels, but it’s still an impressive stat that should translate to better low-light performance. For comparison, the 12 Pro Max had 1.7μm pixels, while every other iPhone since the XS has had 1.4μm pixels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="52XSSS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple isn’t outgunning Android phones on hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n2R1t8"&gt;It’s not clear exactly what hardware changes Apple has made to the iPhone 13’s ultrawide camera; the company simply says it has a “faster sensor” that “reveals more detail in the dark areas of your photos.” The Pro does have significant hardware tweaks, though, since Apple has increased the aperture to f/1.8 for a 92-percent improvement in light-gathering capability. The sensor also now has focus pixels on board — things are rarely out of focus in ultrawide shots because the depth of field is so large, but adding autofocus means that the camera can be used for macro photography, with a focusing distance of 2cm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Rwrb4"&gt;The telephoto camera remains exclusive to the 13 Pro phones, and Apple has increased its equivalent focal length to 77mm, or three times longer than the primary camera. Previously the iPhone 12 Pro’s telephoto offered 2x zoom while the 12 Pro Max went out to 2.5x. There’s a tradeoff here — if you want to frame something with 2x zoom, the 13 Pro will need to crop in from the main camera, reducing image quality. But your pictures that go beyond 3x zoom will be much sharper than before, and it should make for a better portrait lens. Apple has also added Night mode to the telephoto for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J64QBL"&gt;When compared to the Android competition, Apple isn’t doing much to outgun them on the hardware front. The large 1.9μm pixels are noteworthy, but most Android phone makers have been prioritizing big, high-resolution sensors rather than pure pixel size. Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra, for example, has a huge 50-megapixel sensor with 1.4μm pixels, meaning it has decent light-gathering ability even when shot at native resolution without binning the pixels together. And while the 3x telephoto lens is going to be useful, it’s now common to see 5x periscope telephotos (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21444946/huawei-p40-pro-plus-vs-iphone-pixel-10x-zoom-camera"&gt;or occasionally even 10x&lt;/a&gt;) in the Android world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GMDyp54O2X93mx0f_YJVBUgkqvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852176/camera_system__f9pkhq4g2oy2_large_2x.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YYXY1o"&gt;So even though Apple has made meaningful hardware improvements across the iPhone 13 lineup, as ever its performance relative to competitors will come down to how well its software and image processing pipeline has been optimized. The iPhone 11 was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price"&gt;hugely better camera&lt;/a&gt; than the XS the year before it, after all, even though the hardware &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/11/20860442/apple-iphone-11-camera-analysis-competition"&gt;barely changed&lt;/a&gt;. This year Apple is touting Smart HDR 4, which is capable of individually adjusting exposure for multiple people in the frame, but we’ll have to see the phones for ourselves to know what kind of a difference that makes. The same goes for Photographic Styles, a new filter-like feature that Apple says is smarter about adjusting elements like skin tones and skies in each photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIuJtD"&gt;As for video, Apple is making a big deal out of its Cinematic mode that lets you selectively adjust focus and depth of field when post-processing, like Portrait mode for photos. That’s something we’ll definitely have to test extensively. The 13 Pro, meanwhile, lets you record and edit video in Apple’s ProRes codec on the phone itself, or you can export the ProRes file to Final Cut Pro on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccov7C"&gt;All the usual caveats about waiting for full reviews most certainly still apply, but this is looking like a pretty good year for the iPhone camera. Apple is never going to have the flashiest hardware, but it’s made some welcome improvements in areas that make sense, and thankfully it hasn’t locked any features to the Max-sized iPhone. We’re looking forward to seeing the results — as well as those of looming competitors like the Pixel 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="M62prZ"&gt;

    <title>There’s a new bubbles emoji that’ll go just great with the peach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DfD5EeSAW2Yi7XjidCkCbNSq420=/0x3:908x608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860402/image__3_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My editor put together this image disturbingly soon after I pitched this article.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Thomas Ricker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IwU0Vi"&gt;If I were an emoji sommelier, there’s one pairing I’d definitely be recommending after looking at this year’s 37-strong selection of &lt;a href="http://blog.unicode.org/2021/09/announcing-unicode-standard-version-140.html"&gt;finalized emoji&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s a combination of the new “&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/bubbles/"&gt;bubbles&lt;/a&gt;” emoji with the existing “peach.” The former emoji has just been finalized with version 14.0 of the Unicode Standard, but the collection has been public &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578697/new-emoji-14-0-finalists-unicode-consortium"&gt;since earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lt8S7Y"&gt;The reason is simple. Peach has long pulled double duty as the internationally recognized symbol for the human butt, making “butt bubbles” an elegant euphemism for farts. Sure, you’ve long been able to tell a similar visual story by combining the peach with the gust of wind emoji (which I now see is technically called “&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dashing-away/"&gt;dashing away&lt;/a&gt;”). But now you’ve got more options. Like if you wanted to symbolize the act of emitting gas in a bath, or swimming pool, you monster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Emoji shown in the prior image, in addition to a melting face, face with hand over mouth, face with eye peeking through fingers, saluting face, face with dotted lines around it, face holding back tears, as well as heart hands, snapping fingers, pointing index finger, and handshakes, all with different skin tones." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwRPFh-9t83V-nILuDkvUtE7wH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719624/emojipedia_14_draft_world_emoji_day_july_2021.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/new-emojis-in-2021-2022/" target="_blank"&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new emoji.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yw6J0F"&gt;The list, which is &lt;a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/whats-new-in-unicode-14-0/"&gt;nicely summarized by &lt;em&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also includes new faces like “biting lip” and “saluting face.” Unfortunately for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhy-do-English-people-salute-magpies&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F15%2F22675134%2Funicode-emoji-version-14-bubbles-saluting-face-biting-lip-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;English people looking to ward off bad luck&lt;/a&gt;, there isn’t yet a magpie emoji to pair the latter with. New hand gestures include a pair of hands creating the shape of a heart, and a hand pointing towards the screen. As part of this release, handshakes between hands of different skin tones are now officially supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yo3Ufl"&gt;Finally, there are also new gender options for pregnancy, including emoji for “pregnant person” and “pregnant man.” A new “person with crown” joins the existing “prince” and “princess” emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUgHkc"&gt;Now that the list of emoji has been finalized, it’s up to the major platform holders to add the designs into their software, which for most is likely to happen next year between January and August, according to &lt;em&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re interested in learning about how emoji are made, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s own Jay Peters was involved in the creation of this year’s “bubbles” and “saluting face” emoji, and previously submitted proposals for “yawning face” and “waffle.” You can read all about the process he went through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327599/how-to-make-emoji-yawning-face-waffle-proposal-unicode"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhinyE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is testing new ‘Favorites’ to bring order to your chaotic feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZKNcTBubP5QtM-Fi0UGPO_qALP4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842022/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yFl5h3"&gt;You’re on Instagram looking for your best friend’s daily dog update, but you have to scroll endlessly through a sea of posts you care little about, and probably forget what you’re looking for in the first place. After a few extra annoyed scrolls, you close the app in frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOJ2Yd"&gt;It seems Instagram is well aware of your plight, because it is quietly testing out a solution for your messy feed called “Favorites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph25cH"&gt;According to Alessandro Paluzzi, a mobile developer who first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;posted about the new feature on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Favorites lets you categorize your most important Instagram accounts (friends and creators) as your priorities, so that their posts will land “higher” in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dhrAp6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Instagram&lt;/a&gt; is working on "Favorites"  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ℹ️ Posts from your favorites are shown higher in feed. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NfBd8v4IHR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NfBd8v4IHR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZMmGi"&gt;If this feature sounds familiar, it’s because Instagram was testing a different &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15856858/instagram-favorites-private-sharing-friends-list"&gt;Favorites feature back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which you let you limit the exact audience for each post. For example, you could share your wedding photo with just your designated favorites, rather than with your entire following. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="74JCiE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new feature gives you more control over who you see first in your feed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc6osZ"&gt;The 2021 iteration of Favorites, however, is about giving you more control over your feed — by telling Instagram which accounts are most important to you. After all, you may follow a bunch of different brands and creators on your account, but you don’t necessarily prioritize their content on the same level as your closest friends and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkjEUC"&gt;Currently, Instagram ranks the order of your feed by the most recent and shared posts from the people you follow, plus other “signals” like how likely you’ll engage with a post, according to the company’s June 2021 &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about its algorithm. While you may “like” many posts you see, those may not be the content you’re actually looking for, but might be sending Instagram all the wrong signals on what you actually want to see in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="treq2k"&gt;It’s not clear whether this Favorites feature will become an official feature at all or if it will change before it’s rolled out more broadly. For now, Instagram says it “is an internal prototype that’s still in development, and not testing externally.” Perhaps in the future, you just might see this feature in your account menu, just below &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18117718/instagram-close-friends-stories-favorites"&gt;“Close Friends”&lt;/a&gt; — a feature that lets you control who you share your Stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cvg7r8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 13th, 10:42AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with comment from Instagram.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL won’t release a foldable smartphone this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2020 World 5G Convention" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1sMJHfoe7g0PsiwEx_kaf-ZmJvk=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844847/1288191697.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TCL won’t release a foldable phone in 2021 | Photo by Li Zhihao/VCG via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dyG2CT"&gt;Electronics company TCL is pausing its plans release a lower-cost foldable phone this year, the company confirmed in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; Its clamshell-style foldable phone, codenamed Project Chicago, was in mid-development when the company made the decision to put it on indefinite hold. According to TCL the delay is due in part to rising production costs and supply chain shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZkmUG"&gt;“Although the foldable market is growing each year, it is still a premium product category,” Stefan Streit, chief marketing officer of TCL said in a statement t&lt;em&gt;o The Verge. &lt;/em&gt; “In combination with recent component shortages, the COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs in foldable production, TCL has made the difficult decision to suspend the launch of its first commercially available foldable smartphone until the company can produce and bring it to market at a price point that’s accessible to as many consumers as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdOmRe"&gt;Streit added that the company is “closely monitoring the market to determine the best time to launch a foldable smartphone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HzjOj"&gt;The company gave out a few sample devices to reviewers (looks like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmJJvzrGODk&amp;amp;ab_channel=MrMobile%5BMichaelFisher%5D"&gt;MrMobile got their hands on one&lt;/a&gt;) , but said it did not have any additional devices available, or any photos of Chicago to share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLt1bP"&gt;The news comes a few weeks after the launch of Samsung’s latest foldable devices: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; (TCL decided to pause its Chicago device before Samsung’s launch) But both of the foldable Samsung phones are on the higher end of the price range; the Flip 3 goes for $999, and the Fold 3 is priced at $1,799.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jo7aU9"&gt;TCL &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/5/21165069/tcl-foldable-trifold-phone-hands-on-rollable-concept-prototype-display-tablet"&gt;showed off a few foldable&lt;/a&gt; prototypes last year, and again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;earlier this year at CES 2021&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a “rollable” screen design. In April &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383668/tcl-fold-n-roll-concept-rollable-phone-tablet"&gt;TCL showed off a Fold ‘n Roll&lt;/a&gt; device that could expand from a 6.87-inch phone screen to become an 8.85-inch phablet, or a 10-inch tablet size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCYO0w"&gt;The company says it’s not giving up on the foldable product category but doesn’t have a time frame for when its first foldable device may be commercially available. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to sell or trade in your old Android phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Pixel next to Google Pixel 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CogPkUXbGT37svqJiHkPL4h09Iw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844389/pixel_pixel2_vladsavov.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YTcT3i"&gt;There are a plethora of new and exciting smartphones that have just come onto the market (or are about to), and it wouldn’t be at all surprising to find out that you are planning to upgrade from your current phone. Samsung has introduced two new folding phones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;, along with its flagship &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Google has released its latest mid-priced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; and has announced its upcoming &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/magazine/google_pixel_6?hl=en-US"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPirAZ"&gt;Whether you want to buy one of Samsung’s new folding phones or one of the upcoming Google 6 phones without paying full price, trading in your old phone — or selling it — is a smart way to do that. On the other hand, there are those who will decide instead to buy a lightly used phone from an older generation that will suit their needs without breaking the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzeqwI"&gt;If you’ve got an older model and are ready for an upgrade, here are a few steps to take in order to get your device ready to sell, followed by how much cash you can expect to earn back. We’re going to concentrate on Samsung and Google Pixel phones here, but you can probably expect similar results with phones from other vendors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oxubhS"&gt;Inspect your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CXxopT"&gt;If your old device is in good condition, you shouldn’t have much of a problem finding a new owner. As mentioned in our guide on selling your iPhone, having a phone in good condition is crucial to finding a buyer who’s willing to pay top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pUgLB"&gt;Even if your phone isn’t in the best shape, you should still be able to get &lt;em&gt;something &lt;/em&gt;for your trade. Take into consideration its blemishes, including scratches, dents, cracks, and any other quirks that the next owner should know about. Be honest or else it will probably come back to bite you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OGt0Dv"&gt;Erase your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ffByZn"&gt;There are three steps involved in securely wiping your Android phone. These steps can vary slightly depending on whether you have a Samsung, a Pixel, or a phone from another manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ws0xuU"&gt;First, instructions for a Samsung running Android 11:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="XYw9xt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Disable Factory Reset Protection.&lt;/strong&gt; This feature prevents your phone from being wiped if it’s stolen. To disable it, all you have to do is turn off your Screen Lock. (You’ve had your Screen Lock set, right?) Navigate to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Lock Screen	” &amp;gt; “Screen lock type” and select “None.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TaEHML"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Remove your account. &lt;/strong&gt;Navigate to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Accounts and backup” &amp;gt; “Managed accounts” and tap on the account (or accounts, if you have more than one) that’s listed there. Then tap on “Remove account.” (Incidentally, if you haven’t backed up your phone recently, you can go to “Accounts and backup” &amp;gt; “Backup” to get that done.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dD1Ir5"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Factory reset the phone. &lt;/strong&gt;The next step is to factory reset the phone to completely wipe it of all your data. Back at the main settings menu, select “General management” &amp;gt; “Reset” to  take you to the final step. Select “Factory data reset.” You will get a warning page listing the data that will be erased; any accounts you’re still signed into (and you should go back and remove them); and which apps will be removed. Ready? Tap on “Reset” (you’ll be prompted to put in your Samsung account password).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="cnZ8rV"&gt;The instructions here are for a Pixel running Android 12 beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="CvdFUj"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Disable Factory Reset Protection.&lt;/strong&gt; This feature prevents your phone from being wiped if it’s stolen. To disable it, all you have to do is turn off your Screen Lock. (You’ve had your Screen Lock set, right?) Navigate to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Security” &amp;gt; “Screen lock” and select “None.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uOXeGA"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Remove your account. &lt;/strong&gt;Using Android 12, erasing your phone starts with navigating to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Passwords &amp;amp; accounts” and tapping on the account (or accounts, if you have more than one) that’s listed there. Then tap on “Remove account.” You’ll get a warning pop-up. Tap on “Remove account” again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9aIV6A"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Factory reset the phone. &lt;/strong&gt;The next step is to factory reset the phone to completely wipe it of all your data. Back at the main settings menu, select “System.” If you haven’t backed up your phone to Google Drive recently, you can go to “Backup” and select “Back up now.” Otherwise, going into “Reset options” will take you to the final step. Select “Erase all data (factory reset).” You will get a warning page listing the data that will be erased, and if you’ve neglected to sign out of any accounts, it will be listed there (and you should go back and remove it). Otherwise, tap on “Erase all data.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="odtDGL"&gt;Trade your phone in?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AVX9Bj"&gt;When you trade in your phone to a manufacturer or carrier, you may be trading price for convenience. It’s up to you which you choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qWtJb"&gt;At the time of publish, Samsung says it is offering up to a $750 trade-in credit on a Galaxy Z Fold3 5G or Z Flip3 5G. Interestingly, Samsung’s offers tend to be relatively generous. For example, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17093588/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-phone-review"&gt;three-year-old Galaxy S9&lt;/a&gt; will give you a credit of $150, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/17/17703434/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review-battery-specs-price-pen-stylus"&gt;Galaxy Note 9&lt;/a&gt; goes up to $400 as does a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-android-phone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy S10 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, while if you’re trading in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155012/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review-5g-screen-camera-space-zoom-price"&gt;Galaxy S20 5G Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, you can score $750 in trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sfjc84"&gt;During its preorder period, Google says it offers up to $600 for a trade-in. I pretended to have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;Pixel 4 XL&lt;/a&gt; with 128GB storage that was in working condition and free of cracks, and I was offered $170, while a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Pixel 4a 5G&lt;/a&gt; with 128GB brought a quote of $190. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; with 128GB storage got me an offer of $58, and finally, an original unlocked Pixel with 32GB or 128GB was worth a big $25.01.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRrsai"&gt;You may be able to get a good deal with a carrier as long as you read the small print. For example, Verizon is offering a discount of up to $800 on specific new phones (such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 5G&lt;/a&gt;) if you trade in one of a long list of phones (and commit yourself to its Unlimited plan). &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original Google Pixel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MW7paS"&gt;Sell your phone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZSXwS"&gt;As for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73hQPc_RInM"&gt;where you can sell&lt;/a&gt; your old phone, &lt;a href="http://swappa.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swappa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a top pick with a healthy community of buyers and sellers. With Swappa, you create a listing along with a price; when your device is sold, you receive payment from Swappa and then ship the phone directly to the buyer. Swappa charges a fee from the buyer, depending on the price of the phone, but you are responsible for shipping costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdPOfD"&gt;Since what you can get from a site like Swappa can vary, I looked at the lowest price suggested (for which you would more likely find a buyer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0AVz9"&gt;First, Samsung. A Galaxy S9 in fair condition with 64GB brought a low price of $129; a Galaxy Note 9 rated a low price of $219; a Galaxy S10 Plus bottomed out at $249, while a Galaxy S20 5G Ultra started at $539. Even considering that these are the cheapest prices that these phone will go for, there is considerable difference between these and the trade-in prices for Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTZ4VX"&gt;Meanwhile, original Pixel with 32GB of storage brought a low price of $62, while a Pixel XL got low price of $60. An unlocked Pixel 2 with 64GB rated a low price of $90; the 2 XL version was quoted with a low price of $99. An unlocked Pixel 3 with 64GB in good condition had a low price of $115; the 3 XL version in fair condition brought a low selling price of $95. Finally, you could score a Pixel 4 XL in good condition with 64GB for $250.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EE4Ox7"&gt;There are, of course, other sites where you can sell your phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofjsLE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decluttr.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22666545%2Fandroid-pixel-samsung-galaxy-sell-trade-how-to-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decluttr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; buys the phone from you and then resells it. The company gives you a price online; you then ship your phone to Decluttr within 28 days. The phone will be inspected; if there are issues, you will be offered a revised price which you will have 14 days to accept or decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xczo9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gazelle.com%2Ftrade-in&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22666545%2Fandroid-pixel-samsung-galaxy-sell-trade-how-to-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gazelle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; works in much the same way: the company gives you a price online and you then ship your phone to Gazelle within 30 days. The phone will be inspected; if there are issues, you will be offered a revised price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6JQzg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fservices%2Fbest-buy-trade-in%2Fpcmcat133600050011.c&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Buy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lets you either mail in your phone or bring it to your nearest Best Buy retail store; either way, you can trade it in for an e-gift card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5F5SmE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://flipsy.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flipsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deals with a variety of retail sites; it will let you know what vendors offer how much, and then you get 14 days to ship the device. The vendor pays for shipping. If the vendor doesn’t agree with your assessment, they will send a revised offer; since each vendor has its own return policies, it’s a good idea to check before you ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3Gx6n"&gt;And of course, there’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Findex.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22666545%2Fandroid-pixel-samsung-galaxy-sell-trade-how-to-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eBay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Selling here can be a bit complicated, but basically you get up to 250 listings for free each month; once you sell your item, there is a 10.2 percent fee plus a $0.30 transaction fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktxNwU"&gt;Other places where you can sell your phone free of charge (except, of course, for shipping fees) include &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/selling/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook Marketplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://craigslist.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craigslist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tb6JxY"&gt;Whether you use one of the resources listed here to make up the cost of a new Google Pixel 6 or decide that the convenience of trading in the phone is worth the extra bucks is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Jio’s smartphone collaboration has been delayed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3U7MdyLIpYSaVzSMTTKwHi5EUq0=/1x0:835x556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838947/jiophone_next_google.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Jio Platforms&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bklin2"&gt;The JioPhone Next, a smartphone being jointly developed by Google and Indian tech giant Jio Platforms, has missed its planned September 10th launch date, the &lt;a href="https://www.ril.com/getattachment/9071467e-5a43-415e-bfed-b831d0360df8/JioPhone-Next-in-Advanced-Trials,-with-Festive-Sea.aspx"&gt;companies have announced&lt;/a&gt;. The delay is needed to give both companies more time to refine the device, and to navigate problems created by the global semiconductor shortage. The JioPhone Next is now scheduled for wide release around Diwali, which will take place in early November. The phone is currently in testing with a small number of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fidBXi"&gt;The phone is designed to be an affordable 4G smartphone to help the roughly 300 million Indian users currently on 2G networks upgrade to 4G. When it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548453/jiophone-next-google-android-smartphone-affordable"&gt;announced the phone in June&lt;/a&gt;, Jio’s parent company Reliance said it would include voice assistant, augmented reality, and translation features. All this is build into an “optimized operating system based on Android,” which appears to bear some relation to Android Go, if &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/jiophone-next/#:~:text=the%20google%20camera%20go%20app%20icon%20spotted%20in%20one%20of%20the%20promotional%20images%20leads%20us%20to%20believe%20that%20it%20might%20feature%20android%20go"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; is to be believed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFYo2f"&gt;Work on the phone was first announced in 2020, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325343/google-reliance-jio-investment-india-4-5-billion-dollars-7-percent-facebook"&gt;Google announced a $4.5 million investment&lt;/a&gt; in Jio. As part of the collaboration, Reliance announced earlier this year that it’s shifting its retail business onto Google’s cloud infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi promises its 120W fast charger won’t kill its new phone’s battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shoppers are seen leaving the Chinese multinational..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qU_JsUcuMu9inFyT4qdB0knyVvo=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838893/1235139501.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pf8peD"&gt;If you’ve been following the Chinese phone scene for the past few years, you’ll have noticed the inescapable fast-charging arms race. It feels like every few months there’s a new champion, with high-wattage chargers constantly pushing down the time it takes to fill a phone battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1130hI"&gt;This month, Xiaomi is making its biggest effort yet to bring its “HyperCharge” technology to a mainstream, global audience. The upcoming Xiaomi 11T Pro has a 120W charger, a huge power increase on the current global flagship Mi 11, which uses a 55W charger that can get you to 100 percent in 45 minutes. Xiaomi hasn’t revealed estimating charging times for the 11T Pro yet, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s China-only Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; also had a 120W charger that took just 23 minutes to fill up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnqpRS"&gt;A common reaction I see to this kind of fast charger is that they’ll surely have a negative impact on battery longevity, or that there must be safety issues, or both. So I talked to Daniel Desjarlais, international head of communications and global spokesperson at Xiaomi, about the company’s fast-charging technology efforts and what people outside China should expect from the 11T Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mc9AEM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is something that we’ve really, really heavily tested.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C1o9h5"&gt;First off, how does it work? “It’s like having two different inlets to fill the gas in your car and two separate tanks,” Desjarlais says of Xiaomi’s dual-cell battery design, which is similar to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/11/8/20954678/oppo-reno-ace-super-vooc-fast-charging-review"&gt;other high-powered fast-charging solutions&lt;/a&gt; work. “Now, rather than filling at a certain slow rate on one side, you can fill up two at the same time. This is all done on the side of the phone, the charger outputs 120 watts and rather than trying to push the maximum of five volts, a single channel splits it into two, three, four channels. This allows us to increase everything — everything is done at 20 amperes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ybnUo"&gt;Desjarlais went on in detail to explain what happens with the technology in the battery itself, and how Xiaomi’s thermal monitoring systems work to maintain the optimum charging speed at each point in the cycle, but as a non-engineer I’m frankly not qualified to comment on the electrical design here. What I am qualified to comment on is phone design and consumer expectations, and I know a lot of people do worry about the tradeoffs with these fast-charging systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAuClI"&gt;On the question of longevity, Desjarlais says you can expect endurance in line with other more conventional phones. “This is something that we’ve really, really heavily tested,” he says. “Generally, for this level of charging with the batteries that we’ve tested it with, after 800 charging cycles you’ll still have 80 percent battery health. Now, that 20 percent might sound like ‘oh wow, I’m losing 20 percent,’ but that’s quite standard across basically all charging tech. 800 cycles, for most people, it’s going to be two years roughly. So that’s quite solid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lb8nZD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We don't just want to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChargeBetter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ChargeBetter&lt;/a&gt;, but we also want to make sure it's safe for our users. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XiaomiHyperCharge?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XiaomiHyperCharge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/9AyMy3Jjzg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9AyMy3Jjzg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1433716399738925061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UIOxPN"&gt;For comparison, Apple — a company that has faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573710/apple-battery-gate-throttle-iphones-settlement-amount"&gt;heavy scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; over its long-term battery performance while offering slower charging tech than most of its competitors — &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387"&gt;tells customers&lt;/a&gt; to expect a lithium-ion battery to retain “up to 80 percent of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles.” If Xiaomi’s testing figures are accurate, a phone like the 11T Pro shouldn’t suffer from an unusually short lifespan, even if its owner only ever uses the fast charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xADjjO"&gt;When I ask whether using slower chargers would improve battery health further, Desjarlais says “There’s relatively minute differences between the two. Of course, the optimal situation would be yes, to use the slower charger if you’re going to charge overnight and use the fast charger for more rushed situations.” But Xiaomi’s testing has been carried out with the presumption that you could get good battery health if you use fast charging all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SExidK"&gt;As for safety, Desjarlais says the testing has been extremely thorough and includes third parties, with 34 different battery protection features included in the device itself. “Generally this is part of the reason why this technology is coming out now for global markets,” he says. “We wanted to make sure that we met all the regulations, but also that it was incredibly safe for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql77da"&gt;Still, I wondered about those potential tradeoffs. Are there really no downsides to a charging system like this? Could a phone with more conventional charging be thinner, or house a bigger battery, for example? According to Desjarlais, there’s no negative impact. That said, the actual charger is quite a bit larger than the average phone pack-in, and will of course draw more power (albeit for shorter periods of time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8jatb2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Join us for the global launch of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xiaomi11TPro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Xiaomi11TPro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xiaomi11TSeries?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Xiaomi11TSeries&lt;/a&gt; and more products on Sep 15, 2021 at 20:00 (GMT+8)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let the magic begin! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cinemagic?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Cinemagic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ade9PECzWP"&gt;https://t.co/ade9PECzWP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1436252424390406149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jk4AVJ"&gt;Xiaomi thinks its fast-charging technology is here to stay, and there still could be room for improvement. Earlier this year, for example, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/30/22461435/xiaomi-fast-charging-world-record-200w-wired-120w-wireless"&gt;demonstrated a prototype 200W system&lt;/a&gt; that filled a 4,000mAh battery in 8 minutes, though Desjarlais would only say that “Whether or not this comes [in a commercial product] is something that you’re going to have to wait and see on,” citing the need for further safety and performance testing. He had much the same answer about Xiaomi’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;truly wireless Air Charge&lt;/a&gt; teaser, saying “It’s a wonderful concept and it’s something that we’re continuing to examine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0o07nD"&gt;Obviously, safety and effective performance should be the least you expect out of any given phone feature. With fast charging, the question is whether customers in Xiaomi’s global markets will consider it a selling point. “For us, I think the big goal here is there’s a lot of people out there who consider fast charging to be an extraneous feature,” Desjarlais says. “But there’s also a lot of people out there for whom this is a big value add. It’s something you don’t really realize how good it is for your day-to-day life until you have to rush out the door to catch a cab in five minutes and your phone isn’t really charged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGkfe0"&gt;Xiaomi’s international launch event for the 11T Pro and the rest of the 11T series is taking place next week on Wednesday, September 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
