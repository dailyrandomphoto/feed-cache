    <title>There’s still a place for the Note in Samsung’s Galaxy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJ5Xmw"&gt;For the first time in many years, August will come and go without the introduction of a new Galaxy Note smartphone from Samsung. Instead, with their lower prices and improved durability, the company is giving its latest foldables — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617226/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-features-price-foldable-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; — a firm push into the mainstream phone market. With the Z Flip selling for a penny under $1,000, it’s certain to stand out from the iPhone and Samsung’s own Galaxy S21 devices that cost a similar amount (or more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjvXvv"&gt;But for repeat buyers of Notes past and present, it does feel like there’s something missing. We’re talking about the brand that established Samsung as the leading manufacturer of huge phones. Yet the company has completely skipped producing a new Note this year and has tried to explain it away with a simple “not this time around.” For now, the lineup isn’t gone; last year’s Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra will remain for sale in 2021. The latter remains a legitimately excellent phone today, so even with Samsung hitting pause for a year, at least there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeKddK"&gt;Samsung’s stance on the Note’s future is vague enough that it leaves room for an eventual return &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620397/samsung-fold-flip-future-galaxy-s-past"&gt;if foldables don’t become the next big thing&lt;/a&gt;. But I’d argue that at least one traditional Galaxy phone with a stylus should remain in the company’s plans regardless. It’s too soon to move on from everything that Samsung was doing so right, and tacking S Pen support onto its other flagship phones doesn’t quite live up to the Note’s legacy. And there are several reasons for the company to give it another go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PmckpE"&gt;People seem to like stylus phones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UJXu2I"&gt;The Note is no doubt the de facto stylus smartphone, but other companies have also found success. Motorola has said the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt; quickly became the most popular device in the G-series after its release, and that was enough for the company to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538663/motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-review-specs-screen-price"&gt;produce a 5G-capable sequel&lt;/a&gt; this year. And before LG’s complete exit from the smartphone market, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301223/lg-stylo-6-review"&gt;its Stylo phones&lt;/a&gt; were some of its more popular mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkdzYW"&gt;You can’t overstate the importance of a built-in silo for storing the stylus away when it’s not being used. On the Note, the S Pen is there when you need it — for drawing, signing a PDF, or whatever else — and then it’s gone and completely unobtrusive when you don’t. No add-ons or special phone cases required. Those latter solutions only add friction that can take away from the whole appeal. Using a phone case is perfectly fine, and most people do, but trying to incorporate a stylus slot there is far from ideal if you’ve got normal-sized hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZAfKgY"&gt;The Note deserves a better swan song than the Note 20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MEFoBH"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; was true to the line’s usual recipe of stellar build quality, high-end specs, and a giant screen. But the regular Note 20 was a poorly executed misfire. Samsung’s strategy of pursuing a slightly lower price point made sense, but there were enough compromises with last year’s regular Note that it was difficult to recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NitFnM"&gt;Most glaring of all was that it had a 60Hz display, when even cheaper Samsung phones like the Galaxy S20 FE had evolved to smoother refresh rates. The cameras were worse, it had a plastic back, and all of these tradeoffs were made to reach a still-expensive price of $999.99. In the eyes of many Note fans, it was a frustrating mismatch, and they rejected the Note 20 for it. Marques Brownlee went so far as to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exk34o-MMIE"&gt;call it the “Nope 20.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEbqoh"&gt;This was particularly disappointing after Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20845028/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review-s-pen-camera-specs-features-price"&gt;got it right the year prior with the Note 10&lt;/a&gt;, which wasn’t saddled with the same number of disappointing concessions. That device felt like it was meant to be a mini version of the larger, flagship Note 10 Plus. But the Note 20 came off more as an example of what happens when a company cuts too many corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Pgg2cE"&gt;A case is an imperfect solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="REO0KF"&gt;Samsung hyped the addition of S Pen support when it announced the Galaxy Ultra S21 earlier this year. And the experience of &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the stylus seems to be on par with a Note. But then you’ve got to &lt;em&gt;put&lt;/em&gt; it somewhere, and that’s where there’s no substitute for an actual Note. Without a designated slot on the phone itself, Samsung’s solution was to make a case that could keep the S21 Ultra and S Pen together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PryxSk"&gt;However, it came with a downside: worse ergonomics. As Dieter wrote in his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;S21 Ultra review&lt;/a&gt;, the phone can feel more manageable in your hands than an iPhone 12 Pro Max because it’s taller and narrower. That easier-to-hold advantage is diminished somewhat by Samsung’s silicone case for the S Pen. Since there’s a permanent holding spot for the stylus on the case’s left side, the device is noticeably larger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xBtMX0cXBulzWbcDrZk12pk-S1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788254/2D9400D9_EDF5_4457_B7EF_1DAB684961DE.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung bundled the S Pen with a case for the S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kgCiau"&gt;For the Z Fold 3, Samsung came up with a case design that places a holster at the hinge. I think this will work out better, since the Fold is more narrow than most smartphones (including the S21 Ultra) when closed — so it won’t feel as unwieldy even with the added space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9L1q7"&gt;But unless third-party case makers come up with their own options, you’ll be limited to that one specific Samsung case if you want to carry the S Pen with minimal risk of it being lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tNbHhi"&gt;Selling the S Pen separately makes it feel like an afterthought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8x3gkZ"&gt;Even though it went to the trouble of creating a “Fold Edition” S Pen with a retracting spring tip, Samsung won’t be bundling that with its latest flagship foldable. Rather, you’ve got to buy it (or the pricier S Pen Pro) separately. The Fold Edition comes bundled with its specially designed case for $79, while the S Pen Pro is sold standalone for $99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42tNGI"&gt;An S Pen still comes included with many of Samsung’s latest tablets and laptops. But making it an added purchase on top of the $1,800 Z Fold 3 will probably lead some people to pass on it entirely. If the Fold is meant to usher in a new era of smartphone productivity, why not toss the Fold Edition stylus and case in the box? Maybe that’d ease the sting of not getting a phone charger, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tuuVsG"&gt;Another Samsung stylus phone could be great if done right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="e68mX2"&gt;I hope that last year’s models won’t be the end of the line for the Galaxy Note. Samsung still hasn’t come up with an alternative that matches the coherence and convenience of a phone designed with the stylus in mind from the very beginning. But where should the company go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrc7lm"&gt;I could see Samsung choosing the “special edition” route (think Apple’s iPhone SE, but high end) and releasing a new, top-spec Note every few years for the diehard fans that will pay top dollar for their giant slab of glass and S Pen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aon35j"&gt;But an even better development would be if the stylus trickled down to at least one of Samsung’s popular A-series phones and brought more people into the experience — for much less money. That’d be a clear sign that Samsung is committed to the S Pen, even if the Galaxy Note itself remains on hiatus. The benefits of a stylus shouldn’t be reserved for the $1,000-and-up tier. You’d want a high refresh display since that does genuinely improve the responsiveness of drawing and note-taking. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;The Galaxy A52 already checks off that box&lt;/a&gt;, so we know it’s possible even if the company wants to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8BfJJ"&gt;Part of the problem with the Note 20 was Samsung’s messaging: it tried to pass off midrange hardware as something more premium. The pushback and so-so reviews shouldn’t have come as a surprise. But Samsung wouldn’t need to over-sell a Galaxy A-series phone with a stylus: it could be a hit all on its own merits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Google Pixel 6 won’t ship with a charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WWtKPEFDCN0HQefeC0SXQdK8RF0=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736930/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google joins Apple and Samsung by ditching the in-box charger.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hXmmGZ"&gt;Google is the latest manufacturer to bid farewell to the in-box charging brick, saying it expects the Pixel 5A will be the last phone to include one. That means the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; won’t include one when they arrive this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWjePu"&gt;The company says that most people already have a USB-C charging brick, so there’s no longer a need to include one with its phones. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231954/samsung-to-gradually-remove-chargers-earbuds-from-future-phones"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; made similar arguments when they announced they would no longer be offering an in-box charger. That may be true, but it’s likely that the cost savings of not including a charger played a big role in those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TBzBgs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22392246"},{"title":"This is the Pixel 6","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google says it expects the Pixel 5A to be the last phone to include the charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aAa6hI"&gt;There’s also an environmental argument for ditching the charger: fewer redundant chargers being shipped to customers theoretically reduces e-waste. That’s tough to prove, though, and potentially just means that the greenhouse gas emissions of producing and shipping accessory chargers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;will be spread around between more companies&lt;/a&gt; as people buy them from third-party manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vxa6t"&gt;One thing seems certain, though: with these three major phone manufacturers committed to removing the charger, smaller companies will have an easier time following suit and doing the same. While phone shoppers may feel like it’s a case of paying the same price and getting less, this is likely a reality that we’ll all have to make peace with, so hold your wall chargers tight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 5A comes with a bigger battery and screen, smaller price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vCRMtLNtw-FxlEYDSAOV8ZwR-_I=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736882/Pixel_5a_5G_Product_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 5A features a 6.34-inch display and IP67 water-resistance rating.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVJd9p"&gt;Google has officially revealed the Pixel 5A 5G, a phone it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;kind of announced in April&lt;/a&gt; to contradict rumors that it had been canceled. It comes with a short list of updated features compared to its 4A 5G predecessor, including a slightly bigger screen, a much bigger battery, and an IP67 rating for water resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UkhGL"&gt;Few though they may be, these are some important tweaks to an already good midrange phone, and the best part is that the price has gotten smaller: in the US it will cost $449, which is $50 less than the Pixel 4A 5G’s introductory price. The 5A goes on sale in the US and Japan on August 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dLQBUh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22392246"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dUk7QBzrXEbAutV8xElm6bDgbU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786010/Pixel_5a_5G_Lifestyle_Charging__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 5A supports wired charging only, and Google says it’s the last Pixel phone that will ship with a charger in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dFP4Ys"&gt;The Pixel 5A’s screen gets a slight boost to 6.34 inches, a small increase over the 4A 5G’s 6.2-inch display. It’s still a 1080p OLED with a standard 60Hz refresh rate, despite rumors of a faster 90Hz display. The battery gets an increase to 4,680mAh, up from 3,885mAh, which Google says will last through a full day of typical use or two days using Extreme Battery Saver mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94D0WL"&gt;The 5A is also the first A-series Pixel to get an official water resistance rating. With IP67 protection, the phone is able to withstand immersion in up to three feet of water for up to 30 minutes. That’s an uncommon feature in the under-$500 class where IP ratings are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KozyrT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10704284"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xagOMn"&gt;The Pixel 5A works on all major US carrier networks and continues to offer support for sub-6GHz 5G. Unlike last year, Google will not sell a mmWave-compatible version of the phone. That’s no great loss — mmWave 5G is very fast, but range is highly limited and hard to find. Unfortunately, the 5A is also missing support for C-band 5G frequencies, which Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T will start using at the end of this year to bolster their struggling nationwide 5G networks. Google says it could add the necessary software support later, but won’t commit to doing so at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9NKf7G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Google Pixel 5 won’t be sold through any of the major wireless carriers in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b0wE2W"&gt;Other specs remain unchanged from the previous model. It still uses a Snapdragon 765G chipset with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The 12.2-megapixel main and 16-megapixel ultrawide rear cameras and 8-megapixel selfie camera are the same. There’s a rear fingerprint scanner for biometric unlock, an honest-to-god headphone jack, and an 18W charger included in the box (Google says this will be the last Pixel phone to offer one). The phone will ship with Android 11 and is guaranteed Google’s standard three years of OS platform updates and security patch support. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/08GvuipPmUn5G-8Opsns7neL2YM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786075/Pixel_5a_5G_Cases_Lineup.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Case options for the Google Pixel 5A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tZCRck"&gt;Unlike the 4A 5G, the Google Pixel 5 won’t be sold through any of the major wireless carriers in the US. Instead, it’ll be offered directly from the Google Store and through Google Fi. It will be sold in just one finish — “mostly black” — with four colorful case options available separately to spice things up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California regulators think T-Mobile lied to get Sprint merger approved</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mBwD5pXU5PHWS1f7m8ZEHarD5yY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69734661/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The California Public Utilities Commission is displeased with T-Mobile.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dTVLvz"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M398/K955/398955746.PDF"&gt;a ruling published on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile made false and misleading statements in testimony to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) about its plans for Sprint’s legacy CDMA network. The company will have the opportunity to explain why it shouldn’t face sanctions for violating the commission’s rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwDGYx"&gt;The decision comes after a long back-and-forth that started with a petition from Dish Network in April asking the Commission to modify its decision on the Sprint acquisition. Dish claimed that T-Mobile made statements under oath that indicated the company would shut down Sprint’s 3G CDMA network in a three-year timeframe. When T-Mobile announced it would decommission the network on January 1st, 2022, Dish cried foul and appealed to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qSyo3w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A recent letter from the DOJ acknowledged ‘grave concerns’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGJGQb"&gt;It would seem that CPUC agrees with Dish. It cited testimony given by T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray, who it says neglected to mention that the PCS spectrum the CDMA network occupies would be needed for its 5G build-out. Ray also stated that maintaining the legacy network would not impact its plans for 5G expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLKqTQ"&gt;When Dish called out the 2022 CDMA shutdown date as premature, T-Mobile then claimed that the short timeframe was necessary because that PCS spectrum &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be needed to support 5G services after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QdHh6L"&gt;The Commission relied on the specific false statements, omissions, and/or misleading assurances T-Mobile gave regarding its use of the PCS spectrum and its repeated references to a three-year customer migration period without a degraded experience in framing D.20-04-008. Further, it appears that these false statements, omissions and/or misleading assurances and the related time references were intended to induce the Commission to approve the merger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eUXYLb"&gt;As a refresher, T-Mobile agreed to sell Sprint’s prepaid brand Boost Mobile to Dish as a condition of the merger deal. The idea was to set Dish up to fill the void in the wireless market that Sprint would leave as the fourth national carrier. The newly acquired Boost customer base — many of who still rely on the older CDMA network — would help Dish get a running start as it built out its own wireless network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84Fpf0"&gt;That’s... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"&gt;not really working out how regulators envisioned&lt;/a&gt;, to the surprise of nobody who was paying attention at the time. But while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618472/doj-letter-dish-t-mobile-3g-cdma-network-shutdown"&gt;a recent letter from the Department of Justice to T-Mobile and Dish&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged “grave concerns” regarding the CDMA shutdown, this ruling from CPUC goes a step further to potentially impose sanctions on T-Mobile. If the company can’t provide an adequate reason for violating the Commission’s rules, it may be ordered to pay up to $100,000 in fines for each of its offenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UchDu5"&gt;That, unfortunately, doesn’t sound like a whole lot of money, especially considering what T-Mobile stands to earn from Boost customers as it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598163/t-mobile-metro-5g-prepaid-boost-cricket-switch-promotion"&gt;attempts to convert them with waived fees and discounted plans&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, T-Mobile will have the chance to defend itself at its virtual hearing scheduled for September 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile says unauthorized access to its data occurred, not clear if customer info involved</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="31aRzY"&gt;Following a weekend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/15/22626270/t-mobile-investigating-report-customer-data-breach"&gt;report that its servers had been breached&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile said Monday that unauthorized access to some of its data occurred, but it had not yet determined whether personal customer data was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0dH6o"&gt;“We are confident that the entry point used to gain access has been closed, and we are continuing our deep technical review of the situation across our systems to identify the nature of any data that was illegally accessed,” the company said in a news release. “This investigation will take some time but we are working with the highest degree of urgency. Until we have completed this assessment we cannot confirm the reported number of records affected or the validity of statements made by others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwtto3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that a post on an underground forum claimed to be selling data stolen from T-Mobile’s servers, and that the seller of the data said it included Social Security numbers, names, addresses, and driver’s license information related to more than 100 million people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3VazM"&gt;T-Mobile said Monday that it was investigating the claims, “conducting an extensive analysis alongside digital forensic experts to understand the validity of these claims, and we are coordinating with law enforcement.” The statement added that T-Mobile would communicate with customers once the company had a clearer understanding of what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvpltv"&gt;T-Mobile has been the target of several data breaches in the last few years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security"&gt;most recently in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. During that incident, call-related information and phone numbers for some of its customers may have been exposed, but the company said at the time that it did not include more sensitive info such as names or Social Security numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile investigating report of customer data breach that reportedly involves 100 million people</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;T Mobile may have suffered a customer data breach | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9wio2Z"&gt;T-Mobile confirmed Sunday that it’s looking into an online forum post that claims to be selling a large trove of its customers’ sensitive data. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that it was in contact with the seller of the data, who said they had taken data from T-Mobile’s servers that included Social Security numbers, names, addresses, and driver license information related to more than 100 million people. After reviewing samples of the data, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported it appeared authentic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxW1fJ"&gt;“We are aware of claims made in an underground forum and have been actively investigating their validity,” a T-Mobile spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We do not have any additional information to share at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZBesi"&gt;It’s not clear when the data may have been accessed, but T-Mobile has been the target of several data breaches in the last few years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security"&gt;most recently in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. During that incident, call-related information and phone numbers for some of its customers may have been exposed, but the company said at the time that it did not include more sensitive info such as names or Social Security numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CI0mEH"&gt;In 2018, hackers accessed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17776836/tmobile-hack-data-breach-personal-information-two-million-customers"&gt;personal information for roughly 2 million T-Mobile customers&lt;/a&gt; that included names, addresses, and account numbers, and in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20978498/tmobile-security-disclosed-breach-prepaid-customers"&gt;2019, some of T-Mobile’s prepaid customers&lt;/a&gt; were affected by a breach that also accessed names, addresses, and account numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHAFjZ"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/pii-notice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_21975880__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;March 2020 breach&lt;/a&gt; exposed some T-Mobile customers’ financial information, Social Security numbers, and other account information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola is updating its first-gen foldable Razr — with Android 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vnq9LHmbpjTnN2EJ0oi1YzPVkog=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723914/awhite_200210_3893_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PYMq5g"&gt;You could be forgiven for forgetting about Motorola’s folding phones in light of new shiny ones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22613790/samsung-galaxy-fold-flip-3-event-watch-announcements"&gt;announced by the likes of Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, but someone at the company must care about them — &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/motorola-razr-update/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new OS update has been released for the 2019 Razr&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it from Android 10, to Android 11 (&lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/08/13/motorola-razr-android-11-update/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Droid-Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Yes, that’s correct — the OS that &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-11-update-tracker-1155652/"&gt;started hitting Pixels in September of 2020&lt;/a&gt; is the one that became available for the Razr today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsn1DE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The original Razr reboot and the Razr 5G both became available in 2020. However, the first one was announced in 2019, so I’ll refer to it as the 2019 Razr to help avoid confusion between it and the Razr 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vZq3an"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Getting the update only a few months after its much better successor isn’t too shabby&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sBk7g7"&gt;While it may seem like the update for the 2019 Razr is woefully late, consider this: according to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/27/the-moto-razr-5g-is-finally-getting-android-11-catching-up-to-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold2/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://motorola-mobility-en-in.custhelp.com/app/software-upgrade/g_id/2014"&gt;Motorola’s updates page&lt;/a&gt;, Android 11 started rolling out to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;much better 2020 Razr 5G&lt;/a&gt; sometime between April and July. For how first-gen the 2019 Razr is, getting the update only a few months after its successor isn’t too shabby (despite the fact that getting it almost a year after it started rolling out is pretty rough, on an absolute timescale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLBHVM"&gt;Motorola’s update issues aren’t limited to its foldables, however. Many of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;recent phones&lt;/a&gt; only come with the promise of two years of security updates, with some higher-end ones getting one major OS update. Given that the Razr &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21255018/motorola-razr-foldable-external-display-android-10-update-new-features"&gt;already got an upgrade to Android 10&lt;/a&gt; (in May of 2020), today’s update puts it at two feature updates, which is better than what Motorola promises for some of its non-folding phones. And it should be, given that the phones Motorola promises two years of security updates for cost between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$160&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538663/motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-review-specs-screen-price"&gt;$400&lt;/a&gt; — the 2019 Razr was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;$1,500 at launch&lt;/a&gt;. (Though that isn’t to say that a $400 phone should only get two years of updates.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqCKBv"&gt;Still, if you’re still rockin’ an original Razr reboot, it’s an update you didn’t have before. You can read our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426066/android-11-review-features-bubbles-priority-notifications-updates-pixel-oneplus"&gt;full rundown of what Android 11 adds here&lt;/a&gt;, but the summary is that it brings chat app bubbles, more granular privacy permissions, and a more feature-packed power menu. Just do yourself a favor and don’t look too much at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;the features&lt;/a&gt; that are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619546/android-12-beta-4-released-platform-stable-af"&gt;getting ready to drop with Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, because it’s hard to imagine that it’ll come to the older Razr anytime soon, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy A42 5G review: stuck in the middle</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A midrange phone with a big screen, huge battery, and all kinds of 5G connectivity&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Wk9ckH"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A42 5G is a thoroughly decent midrange phone that doesn’t really need to exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYZIbn"&gt;Taking it at face value, it’s fairly priced at $400 with a big 6.6-inch OLED screen, generous 5,000mAh battery, and a healthy support policy that will see it receiving security updates through the next few years. That’s a pretty good deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G08byP"&gt;In the context of Samsung’s Galaxy A lineup, it’s situated between the Galaxy A52 5G and the A32 5G, two very good options in their own price brackets. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;$499 A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; offers a few more high-end bells and whistles than the A42 5G, like a fast refresh screen and an IP67 waterproof rating. At $279, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;the more basic A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; includes an LCD rather than OLED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ZGoAx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10695334"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x0BQxc"&gt;But if you’re shopping for a new device with Verizon, you won’t see either the A52 5G or the A32 5G on the retailer’s shelves (digital or otherwise). Instead, you’ll only find the A42 5G, thanks to one feature it has and the others don’t: mmWave 5G support. Until recently, this was a feature reserved for premium phones, and the A42 5G is one of the least expensive devices that can connect with the network. Verizon in particular has been pushing this super-fast flavor of 5G hard over the past couple of years. Despite its efforts, mmWave is still scarce and highly range-limited, but the carrier is still heavily biasing its stock toward devices that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRDgF6"&gt;That’s why the A42 5G exists, at least in the US, but I’m not convinced that’s a good enough reason for anyone besides Verizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L9JiJoZsAjtaPj1oGPEMZAPbtnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766364/ajohnson_210804_4696_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A42 5G’s glossy, plastic back features a gradient pattern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uClYAU"&gt;Samsung A42 5G screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MvQd48"&gt;The Galaxy A42 5G offers a big 6.6-inch 720p OLED screen. That’s not a lot of resolution stretched across a fairly big panel, and it shows — if you look closely at images you’ll see some pixelation. The screen gets bright enough for indoor use, but I had a hard time seeing it outside even with brightness maxed out. The OLED panel shows nice contrast compared to an LCD (i.e., what you’ll get in a less expensive model like the A32 5G), but otherwise the display is a little underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5h1TCr"&gt;The A42 5G offers an in-display fingerprint sensor for biometric unlocking and it’s one of the better ones I’ve come across in this budget-to-midrange class — it’s responsive and only occasionally fussy. Budget phones often have sensors that are less precise and require additional scans more frequently, and that is a real pain considering how many times we unlock our devices every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z8BnPi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The screen gets bright enough for indoor use, but I had a hard time seeing it outside&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xacy1I"&gt;Battery life is excellent thanks to a large 5,000mAh cell — most days I only drained it to 70 percent by bedtime, but even a day with heavy use that included a Zoom call on cellular data only brought it down around 50 percent. A power user would definitely get a full day and a little extra from it, and with moderate use it can easily be stretched to two days on a charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcXOlT"&gt;Overall performance from the A42 5G’s Snapdragon 750 processor and 4GB of RAM (there’s a healthy 128GB of storage, too, and it’s expandable via MicroSD) is good for day-to-day tasks. The only slowness I noticed was a little bit of lag starting the camera app, and slight delays using more processing-intensive camera features like portrait mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1VuWye"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung has guaranteed two additional OS upgrades and four years of security support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfJI3i"&gt;The US version of the A42 5G ships with Android 11. Beyond that, Samsung has guaranteed two additional OS upgrades and four years of security support. In terms of device longevity, that puts it ahead of a lot of the midrange Android competition, which often only sees a couple of years of security support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCUOuO"&gt;Samsung’s current implementation of Android is a little more cluttered than we prefer, and activating it on Verizon’s network means you’ll end up with even more pre-downloaded apps on top of that. It’s a lot. There’s some sort of game featuring a cartoon bear on the phone I’ve been using for the past few weeks, and I do not care for it but I haven’t been able to summon the energy to uninstall it either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d2zXRM1cK2ypkrBKxhXMfqgCU94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766365/ajohnson_210804_4696_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A42 5G’s rear camera array is headlined by a 48-megapixel f/1.8 standard wide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XiXEPl"&gt;Samsung A42 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="t8CC3A"&gt;The A42 5G includes a 48-megapixel f/1.8 main rear camera, accompanied by an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, and 2-megapixel depth sensor, which is all par for the midrange class. There’s also a 13-megapixel selfie camera around front. A version of the phone sold in the UK and Europe included a 5-megapixel macro and a slightly higher-res 5-megapixel depth sensor, but we’re not missing out on anything important by not having those cameras on the US version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZWgmyz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10696319"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0oTt15"&gt;In good light outdoors, the Galaxy A42 5G takes vibrant, detailed photos. Like other Samsung devices before it, the A42 produces colors that lean toward oversaturated, which can be distracting if a more natural look is your thing. Portrait mode photos are convincing enough, and the camera can sometimes struggle deciding on white balance and exposure in mixed lighting situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dft8Ej"&gt;Photos in very low light show a lot of smeared detail thanks to noise reduction, but outside of the Pixel phones in this price bracket, that’s not something we’d expect a midrange device to excel at. All told, the A42 5G’s photo capabilities are on par with its class. Spending a bit more on the A52 5G will get you a stabilized main camera that will get more sharp shots in dim lighting and slightly better low-light performance in general, but in the $400 range the A42 measures up well against most of its peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dy92tpG9UhCaE0Hl3mo_tRvIlgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766363/ajohnson_210804_4696_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A42 5G’s unique selling point — mmWave 5G support — is of limited value for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yE4FDO"&gt;The Galaxy A42 5G is a fine phone for $400, and if you’re committed to buying from Verizon, it’s one of the better options at that price. But if you’re able to buy an unlocked phone or you aren’t on Verizon, then there are other options, including in Samsung’s own midrange lineup, that are well worth your consideration. Unless you live in an area with good mmWave coverage and spend a lot of your time outside where the signal can actually be reached, the A42 5G’s unique feature is of limited value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjDO3T"&gt;If you’d like to save a little money, the A32 5G is a viable alternative for $280. You’ll get the same security support longevity as the A42 5G along with similar photo capabilities, a huge battery, and 5G support that’s ready for upcoming improvements to Verizon’s and AT&amp;amp;T’s networks. Its processor is a little less robust and the LCD isn’t as nice to look at as the A42 5G’s OLED, but if these things aren’t priorities then you might as well save a little and go for the less expensive device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="cgUeJD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;don’t get too excited about mmWave&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yezL84"&gt;If you think you’ll want a little more than the A42 5G has to offer, then the $500 A52 5G is a good step-up option with a bit of a better camera, a great high refresh rate screen, and the added peace of mind of IP-rated waterproofing. If you can find a Pixel 4A 5G in stock anywhere, that would be another good alternative at $500 with a better camera, faster processor, and cleaner software. It offers a smaller 6.2-inch screen, though, and again, you’ll have a hard time finding one new at this point since its successor, the Pixel 5A, will likely be arriving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569798/google-pixel-5a-fcc-listing-leak-features-specs"&gt;in the near future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="P6mHSC"&gt;If none of the above suits you, then the A42 5G really isn’t a bad choice. Its healthy support policy, decent overall performance, and robust battery life make it one of the best options from Verizon for around $400. Just don’t get too excited about mmWave.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon vows to protect Tracfone’s low-income users in new merger promise </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZGmqIeg1HoJ4jOg442u2zdC-P4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69716127/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aafQny"&gt;On Thursday, Verizon announced a range of new public commitments to protect low-income consumers in connection with its proposed acquisition of Tracfone. The commitments are part of a deal with public-interest groups and communications workers unions, who have agreed to support the acquisition on the basis of today’s announcement.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpSM5T"&gt;For its part of the deal, Verizon pledges to continue to provide Tracfone’s Lifeline subsidy programs for at least three years after the merger closes. Verizon is also promising to offer a subsidized 5G program for low-income Tracfone users. According to the Communication Workers of America (CWA), over 1.7 million Tracfone customers depend on the Lifeline program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HD7hL"&gt;The CWA, Public Knowledge, and the Benton Institute for Broadband and Society had initially criticized Verizon’s proposed purchase of Tracfone, suggesting that the deal could harm Tracfone’s low-income customer base. But the groups announced Thursday that they would be withdrawing their opposition in response to the new concessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oYHWTd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These commitments ensure TracFone customers will continue to have access to Lifeline”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZU9RBa"&gt;“These commitments ensure TracFone customers will continue to have access to Lifeline, an essential program for millions of families,” senior CWA researcher Brian Thorn said in a statement Thursday. “Today’s success would not have been possible without the support of our allies and an FCC interested in protecting the interests of customers over corporations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NmZ4e"&gt;Last September, Verizon announced its plan to purchase Tracfone in a deal valued at more than $6 million. The acquisition would give Verizon over 20 million new subscribers and a tighter grasp on the low-income wireless and value phone market. Verizon plans to close the deal before the end of the year, although the current status of the Federal Communications Commission’s review of the merger is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVSn87"&gt;Earlier this year, several Senate Democrats called on the FCC to add similar conditions to Verizon’s proposed merger to protect low-income subscribers. On Thursday, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Ed Markey (D-MA), among others, applauded the new conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBZs6N"&gt;“These commitments should now be a floor and a starting place for the FCC’s review of the acquisition and negotiations with Verizon,” the senators wrote. “As important as the terms of these commitments are, the conditions must be made legally binding, vigilantly monitored, and vigorously enforced to ensure the company makes good on these promises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlmipB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor’s Magic 3 is its first post-Huawei flagship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EtkKQORn-43zg0BXgxFue7BGK40=/60x0:2940x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714885/HONOR_Magic3_Pro_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic 3 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cRDra4"&gt;Honor has announced its first flagship smartphones since being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;sold off by former parent company Huawei&lt;/a&gt;: the Magic 3 series. The lineup consists of three phones, the Magic 3, Magic 3 Pro, and Magic 3 Pro Plus. They’re coming first to mainland China, but Honor says they’re getting a global release at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgGMug"&gt;When they launch globally, the phones will come with Google’s apps and services, which Honor wasn’t previously able to include while a subsidiary of Huawei due to US sanctions. It should make the Magic 3 series much more competitive outside of China compared to Honor’s recent Huawei-era phones, which had to rely on Huawei’s own services and AppGallery to download software. This setup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;came with significant drawbacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOPGbyTORkiB8KxGywbOOR323zI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22777959/HONOR_Magic3_Blue_Hour.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Honor&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic 3 (left) and the Honor Magic 3 Pro Plus (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NoTYks"&gt;The Magic 3 Pro and Pro Plus are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 Plus processor, while the standard Magic 3 has a Snapdragon 888 processor. Around front they have a 6.76-inch 1344p OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and an aggressive curve around the sides of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJsGfu"&gt;Rear cameras vary significantly between the three phones. On the standard Magic 3, there are three cameras: a 50-megapixel 1/1.56-inch main camera, a 13-megapixel 1/1.31-inch ultrawide, and a 64-megapixel monochrome camera. The Magic 3 Pro adds a 64-megapixel telephoto camera with a 1/2-inch sensor, 3.5x optical zoom, and OIS. Finally, the Pro Plus increases the size of the main 50-megapixel sensor to 1/1.28-inches, and the resolution of the ultrawide sensor to 64 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EqMgk"&gt;The Magic 3 Series has a battery capacity of 4,600mAh and supports wired fast-charging up to 66W. On the Pro and Pro Plus, there’s wireless charging up to 50W with support for reverse wireless charging, as well as an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance (the regular Magic 3 has an IP54 rating). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCnl29"&gt;The announcement of the Honor Magic 3 series follows the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243559/honor-v40-announced-huawei-google-sanctions-specs"&gt;V40 in January&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536512/honor-50-series-pro-release-date-news-features-google-mobile-services-apps-play-store"&gt;Honor 50 in June&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite confirming that the Honor 50 will eventually receive a global release, complete with Google’s apps and services, an exact release date is yet to be confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxYSiU"&gt;The Honor Magic 3 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage will sell for €899 (about $1,055), while the Magic 3 Pro with the same configuration of RAM and storage will cost €1,099 (about $1,290). The Honor Magic 3 Pro Plus, which comes with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, will cost €1,499 (about $1,760). The exact date of the phones’ global release is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
