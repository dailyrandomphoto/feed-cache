    <title>Nothing company now owns the Essential brand, for some reason</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mwBx1i"&gt;Nothing, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices"&gt;recently-launched startup&lt;/a&gt; from former OnePlus executive, Carl Pei, has acquired the Essential brand, according to a &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/15/essential-carl-pei-nothing-technologies/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; citing &lt;a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003234098"&gt;filings at the UK Intellectual Property Office&lt;/a&gt;. Essential, of course, was the company started by Android creator Andy Rubin after he left Google. It launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16165040/essential-phone-review-android-andy-rubin"&gt;single smartphone&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134985/essential-phone-shutting-down-andy-rubin-startup"&gt;shuttering its doors&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/12/17004278/essential-phone-2017-sales-90k-units-sold-six-months-post-launch"&gt;poor sales performance&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing’s acquisition, which was completed on January 6th, 2021, ahead of Pei’s formal announcement of Nothing, apparently includes all of the trademarks, logo, and other branding of Essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAEZBC"&gt;It’s not clear what Pei’s new company plans to do with the Essential brand (or anything else for that matter; the information on what exactly Nothing’s product plans are is as scant as the company’s name itself), but as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes, there isn’t much aside from the brand left at Essential, since the company closed its doors last year. Essential had planned to release a follow up to the one smartphone it did bring to market, as well as launch an ambitious new smart home platform, but neither of those ever made it out of planning phases and were obviously scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jvWFjQekW0Spop3_Vz3AWcexzc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9070829/vpavic_170815_1924_0035.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Essential Phone was the only product Essential brought to market before closing its doors in 2020.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dgEnw2"&gt;It’s also not clear &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; exactly Nothing would want to acquire the Essential brand, which can best be described as “tarnished” after a failed product launch and association with Rubin’s name. A 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;detailed allegations of sexual misconduct levied against Rubin during his time at Google and a massive $90 million buyout he received for leaving the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peQk1K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google’s&lt;/em&gt; article says that Nothing will reveal more information about its forthcoming products in the near future, so perhaps we’ll learn more about what it plans to do with the Essential brand sooner rather than later. We’ve reached out to Nothing for comment on the matter and will update this article should the company respond.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy F62 is coming to India with huge 7,000mAh battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4d9rW3fCZhK062zMykED1k3ef10=/0x0:9999x6666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68819662/FSeries_Shot3_Front_Blue.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy F62 will be available in blue, grey, and green.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="79hrjT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/samsung-launches-galaxy-f62-the-fullonspeedy-smartphone-with-flagship-exynos-9825-processor-64mp-quad-camera-and-7000mah-battery"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy F62&lt;/a&gt; is a new affordable handset that’s releasing in India on February 22nd. It features a massive 7,000mAh battery and the same Exynos 9825 processor that powered the Galaxy Note 10 back in 2019. It’s available in two variants: one with 6GB of RAM that costs ₹23,999 (around $330), and a second with 8GB of RAM that costs ₹25,999 (around $358).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="waWhSY"&gt;Around front you’ll find a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED display with a 32-megapixel selfie camera contained within a hole-punch notch, while on the back there’s a quad camera array. Here there’s a 64-megapixel main camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide with a 123-degree field of view, a 5-megapixel macro camera, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. There’s a side-mounted fingerprint sensor on the phone which is available in green, grey, or blue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JRdjoIe1iGqJiehVAEq7dCFstbE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22304603/FSeries_Shot8_Back_black.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Around back there are four cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NXgyNZ"&gt;Internally, alongside the Exynos 9825 processor, the Galaxy F62 has 128GB of storage, which is expandable by up to 1TB. There’s space for two SIM cards, and the battery can be fast-charged at 25W using the charger that comes in the box. The phone is running Samsung’s OneUI 3.1 software out of the box, and there’s support for the NFC Samsung Pay service, as well as “Single Take,” Samsung’s camera software that automatically assembles a series of photos and videos simultaneously for you to select from after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWdSp0"&gt;From its specs, the Galaxy F62 sees Samsung’s past flagship features trickle down to an affordable handset, accompanied by a huge battery. Samsung says it’ll be available from a variety of retailers including its own online store, Flipkart, Reliance Digital, and My Jio. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is secretly building a smartwatch and planning to sell it next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WbriZtUs24OslXeenlmvwaQzJS0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812001/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PnVUrK"&gt;Facebook is building a smartwatch as part of its ongoing hardware efforts, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-plans-smartwatch-with-focus-on-messaging-health?utm_source=ti_app"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The device is said to be an Android-based smartwatch, though the report does not say whether Facebook intends for the device to run Google’s Wear OS. It also says Facebook is working on building its own operating system for hardware devices and that future iterations of the wearable may run that software instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNzUm6"&gt;The smartwatch would have messaging, health, and fitness features, the report says, and would join Facebook’s Oculus virtual reality headsets and Portal video chat devices as part of the social network’s growing hardware ecosystem. Facebook is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;branded Ray-Ban smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; to come out later this year and a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/realitylabs/projectaria/"&gt;separate augmented reality research initiative known as Project Aria&lt;/a&gt;, which is part of the company’s broader AR explorations it’s been working on for some time now. Facebook declined to comment regarding any planned smartwatch projects  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6O3hp"&gt;The social networking giant’s hardware ambitions are no secret. The company has more than 6,000 employees working on various augmented and virtual reality projects and as part of existing hardware divisions like Oculus and Portal, as well as experimental initiatives under its Facebook Reality Labs division, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/facebook-smart-glasses-coming-sooner-than-later-without-ar?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported last month&lt;/a&gt;. And although Facebook has not expressed a strong interest in health and fitness devices in the past, the company does have a track record in wearables with its Oculus headsets and forthcoming smart glasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KUrLI"&gt;Facebook also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20881032/facebook-ctrl-labs-acquisition-neural-interface-armband-ar-vr-deal"&gt;acquired the neural interface startup CTRL-Labs&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. CTRL-Labs specialized in building wireless input mechanisms, including devices that could transmit electrical signals from the brain to computing devices without the need for traditional touchscreen or physical button inputs. The startup’s intellectual property and ongoing research may factor into whatever wearables Facebook builds in the future — including a smartwatch, smart glasses, or future Oculus headsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGC1oK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 12th, 6:22PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted that Facebook declined to comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snZXKT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 12th, 7:17PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that Facebook’s Ray-Ban smart glasses partnership is distinct from Project Aria, an AR research initiative Facebook has no plans to commercialize. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon delivery app Mentor tracks drivers’ locations and measures their performance </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_12qiyCy9UP7DzeV3CFhWLByZY0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68811572/mdoying_180411_2466_0050stills.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6pz0yk"&gt;Amazon built its own in-house mobile app called Mentor that it uses to track the location and rate the performance of third-party delivery drivers, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/amazon-mentor-app-tracks-and-disciplines-delivery-drivers.html"&gt;new report from CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. The app tracks a driver’s location at all times and also generates a daily score that factors into performance evaluations, with low scores potentially harming a third-party delivery company’s relationship with Amazon for future contracts, the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQo9fB"&gt;Amazon bills the app as a tool for improving safety, but both drivers and privacy proponents cited by CNBC worry the Mentor software is also a tool for surveillance of drivers and as another form of pressure applied on the workers to ensure they’re delivering packages as fast as possible. Earlier this month, an Amazon promotional video posted online &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;revealed a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; involving always-on security cameras from a firm called Netradyne that are similarly used to monitor and measure a driver’s performance, causing alarm among privacy advocates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzUrvQ"&gt;“Safety is Amazon’s top priority. Whether it’s state-of-the art telemetrics and advanced safety technology in last-mile vans, driver-safety training programs, or continuous improvements within our mapping and routing technology, we have invested tens of millions of dollars in safety mechanisms across our network, and regularly communicate safety best practices to drivers,” an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5VtXw0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon says its monitoring measures are designed to improve safety&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xXQjYB"&gt;As its operations have expanded, Amazon has increasingly built out its own delivery infrastructure, part of which is the delivery service program (DPS). This program contracts third-party companies to help with the last-mile delivery that, until a few years ago, was mostly handled by companies like FedEx and UPS. Amazon uses its own drivers to help with cost-cutting measures and to increase the speed and efficiency of deliveries, as part of its broader effort to own and operate more of its logistics chain with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215279/amazon-buys-boeing-jets-planes-delta-westjet"&gt;purchases and leases of cargo freighters and airplanes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWM1gx"&gt;There have, however, been issues regarding driver and pedestrian safety. Amazon has, in some cases, skirted direct accountability for crashes, injuries, and even deaths at the hands of drivers delivering its packages to customers’ homes because of the contract nature of the work, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/us/amazon-delivery-drivers-accidents.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the company has come under fire for using software and other tools to prioritize the speed of deliveries over potential safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmzL6J"&gt;As a result, Amazon has reportedly begun exercising increasing control over its drivers by managing their routes and monitoring their behavior at all times with the goal of improving safety. The Monitor app and always-on surveillance cameras are part of those measures, though some drivers are concerned about how invasive these methods are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEe9pY"&gt;CNBC says drivers congregate online and discuss ways to try to game the system. For instance, drivers have tried wrapping their phones in sweaters and storing them in the glove box of delivery vans because of how unfairly they’re dinged for standard procedures on the job that the Monitor app mistakes for reckless driving, like marking a delivery as completed by picking the phone up. “If your device moves at all, it’s going to count against you,” one driver told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pFUrw"&gt;There are also concerns about the location sharing permissions. Drivers are asked to download the app on their personal devices and to enable “always allow” location sharing, which has some drivers concerned Amazon is overstepping its boundary with regard to driver privacy, CNBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New North Dakota bill would force Apple to allow alternative app stores and payment systems</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q-d1yMVzQ6_Ag-Fic9CxIW_ZQKI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799462/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TQFidg"&gt;A new bill introduced in the North Dakota Senate might have far-reaching consequences for app store operators. The bill, &lt;a href="https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/67-2021/documents/21-1044-01000.pdf"&gt;Senate Bill 2333&lt;/a&gt;, seeks to ban stores like Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store from mandating developers only use those app stores and their respective in-app payment systems. It also bans retaliation against developers in the event they choose an alternative distribution channel or payment system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6YbDg"&gt;“The purpose of the bill is to level the playing field for app developers in North Dakota and protect customers from devastating, monopolistic fees imposed by big tech companies,” said Sen. Kyle Davison (R-Fargo), who introduced the bill before a Senate committee on Tuesday, told reporters in a press conference yesterday, as &lt;a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/north-dakota-senate-bill-targets-monopolistic-app-stores/article_dc491c88-97e0-54cd-beb2-5a26044cb97c.html"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Davison said the 30 percent fee imposed on app developers who sell software through Apple and Google’s marketplaces has the effect of “raising prices and limiting choices for consumers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmLQNZ"&gt;The bill is quite simple and lays out three key restrictions for any “digital application distribution platform” that exceeds $10 million in annual revenue. That means an app store cannot: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="KrRc8v"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“Require a developer to use a digital application distribution platform or digital transaction platform as the exclusive mode of distributing a digital product.”&lt;/strong&gt; That would likely mean that companies like Apple would have to allow app purchases outside a single locked-down store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xvC9Ot"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“Require a developer to use an in-application payment system as the exclusive mode of accepting payment from a user to download a software application or purchase a digital or physical product through a software application.”&lt;/strong&gt; This would allow an iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, to process in-app payments through Epic instead of Apple’s system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JGsDGf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Retaliate against a developer for choosing to use an alternative application store or in-application payment system.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="Femqby"&gt;As a state bill, the proposed legislation would only affect the operation of businesses like the App Store within North Dakota. But the sweeping changes the bill calls for would likely require companies like Apple to make substantial platform-level changes that could affect software distribution on a national scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9Tusp"&gt;The use of alternative in-app payment methods is at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;heart of an ongoing legal battle&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;em&gt;Fornite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games and both Apple and Google, after &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;was removed from the App Store and Play Store in August of last year for introducing its own payment processing tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijA1wq"&gt;Epic purposefully engineered its &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;update to bypass the 30 percent cut of all in-app purchases required by Apple and Google as a form of protest, both to the standard 30 percent cut and specifically Apple’s App Store rules that bar third-party app stores from the iPhone. (Google does allow Android users to sideload third-party software and for developers to create alternative app stores for distributing software, though it does make doing so difficult.) Epic is now suing both companies for alleged antitrust violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3ti9F9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The purpose of the bill is to level the playing field for app developers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LCbdc1"&gt;The Epic case is just one part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506682/google-apple-amazon-facebook-antitrust-report-house-judiciary"&gt;growing antitrust movement in the US that’s taken aim at Big Tech&lt;/a&gt;. Every one of the major US tech companies, save Microsoft, is currently under increased antitrust scrutiny from the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general, with various levels of investigations underway. While Apple is not under formal investigation, CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;testified this past summer&lt;/a&gt; before the Senate Judiciary Committee during its tech antitrust hearing. Meanwhile, the European Commission has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;two ongoing antitrust investigations&lt;/a&gt; into Apple’s App Store and Apple Pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4f3J3m"&gt;Apple has already testified against North Dakota’s new bill in a hearing on Tuesday with North Dakota’s Senate Industry, Business and Labor Committee. Apple’s Erik Neuenschwander, its chief privacy engineer, told the committee the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it” and that it would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into iPhone by design,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;. “Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1XOt5"&gt;Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, who attended the hearing and testified in favor of the bill, criticized Apple for exaggerating the threat the bill poses to its business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;North Dakota's SB 2333 is the first real, concrete legislative proposal I've seen that actually gives me hope that tech monopolies aren't going to rule the world forever. Fargo or Bismarck sound like wonderful places to set up shop under a shield against abuse   &lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1359203441827078145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fNPc52"&gt;Hansson has become a vocal critic of Apple’s App Store policies, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust"&gt;showdown his company had with Apple&lt;/a&gt; last summer over Basecamp’s Hey email client. The disagreement centered on the functions of the Hey iOS email app, and Hansson and Basecamp CEO Jason Fried complained that the situation was emblematic of Apple’s inconsistently applied rules and the lengths the company goes to ensure developers are not sidestepping the 30 percent cut mandate. Although Apple and Basecamp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;reached a compromise&lt;/a&gt;, Hansson has since called for congressional action, as well as stronger antitrust regulation, to try to force Apple to alter its policies and to reign in Big Tech at large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APyX5i"&gt;In written testimony Hansson prepared prior to the hearing, he laid out his case for Senate Bill 2333. “After the recitals, the 17 lines of SB 2333 read like music. Written in a language I can understand without hiring counsel to parse it for me. It almost seems too good to be true! But I sincerely hope that it is not,” he wrote in his testimony, which he later &lt;a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/testimony-before-the-north-dakota-senate-industry-business-and-labor-committee/"&gt;released online&lt;/a&gt;. “That you will listen to the small software developers from all over the country, who are tired of being bullied and shaken down by a handful of big tech monopolists out of Seattle and Silicon Valley.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmdyQn"&gt;Hansson says the US needs a “fair digital marketplace free of monopoly abuse” and that “no single change will have a greater impact than giving small software makers like us a choice when it comes to in-app payment systems, and protection from retaliation, if we refuse the onerous deal the monopolists are offering.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayiay1"&gt;Chairman Sen. Jerry Klein (R-Fessenden) said during the committee hearing that “there’s still some mulling to be done” and that no action would be taken on the bill as of yet. Neither Apple nor Google have immediately responded to requests for comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s Trump ban is permanent, even if he runs for office again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yw0IusnZcVqopV7ucPz0W6bGzcg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68798912/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7q6JHy"&gt;Former President Donald Trump will not be returning to Twitter at any point in the future, according to the company’s chief financial officer. In an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1359502706776432642"&gt;interview with CNBC’s &lt;em&gt;Squawk Box&lt;/em&gt; program on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter CFO Ned Segal said that running for public office again would not reverse the ban the company handed out to Trump in the aftermath of the US Capitol riot on January 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGdqyg"&gt;The question is relevant considering Trump’s ongoing impeachment trial. A central question in the trial is whether Democrats can bar Trump from running for president again in 2024 or seeking other public office. Regardless of the outcome, the @realDonaldTrump will still remain suspended for good, Segal said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UdaPiA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"The way our policies work, when you're removed from the platform, you're removed from the platform whether you're a commentator, you're a CFO or you are a former or current public official," says &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TWTR&amp;amp;src=ctag&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;$TWTR&lt;/a&gt; CFO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nedsegal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@nedsegal&lt;/a&gt; on if President Trump's account could be restored. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZZxascb9Rz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZZxascb9Rz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1359502706776432642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Tj7DY"&gt;“The way our policies work, when you’re removed from the platform, you’re removed from the platform,” Segal told CNBC, “whether you’re a commentator, you’re a CFO, or you are a former or current public official. Remember, our policies are designed to make sure that people are not inciting violence, and if anybody does that, we have to remove them from the service and our policies don’t allow people to come back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJexSj"&gt;Twitter was far from the only platform to take action against Trump following the events of January 6th and Trump’s continuous refusal to accept the results of the 2020 US election. Trump was also banned from Facebook and Instagram, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218805/donald-trump-platforms-bans-facebook-twitter-youtube"&gt;scores of other platforms took various moderation actions&lt;/a&gt; of some sort as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EO9mKb"&gt;But Twitter was Trump’s primary mode of communication, and his absence on the platform has dealt a serious blow to his ability to spread false information about the election results and remain an active participant in discussions around the Biden presidency’s first few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRj0ka"&gt;Yesterday, Twitter reported fourth quarter earnings results indicating it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275079/twitter-trump-ban-daily-user-growth-q4-2020-earnings"&gt;continued to gain new users&lt;/a&gt; even after banning Trump. “We are a platform that is obviously much larger than any one topic or account,” Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said on a call with investors on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyrCh0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Fi VPN is coming to iPhones this spring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JHjyVR3QpFeLXCVfxxRXgTYC8qQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793453/vpavic_4243_20201018_0154.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TUjLLc"&gt;Google launched a VPN for its Google Fi cell service in beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18089834/project-fi-enhanced-network-vpn-privacy-google-announcement"&gt;back in November 2018&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Fi subscribers to route their phone’s internet traffic through an encrypted connection to help protect security and privacy. Until now, though, it has only been available for Android users, but that will change soon. Google plans to roll out the Fi VPN to Fi subscribers on iPhones beginning this spring, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-fi/google-fi-vpn-updates-help-you-connect-safely/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTUrSs"&gt;Google also announced that the VPN is officially exiting beta on Android. “After listening to your feedback and making performance improvements, we’re taking the Fi VPN out of beta for Android phone users,” Google said. The VPN is included with all Google Fi plans, so you should be able to try it out now if you’re a Fi subscriber on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x45ass"&gt;In addition, Google says it’s starting to roll out a new privacy and security hub for Fi users on Android. “The hub makes it easy for you to learn more about privacy and security features on Fi, and manage them with just one tap,” according to Google. “This includes the Fi VPN and other tools that protect your personal information and put you in control of who can reach you.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Visible customers can now get 5G and use eSIMs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRPr7-QCR4o6Q49AO015tkRUWKE=/128x0:1508x920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68792395/1_SmzBzHMl2wygmhoz_KWrGg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;eSIM makes it possible to activate your device with a new carrier without waiting for a physical SIM card. | Image: Visible&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nyx3bQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18195784/verizon-visible-carrier-selling-devices-iphone-galaxy"&gt;Visible&lt;/a&gt;, the prepaid carrier owned by Verizon, is adding some new services that make using it just a bit more like subscribing to one of the big wireless carriers. Starting today, Visible now supports activating service via eSIM. It only works with recent, compatible iPhones, but Visible says it will add support for Android devices soon. The company also is offering 5G service (with limits) and free calling and messaging to Canada and Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgbEQY"&gt;Visible customers’ access to Verizon’s 5G network has some important fine print: both Nationwide and Ultra Wideband are included, but data speeds will be capped at 200Mbps. Direct carrier subscribers (AKA Verizon customers) also have priority on the fastest data speeds during times of congestion. That’s also a common practice of MVNOs. While they can offer competitively priced plans, they’re commonly subject to limitations like speed reductions for heavy data users and streaming video at 480p only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5U9XB2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Both Nationwide and Ultra Wideband are included, but data speeds will be capped at 200Mbps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NFKaiv"&gt;eSIM support makes a lot of sense with Visible’s all-digital ethos: customers with compatible phones can switch to Visible without waiting for a physical SIM card to be mailed. By opting for an embedded rather than removable SIM card, eSIM technology makes it easier to switch carriers using an existing device. That’s also very appealing to MVNOs trying to compete with the big carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKrSSV"&gt;Many MVNOs don’t support eSIM yet, but more are coming this year. H2o Wireless and Pure Talk &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/2-prepaid-brands-offer-esim-a-sign-mvnos-are-ready-to-tap-technology"&gt;will both offer eSIM support sometime this quarter&lt;/a&gt;. But while it makes initially signing on with a new carrier easier, eSIM presents its own drawbacks, including a more complicated process when switching to a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJvfLi"&gt;Visible’s announcement today also includes news about its Party Pay plans, which allow customers to share plan costs while maintaining separate accounts and billing. Previously capped at four people, these plans can now include an unlimited number of lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iVAw5"&gt;Finally, Visible will no longer charge for calls and texts between the mainland US and Canada, Mexico, US Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. It’s increasingly the norm for US carriers to include calling and SMS from the US to neighboring regions without an extra fee or at low monthly flat rate. All of these features (except for upcoming Android eSIM support) are available starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQsVwu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, February 9th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previous version of this post identified Visible as an “MVNO.” An MVNO is a carrier that does not own the infrastructure is uses to provide service, but instead leases it. Visible is wholly owned by Verizon, so the company prefers not to be referred to as an MVNO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm announces its next-gen X65 5G modem, promises up to 10Gbps speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0gcGiN_D2rmhbvhXuESDhoerjkM=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791691/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwCuoi"&gt;Qualcomm has announced its latest 5G modem — the Snapdragon X65, a successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142381/qualcomm-x60-modem-5g-phones-faster-power-efficient-5nm-carrier"&gt;last year’s Snapdragon X60&lt;/a&gt; which just started to hit devices as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888 chipset&lt;/a&gt;. Qualcomm promises that the new modem will be much, much faster, with support for up to 10Gbps speeds on both standalone and non-standalone 5G networks (assuming your carrier supports it, that is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJloCB"&gt;It’ll likely be some time before the X65 hits any devices; if history is any indication, it likely won’t show up until next year’s flagship Snapdragon release, which presumably will be announced in December. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sgacAGS2NYapFaHGr_9_eTHgf3E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22291692/Qualcomm_Snapdragon_X65_5G_Modem_RF_System_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j4hT38"&gt;The new 10Gbps maximum download speed — up from 7.5Gbps on last year’s model — is the flashiest spec, even if its a largely meaningless one, as virtually no 5G network can provide that kind of throughput yet. But it means that there’s plenty of headroom in the specification for networks for whenever they can get to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk8c3r"&gt;That flexibility for future improvements is at the heart of one of the other big features of the X65: support for the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.3gpp.org/release-16"&gt;3GPP Release 16 specification&lt;/a&gt; (Qualcomm says that it’s the first modem to do so). That’s the so-called “5G phase 2” rollout that’s &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2020/07/07/propelling-5g-forward-closer-look-3gpp-release-16"&gt;designed to improve things&lt;/a&gt; like massive MIMO connectivity, power consumption, and more. Release 16 is also meant to help 5G networks expand from consumer to more commercial uses, thanks to better support for unlicensed spectrum and non-public networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evu5Yy"&gt;To that end, Qualcomm says that the architecture of the X65 modem system is upgradable, allowing the company to add new features over time, especially as 3GPP Release 16 continues to roll out, allowing devices to stay relevant and up to date for longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDaM9j"&gt;Along with the new modem system, Qualcomm is also announcing the Qualcomm 545 mmWave antenna, its 4th-generation mmWave antenna, which keeps the size the same as the third-generation model, but adds higher transmit power, along with support for the full range of global mmWave frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQTRrHbolAKMfxEw4U2oEDKYITE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22291694/Qualcomm_QTM547_mmWave_antenna_module.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dbm352"&gt;Lastly, Qualcomm is introducing what its calls “AI antenna tuning technology,” which it promises will enable big jumps in performance thanks to AI-powered tuning. For example, Qualcomm says that the new system is 30 percent more accurate at detecting how you’re gripping the phone in your hand, allowing it to offer improved connectivity, faster data speeds, and better battery life by utilizing a more efficient connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXg72T"&gt;The Snapdragon X65 is expected to launch in products in late 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyzhDo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9KqYx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mw6gZY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIKbTX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s CEO wants to talk to President Biden</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Billionaire Huawei Founder Ren Zhenfei Defiant in Face of Existential Threat" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dsTdD_1vM1pdBOjbEt_LxPrcR7k=/0x3:4240x2830/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791163/1146396255.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ywa5HK"&gt;Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei has called for a reset in relations between the US and the Chinese tech giant. Speaking to international media in China for the first time in more than a year, Ren expressed willingness to speak with President Biden and said he hoped for “open policies” from the new administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaSejD"&gt;“I would welcome [a call from Biden]” Ren said in translated comments provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-welcome-phone-call-from-us-president-biden.html"&gt;reported by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/huawei-ceo-hopes-reset-us-053713079.html"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3121109/huaweis-ren-zhengfei-calls-more-open-us-policy-towards-china-under"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I would talk with him about common development. Both the US and China need to develop their economies, as this is good for our society and financial balance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBEW63"&gt;“Allowing US companies to supply goods to Chinese customers is conducive to their own financial performance,” Ren said. “If Huawei’s production capacity expanded, that would mean US companies could sell more. It’s a win-win situation. I believe the new administration will weigh and balance these interests as they consider their policies. We still hope to be able to buy a lot of US components, parts, and machinery so that US companies can also develop with the Chinese economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ELCDGf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Living a Google-free life with a Huawei phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I1WQik"&gt;Huawei is currently unable to do business with US companies because the Trump administration placed it on the Department of Commerce’s trade blacklist, citing national security fears. Among other issues, this means Huawei is unable to license Android from Google, severely hampering its smartphone business outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsVcPY"&gt;This prompted Huawei to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243559/honor-v40-announced-huawei-google-sanctions-specs"&gt;sell off its Honor subsidiary&lt;/a&gt; in order to protect the brand and allow it to keep on producing smartphones, but Ren dismissed rumors that Huawei might do the same for its own smartphone division. “We will never sell our device business,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GakoO"&gt;Ren also called the iPhone 12 “the best in the world” and said that it helped make the case for Huawei’s 5G networks. “Many high-end device users in Europe use iPhones, and the way those phones operate on our networks in Europe actually is a sign we are also doing well,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UAke5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Feb 9th, 7.55AM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated Ren’s quotes to reflect an official transcript of the discussion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
