    <title>Apple and T-Mobile say iOS 15.2 didn’t switch off iCloud Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qF06W"&gt;Apple has denied that last month’s iOS 15.2 update is behind the difficulty some iPhone owners have faced with using the iCloud Private Relay feature on cellular networks. Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile earlier this week said they weren’t blocking the VPN-like feature, but T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22878885/verizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have identified that iOS 15.2 toggled it off by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F54OgM"&gt;Now Apple says that’s not the case. After releasing an updated beta of iOS 15.3 that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880835/apple-clarify-icloud-private-relay-error-messages-ios-15-3-cell-carriers"&gt;clarifies the language&lt;/a&gt; in iCloud settings, Apple &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/apple-reaffirms-icloud-private-relay-availability-refutes-t-mobiles-accusation-of-a-bug-ios-15-2/"&gt;issued a statement to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; saying that iOS 15.2 wasn’t the problem. “No changes were made to iCloud Private Relay in iOS 15.2 that would have toggled the feature off,” the statement reads. “Users are encouraged to check their Settings to see if Private Relay is enabled on their device or for a specific network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Lq8Yr2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jm2UUZ"&gt;T-Mobile has also followed up with &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; to say that that iOS 15.2 didn’t toggle the feature off after all. “Apple doesn’t change customers’ settings when they update to iOS 15.2,” the carrier says in a statement. “Customers may see an error message if they previously toggled iCloud Private Relay or Limit IP Address Tracking off in their Cellular Data Options Settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cTiEY"&gt;It’s still not entirely clear what caused all of this confusion, but the carriers do say they’re not blocking iCloud Private Relay (except for some T-Mobile plans that include content filtering services), so it’s worth double-checking your cellular settings to make sure everything’s the way it should be. Once the public version of iOS 15.3 is out, the language in settings won’t outright tell you that your cell plan doesn’t support the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to mute a word or phrase on Twitter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K9L9qO_CtfLAzWvVWNfupkuPkNE=/0x0:900x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378592/twitter.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tweet-user-name"&gt;In February 2020,  I found that that it was possible not only to mute conversations or other accounts on Twitter, but (courtesy of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nonprofWHIT/status/1229964006330380289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1229964006330380289%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F2%2F19%2F21144097%2Ftwitter-mute-tweets-word-name-tag-how-to-settings-phone-desktop"&gt;a tweet by @nonprofWHIT&lt;/a&gt; ) that you could also mute a specific &lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt;. And you could do it straight from a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZRtti"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1480958895287939072?s=20"&gt;Twitter has announced&lt;/a&gt; it is expanding this feature so that when you mute a word or phrase, it will not appear in your Explore tab or Event-based notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CalAyd"&gt;Here’s how you go about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cPBAYz"&gt;Mute words or phrases on an iPhone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kiOUjU"&gt;If you’re using the Twitter app on an iPhone, it’s a quick and easy process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WDHN6T"&gt;Long-press on the word you want to mute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="olIheA"&gt;Choose “Mute” from the pop-up menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PEzRpO"&gt;You’ll be sent to a page where you can choose from where you want to mute the word (your timeline or notifications), from whom (anyone or people you don’t follow), and the duration (forever, 24 hours, seven days, or 30 days). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long-press on the word you want to mute. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ct4FjssBFbrPRlqSFHRIEaTYgSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19731703/IMG_589D3687AA11_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press on the word you want to mute. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select where you want to mute it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDH9hXswL9-N6bXW-V0tYJdiQvU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19731705/IMG_BB887E06D435_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select where you want to mute it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VevJJq"&gt;Mute words or phrases on an Android phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QEISnd"&gt;If you’ve got an Android phone, don’t despair. You can also mute words from the Android Twitter app (or, for that matter, from the iOS Twitter app) through the app’s settings. It’s not quite as fast as doing it directly from a tweet, but it’s just as effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dioGVM"&gt;Select your icon on the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="86FxuH"&gt;Select “Settings and privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy and safety” &amp;gt; “Mute and block.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aUmPGy"&gt;Tap “Muted words.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IWrdR2"&gt;Tap the plus sign and enter the word you want to mute. You then get the same choices as to where, from whom, and duration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Android, you mute using settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nTl99kR7ncdZUAn443VgaOsHAHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161869/Screenshot_20220111_164607.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Android, you mute using settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Enter each word or phrase separately." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h4oiyYduCftQXYz_BYEYRnba7lA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161872/Screenshot_20220111_164831.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enter each word or phrase separately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="78Fb6s"&gt;If you no longer want to mute the word or you want to extend the mute time, return to the “Muted words” screen, tap on the word in question, and choose the corresponding option (“Delete word” or “Change mute time”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can always delete the muted word." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MJM9RKxdhhrJusCZm98IBsSy0b8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161887/Screenshot_20220111_164953.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can always delete the muted word.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Are you sure?" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0RO26hyhtA6H-OU6WSHsyeWV9GM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161886/Screenshot_20220111_165009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you sure?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yGqJr7"&gt;Mute words or phrases on your desktop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kIw7dK"&gt;And finally, if you’re tweeting directly from Twitter’s website, you can mute a word from there as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mUDyjq"&gt;On your desktop, from the left-hand menu, click on “More” &amp;gt; “Settings and privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy and safety” &amp;gt; “Mute and block.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PlrwIF"&gt;In the right column, click on “Muted words.” Click on the plus sign in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0x5wni"&gt;Now you can enter the word or phrase you want to mute. As with the mobile Twitter apps, you can choose whether to mute from your timeline or notifications, from anyone or people you don’t follow, and for how long. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On a desktop, you first find the “Mute and block” section." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sLiNAOQx6_OtIxogeghXdLHom1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161973/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_4.59.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On a desktop, you first find the “Mute and block” section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1BIzId"&gt;When you’ve made all your choices, click on “Save.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4rpSnz"&gt;If you want to unmute any words, go back to the “Muted words” column. Click on the red crossed-out volume symbol to the right of the word, and then click “Unmute” on the pop-up window that appears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s simple to go back and unmute a word or phrase." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R66EzpN58QfNo7ElEtgaP5xvr2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161974/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_5.01.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s simple to go back and unmute a word or phrase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7KYdrh"&gt;Some additional notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MIsPI2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/advanced-twitter-mute-options"&gt;Twitter has a number of ways&lt;/a&gt; you can mute different types of info in your timeline and notifications. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Tr9Tbt"&gt;You can also mute specific mentions of specific accounts (but not mute the account itself) by using the @ in front of the account name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hRELIu"&gt;If you mute a word, you will also mute that word’s hashtag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="znDiJJ"&gt;Muting is not case-sensitive (“spoilers” and “SPOILERS” will both work), and you can use a phrase with punctuation (“Hey, you!”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mdxx9i"&gt;Twitter is expanding the ability to mute words, phrases, etc. to areas other than timelines and notifications. Just yesterday, it announced that blocked or muted text would also no longer appear in Events-based areas:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="y91ggM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;First up, Events. Now across Android, iOS, and web, Events from accounts you’ve blocked or muted won’t appear in your Explore tab, “What’s happening” sidebar and emails, or Event-based notifications.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1480958895287939072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 11, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="56qsSQ"&gt;If / when the ability to mute is extended even further, we’ll add it to this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3o5ip"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 12th, 2022, 10:00AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on February 19th, 2020, and has been updated to allow for UI changes and new features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile say they’re not blocking Apple’s iCloud Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bVCnW6IcjHg1auWUvneXHpkTC_U=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376980/og__ishslgdhhimq.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gsPVr9"&gt;T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T — the three biggest US cellular carriers — have all confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they aren’t blocking Apple’s new iCloud Private Relay feature, following reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;some customers were having issues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;with the VPN-like feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjO0fq"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon straight-up say they’re not blocking the feature from functioning. Verizon spokesperson George L. Koroneos confirms that Private Relay works on both cellular and Fios internet connections, and AT&amp;amp;T spokesperson Seth Bloom says the carrier’s policy is not to block Private Relay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IG6Sn"&gt;T-Mobile’s situation is a little more complex: most customers shouldn’t have any issues with iCloud Private Relay. But those who use content filtering services (like the carrier’s Family Controls) won’t be able to use iCloud Private Relay, the carrier tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fa5X2u"&gt;“Customers who chose plans and features with content filtering (e.g. parent controls) do not have access to the iCloud Private Relay to allow these services to work as designed. All other customers have no restrictions,” T-Mobile spokesperson Bennet Ladyman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That tracks with Apple’s messaging around the feature, which notes that “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uuaZLl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"T-Mobile identifies issue that prevented some iPhone users from using Private Relay","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="X5VL8i"&gt;T-Mobile’s spokesperson also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the carrier &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; find an issue with Apple’s recent iOS 15.2 update that caused iCloud Private Relay to be toggled off following the update. “Overnight our team identified that in the 15.2 iOS release, some device settings default to the feature being toggled off. We have shared this with Apple. This is not specific to T-Mobile.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnIzGG"&gt;If the problem really is on Apple’s end, it could also explain the issues that some Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T customers may have been experiencing in the wake of the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o68AKN"&gt;That said, it’s possible that carriers may sour on supporting Apple’s privacy feature in the future. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Fapple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22878885%2Fverizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Vodafone, Telefonica, Orange, and T-Mobile have all signed a joint letter asking the European Commission to block Private Relay, arguing that the feature is “cutting off other networks and servers from accessing vital network data and metadata, including those operators in charge of the connectivity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZv0Sy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;iCloud Private Relay&lt;/a&gt; is similar in many ways to a VPN, working to automatically mask your internet traffic from both Apple, your ISP, and anyone else trying to snoop around what you’re doing online. The feature is still in beta but is currently available to anyone subscribing to a paid iCloud plan — although Apple doesn’t keep it toggled on by default, at least for now. There are other limitations, too: Private Relay won’t let you spoof your internet as coming from outside your rough geographic area (a popular use for VPNs to get around national or regional content limits), and it only works in Apple’s own Safari browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Apm9t5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile identifies issue that prevented some iPhone users from using Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a679SQQpMlD7hp-oo9jH_r4cJPA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372164/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lX89e"&gt;T-Mobile said Tuesday that it had not blocked iCloud Private relay, and that it had identified what was causing some iPhone users to appear blocked from using the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OE9nGi"&gt;“Overnight our team identified that in the 15.2 iOS release, some device settings default to the feature being toggled off. We have shared this with Apple.

&lt;p id="hwCA9M"&gt;Private Relay is still in beta in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, and it isn’t turned on by default. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;You have to go into your iPhone’s settings to switch it on&lt;/a&gt;, which is where some T-Mobile customers first noticed the message above appearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z095du"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480631410239094797?s=20"&gt;a reply to that tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the user shows what happens when you click the “Learn More” button below the initial message — there, Apple explains why T-Mobile might be blocking the feature. “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay,” it reads. “Your cellular provider may be providing network-based services, such as Parental Controls, requiring them to view the traffic on your network.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oYDJF"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iCloud Private Relay conflicts with a number of T-Mobile services, but that doesn’t appear to be the case here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4ZROa"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/european-carriers-seek-to-block-iphone-private-relay-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iPhone users in Europe were the first to notice that access to the Private Relay feature wasn’t working. T-Mobile, Vodafone, and Telefonica added their names to an open letter published in &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/01/09/apple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that criticizes the feature. Carriers argue that Private Relay “will impair others to innovate and compete in downstream digital markets and may negatively impact operators’ ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony Xperia 5 III now shipping in the US, almost nine months after initial announcement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YoS7oZk0NVKgSCFSQhWYKCyGe-U=/87x0:1022x623/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374527/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e3KHRc"&gt;Sony’s Xperia 5 III, the compact counterpart to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22580552/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-price-specs-screen-camera"&gt;Xperia 1 III&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href="https://pressroom.pixelshift.studio/sony-electronics-highly-anticipated-xperiar-5-iii-smartphone-now-shipping-in-the-united-states"&gt;now on sale in the US&lt;/a&gt;, almost nine months after the company initially announced the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382887/sony-announces-xperia-1-iii-xperia-5-iii"&gt;in April 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The phone retails for $999.99 and will be available in black or green, with the latter exclusive to Sony’s own online store. The phone went on sale in the second half of last year in the UK and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktKLs8"&gt;The phone has seen some internal upgrades compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514064/sony-xperia-5-ii-review"&gt;Xperia 1 II&lt;/a&gt;, which bring it more into line with mainstream handsets from 2021. It’s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, runs Android 11 out of the box, and should also be able to benefit from at least some 5G connectivity in the US. Elsewhere, battery capacity has been upped to 4,500mAh, and Sony advertises that this larger battery can be charged to 50 percent in half an hour, like its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8e7JgyoV9gkitL48wARyEBuXEVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160681/auto.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tall display paired with three rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gjED2g"&gt;Externally the Xperia 5 III has a similar design to the Xperia 5 II. Its 120Hz 6.1-inch display maintains Sony’s trademark 21:9 aspect ratio, and there are still three rear 12-megapixel cameras, which handle main, ultrawide, and telephoto duties, respectively. There’s support for taking photos at up to 20fps, with focus / exposure readings happening at 60fps, as well as support for recording 120fps 4K footage in HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvspRt"&gt;It’s a decent set of specs, and if the Xperia 1 III is anything to go by, the phone should have decent camera performance and a stunning screen. But $999 seems like a high price when, very soon, we’re going to start seeing phones releasing with Qualcomm’s newer Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xr8tB8"&gt;The Xperia 5 III is shipping now, and Sony says that orders placed before February 27th will come with a pair of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt; earbuds and 43,200 &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; CP points for free. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything you need to know about 2022’s biggest chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BA-qOvlIZpUM9jZivpdTDrd-cLY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374177/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yd7xYj"&gt;It’s a new year, and like clockwork, 2022 has brought with it a plethora of new chips for laptops, desktops, phones, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEs5sx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855915/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-ces-2022-h-series-laptops-gaming-performance"&gt;Intel announced new CPUs&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866533/intel-12th-gen-cpu-alder-lake-mainstream-consumer-desktops-ces-2022"&gt;virtually every product it makes&lt;/a&gt;, AMD refreshed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;laptop processors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt; for its whole lineup &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; started teasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856151/amd-ryzen-7000-desktop-cpu-5nm-next-gen-zen-4-release-date-ces-2022"&gt;its next major desktop overhaul&lt;/a&gt;, and Nvidia came out swinging with the announcement of its most &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866454/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2022"&gt;powerful GPU yet&lt;/a&gt;. If you weren’t keeping up (or even if you were) it was a &lt;em&gt;lot.&lt;/em&gt; And that was just CES: Qualcomm already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809687/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-chip-smartphone-processor-specs-details"&gt;announced &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; next-gen chips&lt;/a&gt; for smartphones and laptops in December, and Samsung is teeing up a new Exynos processor, too. And that’s not even considering Apple, which tends to play its cards closer to its chest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWkn4I"&gt;But as the dust settles and products with that plethora of processors start to loom on the horizon, here’s a breakdown of 2022’s most important chips, and what they’ll mean when you’re looking for a new laptop, computer, or phone this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WBK3tc"&gt;Laptops&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MZOC9y"&gt;2022 is shaping up to be a very interesting year for new laptops, thanks to AMD and Intel — both of which announced full slates of new laptop chips at CES 2022, which will likely power almost any major computer released this year that doesn’t have an Apple logo on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="392Zcv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lots of new laptop hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wWZNLm"&gt;Intel’s updates appear to be the more notable of the two companies, with the announcement of its Alder Lake family of chips for its entire laptop range (although only the most powerful H-series chips made their formal debut; the U-series and P-series lineups for lighter-weight laptops are set to arrive later in 2022). Like last year’s Alder Lake desktop chips, the new laptop chips are the first to feature Intel’s new (some might say Arm-esque) architecture with a mix of performance and efficiency cores.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZoUXLvvbEWktQCn47-4fD92mQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142901/12th_gen_mobile_chip_pose_06_4000px.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eSEIB2"&gt;The first wave of Alder Lake desktop processors were &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; impressive, a breakthrough product for an Intel that had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22597713/intel-7nm-delay-summer-2020-apple-arm-switch-roadmap-gelsinger-ceo"&gt;been caught in a yearslong slump of delays&lt;/a&gt; for its 10nm process (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;since renamed Intel 7&lt;/a&gt;). If Intel can realize similar success on its laptop lineup, Alder Lake could be the edge the company needs to fend off an ascendant AMD and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8CJwX"&gt;Processors are only a piece of the puzzle, though, and Intel’s biggest product of 2022 was still largely missing from CES 2022: its upcoming lineup of discrete Arc GPUs, which will be rolling out later this year for desktop &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;laptop devices. The company has already started teasing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865560/intel-arc-gpu-teaser-alchemist-ces-2022-oem"&gt;major partners like Dell, HP, and Samsung&lt;/a&gt; will be using its chips (in addition to adding the requirement that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856046/intel-evo-laptop-standard-foldable-laptops-h-series-project-athena-ces-2022"&gt;Intel Evo-branded laptops&lt;/a&gt; with discrete GPUs will need to be using Arc chips to get Intel’s seal of approval). And Intel is making big promises about the potential of combining its integrated graphics in conjunction with discrete Arc GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/adaptix/deep-link.html"&gt;through its Deep Link technology&lt;/a&gt; for bigger gains. But for now, Arc is still one of the biggest question marks for 2022’s computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaRkIf"&gt;On the other side of the aisle are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;AMD’s new Ryzen 6000 chips&lt;/a&gt; for its laptops. This year’s chips still are using a slightly upgraded architecture from last year’s Ryzen 5000 (AMD calls its Zen 3 Plus and called out a few improvements like bumps to performance and battery life). That’s fine, given that last year’s Ryzen chips were already great —&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt; AMD’s 2021 laptops were its first truly premium designs in ages&lt;/a&gt;, with great battery life, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;excellent performance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;powerful discrete GPUs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RG-699T4XpCmshx07FoajVAvCDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160565/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_9.03.17_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LIzmAa"&gt;The integrated GPU side of things, though, is where this year’s biggest changes are for AMD, which is finally upgrading to its new RDNA 2 architecture here instead of continuing to use its old Vega GPU designs. RDNA 2 is the same architecture that the PS5 and Xbox Series X have, and while the integrated GPUs on 2022 AMD laptops won’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; approach the power of those consoles, they’re even closer (with the top Radeon RX 6850M XT GPU actually offering more compute units than the PS5 does). All told, AMD is promising some big boosts for gaming on laptops, which is an exciting prospect… if the chips actually hold up to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DDKUDN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AMD has some big gaming updates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9jtJYV"&gt;And for those who need more power, AMD also has a slate of new notebook GPUs, expanding its lower-end range for its 6000M series chips. It’s also introducing a new, more power-efficient line of Radeon 6000S chips for thinner and lighter laptops that — in theory — won’t have to compromise on gaming performance. Both of those lineups will be based on RDNA 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Nr1FZ"&gt;Lastly, there’s Nvidia, which announced a refreshed wave of powerful laptop GPUs that are coming soon: mobile versions of the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti, which promise 1440p gaming at 100 and 120 frames per second and can integrate with a laptop’s CPU to balance power and temperature for maximum performance. Nvidia tells us they’re roughly 10-20 percent more powerful than their non-Ti laptop predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qmhmdp6umSn-6Sp_vSd5gNaW7vc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144576/chrome_MtQmNzsoUF.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vpKkNV"&gt;All said, it’s an exciting time to be looking to buy a new laptop in the coming weeks or months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLbYKa"&gt;Of course, all that goes without acknowledging the elephant in the room: Apple, which has not so quietly been establishing itself as a silicon force to be reckoned with thanks to its excellent M1 series of processors. (They recently received high-powered upgrades in the company’s late 2021 MacBook Pros — resulting in some of the best performance and battery life on any computer &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has ever tested.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mmTDnB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Qualcomm will probably have to wait until next year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uTNRI3"&gt;Qualcomm is also trying again to make inroads with laptops, a market that the company (which thoroughly dominates mobile SoCs) has yet to really break into in any meaningful way. This year, the company has its new Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 chipset, which the company says offers an 85 percent jump in CPU performance and a 60 percent faster GPU compared to Qualcomm’s previous laptop chip. That said, the new platform is off to a slow start: CES 2022 came and went without a single device announced using the 8cx Gen 3, and Qualcomm itself seems to be pinning its future not on its current flagship laptop chip, but a 2023 chip designed by the Nuvia team that will “set the performance benchmark for Windows PCs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovBXVa"&gt;While Apple didn’t make an appearance at CES 2022, the shadow of its chips were definitely felt: Intel defiantly rolled out slides of benchmarks claiming its new Alder Lake H-series chips were even more powerful than Cupertino’s best — something that we’ll have to test for ourselves when 2022’s new crop of laptops roll around. Battery life on Intel’s chips is also a big question mark, one that the company didn’t really address in its announcements. Nvidia also took a shot at Apple, arguing that its new RTX Studio-branded computers with its new GPUs can offer seven times the GPU performance as Apple’s M1 Max. But Apple itself is rumored to have its second-generation processors out later this year, which could throw 2022’s chip crown into contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bB4Rcr"&gt;Desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UHmEEY"&gt;The desktop side of things was a little calmer at CES 2022. Intel caught up the rest of its desktop lineup to Alder Lake, as well (last year’s launch was just a trio of high-powered gaming chips). The new lineup should bring Intel’s new architecture strategy (which has two types of processor cores) to the rest of its desktops, including more consumer-friendly desktop towers and all-in-one PCs. The company also rolled out new, cheaper motherboard designs to go with the broader release of chips (which were badly needed, given that until now there was just a single high-end chipset available). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wE3ADt"&gt;AMD (which hasn’t updated its desktop lineup since late 2020) only announced a single new chip coming in the first half of the year: Ryzen 7 5800X3D, which uses AMD’s 3D V-Cache stacking technology to squeak out an extra 15 percent of power compared to the Ryzen 5900X. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hqEZvMf4RISZQ6DQob6ZI5lwBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144140/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_8.02.34_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bvFlJm"&gt;More exciting things are on the horizon for later in 2022, though, even if there’s going to be a bit of a wait to get them. AMD has started its next big processor refresh with the Ryzen 7000 line of chips, which will be powered by the company’s new Zen 4 architecture, jump to a 5nm process node, and add a new socket. The chips will switch to AMD’s new AM5 design, which puts pins on the motherboard instead of the CPUs. That means that for the first time in over five years, you’ll have to get a new motherboard to take advantage of AMD’s new CPUs. Those chips won’t arrive until the second half of the year, but they should make a pretty big splash when they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJoeCr"&gt;Nvidia also showed off its upcoming RTX 3090 Ti, which will take the crown as the company’s most powerful consumer graphics card when it arrives later this year (with a presumably sky-high price tag to match its performance).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d1NA3pSU803m-Z4iGtlydXb4VJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144510/rtx3090Ti.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fMlJhI"&gt;Similar to the laptop side of things, 2022’s most mysterious chip product is Intel’s upcoming Arc discrete GPUs. Codenamed “Alchemist,” Intel will finally look to take on AMD and Nvidia directly for the minds, hearts, and GPU slots of gamers and creatives alike when it launches its extremely hyped consumer graphics cards later in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zkYSih"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Arc is inbound&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="okM4gJ"&gt;Intel has already showed off some interesting demos, like its XeSS super-sampling for 4K scaling (similar to Nvidia’s DLSS or AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution). But the real test will come when the first GPUs actually ship. The current crop of rumors expect that Intel will be targeting the middle of the road for its first generation of GPUs (one leak from last fall &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/intel-arc-alchemist-gpu-could-be-a-game-changer-heres-everything-we-know"&gt;expects Intel’s best first-gen card&lt;/a&gt; to be competitive with about an RTX 3070), but we’ll have to wait for later this year when customers can see for themselves just how well Intel’s first major discrete GPUs in history really hold up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnEdiD"&gt;Lastly, there’s Apple, which is rumored to be expanding its Arm-based chips to the rest of its desktop lineup in 2022, where some of its most intriguing products have yet to be updated, like its high-powered Mac Pro desktop. It’ll be interesting to see how Apple manages to scale up its chip designs to that level of power and performance — especially with the fierce competition from AMD and Intel’s refreshed lineups mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JyMcHD"&gt;Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jZrpY7"&gt;Things are a little simpler when it comes to mobile chips. If you’re buying an Android phone in the US, odds are it’ll have a Qualcomm chip powering it. If it’s a flagship device, it’ll be the recently announced Qualcomm 8 Gen 1, the company’s latest and greatest SoC that’s expected to start showing up in products like Samsung’s Galaxy S22 lineup in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cx9ECELaIfVlFXwfXgJGcLFNL0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053632/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Mobile_Platform__Key_Visual__Angle_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="26x4vd"&gt;Apple will use whatever it names the next iteration of its A-series chips for the iPhone (the same money is on the A16), but it’ll be exclusively in Apple products. Samsung has its new Exynos 2200 processor, which will mix things up a bit with an AMD RDNA 2-powered GPU, but odds are it won’t ever make it to the US for a variety of licensing and modem issues (along with the simple fact that Qualcomm’s chips historically perform better than Samsung’s).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpXs3W"&gt;Google is a company to watch, with its new Tensor SoC platform that it debuted on the Pixel 6 lineup last year; presumably, Google will be looking to follow that up with a second-generation version to power its 2022 smartphones. The company is rumored to be working on more powerful in-house chips for future Chromebooks, too — which could be extremely interesting in a world where Apple’s similarly custom-designed Arm-based laptops are some of the best computers around. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor announces the Magic V, its first foldable smartphone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/skD0J9sSG0ptJskU5JJts_kogs0=/0x0:1358x905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70369188/d81jWLiA_cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor’s new foldable, the Magic V.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRv9FC"&gt;Former Huawei sub-brand Honor has just announced its first foldable smartphone, the Honor Magic V. It uses a similar folding form factor to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold devices, combining a large internal folding display with a smaller external display that can be used while the device is folded. Today is the foldable’s Chinese launch, where its price starts at ¥9,999 (around $1,569) for its 256GB storage model. It will go on open sale on January 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puGB6W"&gt;The Magic V’s flagship feature, its internal folding screen, measures 7.9 inches from corner to corner, has a resolution of 2272 x 1984 with a refresh rate of 90Hz, and an aspect ratio of 10:9. That’s slightly bigger than Samsung’s Z Fold 3, whose internal screen is 7.6 inches with a resolution of 2208 x 1768. Honor says the Magic V’s internal screen is like using two 21:9 screens side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWMekK"&gt;The Magic V’s external screen is also slightly larger than the Z Fold 3 at 6.45 inches (compared to 6.2 for Samsung), with a resolution of 2560 x 1080, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 21:9 aspect ratio. Honor says this will help make the device more usable when you don’t want to unfold it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pqAqKnxfPipygOI4i1AW1A6XFeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158005/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_12.32.15_PM.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic V in orange.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M4iOVM251Pj5YM_WPRwb-g8SZHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158009/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_12.29.52_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Honor&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor’s foldable, folded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jym1Eh"&gt;When folded, the Magic V measures 72.7mm wide, 14.3mm thick, and has a height of 160.4mm, and when unfolded it expands to 141.1mm wide and is 6.7mm thick. That’s slightly wider than Samsung’s latest Z Fold, while being slightly thinner overall when folded. Honor’s foldable is slightly heavier, however. It’s available in three colors: orange, silver, and black, and Honor CEO George Zhao says it should survive being folded and unfolded 200,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hr0esu"&gt;Internally, the Magic V is running Qualcomm’s latest chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, which is paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage. It’s got a 4,750mAh battery that can be charged at up to 66W, which gives you a 50 percent charge in 15 minutes. It’s 5G compatible and is running Honor’s Magic UI 6.0 software on top of Android 12, which supports the display of multiple app windows at the same time, Honor says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNoWvQ"&gt;In terms of cameras, Honor has included a trio of 50-megapixel sensors on the rear of the foldable, which include a main sensor, an ultrawide camera, and something Honor is calling a “spectrum enhanced camera.” We’ve followed up with the company for details on what exactly this third camera does. The Magic V has a pair of 42-megapixel selfie cameras, one embedded in the outer display, and one embedded in the inner folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NjOIA"&gt;Honor joins an increasingly long list of companies that have either announced or have started to sell foldable smartphones. Most recently, we saw Oppo announce its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price"&gt;Find N&lt;/a&gt; late last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Honor’s former parent company Huawei&lt;/a&gt; also have foldable devices of their own. We’ve followed up with Honor to find out if, or when, the Magic V might see a global release. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA lists 50 airports that will have 5G buffer zones ahead of C-band expansion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cell Tower" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0DUnadgi6Re0qcDz56wmLp5nbTk=/104x0:3967x2575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70364482/1234861974.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8YJChP"&gt;With AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon set to bring their 5G expansion live on January 19th, &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-5g"&gt;the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has chosen&lt;/a&gt; 50 airports (&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2022-01/50%20Airports%20with%205G%20Buffer.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) that will have buffer zones to help prevent flight disruptions (via &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-faa-details-50-airports-that-will-have-5g-buffer-zones-2022-01-08/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/faa-selects-airports-for-5g-buffer-zones-11641609361"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Safety regulators picked airports based on location, traffic volume, and the likelihood of low visibility — all factors that may increase cancelations, delays, and diversions as both carriers roll out 5G C-band service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOd3oM"&gt;As pointed out by the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, notably busy airports like Chicago O’Hare, Orlando International, Los Angeles International, and Dallas / Fort Worth International are included on the list, along with airports in locations that are often impacted by foggy conditions, such as Seattle / Tacoma International and San Francisco International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e2kesa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will turn off 5G transmitters at buffer zones for six months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4QT6vg"&gt;The FAA notes that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have agreed to turn off their 5G transmitters at these specific buffer zones for six months, which should “minimize potential 5G interference with sensitive aircraft instruments used in low-visibility landings.” Some airports — including major hubs like Hartsfield / Jackson International and Denver International — didn’t make the list, either because they aren’t in locations where 5G C-Band deployment will take place, or they can’t permit low-visibility landings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cX0Ttp"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have been itching to deploy their improved 5G service ever since they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;spent a combined $70 billion last year&lt;/a&gt; on securing chunks of the C-band spectrum, which should provide a middle ground in terms of 5G speed and coverage — something that both carriers’ 5G service is currently lacking. The two currently offer 5G service using super fast high-band millimeter wave technology that only covers small areas, as well as the low-band spectrum, which provides a lot of coverage with slow service akin to 4G LTE. T-Mobile already offers mid-band 5G service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;but it isn’t in the C-band range&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BZJsj"&gt;Both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T were originally set to switch on their 5G expansions on December 5th, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;air safety fears delayed the launch&lt;/a&gt; twice. The carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863964/faa-fcc-verizon-att-c-band-5g-airports-proposal-rejected"&gt;ended up rejecting the FAA’s request&lt;/a&gt; to delay the rollout until January 5th but later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;came to an agreement&lt;/a&gt; to turn on service on January 19th, giving the FAA additional time to account for potential flight disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QcGBwX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Samsung is showing off the foldables of the future at CES</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GABMbrADflCB0KQDm994LxD_LtI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360697/Screen_Shot_2022_01_07_at_9.27.00_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vZmPbp"&gt;Samsung is arguably leading the charge on folding phones, and even though the first Galaxy Fold got off to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938653/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-updated-android-price-specs-features-hinge"&gt;a rocky start&lt;/a&gt;, last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; were impressive devices that delivered on the promise of how handy a device with a folding screen can be. But the company isn’t stopping with those form factors; at CES 2022, it showed off a bunch of prototype folding devices that could hint at foldables to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCzqCZ"&gt;Take the Flex S, a multi-foldable device that can stretch all the way out to a triple-wide screen. Or the Flex G, a pocket-sized device that folds &lt;em&gt;inward&lt;/em&gt; to protect the screen. There’s a device with a right rail that slides out to add some screen real estate. And Samsung even showed off a 17-inch folding laptop that’s not unlike the one Asus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867624/asus-zenbook-17-fold-oled-foldable-laptop-tablet-specs-price-release-date"&gt;announced at CES&lt;/a&gt; (though Asus is promising that its device will come out this year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ90MF"&gt;There’s a lot to get excited about, and you can see Samsung’s latest foldable tech in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzdwfCZ9XKY"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApO4Tc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 10 Pro gets a better RAW mode and a wider ultrawide camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GsB40f87Eyxw1A4ckKegdYWtmGQ=/0x49:1173x831/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70357604/OnePlus_10_Pro_Black_Headshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus continues to lean into partner Hasselblad’s image tuning expertise and branding.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sraOKr"&gt;OnePlus is sharing a few more details about the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22849868/oneplus-pro-china-launch-january-11th-design"&gt;OnePlus 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a focus on camera specifications. If you were hoping for lots of hardware upgrades from this second-gen partnership with Hasselblad, it looks like you’ll have to keep waiting — with the exception of a new ultrawide, these updates are primarily software-based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKzEpi"&gt;To recap some basic camera specs that we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs"&gt;learned earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, the OnePlus 10 will offer a triple rear camera — likely the same 48-megapixel main, 50-megapixel ultrawide, and 8-megapixel telephoto configuration as last year. There’s a 32-megapixel front-facing camera, which is a significant resolution bump from the 9 and 9 Pro’s 16-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzC3Sw"&gt;A notable update is the addition of a shooting mode called RAW Plus which, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174433/apple-ios-14-3-pro-raw-iphone-12-pro-max-update-features"&gt;Apple’s ProRAW format&lt;/a&gt;, combines the benefits of computational photography and RAW image capture. The OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro offered a traditional RAW mode, so this is a nice improvement for those who want to tinker with data-rich RAW files while retaining the advanced image processing that smartphone cameras are so good at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UNir2z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vlrPdg"&gt;All three rear cameras can be used in the updated Hasselblad Pro Mode to control exposure settings and shoot 12-bit RAW files. We really liked the intuitive Pro Mode on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro, so we’re eager to check out the latest version. There’s a new manual video recording mode, too, called Movie Mode. It offers control over ISO and shutter speed as well as access to a LOG shooting format that better lends itself to post-capture color grading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1EJNZ"&gt;The 9 and 9 Pro cameras featured color tuning by Hasselblad, and OnePlus continues to lean into that aspect of the partnership. In this iteration, it combines its own (also Oppo’s own) “Billion Color Solution” and Hasselblad’s color science to bring 10-bit color to each of the phone’s three rear cameras. That should make for smoother color gradations in images — provided that you’re looking at them on a screen capable of displaying all of those colors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNmthcFuANzn8jtQlWZiFsLFHEI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23148621/OnePlus_10_Pro_150__Ultra_wide_Portrait_Watermarked.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The view from OnePlus’ new ultrawide lens is very wide indeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ek8K6j"&gt;On the hardware side, there’s a new ultrawide camera sensor with an extreme 150-degree field of view — somewhere in the ballpark of 5mm in 35mm terms. If you want to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; go for a dramatic shot, this lens can be used in combination with a new fisheye mode. For a slightly narrower view, the ultrawide offers a 110-degree mode, which is closer to the 14mm equivalent offered by the 9 and 9 Pro, and uses AI distortion correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCzpZB"&gt;There’s one more hardware change to note: it looks like OnePlus dropped the monochrome camera. This was a low-resolution chip that was included in previous models to assist when shooting black-and-white images. That was the claim, anyway. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"&gt;struggled to find it making any difference&lt;/a&gt; in monochrome images and my colleague Jon Porter has bemoaned its existence for years, describing it at turns as “baffling” and “pointless.” The renders of the 10 Pro that we’ve seen thus far show three useful-looking cameras along with a flash and nothing that looks like a little monochrome sensor in sight. If that’s the case: farewell, monochrome camera, we hardly knew what ye did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XaGyd"&gt;Outside of camera updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs"&gt;what we’ve learned about the OnePlus 10 Pro so far&lt;/a&gt; is not surprising at all. It will come with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, a 120Hz screen, and 50W wireless charging — in line with previous OnePlus flagships and checking all the “2022 Android flagship” boxes. It’s due to launch on January 11th in China with availability in other regions later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
