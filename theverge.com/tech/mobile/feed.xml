  &lt;p&gt;A privacy-minded roundup of apps, including a self-care penguin&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zj20b0"&gt;Congratulations on your new Android device! After going through all the legalese to set up your Google account and services (and probably doing the same with your phone manufacturer and carrier), you’re finally ready to make your phone or tablet your own. As you populate your email app with new emails and purge useless apps from your device, now is the time to install some better apps that will improve your life. Here are nine Android apps that made me happier and more organized, without being overly demanding of my user data or annoying with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IOVFJu"&gt;ColorNote Notepad Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="ColorNote" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PL8r78rs9xiI0HgUZfZnZSYDmuQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097002/Screenshot_20211214_190728.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Notes&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ColorNote Notepad Notes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="ColorNote app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Gg2F_00MemnHcWgmFtsuwdCTHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097012/Screenshot_20211214_191628.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ouxxfg"&gt;My home is full of post-it notes strategically placed on multiple surfaces: my desk, boxes, and even the cutting board. And they all serve different purposes: some are shopping lists, some are reminders to return an item, and some are just my to-do lists. The ColorNote app is basically a digital version of my sticky note addiction but organized into a single screen. You can create either a text note or a checklist and customize its color to help you differentiate one from another. The app has a calendar where you can note important dates, share individual notes with your friends and family, or even sync your notes across multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LESRm0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925165" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CLZbrU"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="smTWTg"&gt;Notebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Notebook app by Zoho Corporation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQCampC59WZmgd2-S_QMwdouvx0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097020/Screenshot_20211214_192140.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Zoho&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Notebook app by Zoho Corporation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aAOCy1bTDCdgfLKUUFktjQeDTP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097181/Screenshot_20211214_202422.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YzSTKC"&gt;It’s handy to have a robust note-taking app on your phone: this way, you can jot down detailed notes, include relevant photos from your work meeting, and keep a journal, all on the same device. The free Notebook app from Zoho organizes your notes into digital notebooks with gorgeous digital covers and provides powerful tools to help you document anything and everything. You can embed multimedia elements like sketches, photos, and even audio files into your written notes to add context and can add as many pages as you need. Your data is stored locally, but you can sync your notebooks across multiple devices (including Windows, macOS, and iOS) if you have a Zoho account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="52mgxW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925177" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="K0JWXn"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wA7WOD"&gt;Finch: Self-Care Widget Pet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Finch, the self-care widget pet app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rUXraJAUk_s6MrfrLwKT7UfP3DY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097035/Screenshot_20211214_192518.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Finch Cares&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finch: Self-Care Widget Pet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Finch, the self-care widget pet app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dK8_QldNXYPrqLlWbhLsQahIbSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097039/Screenshot_20211214_192529.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qZkGk8"&gt;We’re coming up to year two of the pandemic, and everyone is feeling various degrees of isolation and exhaustion. Good thing Finch, the self-care pet penguin, is here to guide us to take better care of our mental health. He lives inside the app and prompts you to practice self-care each day: he’ll check in on your mood and will tell you to stretch and set goals periodically, which will earn energy points to help him on his adventures. There is plenty to do in the free version, but you can upgrade to Finch Plus for more self-care exercises; it costs $39.99 for a one-year subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qzcXfu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925188" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ptHhGb"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="24j74j"&gt;CBT Companion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="CBT Companion app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVs0vaMt518GYN0t5xkQbNEINoM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097053/Screenshot_20211214_193100.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Resiliens&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;CBT Companion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="CBT Companion app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s19WY7Qa3TtzIeL5pt0uDVcdzYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097057/Screenshot_20211214_193124.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dF31SE"&gt;If you rather track your mental wellness without the gamification of Finch, the CBT Companion app (Cognitive Behavior Therapy) is a more pragmatic alternative. It offers a safe (and free) space to document your thoughts and provide exercises to practice your CBT skills, whether you’re working with a clinician or not. You can also pay $9.99 per month or $49.99 every six months to access additional exercises and content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AP2SSp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925215" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="m7AIco"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rkexJR"&gt;AfterShip Package Tracker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="AfterShip app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yijL08huhxm26BDMfvpBVCFkyHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097066/Screenshot_20211214_193709.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: AfterShip&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AfterShip Package Tracker &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="AfterShip app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iHW-6D_z2QR5UyNOF6U7O4L1ni0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097068/Screenshot_20211214_193654.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4TW1fw"&gt;Given how brazen porch pirates are these days, it’s more important than ever to know the delivery status of all the packages you’re expecting — whether they’re gifts for friends and family or groceries that need to be refrigerated as soon as possible. AfterShip lets you manually enter each package you’re expecting (rather than demand access to all your emails like other apps) — you just have to provide the tracking number and name the courier delivering the package, and the app can figure out the rest. It’ll show you where each package is on a map, as well as its current status (I usually have to tap on the name of the courier to see the latest update). This way, you’ll know when to expect a package to arrive, so you can grab it before a porch pirate can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vNxpQ2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925226" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Gema93"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DmvEz3"&gt;Discord&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Discord app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3KH_f7jl3ARHdrQeRtWOhO0jUcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097093/Screenshot_20211214_194408.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Discord app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_fp_QNMdeBEhlMikLvaAj6vGAhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097089/Screenshot_20211214_194337.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o5r7Oq"&gt;Ever since Google announced that it will be shutting down Hangouts, a chat app that my parents know and love, I’ve been on the hunt for another easy-to-use up chat app. Discord, the platform beloved by gamers, might just be&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;one. First, I like that you only need to provide your email address to sign up for an account, and you can invite specific people to join your server or room. Within your own private space, you can chat with your friends and family using text or GIFs or have the option to start a video or voice call, whether they have the app or use the web interface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9Xsadp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925236" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="SFpOKa"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nW1rtw"&gt;Firefox Browser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Firefox mobile web browser app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yqOQRggIBEPWzae3fVm8Q8_MUyA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097107/Screenshot_20211214_195145.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Mozilla&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefox Browser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Firefox mobile web browser app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7ZAPWs6VEZ9FWUzMjDmu8GM4WM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097109/Screenshot_20211214_195340.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kl4ZgI"&gt;I got so fed up with the algorithmically generated news on the Chrome web browser’s homepage that I started using the Firefox mobile browser on my phone instead. Like the desktop version, the mobile Firefox browser can block trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, cryptominers, and fingerprinters. Without these sneaky little things following you around, you can just surf the web as usual, though some sites might break without being able to collect data on you. You can even customize your browser by changing it to Dark Mode or moving the search bar to the bottom of the screen to make it easier to use on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FszHNp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925291" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mgvW1T"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="d02Tb4"&gt;Paprika Recipe Manager 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Paprika recipe manager app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q8A0l6J8821CBKadqXYtbvG3Az0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097156/Screenshot_20211214_201055.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Hindsight Labs&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paprika Recipe Manager 3 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Paprika recipe manager app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aSY23A8WJoZNU8XLtZwe6D6_sCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097161/Screenshot_20211214_200759.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gnknpy"&gt;My current recipe management is a hot mess: I keep too many web browser tabs opened with recipes I want to find quickly, all on my phone. With Paprika, I can download the contents of my favorite recipes (as long as they’re available online and searchable by Google) and save the ingredients and instructions inside this little app. You can even tweak the recipe you import in case you have any tips or changes you’d like to make to the original. The app includes an editable grocery shopping list, pantry list, and menu, as well as a meal planning calendar to keep your kitchen organized. Although the free version only lets you store a maximum of 50 recipes, you can upgrade to the paid version that enables syncing between devices and storage of an unlimited number of recipes for $4.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nmgtqk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925320" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="I0kMQb"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="P9mga9"&gt;Weather &amp;amp; Widget — Weawow&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Weawow weather &amp;amp;amp; widget app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ay6KdkBaW6DvVrrckrB73Bhgh94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098760/Screenshot_20211215_114012.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Weawow&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weather &amp;amp; Widget - Weawow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Weawow widget customization options" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C2BRKhL_0hIItIRfxbMvQ7lc7BY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098768/Screenshot_20211215_113946.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVsKXM"&gt;Ever since IBM bought The Weather Company and, with it, Weather Underground — a site I swore by but whose app experience has seen better days — I’ve been on the hunt for a new weather app that is similarly respectful of users’ privacy. The Weawow weather app is that unicorn. It asks you to enter your location rather than demand continuous access to all your GPS data, lets you opt out of sharing your location data with third parties, and doesn’t serve ads along with its forecasts. I appreciate that this app makes it easy to change the units of measurement for those of us who need to, has a swipe-friendly interface, and lets me add it as a widget to my home screen with lots of options for customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UyiQey"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925750"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s foldable P50 Pocket has a circular external screen that’s perfect for notifications</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2r9KRAtEARGT9IwY60Xq2WlNQTM=/124x0:2739x1743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70309517/p506.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EH5xiH"&gt;Huawei has officially announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Fphones%2Fp50-pocket&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F23%2F22851418%2Fhuawei-pocket-p50-foldable-clamshell-phone-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the P50 Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, a clamshell-style folding smartphone that has a circular, 1-inch external display for quick access to notifications and widgets. The device launches in China today, though US sanctions (which mean Huawei can’t use key tech like Google’s Android OS) mean the P50 Pocket won’t make any impact in the West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMMsBM"&gt;Huawei teased the handset &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839272/huawei-p50-pocket-china-launch-foldable"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; with a photoshoot focused on the P50 Pocket Premium Edition that appeared in &lt;em&gt;Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/em&gt;. This version of the device was created with Dutch designer Iris van Herpen. It has a gold or silver finish, and a 3D pattern on the exterior surface that’s typical of van Herpen’s work, resembling feathers or leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P50 Pocket is Huawei’s third foldable phone, but its first to use a clamshell design. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WLi0VCf1hOreTzv04EivhQW9nMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122378/p501.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s sales pitch for the P50 Pocket focuses, not surprisingly, on the pocketability of the device. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MzESqC"&gt;When unfolded, the Pocket’s OLED screen is 6.9-inches in size, with a 21:9 ratio and 120Hz refresh rate. The device weighs 190 grams and is just 7.2mm thick (Huawei compared it to the iPhone 13 Pro Max which weighs 238 grams and is 7.65mm thick). It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 4G SoC, a 4,000mAh battery, and runs Huawei’s Harmony OS 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7k7eIF"&gt;The P50 Pocket’s main camera array has a 40-megapixel main sensor, 13-megapixel wide angle lens, and 32-megapixel “super spectrum” lens which Huawei says captures a greater range of color. There’s a hole-punch camera built into the main display, but Huawei notes that the phone’s foldable design makes it more convenient to use the main camera for taking selfies, with the 1-inch cover screen doubling up as a viewfinder. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9KPIbU0IcXVyJQQ3L9nDbzJyl8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122383/p504.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P50 Pocket’s external circular screen can be used to display various apps and widgets. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lu5WI0pBGnM_IZZYlNYhtrZO8TY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122381/p503.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accessing basic information like turn-by-turn directions can be done more discreetly. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uLWOkA"&gt;Huawei is positioning that same “cover screen” as a big part of the P50 Pocket’s appeal. As well as showing notifications or the time, the screen can be used for widgets, letting users control music, follow directions, and so on. So, for example, if you’re using your phone to navigate in a new city, the cover screen will show discreet, turn-by-turn directions, rather than forcing you to open up the large 6.9-inch main display to check your position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSKqfK"&gt;The P50 Pocket also has a new hinge which leaves zero gap between the screens when folded. This compares favorably to devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3, which is another clamshell but has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;slight tapering gap&lt;/a&gt; when folded. The P50 Pocket also has face unlock on both the main and cover screen, and a side-mounted fingerprint unlock sensor — handy when many people are still commonly wearing masks during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jMEc9EYobXdJb8o4syzjAciVbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122384/p505.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P50 Pocket folds completely flat, while Samsung’s Z Flip 3 has a slight tapering gap. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="REh8E1"&gt;A standard edition of the P50 Pocket has gone on sale in China today with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for ¥8,988 (around $1,400), while the premium version, with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, sells for ¥10,988 (around $1,700). The standard edition is available in black and white, while the premium edition comes in silver or gold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2O7V6v"&gt;During a presentation, the CEO of Huawei’s consumer business group, Richard Yu said the clamshell design offered a more refined take on folding devices. “It’s very delicate and exquisite,” said Yu. “We want to bring elegance to you, on the go.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title> T-Mobile’s 5G Home Internet: I tried it, and it tried me</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Is cellular good enough for a home internet connection?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZyAzmr"&gt;I was interested in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;T-Mobile’s Home Internet service&lt;/a&gt; from the first time I heard about it: it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711794/t-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut"&gt;$50 (a price that includes the specialized router)&lt;/a&gt;, contract and data cap-free, and is powered by 5G and LTE instead of phone lines or cable. As many people in the US can probably relate, I’m not in love with my traditional ISP — I often push up against its 1.2TB data cap, and $80 per month feels like a lot to pay for the supposedly 400Mbps service I get. So I wondered: could I, a remote worker and heavy internet user who likes to stream video, play multiplayer games, and do cloud backups, actually be fine with internet delivered through the air instead of a cable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axXVco"&gt;After a few weeks of testing, it seems like the TL;DR answer is no; despite &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Feligibility&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22838200%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-5g-cellular-connection-cable-review-gaming-work-from-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile’s site&lt;/a&gt; telling me my address is eligible, the router almost always had a “weak” cellular signal, and there were so many drop-outs and slowdowns that even my non-techie wife was fed up with it after a few weeks. The thing about cellular internet, though, is that my experience won’t necessarily be the same as yours, even if you live a few blocks away from me. So take this review for what it is: one person’s experience with what the service is like in one tiny, non-specific part of eastern Washington state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KdvDSP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10926344"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6UgddWWUxLMIYc4hj811jPDX8oI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086507/mclark_211109_4928_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s router has decent I/O, but the most interesting ports don’t work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eLzGp6"&gt;Before we get into the particulars of my experience, though, let’s start with what’ll be universal to those using the service: the router hardware and setup process. The router supports Wi-Fi 6, which is nice to see, and has a small circular touchscreen on top that you can use to see various statistics like how many devices are connected to your network and how good its cellular connection is. On the back, there’s a place to plug in the (frankly massive) power brick, two Ethernet ports, a power button, and a few pins that let you plug in a battery backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqUwQu"&gt;Looking at that picture, you may be just as excited as I was when you see that there’s a USB-C port. I have no idea why the router’s manufacturer, Nokia Solutions &amp;amp; Networks, put it there, but it and the RJ-11 phone port are currently non-functional, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fpublic-files%2Fattachments%2FT-Mobile%2520High-Speed%2520Internet%2520Gateway%2520End%2520User%2520Guide.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22838200%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-5g-cellular-connection-cable-review-gaming-work-from-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the router’s manual&lt;/a&gt; (pdf). Bummer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RncpqR"&gt;After you plug the router in and turn it on, it’ll prompt you to download T-Mobile’s app using a QR code displayed on its screen. I had a lot of frustrations with the app at first, until I realized that I had to connect to the router’s Wi-Fi network before hitting the “setup device” button. As far as I can tell, that step isn’t included in the quick setup guide, nor is it hinted at in the app itself. The setup process was a breeze after I figured that out, though, with the app prompting me to choose a name for my network and to set a password (the default name and password are printed on the bottom of the device if you’d rather just leave it as-is). Then, the app told me it was time to find a good spot to put the router where it could pick up a strong signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mhjayubdszaq6huIKXOa7OOgdYM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086515/mclark_211213_4928_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My search for signal didn’t go great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJDoddVDl6Wp_MGWQXiyMyq7uhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086512/mclark_211211_4928_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The router’s power brick is quite large&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UxzQzT"&gt;That process was actually quite fun. The router has a battery in it, so you can walk around with it and test out the signal strength in different spots. (The battery doesn’t seem to work as a backup power source, though. If it’s not plugged into power, you won’t be getting any Wi-Fi.) As I mentioned before, though, this feature didn’t help me out much; upstairs or downstairs, right next to a window or in the absolute middle of my house, I got a steady two bars of service (out of five) — even taking it outside didn’t help, not that I could’ve left if there had I gotten perfect signal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwBhLT"&gt;The app doesn’t make it clear if you’re using LTE or 5G, but digging into the router’s web GUI, you can see what cellular bands it’s making use of. After Googling band designations, I was able to determine that, at time of writing, the router was primarily connected to LTE and was using 5G as a secondary connection. Of course, as T-Mobile says on its site, that could change based on “signal strength and availability, time of day, and other factors.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The T-Mobile router’s status screen, displaying that the primary signal was on the B2 band, and the secondary signal was on the n41 band." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KXOiN5NyMsvNXQejGM3TfJrE1yU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099655/Screen_Shot_2021_12_15_at_12.52.13.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can figure out where your signal is coming from, with a bit of digging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DzCEBE"&gt;I ended up putting the router in what I felt like would be the most advantageous place: on a windowsill upstairs, facing the city. From there, all that was left to do was unplug my current access point (I didn’t want it to talk over the T-Mobile router) and plug my switch into my new cell-powered router to get all of my hardwired IoT devices connected to my new home network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fe8klf"&gt;At first, everything seemed all right. I was getting download speeds anywhere from 73 to 135 Mbps, and I even saw upload speeds as high as 20 Mbps. For the first day or two, I really didn’t encounter any issues — when it came to actually using the internet, it seemed to be the exact same experience as when it was coming in over the wire (and Siri could even play Apple Music on my HomePods, something that’s completely broken on my normal setup for some reason). The router also performed admirably — my laptop’s internet was just as fast in my office right next to the router as it was in my living room, which is downstairs and across the house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjOamWvfftJV6BkdGJXM9u4V9lQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099744/Screen_Shot_2021_12_15_at_13.23.48.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For $50 a month, it’s hard to complain about these results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oUE454"&gt;Slowly, though, hiccups started to pile up. Webpages would occasionally struggle to load, or I’d switch channels in Slack and notice that everybody’s profile pictures were grey squares until their actual smiling faces loaded in one by one (which is how I learned that Slack doesn’t seem to cache those images, for some reason). Once, the speeds were so abysmal that it took Twitter a literal minute to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmk9Xr"&gt;There were even a few periods where the internet would seemingly just be gone for a few minutes at a time, with my web browser immediately telling me that it couldn’t connect when I tried to navigate to a site. The frequency of the outages or slowdowns varied — some days, I only had occasional glitches, and a few days, the internet was basically unusable. There weren’t a ton of perfect days, but they did happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LkVXWn1va8kEhJmH79DSZKh_jpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099757/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_21.12.27.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This result, though, is less ideal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l2A2qC"&gt;From what I can tell, this was almost always an issue with the actual service and not the router (though there was one abnormally long outage that did appear to be a router issue, as it was fixed as soon as I rebooted the machine). I could send packets between the devices in my house just fine — I was just cut off from the outside world. I asked T-Mobile what could’ve caused these issues, and it told me that “while you might see slower speeds during times certain times of the day, due to network congestion, 30 seconds to load a webpage doesn’t sound like a normal experience.” I asked for ideas as to what may have caused it but didn’t receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTMOdT"&gt;As someone expected to be ready to jump on breaking news at any moment, this was obviously not ideal for my use case. I’m sure my boss and coworkers got annoyed with how often I said something along the lines of “okay, I’ll grab that as soon as my internet starts functioning again.” The unreliability also caused issues in my personal life, too — when trying to watch YouTube with my wife, she’d occasionally comment on the “potato resolution.” (Mind you, this is someone who is perfectly content watching DVDs.) I would also run into issues trying to play online games, with my ping swinging like a pendulum from a usable ~30ms to an unplayable 900ms. You can see the results of that in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BCmWyx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What that kind of performance looks like in-game. As a heads up, there is some violence in the clip, so you may not want to watch it if you’re sensitive to that kind of thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5xpMU"&gt;It’s not that T-Mobile Home Internet never worked. I’d say the majority of the time, it was perfectly fine. I was able to play several hours of multiplayer &lt;em&gt;CoD&lt;/em&gt; during my testing, and for the most part, I was shocked that the experience could be as good as it was over cellular. I was also able to do some perfectly acceptable video calls with friends and family. When my service was working, I genuinely couldn’t tell the difference between it and my normal cable provider. It’s just that I couldn’t rely on it working that well, and as someone who works from home, that’s a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="DCBcHD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10926399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wvunmr"&gt;I was hoping to switch to T-Mobile’s home internet if my tests went well — I’m not the type of person who needs to have a screaming fast 200 Mbps plus connection and am even willing to put up with a little spotiness if it means not having to pay $80 a month for Comcast and its data caps. But the first time I got the notification on my computer telling me that my phone’s battery was dead because I’d been tethering to it all day, I knew those hopes had been dashed. (It would’ve been awkward if my phone ran off T-Mobile, but I’m on the Verizon-powered Visible.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sNI7g6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yes, it did feel ironic having to use cellular internet because my cellular internet wasn’t working&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o2Buei"&gt;That doesn’t mean T-Mobile’s internet won’t work for anyone — I may have had a better experience had I been able to get more than two bars of service at my house (though the app usually showed that it still had two bars of signal during outages), and for some people, even the worst of what I experienced would be better than what they’re currently using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dPj7n"&gt;When I was using DSL a year ago, I still probably would’ve chosen T-Mobile over it — the two connections were similarly reliable, but I got faster speeds over cellular when it was working than I used to get over the phone lines. For people who live in an even more rural setting than I do and rely on the internet less, T-Mobile’s internet could be a huge upgrade from dial-up or extremely spotty satellite internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNPrtO"&gt;Speaking of satellite internet, there’s an obvious comparison between T-Mobile’s service and SpaceX’s Starlink; both promise home internet without the need for infrastructure coming to your house. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor-in-chief Nilay Patel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;wasn’t pleased when he tried out the Starlink beta&lt;/a&gt;, and the service is significantly more expensive than T-Mobile’s: you have to pay $499 plus shipping for a satellite dish and $99 a month for the service. But Starlink does promise higher speeds, saying you can expect 100Mbps to 200Mbps downloads. While T-Mobile says that many users can expect “speeds in excess of 100Mbps,” it says that the average is “between 35-115 Mbps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="hUJFvh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neither service excelled for us, but they could get better if they continue to compete&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ot8K5C"&gt;There are other pros and cons for each service. Installing Starlink’s satellite dish is significantly more invasive than plugging in T-Mobile’s router, and I doubt my apartment complex would ever be okay with me sticking something on the roof (even with Starlink’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776563/spacex-starlink-rectangular-dish-router-mounting-internet-satellites"&gt;new, smaller design&lt;/a&gt;). And T-Mobile’s service uses the cell towers that also provide service to our phones — Starlink &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21190273/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-constellation-astronomy-coating"&gt;wants to put 12,000 satellites into orbit&lt;/a&gt; to power its service, potentially obstructing our view of the cosmos. But if your house is in an area without reliable cell service, T-Mobile obviously isn’t going to be an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29L0sB"&gt;It’s conceivable that T-Mobile’s home internet could get better over time — when compared to building out traditional internet infrastructure, adding 5G capacity to cell towers requires much less physical labor. I want to break up with my ISP so badly that I may give T-Mobile another chance every year or two to see if it’s improved to the point that I could use it. The company makes that easy — it’s a no-contract service, so it’d only cost me $50 to get an entire month to give it another shot. If you live at an eligible address and are curious about cellular internet, it may be worth at least giving it a shot. You may end up having a much better experience than I did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oaqmi7"&gt;For now, though, I’ll be sadly trudging back to Comcast. It seems that my dream of $50 unlimited internet was just too beautiful to come true in 2021. If you’re thinking of trying it out for yourself, be sure to read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"&gt;our list of considerations&lt;/a&gt; before you do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor teases its first foldable, the Magic V</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j2pwUinsJGQl1dhcvrq1b99SY2w=/0x0:9999x6666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304931/HONOR_Magic_V.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0burOg"&gt;Former Huawei sub-brand Honor has teased the launch of its first foldable smartphone, the Honor V. An image shared &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3206603957/L7bOzxmnz?pagetype=profilefeed&amp;amp;layerid=4717137157950853"&gt;on its Weibo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Honorglobal/status/1473563964340678658"&gt;Twitter accounts&lt;/a&gt; teases the design of the device, showing a telltale hinge between the two halves of the device. The Weibo post says the “folding flagship is about to be released,” though no exact launch date has been announced and Honor declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b12PHd"&gt;Honor has been open about its desire to release a foldable for some time. As early as 2019, the company’s CEO George Zhao &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/honor-ceo-wants-to-launch-5g-phone-in-2019-foldable-phone-in-2020/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he was interested in producing a foldable under the Honor brand, but expressed concerns that the device would be too expensive for Honor’s younger target market. In June this year, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-foldable-phone-report-dscc/"&gt;reports emerged&lt;/a&gt; that development of such a device was underway at the company, and that its folding display panels were being provided by BOE and Visionox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hL8goF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Unfold all the potential. This is HONOR’s first foldable flagship phone, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HONORMagicV?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HONORMagicV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/kijORIGxg1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kijORIGxg1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HONOR (@Honorglobal) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Honorglobal/status/1473563964340678658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGNVMH"&gt;There aren’t many details on the exact form the Magic V could take, but a &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=3064"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests it could have an 8.03-inch folding inner display paired with a 6.45-inch outer screen. That suggests a device that resembles Samsung’s Z Fold devices (which unfold from a phone form factor into a tablet) rather than its Z Flip (a phone that folds to become more compact). That’s also the form factor used by Honor’s former parent company Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;with its Mate X2&lt;/a&gt;, though now that Honor has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;independent for a year&lt;/a&gt; it’s unclear how similar its upcoming device might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOsB69"&gt;Honor joins an expanding list of companies that have either released, or are planning to launch their own foldables. Samsung and Huawei were two early entrants, but more recently we’ve seen foldables from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, and Oppo, which officially announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price"&gt;Find N phone&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. As well as Honor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22735454/google-foldable-phone-pixel-fold-pixel-6-samsung"&gt;Google is also rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be planning to announce as many as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683566/google-jumbojack-foldable-passport-android-12-1-code-discovery"&gt;two foldables&lt;/a&gt; of its own in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ad board tells Mint Mobile it should stop abusing the word ‘unlimited’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_aRpxdGb8biWnqf05c2BGG6LHA=/0x51:1202x852/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70303317/Fox_Art_04_resize.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mint Mobile says it will comply with the board’s decision.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Mint Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iZRFey"&gt;The National Advertising Review Board &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/nad-clamps-down-mint-mobile-unlimited-ad-claims"&gt;has denied Mint Mobile’s appeal&lt;/a&gt; defending its use of the word “unlimited” in its advertising since its unlimited prepaid plan includes a high-speed data cap of 35GB per month. That’s not unusual — most unlimited plans include a cap on high-speed or “premium” data — but Mint actually slows customers down to unreasonably slow 2G speeds after 35GB. That &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;unusual, even in an industry that has rendered the term “unlimited” virtually meaningless, and &lt;a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/decisions-details/mint-mobile-unlimited-claims-appeal"&gt;the ad board sides with AT&amp;amp;T’s argument&lt;/a&gt; that it’s slower than a customer would reasonably expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNM4a0"&gt;Carriers and MVNOs have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13330158/t-mobile-unlimited-data-settlement-fine-discount-free-data"&gt;throttled heavy data users&lt;/a&gt; more or less since unlimited plans made a comeback. And to be sure, the vast majority of wireless customers use less than 35GB of data per month, so they’d never experience a speed decrease. However, reducing customers who do surpass this threshold to very slow 2G speeds is a step further than most other carriers take throttling — some reduce speeds only when the network is congested or drop customers to more reasonable speeds closer to 3G. In fact, the major carriers’ &lt;em&gt;data-capped&lt;/em&gt; plans often include 2G once the data limit is reached, so Mint calling this plan “unlimited” when it’s essentially a 35GB plan isn’t exactly fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wfho2K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cellphone plan fine print, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hd0BMw"&gt;Over the past year, a couple of carriers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;introduced new unlimited plans&lt;/a&gt; that don’t impose slowdowns based on how much data a customer uses. These plans are pricey, however, and exclusive to postpaid customers. For now, throttling remains a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"&gt;commonplace limitation&lt;/a&gt; on most unlimited plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZ17Z0"&gt;Mint says it will comply with the board’s recommendation to “discontinue or modify” its claim. And come to think of it, we may discontinue or modify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22606623/best-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile"&gt;our prepaid unlimited plan recommendation&lt;/a&gt; of Mint Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s next flagship phone will launch on December 28</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rMEbCSv2RelPcCYZ8OXhUhVNBvA=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70300676/002p2Zyzly1gxl7k7wbp2j61o0280npd02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A teaser poster for the event.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7GZaaz"&gt;Exactly one year from the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;, Xiaomi is set to launch the successor on December 28th, the company has announced via its &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/2202387347/L72AgfN3a?pagetype=profilefeed"&gt;official Weibo account&lt;/a&gt;. The new lineup will be called the Xiaomi 12 series, following the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639020/xiaomi-mi-brand-ending-mix-4-confirmed"&gt;phase out its Mi branding&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. A teaser poster features Chinese sprinter Su Bingtian, which sets the expectation that the event is likely to be focused on the Chinese market before the Xiaomi flagships make their way to global markets in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzrwtN"&gt;Xiaomi’s 12 series lineup could include as many as four different devices, &lt;a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-12-12x-pro-series-launch-date-december-28-poster-ultra-specifications-features-2662501"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Gadgets 360&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These include the Xiaomi 12, the 12 Pro, the 12X, and the 12 Ultra, although it’s possible that not all of them will be announced during the December event (this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t announced until late March, for example). &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/12/21/xiaomi-12-12x-12-pro-names-launch-date-confirmed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmochina &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Xiaomi executives have been spotted using the other three phones to post to their Weibo accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vyjIVY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="tl" dir="ltr"&gt;Xiaomi 12 and 12 Pro  coming &lt;a href="https://t.co/HRCYuamab9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HRCYuamab9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1473190043711782912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YrsKej"&gt;There aren’t many official details about the upcoming handsets, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leijun/status/1465843044415336449"&gt;Xiaomi has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that they’ll be powered by Qualcomm’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809687/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-chip-smartphone-processor-specs-details"&gt;Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor&lt;/a&gt;. Apparent marketing images of the Xiaomi 12 and 12 Pro shared by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1473190043711782912"&gt;leaker @UniverseIce on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; show the phones will feature centrally orientated hole-punch cameras. Other rumored specs of the Xiaomi 12 include a triple rear camera, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1471470228089585682"&gt;leaked renders from @OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt;, with a 50-megapixel primary sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4csX7"&gt;Although Xiaomi’s phones don’t have much of a presence in the US, it’s ranked as the &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/europe-smartphone-market-q3-2021/"&gt;second biggest smartphone manufacturer in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-share/"&gt;second biggest Android manufacturer in the world&lt;/a&gt; behind Samsung. Demand is driven by phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;Xiaomi Mi 11&lt;/a&gt; which offers comparable specs to Samsung’s flagships at much more affordable prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFsnAi"&gt;The Xiaomi Mi 11 launched globally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272003/xiaomi-mi-11-international-price-release-date-announcement"&gt;in February this year&lt;/a&gt;, which hopefully means that the international version of the Xiaomi 12 will arrive soon after the December event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former head of Sonic Team releases new self-made mobile game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XFgzBJNBBIOJb2A9WJtQwgLSDBs=/0x330:4032x3018/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70298647/FG5AXYJacAIKwLq.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yuji Naka showing off his solo-developer skills&lt;/em&gt; | Image: @nakayuji via Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2eoPOW"&gt;Yuji Naka — former head of Sonic Team — released a new game under his one-man studio Prope called &lt;a href="http://iprope.com/SHOT2048.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shot2048&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Naka was the lead programmer for the original &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; (which seems to be playable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834023/sega-genesis-sonic-1-tesla-arcade"&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt; nowadays) and most recently left his short stay at Square Enix to spend his time working on this hyper-casual title for mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nP75bx"&gt;The goal in &lt;em&gt;Shot2048 &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1594889891"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PropeLtd.SHOT2048"&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;) is to roll dice to the end of an alley and combine (multiply) enough like-numbers to create at least one die valued at 2048. It did take me about five attempts to win my first game... and about four tries to understand the game. There aren’t much in terms of instructions other than this iOS App Store description (though admittedly, after reading it again post-play, it makes sense now):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cQGAYO"&gt;The purpose is to shot the same number and make 2048.&lt;br&gt;The purpose is to shot the same number to make 2048, but aim for more.&lt;br&gt;Tap to move the number left or right, and release your finger to fire the number.&lt;br&gt;If you hit the same number, they will be combined and the numbers will be added.&lt;br&gt;The game is over when the numbers stop in the red game over area in the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="dvJrA2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I created a hyper-casual game called [&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SHOT2048?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SHOT2048&lt;/a&gt;]. This is the first time in my 37 years as a game creator that I, Yuji Naka, have made a game all by myself. I would appreciate it if you could play it and spread the word. Thank you very much. &lt;a href="https://t.co/vuWmoxO0sj"&gt;https://t.co/vuWmoxO0sj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LNwQDORXJO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LNwQDORXJO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Yuji Naka / 中　裕司 (@nakayuji) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nakayuji/status/1472186879588331525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t3WK54"&gt;It’s a neat idea for a quick time-pass and doesn’t actually require much in terms of math skill since you only really need to match colors and keep the dice out of the shooting zone. The stage gets a bit more challenging as too many dice fill up the play zone; should the dice stay in the shooting zone for too long — about five seconds — the game will be over. The physics can get kinda wonky, but you’ll need to count on some toppling to get the dice in the back to combine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/thiCJP-a0HaPD-UKM6yBUuMocNk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115535/shot2048.001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshots by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I won once in Shot2048, might be worth playing again but definitely not with the pay-to-win transactions. On the right is a very similar game called Chain Cube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="67hcWv"&gt;Naka’s game takes clear inspiration from other popular mobile puzzlers like, uh, &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt; (which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/28/5556760/threes-developer-releases-emails-showing-work-in-reply-to-clones"&gt;has its own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/11/8722909/threes-free-to-play-launch-ios-android"&gt;history of cloning&lt;/a&gt;) or another similar title we noticed called &lt;em&gt;Chain Cube&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yIcUC"&gt;The free-to-play game is ad-heavy but will let you remove the ads for $5.99. Also, if you’re having a tough time winning, the game will gladly take $0.99 to give you five more tries. I was also requested by the app to track me, which I declined (though, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22828713/apple-app-tracking-transparancy-psa-privacy-ads-cohorts"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not always a full off switch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHDuVH"&gt;Naka built the game on Unity and says this is the first game he developed alone, touting his 37-year career in the video game industry. The inaugural Prope team (2006) consisted of Naka and 10 former Sega employees targeting the casual &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.giantbomb.com%2Fwaggle%2F3015-1035%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F20%2F22846465%2Fyuji-naka-sega-sonic-team-shot2048-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;waggle&lt;/a&gt; gaming boom, starting with &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/07/06/review-lets-tap-for-the-wii/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s Tap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Wii. Without a team, Naka &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nakayuji/status/1472934019432337409"&gt;needed some help&lt;/a&gt; getting leaderboards to work for &lt;em&gt;Shot2048&lt;/em&gt; — so he asked for (and received) help on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC settles with Verizon, AT&amp;T, and others over failed 911 calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhte_qzeEtWYvLvv25Tl4r2cKPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70294725/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6UFV1c"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/four-companies-settle-fcc-investigations-compliance-911-rules"&gt;has reached settlements&lt;/a&gt; with AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, Intrado, and CenturyLink (which now goes by Lumen Technologies) over investigations into failed 911 calls that occurred during network outages in 2020. The companies will pay a total of $6 million combined and also agreed to ensure compliance with the FCC’s 911 availability rules going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUOACx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T will pay $460,000 to settle two different investigations regarding network outages that took place on September 28th, 2020. Both Lumen Technologies and Intrado agreed to resolve investigations into outages that occurred on that same day, with Lumen Technologies paying $3.8 million and Intrado paying $1.7 million. Verizon settled with the FCC over an investigation of an outage that took place on May 7th, 2020, paying $274,000 as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JjexEM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s vital that phone companies prevent these outages wherever possible and provide prompt and sufficient notification to 911 call centers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5TA3d"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, Lumen Technologies, and Intrado weren’t just probed for failed 911 calls. The FCC also reports that it opened an investigation as to whether these companies alerted the affected 911 call centers of the outages in a timely manner. It also investigated AT&amp;amp;T for potentially failing to “deliver number and location information” during the outage, which is in violation of FCC rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKjhfJ"&gt;“Sunny day outages can be especially troubling because they occur when the public and 911 call centers least expect it,” said FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. “It’s vital that phone companies prevent these outages wherever possible and provide prompt and sufficient notification to 911 call centers when they do occur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX28cX"&gt;Just last month, &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-reaches-195m-settlement-t-mobile-911-outage-investigation"&gt;T-Mobile agreed to pay $19.5 million&lt;/a&gt; to settle an investigation into whether T-Mobile violated the FCC’s 911 calling rules during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292024/t-mobile-verizon-att-calls-failing-down-phone-networks-us-carriers"&gt;the massive nationwide outage&lt;/a&gt; that occurred in June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon tries to defend collecting browsing data on its network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lAushCodxkqVEjGJHgyQjuGnM6M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286702/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPknxr"&gt;Verizon has sent an email to customers to let them know they’re getting opted in to its Custom Experience data collection scheme after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22818783/verizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history"&gt;reports came out&lt;/a&gt; about it being turned on by default for some users. If you (understandably) trashed the email without reading it, the TL;DR is that Verizon’s program collects data about your apps and web browsing activity to help “provide you more personalized experiences with Verizon.” But of course, Verizon says, you have a choice — you can turn it off anytime because your privacy is important to it (though not important enough to make the program opt-in instead of opt-out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6pi66"&gt;Custom Experience is a sort of spin-off / successor / rebrand of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/2/16085062/verizon-up-rewards-program-track-browsing-history-data-select-oath"&gt;Verizon Selects&lt;/a&gt;, which people were enrolled into when they used the Verizon Up rewards program. Verizon Selects has now been rebranded as Custom Experience Plus, while the Custom Experience with a few limits on tracking is rolling out to most customers who don’t actively opt out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bzhiO"&gt;Verizon is letting its customers know about the program through emails, like one a member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s staff received, and texts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jamesreb/status/1471603532730040324?s=20"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; a reader says they got. The email promises that “you’re in control,” saying that you can opt out within the next 30 days before the Custom Experience is turned on for your line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mEB4Nz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon is now letting its customers know that the Custom Experience is coming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xk1K05"&gt;Doing nothing, however, will likely end with Verizon using your data to “personalize [its] communications with you, give you more relevant product and service recommendations, and develop plans, services and offers that are more appealing to you.” The &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/verizon-custom-experience-programs-faqs/?CMP=CRM_M_CU_AC_EM_NOT_21_11_LEGAL_CTM_EXP_NON_SLCT_ENG_NUS&amp;amp;EMHID=c96b4811be3d4808a642b94ba5f0fe873310c7077504f5b29ca77de541c45883&amp;amp;CUHID=398078901cccf63d677d949665702ed2995acb4db919825c6f5eb16102951ba7&amp;amp;BID=452102968" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s FAQ for the program&lt;/a&gt; says that “consumer and small business customers with smartphone lines are included in the Custom Experience program.” It does note that corporate and government lines, as well as lines for children and people in Maine, aren’t included in the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofay85"&gt;As we note &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22818783/verizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history"&gt;in our explainer&lt;/a&gt;, there are actually two levels to what Verizon is doing here — Custom Experience, which is the automatic enrollment one, and Custom Experience Plus, which is much more invasive but supposedly is opt-in. However, it does seem like people have found that they’ve inadvertently signed up for Custom Experience Plus while using other rewards programs. Verizon says with Plus, it collects location data straight from its network (so turning off location tracking on your phone won’t help), as well as metadata about your phone calls like who you talk to and when you talk to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QSFnj"&gt;You can read the full instructions on how to turn off Custom Experience and erase the data it’s collected on you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22818783/verizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but the short version is that it can be done in the “Manage privacy settings” preference pane of the My Verizon app (&lt;a href="http://m.vzw.com/CE"&gt;or the web&lt;/a&gt;). Verizon says that it doesn’t sell the data from Custom Experience to advertisers and that it’s for Verizon’s use only. One reader reported that Verizon even sent an alert that linked users to a page explaining how &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/dam/support/pdf/device-installment-privacy-notice.pdf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon uses the personal data you provide when you sign up for its service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As promised, Nokia phones started getting Android 12 this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6Ury3w_zy1QZ2X2zQVU4y49ZSc=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282874/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia X20 is HMD Global’s first device to get Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mZCT2X"&gt;HMD Global offered its first Android 12 update this week, starting with the midrange Nokia X20. The company says &lt;a href="https://community.phones.nokia.com/discussion/64559/android-12-on-nokia-x20"&gt;users in this first wave&lt;/a&gt; will receive the update by December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQvmdb"&gt;Good. That’s what HMD said it would do, and it’s doing just that. We love to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfq1o7"&gt;You’re forgiven if you forgot that the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_int%2Fnokia-x-20&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22839883%2Fnokia-x20-android-12-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia X20&lt;/a&gt; exists — it’s a mostly unremarkable device with a 6.67-inch 60Hz display, Snapdragon 480 processor, and four rear-facing cameras. In fact, its most compelling features might just be its healthy support policy (three years of OS updates) and an unusually generous three-year warranty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E0TWvj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Generally speaking, the Android 12 rollout has been a rocky one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kV0pax"&gt;That’s a great policy in theory — as my colleague Jon Porter pointed out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;his hands-on with the X20&lt;/a&gt;, the phone should still be under warranty when it gets Android 14. But there’s no real guarantee that HMD (or any Android device maker for that matter) will follow through with its promise of continuing OS updates. To that end, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811988/hmd-global-nokia-9-pureview-android-11-software"&gt;recently backtracked on its promise&lt;/a&gt; to bring Android 11 to the Nokia 9 PureView. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WF2h4z"&gt;And generally speaking, the Android 12 rollout has been a rocky one. OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828553/oneplus-buggy-oxygenos-android-12-update-9-pro"&gt;pulled its buggy Android 12-based OxygenOS update&lt;/a&gt; for the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 owners &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-android-12-problems-issues-update-postponed/"&gt;have also reported issues&lt;/a&gt; with the stable Android 12 update. Google’s own Pixel 6 and 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832212/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-bug-fixes-fingerprint-sensor"&gt;appear to be afflicted&lt;/a&gt;, too. Even a so-called stable Android 12 release for Nokia phones could prove to be equally unstable. But if the X20 is to live up to its promised three-year lifespan, it’s certainly starting on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;
