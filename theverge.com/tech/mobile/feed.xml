    <title>Apple blocked some searches with the word ‘Asian,’ and now it’s getting fixed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KBYeeJdZ2lPDnpkTG1CjBtdT3Bg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69050574/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4DWj4R"&gt;Apple’s built-in web content filter for iOS and macOS has apparently been blocking any searches containing the word “Asian” for almost a year, and the error is finally getting fixed, according to a &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-asian-adult-content-filter-ios-fix/"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The issue shows up when you’re using a device that has the “Limit Adult Websites” content restriction turned on. But it’s not just blocking adult websites; it’s blocking almost any searches relating to Asian culture, including “Asian market,” “Asian culture,” and even “stop Asian hate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4HQNl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to confirm that the above searches were blocked on devices running current versions of Apple’s software (iPadOS 14.4.1 and macOS 11.2.3) with the content restrictions turned on. The searches are blocked on both Safari and Chrome on iOS devices, but Chrome was able to perform them on macOS. Devices without the content restrictions turned on can perform the searches and receive results. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nnBi-paaXCSm7De5vPXKvZYOqZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408688/IMG_A6361A17FF98_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The error message shown when a search is blocked by the content restrictions on an iPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NzBuf2"&gt;The good news is that the issue should soon be resolved. The searches work on devices running the iOS 14.5 beta, &lt;em&gt;Mashable &lt;/em&gt;reports. Still, it’s ridiculous that it took this long to fix: there are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/charliestigler/status/1229845987864109056"&gt;reports of the issue&lt;/a&gt; from February 2020, and it shouldn’t have been an issue in the first place. Of course, creating a filter for adult content is extremely difficult, but almost entirely blocking a word used to describe &lt;a href="https://asiapacific.unfpa.org/en/node/15207"&gt;60 percent of the world’s population&lt;/a&gt; is obviously incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35eD3x"&gt;In current, non-beta software, the filter behaves very strangely. “Asian restaurants” is blocked on macOS but not iOS, while “Asian food” is blocked on both. And while the issue has been around for a while, it’s especially embarrassing for Apple in the current moment, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358649/anti-asian-hate-violence-linkedin-content-moderation-atlanta-shooting"&gt;anti-Asian sentiment and violence have been on the rise&lt;/a&gt;. It’s good to see it should be solved in the next versions of iOS, but it shouldn’t have taken this long. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon says it will shut down its 3G network — for real this time — on December 31st, 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JsotKMjQE5x4o8PYbbzbbVWUHvM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049900/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon stopped activating phones on its 3G network several years ago.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rjM2ZN"&gt;After years of delays, Verizon says it will finally &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F3g-cdma-network-shut-date-set-december-31-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22358628%2Fverizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shut down its 3G CDMA network&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2022 — and the company means it this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KIxAK"&gt;Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/11/3488546/verizon-sunset-2g-3g-cdma-2021"&gt;initially targeted 2021&lt;/a&gt; for the shutdown and later revised with a more ambitious goal of 2019. That didn’t happen, and as recently as January 2021, the company said the plan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215453/verizon-3g-shutdown-paused-delay-network-old-phones"&gt;was on hold indefinitely&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Verizon has confirmed an official shutdown date of December 31st, 2022, and a statement that “the date will not be extended again” on the company’s news site leaves no room for ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzdy3l"&gt;This move won’t affect anyone who has activated a phone with Verizon in the past few years; the company stopped activating 3G-only phones in 2018. Verizon is also keen to point out that it will be the last major US carrier to take its 3G network offline. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;says it will shut down its network&lt;/a&gt; in February 2022, and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/05/t-mobile-3g-shutdown-reportedly-delayed-until-2022/"&gt;T-Mobile is aiming for January 1st, 2022&lt;/a&gt;, which could &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/what-t-mobile-3g-cdma-shutdown-means-for-boost-mobile"&gt;cause serious problems&lt;/a&gt; for millions of Dish Network’s Boost Mobile customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lUxhZH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon stopped activating 3G-only phones in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H3cshK"&gt;If you happen to still be using a 3G device on Verizon at this point (well done, you!), then you’ll need to upgrade to something 4G-compatible by the end of 2022 to keep using the network — and it might be a good idea to go for a 5G device at this point just to stay ahead of the next curve.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Area 120 incubator releases a powerful AI document scanner for Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0LkIYK9iwh9IhIfXkNrntStG9VQ=/107x0:1292x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048903/Screen_Shot_2021_03_30_at_9.01.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2GBHa9"&gt;Google’s Area 120, an internal incubator program for experimental projects, is releasing a new app today called Stack that borrows the technology underlying the search giant’s &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/document-ai"&gt;powerful DocAI enterprise tool&lt;/a&gt; for document analysis. The end result is a consumer document scanner app for Android that Google says vastly improves over your average mobile scanner by auto-categorizing documents into the titular stacks and enabling full text search through the contents of the documents and not just the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Bt1Ca"&gt;“I joined Google a couple of years ago when my education startup, Socratic, was acquired. At Socratic, we used Google’s computer vision and language understanding to make learning easier for high school students. I wondered if we could apply the same technologies to make organizing documents easier,” said Christopher Pedregal, the team lead on Stack, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FpXSKY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stack lets you search through the full text of scanned documents &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="muAoj3"&gt;Following the acquisition, Pedregal and his colleague Matthew Cowan joined Google’s Area 120, where they came up with an app that could use DocAI and its artificial intelligence technology to improve the process of scanning receipts, bills, and other important documents. The app uses Google’s biometric authentication on Android, so you can secure sensitive documents behind face or fingerprint scanning to unlock the software. It also automatically creates fields for scanned bills so you can fill in due dates and other important info. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3GTMH"&gt;The app, like so many of Google’s experimental (and sometimes even not-so-experimental) efforts, is getting released in the hopes it catches on and not with any real concrete business model attached or a definite roadmap. Pedregal stresses that “it’s early days” for Stack, which means the app can “still get things wrong.” It also means it could, at a moment’s notice, get sent to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;Google Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; — though, presumably, with the option to export your documents if that does happen at some point in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAX5gh"&gt;That said, it seems like a powerful alternative to a normal document scanner, and few companies are better than Google at understanding text and recognizing images. So it’s certainly worth a shot if you’re in the market for a better way to organize your real-world paper. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Codename: Urban Legends is a taste of what Niantic thinks 5G could do for AR gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g22CO7uRg3ebCUxumkI0ShCf9kI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047739/5G_MEC_Codename_Urban_Legends_Hero_D__1___1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2X0fuI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; developer Niantic has &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/niantic-planet-scale-ar-5g-multiplayer"&gt;unveiled &lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which it describes as “a multiplayer demo experience that offers a glimpse into the future of AR and 5G networks.” The game revolves around casting magic spells to kill monsters and rescue allies. It’s similar to Niantic’s previously released games, but the trailer includes a unique feature: multiple players interacting with the same augmented reality creatures from their own phones. Niantic says it’s just a demo at the moment and not for general consumer use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaDxce"&gt;It’s an exciting shift from Niantic’s previously released games like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, and the company says this is largely thanks to 5G&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Although its games have had multiplayer elements, for the most part each player exists in their own augmented reality worlds. For example, while the same pokémon appear on the map for every player in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, each player can only view and interact with their own creatures in AR. In other words, you can’t throw a pokéball to catch someone else’s augmented reality pokémon. (&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Go&lt;/em&gt; has a limited &lt;a href="https://niantic.helpshift.com/a/pokemon-go/?s=buddy-pokemon&amp;amp;f=shared-ar-experience-with-your-buddy&amp;amp;l=en&amp;amp;p=web"&gt;shared AR experience mode&lt;/a&gt; where you can see other players’ pokémon but not interact with them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iP56r2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A multiplayer demo experience that offers a glimpse into the future of AR and 5G networks”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BaVrf9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legend&lt;/em&gt;s isbuilt on the same platform that underpins the augmented reality games &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;. Niantic hopes that AR gaming will be 5G’s “killer app,” benefiting from its higher speeds, lower latency, and ability to keep lots of people’s phones connected to the internet in a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trziOF"&gt;Niantic says that carriers from its &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/niantic-planet-scale-ar-alliance-5g"&gt;Planet-Scale AR Alliance&lt;/a&gt; — an organization formed of over half a dozen carriers around the world aimed at developing augmented reality 5G experiences — have been network testing the game. These include Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, Globe Telecom in the Philippines, and Verizon in the US. Niantic &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/niantic-planet-scale-ar-alliance-5g"&gt;formed the alliance last year&lt;/a&gt; to promote and develop augmented reality experiences for 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtaV8l"&gt;Although it’s a cool demo, &lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reliance on 5G risks replicating some of the geographical issues that affected &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go. &lt;/em&gt;5G coverage is currently concentrated in cities, meaning players living in more rural areas risk losing out (&lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends &lt;/em&gt;works on both Sub-6GHz and mmWave variants of 5G). It was a similar situation when city-dwelling &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;players benefited from having more pokéstops and gyms compared to players out in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGG3TC"&gt;Today’s announcement doesn’t say when the demo might turn into a real game or on which phones it runs. However, Niantic tells us the game will be exclusive to its carrier partners’ customers once it releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JFiPv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends&lt;/em&gt; is an interesting tech demo, and it has the potential to expand on &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;’s augmented reality features in some interesting ways. We just want to know when players will be able to dive in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s new logo is almost unrecognizable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fOJTpR6OmjyOacN7eoScADglUcg=/160x0:2059x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047710/Screen_Shot_2021_03_30_at_12.51.31_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xiaomi’s new logo (left) and old logo (right). &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="05KiGt"&gt;No one in the world does corporate pomposity quite like tech firms, and Chinese mobile giant Xiaomi is no exception. The company announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;new foldable Mi Mix Fold today&lt;/a&gt;, but it also revealed a new logo, spending more than 20 minutes describing the process in which it turned its old square design into... a squircle. (Halfway between a square and a circle.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JigPOx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Xiaomi says the new logo has a new “internal spirit,” too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U3HWJE"&gt;In fairness to Xiaomi, the company is not blind to the fact its new logo is &lt;em&gt;pretty similar&lt;/em&gt; in appearance to the old one. “Are you disappointed at this logo, that we just made our original logo rounder?” asked Xiaomi’s CEO Lei Jun, somewhat rhetorically. No worry, Lei explained, as the company “didn’t just change the shape from square to round” but also changed “the internal spirit as well as the mentality of the brand.” So, that’s reassuring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEElAD"&gt;The company went on to note that the shape of the new logo can be described using mathematical equations (a property that is common to most shapes, I believe) and that it took the firm a long time to pick the right one (it started the rebranding process in 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98iYgb"&gt;You can see some of the shapes it considered and discarded below, along with the blindingly, obviously, self-evidently superior final design. N:3, could it be any other way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T8VZNL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10419708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FtECfm"&gt;We’re having some fun at Xiaomi’s expense here, but really this is just par for the course when it comes to corporate redesigns. Indeed, this sort of long-winded, self-indulgent presentation is common to pretty much all big tech brands at this point, from Samsung to Microsoft to Apple (who started the game and remains the master of the form). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiVBtm"&gt;As Lei explained, the new logo is part of a bigger overhaul of Xiaomi’s “brand identity” overseen by famed Japanese designer Kenya Hara. “The new logo is not a simple redesign of the shape but an encapsulation of Xiaomi’s inner spirit,” said Hara during a video segment. “The design is essentially a reflection of the concept ‘Alive.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZgAqV"&gt;So, if you feel dead inside considering the millions of dollars of work that went into circling the square of Xiaomi’s logo: don’t. That’s disrespectful to its brand identity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi announces the Mi Mix Fold, its first folding phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RCsMj-zHd0WmoMDy0CBaSsJBZks=/0x0:1688x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047687/mf1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mi Mix Fold pairs a folding screen on the inside with a smaller outer display. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Px37br"&gt;Xiaomi has resurrected its Mi Mix series with the Mi Mix Fold, the company’s first commercial folding phone. Unlike previous outlandish Mix devices and concepts from the company, the Mi Mix Fold is a pretty conventional folding phone that uses a big-screen-on-the-inside / small-screen-on-the-outside design similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Huawei’s new Mate X2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNbPcj"&gt;The inner screen is an 8.01-inch 4:3 OLED panel with 2480 x 1860 resolution, a standard display brightness of 600 nits (900 peak), and support for Dolby Vision HDR. Xiaomi says the display is able to withstand being folded 200,000 times. The outer screen is 6.52-inches with a 90Hz refresh rate. Xiaomi is making big claims about the Mi Mix Fold’s audio capabilities, with four Harman Kardon-tuned speakers and what the company describes as 3D panoramic sound.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GcyVDYwontZoiL40zB4XrIT8x8k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407567/MIX_Fold__21_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone has a camera with a liquid lens on the rear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f5Q0Hb"&gt;The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 paired with 12GB or 16GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage. Battery capacity is 5,020mAh, and Xiaomi says the 67W fast-charging system should get you a full charge in 37 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4Xy8k"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350245/xiaomi-mi-mix-liquid-lens-autofocus-focal-length-camera"&gt;previously teased&lt;/a&gt; last week, the new Mix is also the first phone to use liquid lens technology in its camera. Xiaomi says that it allows for a telephoto lens with a close focusing distance of 3cm and optical zoom of 3x, or 30x hybrid zoom. The rest of the camera system is comprised of a Samsung HMX 108-megapixel main sensor and a 13-megapixel ultrawide, which sounds like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;the same solid setup that’s on the Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7B1jVL"&gt;Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194065/xiaomi-foldable-phone-tablet-device-teaser"&gt;first showed off a folding phone prototype&lt;/a&gt; more than two years ago, before Samsung shipped its first Galaxy Fold. That device had a double-folding design where a tablet-sized screen could be bent back on the left and right edges for a more phone-like experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ae1pI"&gt;Later that year, Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/24/20881378/xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-announced-wrap-around-screen"&gt;announced the Mi Mix Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, which had a wraparound screen that covered almost the whole phone, but it never made it to market. More recently Xiaomi unveiled its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267807/xiaomi-quad-curved-waterfall-display-concept-phone-announced"&gt;latest concept phone&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a “quad-curved waterfall display” that curved on all four sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kyt1GQ"&gt;The Mi Mix Fold, on the other hand, is very much going on sale — people in China are able to preorder it as of today, and it’ll ship on April 16th. Prices start at 9,999 yuan (around $1,521) for a model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, going all the way up to 12,999 yuan (around $1,978) for a 16GB / 512GB ceramic special edition. There’s no word yet on a release outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: PayPal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FlSiSw"&gt;We already knew that PayPal was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527288/paypal-cryptocurrency-support-buy-sell-venmo-bitcoin"&gt;planning to support cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; as a form of payment, and now, the online payment app announced US customers can do just that with its “Checkout with Crypto” feature, which is rolling out today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YDTb3"&gt;After rolling out the ability for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562771/paypal-cryptocurrency-buy-sell-bitcoin-ethereum-litecoin-us-users"&gt;US users to buy and sell cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; directly from their accounts last November, PayPal’s new “Checkout with Crypto” allows users to instantly convert their Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or Bitcoin Cash to US dollars (with no additional transaction fees) that PayPal then uses to complete the transaction. If a merchant doesn’t take US dollars, PayPal also converts those dollars into local currency at standard conversion rates set by PayPal. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tacC6RkjsT5OnQJh4ccW0FdHWsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406834/paypal_crypto_screen.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PayPal will support several types of cryptocurrency, including Ethereum and Bitcoin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4OQuh2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;PayPal is not the first payment app to offer support for cryptocurrency&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="htM45Y"&gt;The feature will automatically appear in the PayPal wallet if a user has a “sufficient cryptocurrency balance to cover an eligible purchase,” and you’ll be able to see your crypto balances for each kind of coin in the app. However, you can only use one type of cryptocurrency for each purchase you make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aj1fUe"&gt;PayPal is not the first payment app to offer support for cryptocurrency. In 2018, its competitor, Square, launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17689156/square-cash-expands-bitcoin-support-to-all-50-us-states"&gt;support for Bitcoin on the Cash App&lt;/a&gt;. But the launch of cryptocurrency as a form of payment makes PayPal both a major digital wallet and a cryptocurrency exchange, which could streamline the use of cryptocurrency as a more common payment method. During its Investor Day last week, the company reported that it had &lt;a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_presentations/2021/02/PP-Investor-Day-2021-Combined-FINAL.pdf"&gt;377 million active accounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is already shutting down its live TV service, partners with YouTube TV and Philo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nkjNGeYXyH83iWeu69Bj9WlB2G4=/179x0:2249x1380/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044385/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_3.19.01_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pzT0Ue"&gt;Only five months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535264/tmobile-tvision-live-internet-tv-streaming-service-price"&gt;announcing its TVision streaming service&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile today shared news that TVision’s three bundles of live channels will all shut down at the end of April. The development comes as part of T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22120959"&gt;new partnership with Google and YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, which it’s making out to be a huge deal. The carrier says YouTube TV will now fill the role of its “live TV solution.” It’s also positioning Philo TV as the replacement for its base offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6Up7y"&gt;The Live, Live Plus, and Live Zone services that were available with TVision will go dark on April 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWpsbg"&gt;T-Mobile is giving a free month of YouTube TV to customers who had signed up for one of the TVision Live packages, and all T-Mobile subscribers will be eligible to save $10 on the usual monthly rate of $64.99; so if they want the service, it’ll cost $54.99 per month. They can also get three free months of YouTube Premium. On Philo’s side, customers can also get $10 off the usual price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VIIhE"&gt;“YouTube TV is a leader in this space,” T-Mobile said in today’s press release. “It offers the same great flexibility, robust content and convenience that TVision customers love.” The message is clear: T-Mobile is teaming up with a company that has been in this game longer and is already familiar with everything it takes to make streaming, watch-anywhere TV work — even if it feels like the costs keep climbing higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkan9Q"&gt;In what comes off as an attempt to sugarcoat a short-lived misstep, T-Mobile says its “TVision initiative was launched to give customers new choices and help millions cut the cord, while expanding appeal for the company’s forthcoming wireless home Internet service.” That doesn’t quite match the usual brazen “Uncarrier” tone that &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201027005931/en/"&gt;T-Mobile had back in October&lt;/a&gt;, when CEO Mike Sievert said “just like we changed wireless for good, now we’re gonna change TV for good.” At the time, T-Mobile said TVision Live was “a total game-changer for anyone who wants live news and sports.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYIAnX"&gt;Sievert has now changed his tune. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fturns-out-tv-is-better-with-friends&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356978%2Ft-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;, he acknowledged that TV is better “with friends,” and went into more detail on what led to T-Mobile’s revamped approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4znjJL"&gt;This shift may surprise some given last year’s TVision streaming services launch. But innovation seldom follows a straight line. Since launching the TVision initiative, we’ve learned a lot about the TV industry, about streaming products, and of course, about TV customers. We also saw trends that made us take a fresh look at how to best do in video what we always do: put customers first. With our TV software provider encountering some financial challenges and with our broader, strategic partnerships with Google and Philo, we saw an opportunity to deliver unique value to our customers and strengthen the TVision initiative with the best partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VKXEW"&gt;This industry is incredibly fragmented, with new streaming services launching all the time, and we’ve concluded that we can add even more value to consumers’ TV choices by partnering with the best services out there, negotiating incredible streaming media deals for T-Mobile customers, and helping our customers navigate the increasingly complex streaming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="O8PqJk"&gt;Sievert describes the new arrangement as “a big upgrade,” adding that “YouTube TV offers more than twice as many channels as TVision Live, and Philo offers nearly twice as many channels as TVision Vibe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCCJ3h"&gt;TVision Live had started at $40 / month, with Live Plus and Live Zone each increasing by another $10. As other internet TV providers know, it’s unlikely that T-Mobile would’ve been able to hang on to those lower tiers for long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeLpTJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fservices%2Fvibe&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356978%2Ft-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TVision Vibe&lt;/a&gt; — a $10-per-month service that provides on-demand access (but not live streams) to shows from AMC, Discovery, MTV, and other networks — is also being phased out. Same goes for TVision Channels, which lets customers aggregate their subscriptions from Showtime, Stars, and Epix. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fservices%2Fhub&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356978%2Ft-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TVision Hub 4K streaming dongle&lt;/a&gt; will remain available, and it sounds like YouTube TV will now get a prominent spot on that device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51iACF"&gt;You can look at this as a retreat on T-Mobile’s part, but I think its decision is probably the right one. YouTube TV remains the streaming TV service to beat, and there just wasn’t enough about TVision to make it stand out among YTTV and other competitors. Any price advantage was never going to last. Above all else, T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297311/tmobile-5g-mid-band-magenta-max-unlimited-data"&gt;still touting its strong 5G network advantage&lt;/a&gt;, as evidenced by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;Magenta Max data plan&lt;/a&gt; it announced in late February. The plan is the only one among major carriers to lift any deprioritization limits on data usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAubD5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 29th, 4:25PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The article has been updated with more details on T-Mobile’s revamped TV approach, with new details on Philo’s role in the initiative and a blog post from T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is betting big on Google’s Android services: RCS, YouTube TV, Pixel, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5 in “Sorta Sage” green" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mkBer63LTPctRN6fpc5LooDif9s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044383/akrales_201012_4137_0117.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DTBIdh"&gt;Google and T-Mobile are announcing a huge partnership today, with the carrier agreeing to showcase a suite of Google’s services on Android phones sold on the carrier’s network. The list includes officially supporting Google’s Android Messages (with RCS) app on all of T-Mobile’s Android phones, dropping T-Mobile’s own TV services for Google’s YouTube TV, showcasing Google One as the default backup service, and expanding support and sales of Google hardware like the Pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwYqkZ"&gt;T-Mobile and Google say the carrier has “the most Android smartphone customers in the US.” With this big partnership, those customers will have a phone that is more likely to showcase native Google services instead of less-well-supported services from the carrier or manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFNKtp"&gt;It’s also a big win for Google, which will finally see another US carrier besides Verizon take a real shot at promoting the Pixel line of phones. Pixel sales in the US have not reached any sort of real critical mass, though they’ve done better since Google started selling less-expensive versions like the 3A and 4A. Early on, Verizon was the premier partner, but it never materialized into big numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46l3wu"&gt;But the biggest news is probably that T-Mobile is winding down its Live, Live Plus, and Live Zone services in favor of YouTube TV. T-Mobile customers get $10 off that service, and there will be various other offers, including three months free of YouTube Premium. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22121019"&gt;More on that deal (and the surprising decision to wind down T-Mobile’s own TV streaming service) here from Chris Welch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="etJqKX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;RCS takes another baby step toward becoming the default&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b7FAE0"&gt;For messaging, it’s yet another step forward in the long, convoluted, and harrowing journey to normalize the next-gen RCS standard across the US. Just this past January, some strange backroom dealings meant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 devices shipped with Samsung Messages as the default&lt;/a&gt; in the US, while most of the rest of the world got Android Messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYt9du"&gt;Samsung phones on T-Mobile &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; use Android Messages as the default in the future, as will every other Android phone T-Mobile sells. Google says the switchover will happen by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ruRF4y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is rolling out end-to-end encryption for RCS in Android Messages beta ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"},{"title":"Google is finally taking charge of the RCS rollout&amp;amp;nbsp;","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18681573/google-rcs-chat-android-texting-carriers-imessage-encryption"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zz0VYP"&gt;Google is also providing a small update on its ongoing effort to support secure end-to-end encryption for RCS on Android Messages. It reiterated that the rollout for beta testers already started and that it “will continue throughout 2021.” Fully encrypted chat for 1:1 messages for RCS is currently only supported inside Android Messages, so T-Mobile’s decision to make it the standard will mean that more people will have it made available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBU8ge"&gt;Google and T-Mobile are also announcing plans to “build a messaging business together.” That’s a reference to RCS’s ability to be used for business chat — just as you can with iMessage or WhatsApp for some businesses. It’s one of the things that originally seemed like it might be a big driver for adoption since there’s money to be made on the backend as businesses pay for the service, but it hasn’t reached its potential yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Etp1bY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon didn’t do much for Google’s Pixel phones, but maybe T-Mobile will&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOemtC"&gt;Last and perhaps least, T-Mobile is adopting Google One’s cloud storage as the default backup service for Android phones. Unlike with TV, it doesn’t appear there will be any discounts on offer. Custom online storage solutions from carriers are a notoriously annoying piece of crapware installed on Android phones — just ask any Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T customer who bought their phone from their carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raB1nC"&gt;When asked for comment, Google says it isn’t “disclosing the financial terms of this deal.” Google and T-Mobile already have a pre-existing relationship, as T-Mobile is the network that supports Google’s MVNO, Google Fi. This new deal doesn’t change anything for Fi customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSRKmA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra’s camera bump is no moon; it’s a space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cr1vFRnOtzFVDIQOYFzA2YVaOlE=/0x118:1500x1118/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044009/mi_11_bump3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a lot.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7WgYQp"&gt;We were warned. But as is so often the case, our feeble minds couldn’t fully grasp it until it was staring us in the face. We saw the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra’s camera bump in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280166/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-leak-front-screen-display-specs"&gt;pre-announcement unboxing video&lt;/a&gt;, so we knew what was likely in store: an absolutely massive bump with three rear-facing cameras next to a 1-inch screen. But now that the phone has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;officially launched&lt;/a&gt; and we’ve seen it from more angles, we can confirm that it is actually the Death Star of camera bumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vft2dQ"&gt;What’s most striking is the bump’s unapologetic thickness. This isn’t a design that tries to minimize its appearance or meld it into other elements of the phone, a la the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it’s a major contributor to the device’s overall 8.38mm thickness. It’s practically halfway to a &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/6801580015/sonyt77t700"&gt;2008 Sony Cybershot point-and-shoot&lt;/a&gt; glued to the back of your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C6aIG7Uz4jvVvu2nxcqsWzkqdh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22405941/mi_11_bump11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Imag&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;e: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top and bottom views of the Mi 11 Ultra’s camera bump and the phone attached to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XMnCUP"&gt;The bump’s standout feature — that little 1-inch OLED — no doubt requires a thicker design than your average display-less array. And let’s not forget the cameras themselves, starting with a 50-megapixel wide angle with a very large 1/1.2-inch sensor that’s just a shade smaller than the 1-inch sensor you’ll find in dedicated cameras like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995864/sony-rx100-mark-vii-camera-review-price-specs-features-microphone-jack"&gt;Sony RX100 VII&lt;/a&gt;. That big sensor potentially offers better light-gathering capabilities than a more conventionally sized one, especially considering it’s combined with a relatively fast f/1.95 lens. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RBsULfgwB63DBbs6uwx6B6qq7Vg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406043/xiaomi_bump.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bump is big, but so is the main camera sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb8x7l"&gt;There’s also a 48-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide and a 48-megapixel f/4.1 periscope-style 5x optical zoom. That’s not on quite the same level as the S21 Ultra’s four rear-facing cameras (plus an autofocus sensor), but it’s still plenty of hardware to house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEZpE5"&gt;The camera bump is, without question, enormous. But it’s not just big for the sake of being big, though. Its screen and uncommonly large main camera are potentially really useful. Will we ever see a more mainstream device with a camera bump this, for lack of a better term, chonky? Probably not. This 6.8-inch device is probably the best venue to debut these features since users already know they’re getting a big device. The rest of us can just marvel at what an astonishing technological feat it is. Truly more machine than man.&lt;/p&gt;
