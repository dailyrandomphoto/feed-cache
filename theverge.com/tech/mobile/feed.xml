    <title>Here are our favorite MagSafe-compatible cases for the iPhone 13 </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xPF2ZE"&gt;Now that your brand-spanking-new iPhone 13 has arrived (or is on the way), it’s time to start thinking about protecting your baby. After all, it’s only a matter of time before your phone falls out of your pocket or makes contact with your keys, so it’s worth the extra investment now to prevent future damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CujTbM"&gt;Although MagSafe as an iPhone accessory standard is already a year old, Apple is off to a slow start building out its accessory ecosystem. Since its October 2020 launch event, Apple has only launched a dozen official MagSafe products: from the iconic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe Charger&lt;/a&gt; puck to the 2021 &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMM0Q3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-golden-brown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe Leather Wallet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KebrqK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The iPhone 13 Mini still gets slower MagSafe charging speeds ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691602/iphone-13-mini-slower-magsafe-charging-speeds-12w"},{"title":"The Lightning port isn’t about convenience; it’s about control ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22690338/apple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe"},{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3z5diJ"&gt;Of course, third-party accessory makers are eager to make MagSafe products, too. Unfortunately, Apple is famously tight-fisted with its proprietary technology, even though its &lt;a href="https://mfi.apple.com/"&gt;MFi program&lt;/a&gt; is designed to license and control these very products. So third-party accessories like battery packs and chargers can only attach to the official MagSafe products and charge at 7.5W, rather than the 15W wireless charging standard that Apple-approved accessories can achieve. But third-party accessories tend to be cheaper in price and offer more selection than the official lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34HE13"&gt;In case you’re on the hunt for cases that will work with your official &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe Charger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt;, here are the top 10 third-party iPhone 13 cases that caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Backbone offers 3D-printed solution for iPhone 13 Pro camera bump issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BackBone One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5pTzJYYDGcJV2im_LTmgwbvwrlc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69913581/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hk174V"&gt;Backbone Labs has acknowledged the issue that hampers the use of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;excellent iPhone gaming controller&lt;/a&gt; with the new iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691301/iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-backbone-one-gaming-controller-accessory"&gt;As we noticed last week&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone 13 Pro’s thicker camera bump means the phone doesn’t sit neatly in the Backbone One controller, either sticking out on one side or causing the bridge on the back to slightly buckle. It’s not unusable, but it’s not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uV1mXY"&gt;“We spent a tremendous amount of time meticulously crafting every surface of Backbone One (both bits and atoms) and even designing universal support for the iPhones available when it was released,” a Backbone representative wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Backbone/comments/pvhl98/backbone_one_iphone_13_pro_pro_max_adapter/"&gt;official post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, we’re disappointed in the situation at hand. Several folks on the team even upgraded to 13 Pro Max for a better gaming experience, and while the fit may be acceptable for some users, it’s not as good as we’d like it to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WquSRF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Backbone One is a stunning controller that turns your iPhone into a more capable gaming device","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0nAvVr"&gt;To address this, Backbone has designed an adapter that is intended to improve the experience with the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. Unfortunately, the company says it isn’t able to mass-produce them right away because of supply constraints and COVID-19, so the adapter design will be released as an open-source 3D printable file. If you don’t have access to a 3D printer, Backbone says “we’ll do our best” to send an adapter to users who contact the company’s support team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwUaUy"&gt;The printable files should be posted online “in a matter of days;” we’ll let you know how well the solution works when we can.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s Friday, here’s the Galaxy S22 Ultra render that has the Android blogosphere abuzz</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tPAqt1bFg8PNssyPiGSlNCBun-M=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69905230/GALAXY_S22_ULTRA_5K4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Digit, OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pA0XYz"&gt;It’s Friday, it’s fall, there’s a breeze in the air (hopefully), and there’s fresh, I’d argue ridiculous, renders of Samsung’s expected Galaxy S22 Ultra to show you. The renders come &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1441426057316368389?s=20"&gt;courtesy of @OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.digit.in/news/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-exclusive-leaked-renders-specs-61203.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and they feature a new Samsung flagship with what looks like a Galaxy Note 20-inspired body and back that... well you should see for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBQsVb"&gt;Since deciding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;to skip the Galaxy Note in 2021&lt;/a&gt; — apparently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676054/t-mobile-cfo-peter-osvaldik-samsung-supply-no-note"&gt;much to the chagrin of T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;Samsung’s been seeding Note features across its popular phones. Both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; offer stylus support. If these new renders are to be believed, the Galaxy S22 Ultra will go even further. According to OnLeaks and &lt;em&gt;Digit&lt;/em&gt;, the new phone will come with the hole-punch selfie camera and candy bar shape of last year’s Note, along with stylus support and what looks like an actual stylus slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fLZ8ro"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sooo... Here comes your very first and early look at the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Samsung?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Samsung&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS22Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS22Ultra&lt;/a&gt; and its quite "unique" rear camera housing design! (360° video + stunning 5K renders + dimensions)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On behalf of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/digitindia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@digitindia&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/vBGM3WJfru"&gt;https://t.co/vBGM3WJfru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/YDqfFrVGLW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YDqfFrVGLW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1441426057316368389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NW5kU6"&gt;The render of the back of the device is where things get interesting, weird, or bad, depending on your taste. The Galaxy S22 Ultra appears to morph &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;the camera “plateau” of the S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; into an unmistakable letter P shape. Is the P for... photos? Pictures? Maybe periscope? There certainly seems to be plenty of room. For reference, the previous Ultra included a main 108-megapixel wide-angle sensor, two 10-megapixel telephoto sensors, and a 12-megapixel ultrawide sensor on the back of the device. Who knows what the new S22 Ultra will fit?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ATuyJXVgnfueUq6vLwNSV-oIdbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22875857/GALAXY_S22_ULTRA_07.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Digit, OnLeaks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s hard to miss the P-shaped cameras, a little bit easier to miss the stylus slot at the bottom of the rumored device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sDJGdj"&gt;There’s some reason to believe this could be Samsung’s design, beyond it fitting with a general trend of camera bumps becoming big and increasingly... visible on devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;the iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;yet-to-be-released Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. OnLeaks has a fairly good track record of leaking phones, pretty closely matching the looks of both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395173/leaked-google-pixel-5-renders-specs-october-launch"&gt;the Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447011/google-pixel-6-leaks-renders-pics-specs"&gt;the Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. This kind of refinement to a camera housing also doesn’t seem out of the picture, in many ways it’s a reduction of the S21 Ultra’s cameras: a corner has been removed. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t look strange, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy S21 Ultra, in Phantom Black" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1pRvJgZl0Ynhub4j7_nMUn0Zt0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248961/vpavic_210119_4377_0170.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can imagine seeing a “P” on the Galaxy S21 Ultra if I really look at it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Here’s how much that free iPhone really costs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aoo6ErNbF9KL1EZXp8uvg7yf2gU=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69904305/lcimg_8043788f_4592_4b97_9d19_6cf11041bc74.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prices for iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone Pro Max, as announced at the 2021 Apple Event.&lt;/em&gt; | Sean Hollister&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0oPG4N"&gt;With all the carriers dangling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"&gt;sweet, sweet trade-in and upgrade offers&lt;/a&gt; to essentially give you a “free” iPhone 13 (or two) this year, one can’t help but wonder: which one is the best deal? In this case, that would be the offer that costs you the least money but gets you the iPhone you want. Between all the convoluted conditions and confusing industry jargon, the carriers certainly don’t make it easy to compare different offers or make clear what you’re signing up for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJ8Hta"&gt;Carriers might be eager to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"&gt;sign up new customers for their bottom lines&lt;/a&gt;, but you need to look out for yours too. After all, is it better to opt for a cheaper unlimited plan that requires a 36-month commitment or get instant trade-in credits to pay a little less sales tax upfront? Should you look for deals that give you instant trade-in credits or get trade-in credits in the form of bill credits over the course of your agreement? It’s sometimes hard to understand all the details until you’ve already signed the contract. To save you the trouble, I took a closer look at the fine print of these deals and did some back-of-the-napkin calculations to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lQYt37"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"},{"title":"iPhone 13 Pro review: a better display, the best camera, and incredible battery life","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"},{"title":"How to buy the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCbB4ruy8_POK4LyN7eYl8Gt1vg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874502/lcimg_a194780c_218b_4835_a70c_847baa93d76f.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many of the carrier trade-in offers are so aggressive that you can get an iPhone 13 Pro for “free.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EaCcga"&gt;In this case, I wanted to figure out which deal offers the best overall value over the long term. For example, what are my upfront and long-term costs in getting the newest iPhone for as low as free? For the sake of this exercise, I pretended to be a new customer in New York City, shopping for a single phone line, who wants to trade her iPhone 11 for an iPhone 13 or an iPhone 13 Pro,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSsTVt"&gt;Some important caveats about the numbers I’ll be referencing: they are by no means definitive and only serve to demonstrate how these deals work. For one thing, these carrier offers are time-sensitive and may already be different by the time you read this. The specifics of your carrier plan are influenced by many personal factors, like your credit history, your local tax rate, how many lines you need, and any special discounts that you’re eligible for (e.g., military/veteran). I can only present a relatively basic set of numbers that don’t reflect all the many possible variations in the universe, so take my numbers with a grain of salt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMqT8G"&gt;After comparing similar offers from AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile / Sprint, Verizon, Apple.com, I’ve noticed a few tips that would help you shop for the best deal for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1u5JP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My key takeaways...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DX9LdWjvrdsw3twULvMGJi2t2tQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874503/lcimg_998e9575_72ad_4040_91eb_7203d774a004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In some scenarios, it might make sense to pay for a device in full and instant trade-in credits, rather than rely on trade-in credits in the form of bill credits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k9wZNK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the plans, not the free phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPPJpa"&gt;Most of the trade-in credits are so high that they basically cover the cost of an iPhone 13 or iPhone 13 Pro — assuming your trade-in device is from the past two years and in good condition. So when you look at these deals, you should not get distracted by the allure of a free iPhone. Instead, focus on the cost of the plan after 24 to 36 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYHS5M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contract Length Matters Most&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrP3h3"&gt;The duration of the contract has the biggest impact on separating the best value deal from the bad. While AT&amp;amp;T offers the cheapest unlimited plan among its competition ($65/month), after 36 months (the required length you need to have service for to get the best offer), it ended up costing the most money ($2,445.30). Since most of its rivals’ plans are only 24 months long, I did the math on the AT&amp;amp;T plan at 24 months just so that I could compare apples to apples. It turns out the $65-per-month plan is the least expensive one after 24 months ($1,630.20) and is even cheaper than the special promotion between Apple and T-Mobile / Sprint ($1,713.60), which includes an extra $500 discount on the phone when you sign up for the $85 Magenta / Sprint Max plan. It’s worth gaming out the full cost of the plan for the duration of the contract before you sign on the line because this is where you’ll be spending the majority of your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxJeXh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instant Trade-in Credits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmQkZL"&gt;If you can pay for the balance of your phone in full at the time of purchase and live near an eligible Apple store, you might want to take advantage of the instant trade-in credits that Apple offers. The beauty of the instant trade-in credit is that you get the value right at the time of purchase, which lowers the sales tax you pay at checkout — unlike the online trade-in process where your device has to be mailed to a third party to be evaluated, before its actual value will be credited to your monthly bills in a few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5Jmy6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trade-offs with Trade-ins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpKrTX"&gt;Although my hypothetical trade-in credit for the iPhone 11 (between $800 and $1,000) effectively renders my monthly device payments to $0, because I am required to be on a monthly device payment plan as part of any trade-in offer, I may not terminate my device plan earlier than 24 months. If I do, I would be responsible for paying for the balance of this “free” iPhone, lose the remaining value from my trade-in device, and (potentially) pay an early termination penalty. Now, if I paid for the device upfront (ideally with an instant trade-in credit), I could choose a plan that better reflects my actual data consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSMYJp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm4lO4"&gt;In some cases, the carrier might require you to pay a down payment or an activation fee, and offer you different contract lengths based on your credit history. While you won’t be paying for your iPhone directly when your trade-in credit kicks in, you still have to pay the sales tax on the full price of the phone — there is no bill credit to reimburse that cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuCwrG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Winner: Verizon &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FL7vlP"&gt;Out of all the carrier offers, Verizon actually had the lowest overall costs with its 24-month payment plans, even though it doesn’t have the cheapest 5G plan or the shortest agreement length. At $2,077.36 for the iPhone 13 and $2,285.36 for the iPhone 13 Pro, these totals don’t even include the $500 gift card that Verizon is offering to customers who switch providers. The most expensive carrier offer, on the other hand, is from AT&amp;amp;T and its extra-long 36-month contract. Not only does it cost more of your hard-earned money, but your iPhone 13 will be so out-of-date after three years that you may want to pay to end your contract early. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WcByte"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10766269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yxLCVZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ObBKh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10766838"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sou97r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, September 27th, 2021 at 11:59AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the trade-in value of an iPhone 11 used towards an iPhone 13 Pro from T-Mobile and Verizon. The iPhone 13 Pro chart has been updated to reflect the correct trade-in values ($800), as well as the corresponding monthly payments and total costs. The copy has also been updated with the correct total cost of the iPhone 13 Pro trade-in offer from Verizon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 Pro’s camera bump is a problem for the Backbone controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BackBone One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/085GaNsw_jS9EuF437spwptuDeg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902838/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tbCIPR"&gt;The new and very good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro lineup&lt;/a&gt; has a thicker camera bump than previous generations (7.65mm vs. 7.4mm in the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max). It sounds negligible, but it’s enough to cause a few small issues with accessory compatibility. For instance, the iPhone 13 Pro apparently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1441086122839339015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1441086122839339015%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrumors.com%2F2021%2F09%2F23%2Fmagsafe-duo-charger-iphone-13-pro-compatibility%2F"&gt;doesn’t fit perfectly onto the MagSafe Duo dual charger&lt;/a&gt; because of its size. And based on my colleague Sam Byford’s first-hand experience, it also doesn’t fit all that well when placed inside of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone One, the best iOS controller you can currently buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANcZVf"&gt;The Backbone One has a, for lack of a better word, backbone that connects each side of the controller. The iPhone 13 Pro’s camera bump causes the phone to rest unevenly while nested in the Backbone One, making it wobble during use. That’s not a huge issue in itself, aside from the fact that the phone is technically less secure in the controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CUUPJ"&gt;But he reported a few disconnect issues while playing, too. And if the device isn’t flat while connected via the controller’s Lightning jack, there’s reason to believe that it could be putting stress on the iPhone 13 Pro’s Lightning port, which may amount to a bigger problem over time. So, keep this in mind if you already have one of these controllers and expect a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Backbone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xux0sfkYNlBFKkOJJ_X76uRpLYs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874715/IMG_0225.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sam Byford&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A side angle of the iPhone 13 Pro fit into the Backbone One controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YU1B23"&gt;We’ve reached out to Backbone to comment on this issue. But this problem isn’t isolated to just this company. Presumably, there are several bespoke accessories, in and outside of the realm of gaming, made to fit iPhones and Android phones up to a certain level of thickness. But as mobile photography gets more advanced, the sensors and lenses built into phones will likely get larger, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnEfwf"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6jbBS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Docking a Surface Pen to your Surface Duo 2 phone will cost $65</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WyMvP5DuGsg6ky5Zp8t8PBo_Wzo=/0x250:3000x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69900827/Surface_Duo_2_with_Pen_under_embargo_until_September_22.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9XWxjW"&gt;Microsoft has a new phone of its own, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684814/microsoft-surface-duo-2-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt;, arriving October 21st — and if you buy an optional “Surface Duo 2 Pen Cover,” you’ll be able to magnetically dock and wirelessly charge the company’s optional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686095/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-haptics-features-price-release-date"&gt;$130 Surface Slim Pen 2 stylus&lt;/a&gt; and use it with the Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9PYcA"&gt;The need for a special cover &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688403/surface-pro-8-duo-studio-x-go-true-price-keyboard-pen-stylus-bundle"&gt;wasn’t quite made clear&lt;/a&gt; during the company’s presentation last week, nor a price or release date, but &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo-2-elusive-pen-cover-price-availability"&gt;Microsoft confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Windows Central &lt;/em&gt;today&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll cost $65 on October 21st. While that’s the same day the Surface Duo 2 is slated to launch, it strangely didn’t go up for pre-order alongside the phones, and still isn’t available to add to a cart now. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-duo-2-pen-cover%2F8P0W0GNK1WFT" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can find its product page here&lt;/a&gt;, with the Pen Cover listed as “Coming soon.” &lt;/p&gt;

It’s also listed as being compatible with the original Surface Slim Pen, but it’s not clear whether it docks or charges the older pen, or (hopefully) both. You can get it in both colors (it seems to blend quite nicely with the phone) and it’ll have a fabric lining to protect the finish of your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TTquPW"&gt;Microsoft says the original Surface Duo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690003/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-release-date"&gt;will get an update to Android 11&lt;/a&gt; by year’s end. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nokia’s new G50 is a $300 5G phone with a big battery and two years of OS upgrades</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-KxYIa3RB9oWPphcH1iu4V4w3Ic=/0x125:3000x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895204/Nokia_G50___Beauty_1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G50 has a triple rear camera system.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nokia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sK3V8q"&gt;Nokia has a new midrange phone coming to the US and a number of global markets. The new G50 costs $299 and has all the ingredients to be competitive as a midrange phone, with a 6.82-inch HD+ display, big battery, audio jack and 18W fast charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOnRac"&gt;This G-series phone is similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;Nokia X20&lt;/a&gt; that was announced back in April 2021, but the G50 has a bigger screen and battery and comes in a version specifically designed for the North American market (AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile). Unsurprisingly, it supports the slower 5G Sub 6, which means this phone will work on T-Mobile’s 5G network, but not on Verizon’s mmWave network, and will only get 4G reception on AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9lJF9"&gt;Like other 5G phones in the $300 range, the Nokia G50 is powered by the modest Snapdragon 480 chip, so don’t expect the fastest performance or smoothest gaming experience on this phone. It has 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, as well as a microSD slot in case you need to backup your photos or sideload an app. Compared to Motorola’s identically named &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;G50&lt;/a&gt;, the Nokia has a slightly bigger HD+ 6.82-inch display that is capable of 450 nits of brightness and has a v-shaped notch around its front 8-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xulu-7vTpb5_FiBSErLXKOC0beI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22870595/Nokia_G50_Emotional_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nokia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G50 comes in two colors, a blue and a pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k2WTe5"&gt;On the back of the Nokia G50 is a triple-camera array, arranged in a circle. You’ll probably use the 48-megapixel standard camera the most, while the 5-megapixel Ultrawide and 2-megapixel depth sensor cameras can bring some fun perspectives to your shots but will likely be of noticeably lower quality. Its front selfie camera also offers video stabilization to help sharpen your blurry Tik Tok videos and a Night Selfie mode to brighten your low-light selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJBrqy"&gt;According to HMD Global, the maker of Nokia phones, the Nokia G50 will ship with Android 11 and receive two years of OS upgrades and three years of monthly security updates. In other words, this budget phone won’t turn into a brick in a few years, which is good for the environment and for consumers who want to get more use out of their phones before upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32jfJ0"&gt;The Nokia G50 is preloaded with Spotify and a 30-day trial of ExpressVPN and is available in Ocean Blue or Midnight Sun. It’s available for preorder starting today, September 22nd, at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FNokia.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F22%2F22687760%2Fnokia-g50-phone-battery-android-upgrades" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia.com&lt;/a&gt; and will ship on September 30th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Surface Duo 2 has all the features that were missing the first time around</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z42YUkT_VnzI-6knHhQnGJ8r5lA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893260/Surface_Duo_2___Front___Back_under_embargo_until_September_22.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Surface Duo 2&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QgsWeg"&gt;Microsoft has officially announced the new Surface Duo 2, its second attempt at an Android-powered folding phone. The Duo 2 retains the head-turning design of the first-generation model, but it specifically addresses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;many of the complaints we had&lt;/a&gt;. This time around, Microsoft is putting a legit camera on it, supporting 5G, using a current processor, and is throwing in bigger screens — things that are all quite nice to have on expensive phones. Microsoft says the Duo 2 will be &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeSurfaceDuo2092221&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-duo-2%2F9408kgxp4xjl%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available starting on October 21st&lt;/a&gt; for $1,499.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tczJZJ"&gt;The Surface Duo 2, which is available in the same white color as the first-gen plus a new black option, has two 5.8-inch, 1344 x 1892 OLED displays connected by a hinge that allows you to open it like a book or prop it up like a tent. It’s a markedly different approach from what Samsung is doing with its folding phones, which have a single large screen that gets folded in half. Combined, the two Duo 2 displays measure 8.3 inches diagonally and both of them feature a faster 90Hz refresh rate. A slight curve on the screen allows it to be viewed when the Duo 2 is closed, showing you time and missed notifications. Covering the screens is Corning glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Am-qVTAAXoT0PrOda_FOFzF6bY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869965/Surface_Duo_2___Modes_under_embargo_until_September_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2 maintains the unique design of the first model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xtppzUsJYDXp1-B7atPOX1httEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869992/Surface_Duo_2_with_Pen_under_embargo_until_September_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screens have a slight curve that lets them be visible when the Duo 2 is closed — Microsoft is using it as a notification panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nmPlcG"&gt;Inside one half of the device is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor — a significant upgrade over the 855 chip that was in the first version. It also supports 5G connectivity, another upgrade from the 4G radio that was in the first Duo. Microsoft says it’s the thinnest 5G device on the market. Paired with the processor is 8GB of RAM (2GB more than the first gen) and between 128GB and 512GB of storage. Other hardware upgrades include NFC but no wireless charging, two things that were annoyingly omitted from the first Duo. Microsoft hasn’t specified how big the battery is, but it claims the usual line of “all day battery life.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo 2 has a triple rear camera system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hvqLI8"&gt;The original Surface Duo was laden with a single camera above the right screen, and frankly, it was terrible and one of the weakest points of the hardware. This time around, Microsoft has installed a proper three-camera system on the outside of the Duo 2, with a standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto camera system. All three cameras have 12-megapixel resolution, with the wide and telephoto lens also featuring optical image stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkgpXk"&gt;Like the prior Duo, the Duo 2 supports pen input with Microsoft’s line of Surface Pens. You can magnetically stick the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686095/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-haptics-features-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Slim Pen 2&lt;/a&gt; to the outside of the Duo 2 to keep it with you on the go and it will charge while it’s sitting there. (But again, no wireless charging for the phone itself.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OXqFrjBdDb6T-zzpYZZzhFNy74M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869954/Surface_Duo_2___Editing_under_embargo_until_September_22.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2 works with Microsoft’s new Surface Slim Pen 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ap0L9g"&gt;Of course, the main pitch with the Duo line of products is productivity, since it’s essentially two standard smartphones connected by a hinge. That’s not changing this year and Microsoft says it has come up with more optimizations for sharing information between the two screens and spreading a single app across them. The company says 150 games, including &lt;em&gt;Asphalt Legends 9&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Modern Combat 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dungeon Hunter 5&lt;/em&gt;, are optimized for using one screen as a controller while viewing the game itself on the other screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5TR4N7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to preorder the Surface Duo 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684018/microsoft-surface-duo-2-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iVixqE"&gt;But those promises were also made for the first Duo, and software support was where it really fell apart. Microsoft’s demos look impressive, but they did the first time around, too, so we’ll remain very skeptical until we’re able to test it out first hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KbD3a"&gt;The Duo 2 is running Android 11 at launch, even though the original Duo is still saddled with Android 10 and Microsoft didn’t indicate when it might get the update to 11.

    <title>The Google Pixel 6 Pro may have been leaked in a brief hands-on video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SAHQ3fry4N3AD_R8tjhn_Eu_z2g=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890456/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WVVTzX"&gt;Google got ahead of any possible news leaks about the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;announcing the phones&lt;/a&gt; back in August, including that they would run on the company’s long-in-development Tensor chip. But it’s possible that some leakers have recently got hold of an actual unit. A video posted to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1440385355258028032"&gt;Twitter by @thisistechtoday&lt;/a&gt; may be showing off a pre-production version of the Pixel 6 Pro, complete with its triple rear camera array. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOCKvP"&gt;Of course, Google hasn’t been coy about sharing what the device will look like — even installing &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/first-look-google-puts-pixel-6-and-6-pro-on-display-at-its-nyc-store"&gt;dummy units in its NYC store for people to ogle&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, the device that’s spun around in this short clip looks like what we’ve seen so far — the strange Google logo placeholder notwithstanding. The phone in this video appears to have a hole-punch selfie camera, and all of its buttons are located along its right edge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G1CaYO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I think this may be the first hands on video leak of a Google Pixel 6 Pro. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FYI: The logo would indicate that this is likely an early production test unit, so that means there may be some differences between what you see here and the actual production device. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/teampixel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#teampixel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/4QSvdktqA7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4QSvdktqA7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— M. Brandon Lee | THIS IS TECH TODAY (@thisistechtoday) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1440385355258028032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6hP7jt"&gt;Just like the Pixel 6 Pro renders that Google shared, the phone in this video appears to have a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0w_6uZBFl8F94sDwJAiydSFMAr4=/0x0:3840x2160/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:3840x2160):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755095/Pixel_6_Pro_Group_Image__Transparent_.png"&gt;metallic and glossy rail&lt;/a&gt; surrounding its raised camera bar, as opposed to the Pixel 6’s &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lGTDiRqYZ_v7B0qBMCPFTj6yxMo=/0x0:3840x2160/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:3840x2160):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755096/Pixel_6_Group_Image__Transparent_.png"&gt;darker, matte-textured &lt;/a&gt;rail. Admittedly, it’s tough to tell for sure in this footage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWDObJ"&gt;So while it isn’t as if we haven’t seen what the phone looks like, what’s notable in this video is that the display is powered on, which is an angle on the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro that we &lt;em&gt;haven’t&lt;/em&gt; seen much of, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664341/google-pixel-6-real-world-photos-october-19th-launch-date-rumor"&gt;outside of this new ad&lt;/a&gt;. Admittedly, though, it’s a rather boring glimpse, showing the same screen you see during the Android 12 setup process. The Pixel 6 Pro will have a 6.7-inch QHD+ screen with a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kA26HW"&gt;We still don’t know exactly when Google plans to fully take the wraps off the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro or when it will share prices and a release date. But it ought to be soon, perhaps sometime in October, if previous years are any indication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus says no 9T this year, 2022 flagship will run merged Oppo OS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ej-Aw0wIGriVZxekKUBKuHPgdzk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69881985/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0041_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;2021’s OnePlus 9.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KQLNEl"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has confirmed that the company doesn’t plan to release its traditional T-series device in the second half of this year. He also announced that next year’s OnePlus flagship phone would run on a newly unified operating system, following the company’s integration with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;fellow BBK Electronics subsidiary Oppo&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus announced it would be merging the codebases of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;Android-based OxygenOS operating system with Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt; in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piK8i5"&gt;This means we’re unlikely to see a OnePlus 9T following up this year’s OnePlus 9. Despite the similar names, the company’s T-series phones have offered significant upgrades over its flagships from earlier in the year. For example, the 8T had around double the charging speeds of the 8, while the 7T bumped the original 7 display to a higher 90Hz refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCVMSE"&gt;“This year we will not be launching a T-series product,” Lau said via a translator in a roundtable interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and other journalists. This will be the first year without a T-series device since OnePlus adopted the release schedule with the OnePlus 3T in 2016. Since then, like clockwork, OnePlus has released a new T-series phone in the latter half of each year, culminating in last year’s OnePlus 8T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qclhlz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This year we will not be launching a T-series product”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AL8dUt"&gt;In what is effectively a merger between OnePlus and Oppo, the two companies will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;unifying the underlying codebases of OxygenOS and Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt;. The two Android-based operating systems will continue to have their own branding and unique features, Lau said, but the code underpinning them will be the same, and they’ll be developed by a unified team. The way OnePlus describes it, the approach will result in an operating system that’s “fast and smooth” and “clean and lightweight” like OxygenOS, while also being “reliable” and “smart and feature-rich” like ColorOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sa1Iiz"&gt;Lau said the codebase integration of the two operating systems was completed in June, and that it’s already helping to allow for more frequent software updates. But we’ll have to wait until next year to see the first OnePlus flagship launch with the newly integrated operating system. It won’t just be new OnePlus phones getting the new OS — it will also come to OnePlus’s older devices is they’re still scheduled to receive support. These support periods include three major updates for flagship phones, two for most Nord devices, and one for Nord N phones. Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22443128"&gt;Oppo announced&lt;/a&gt; that the OnePlus 9 series will receive a beta of the new software in October, followed by the OnePlus 8 series in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUUm1X"&gt;OnePlus tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that integrating its operations with Oppo was necessary to make it more efficient, and would streamline its R&amp;amp;D resources “to support more products and work more efficiently.” As well as integrating the two company’s operating systems, OnePlus also said it would be integrating its Warp Charge fast charging standard with Oppo’s SuperVOOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Twy7Da"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/chinese-smartphone-giant-cuts-jobs-after-going-up-against-apple?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Oppo’s merger with OnePlus is creating redundancies, including within its ColorOS development unit, as the two BBK subsidiaries pool resources. As many as 20 percent of staff across some software and device teams are reportedly being cut, according to the report. The cuts are reportedly the result of Oppo expanding too rapidly in recent years, moving aggressively into new countries and product categories with big bets that haven’t payed off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmOB7c"&gt;During our briefing, however, which took place prior to the publication of &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report, OnePlus’s Lau played down the possibility of merger-related layoffs. “[Redundancies haven’t] been something that’s come up during the merger,” Lau said via a translator, “We have a focus on bringing together the OnePlus and Oppo teams to be able to bring together the strengths of both sides into the merged entity.”&lt;/p&gt;
