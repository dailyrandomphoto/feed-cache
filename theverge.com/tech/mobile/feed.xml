    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 3 is up to $500 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1vJ1e6XX8032Pqgdd0I-F7Qm4Qw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70200959/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_3.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rQ5Rvk"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 3 is the company’s lowest-priced foldable yet at its normal $999.99, but today you can get the trendy phone for way, way less than that. In an early &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796645/cyber-monday-2021-early-deals-sales-tech-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"&gt;Cyber Monday 2021 deal&lt;/a&gt;, the unlocked Z Flip 3 is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf5XF4x8a5W" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available from Best Buy for $599.99&lt;/a&gt; if you activate service on the device with your purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UglclJ"&gt;That’s a colossal $400 discount from the Flip 3’s regular price and brings it on par with something like the Pixel 6. Google’s phone is terrific, but it certainly doesn’t have the cool factor of a folding screen. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers can both get that price for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Ya367"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10890426"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1nrHXB"&gt;In certain cases, you can save even more. Activating a new line of service on T-Mobile / Sprint brings the price down to $499.99 for the unlocked Z Flip 3. If you can deal with some carrier bloatware, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf5XSZjbTWp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Verizon model&lt;/a&gt; is also discounted to $499.99 if you’re eligible for an upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lllbdG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Cyber Monday deals happening now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22796645/cyber-monday-2021-early-deals-sales-tech-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KxuzHf"&gt;Take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review of the Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll find that my colleague Dan Seifert praised Samsung’s first truly mainstream foldable for its excellent screen, snappy performance, water resistance, and compact size when folded up. If there’s one weak point of the phone, its battery life is merely average among the competition. But there’s no denying the sleek look of this thing — and that cream color still looks just as fantastic now as when Samsung announced it, though the deal applies to the black, green, and lavender colors if those are more your style.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new A03 and A03 Core look like big bargains but we can’t quite tell yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EyhN7xDJsWS_BikbqX1GQu59JA=/0x27:650x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70195939/samsung_galaxy_ao03_core.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A03 Core has a 6.5-inch display. | Photo by Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v6gbQA"&gt;Samsung has quietly added two new devices to its entry-level A-series lineup: the Galaxy A03 and Galaxy A03 Core. And while both devices don’t yet have a set price, we can predict that they’ll both be pretty affordable, considering how Samsung prices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;the rest of its A-series devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4wU0s7lcMGKNc940UX4SlKDZqjg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23044852/samsung_galaxy_a023_standard.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A03 has a dual rear camera with a 48MP main sensor.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KhODGa"&gt;An infographic posted on &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/infographic-the-galaxy-a03-is-upgrading-core-mobile-features-to-make-your-day-to-day-more-convenient"&gt;Samsung’s site&lt;/a&gt; outlines the A03’s specs (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/26/samsung-quietly-launches-galaxy-a03-w-48mp-camera-5000mah-battery-more/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The device comes with a dual rear camera with a 48MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, which helps the camera focus on the main subject of the photo rather than giving you a different ultrawide or zoomed in perspective. Meanwhile, the front of the device comes with a waterdrop notch containing a 5MP selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIQK8L"&gt;The A03 sports a 6.5-inch HD Plus Infinity-V display, and a 5,000mAh battery. In terms of performance, it comes with an unspecified octa-core 1.6GHz chipset, as well as options for 3GB or 4GB of RAM and 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB of internal storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bTen8LmAMdC8L7Q7TchYiYigev8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23044615/samsung_a03_back.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A03 Core comes with an 8MP camera on its rear.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nkkMYk"&gt;Details for the separate Galaxy A03 Core can also be found on &lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/mediaresources/galaxy_a03_core/techspecs"&gt;Samsung’s website&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike the standard A03, it doesn’t have a fancy infographic. As its name implies, it seems like the A03 Core is a stripped-down version of the standard Galaxy A03.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4rS1x"&gt;The device has a single 8MP camera on its rear and a 5MP selfie camera, packing 2GB of RAM and 32GB of built-in storage. Aside from that, the device also has a 5,000mAh battery, and the same 6.5-inch display size as the A03. Like the base A03, Samsung has yet to reveal which company manufactures the A03 Core’s octa-core chipset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZTAeu"&gt;The Galaxy A03 will be available in blue, red, and black, while the Galaxy A03 Core just comes in blue and black. Samsung doesn’t provide any details on pricing, but judging by the A03s’ £139 (around $185 USD) price tag — which was &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/uk/samsung-adds-the-new-galaxy-a03s-to-the-galaxy-a-series"&gt;released outside of US markets in September&lt;/a&gt; — the A03 and A03 Core will likely have similar budget-friendly prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRLxHK"&gt;It’s unclear which version of Android these phones will ship with, or when Samsung will officially release the devices. Samsung also doesn’t explicitly state where the A03 and A03 Core will be available, but there’s a possibility that they’ll both reach the US, considering that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;the A02s and other A-series phones did earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and AT&amp;T offer to temporarily lower 5G’s power to avoid aircraft interference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z8gtqRmH0dQZtqHZHA7XQnJNd2c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70189166/DSCF1198-3.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5FdF8n"&gt;As the Federal Aviation Administration continues examining whether mid-band 5G spectrum could pose a risk to aircraft safety systems, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have offered to dial back the power coming from 5G cell towers for a period of six months to ease any industry concerns. Both carriers are preparing to launch crucial upgrades to their respective 5G networks using spectrum acquired in the C-band auction. This will lead to more robust 5G connectivity and faster speeds compared to the base-level 5G experience that Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T currently offer today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nq2jFU"&gt;In early November, both companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;agreed to push back the rollout by an additional month&lt;/a&gt; to January 2022. In a letter sent to the FCC today, they made clear that they’ll be moving forward with the planned mid-band 5G launch at that time. “This spectrum will be the backbone of our 5G networks for many years to come,” the companies said in the letter, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-verizon-propose-5g-limits-to-break-air-safety-standoff-11637778722?page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZwhKz"&gt;In support of the technology, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T point to years of research about potential interference and note that mid-band 5G hasn’t wreaked havoc for flights in other countries where mid-band 5G is already in place. “While we remain confident that 5G poses no risk to air safety, we are also sensitive to the Federal Aviation Administration’s desire for additional analysis of this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnmOzh"&gt;To help prevent a drawn-out conflict with the FAA, the two carriers say they’ll voluntarily take extra precautions through July 2022 “to minimize energy coming from 5G base stations — both nationwide and to an even greater degree around public airports and heliports.” That should be enough to “allay concerns about radio altimeter performance,” the companies said, while also maintaining strong performance for wireless customers. Altimeters can assist aircraft operators during landings, especially when dealing with poor visibility conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9sqaC"&gt;It’s not yet clear whether the proposal will be accepted by the FAA, which has warned pilots of the possibility that “interference from 5G transmitters and other technology could cause certain safety equipment to malfunction, requiring them to take mitigating action that could affect flight operations.” After July 6th, both carriers say they’ll set everything back to normal “unless credible evidence exists that real-world interference would occur if the mitigations were relaxed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig6lkc"&gt;“Our use of this spectrum will dramatically expand the reach and capabilities of the nation’s next-generation 5G networks, advancing US leadership, and bringing enormous benefits to consumers and the US economy,” Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T claimed in their joint letter sent to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746223/net-neutrality-fcc-jessica-rosenworcel-chair-gigi-sohn-ajit-pai-broadband"&gt;FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Protect your Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro with these unique cases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YoTIz4IU834I471hvdINIIqfYjo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70187556/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are big, slippery phones that can benefit from a good case&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w240DX"&gt;As wonderful as the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are, their smooth glass backs are extremely slippery, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Dan Seifert mentioned in his review&lt;/a&gt;. And the official &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6_case?hl=en-US"&gt;Google frosted recycled plastic cases&lt;/a&gt; are not great solutions, thanks to their cheap feel and still slippery finish. So, where does that leave you, the new owner of Google’s flagship phone? You can’t just leave your pristine new phone naked. That’s why we’ve rounded up some third-party cases that befit the Pixel’s unique design, whether you’re looking for a case for yourself or gifting a case to a new Pixel 6 owner. Just be aware that cases may be out of stock or slow to ship, so you’ll need a lot of luck and patience to find your ideal case this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly switching to its own iPhone modem design in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro (left) and Pro Max (right)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/coOaqfrqsJvwUlP4fi3eX8G2Ipo=/0x0:2031x1354/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70186370/vpavic_210916_untitled_0058.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rM51ne"&gt;Apple is planning to partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for the production of its own 5G modems for future iPhones, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-taps-TSMC-to-build-custom-iPhone-5G-modem-in-2023"&gt;new report in &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is said to be planning to use TSMC’s 4nm process node, which hasn’t yet been deployed for any commercial product; the modem is apparently being designed and tested at 5nm before moving to mass production in 2023 at 4nm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYPkpa"&gt;Apple’s switch to modems of its own design is widely expected to happen in 2023, and TSMC is the natural manufacturing partner. Qualcomm, which is the dominant player in the industry and produces modem components for the entire iPhone 13 lineup, recently said that it expects to account for just 20 percent of iPhone modem orders in two years’ time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HhiBJg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="IAG1ZF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition"&gt;Apple bought Intel’s 5G modem division in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, foreshadowing the eventual switch. Earlier that year Qualcomm and Apple agreed to end a costly modem technology patent dispute, with Qualcomm receiving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525962/qualcomm-apple-settlement-4-5-billion-dollars-patent"&gt;more than $4 billion&lt;/a&gt; as part of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60SHji"&gt;TSMC is the manufacturer of all iPhone A-series processors and M1 systems-on-chip for Mac computers. According to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;, there are hundreds of TSMC engineers based in Cupertino to work with Apple’s chip development team. 2022 iPhone SoCs will reportedly use TSMC’s 4nm process, and some iPad models are said to be adopting 3nm processors in 2023. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;says the iPhone will make the 3nm jump “as soon as” next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 10 is coming to the six-year-old Fairphone 2</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y9aouK"&gt;Sustainable smartphone manufacturer Fairphone has released an Android 10 update for the six-year-old Fairphone 2, a device that originally launched with Android 5 in 2015. The update is in beta for the time being, but &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F11%2FFairphone-to-upgrade-six-year-old-Fairphone-2-to-Android-10-providing-users-with-unprecedented-seven-years-of-support.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F23%2F22798512%2Ffairphone-2-android-10-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; it hopes to release a stable version early next year. Alongside it, the company also plans to start beta testing an Android 11 update for the 2019 Fairphone 3 and 2020 Fairphone 3 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmzavO"&gt;Although getting an Android update two years after its original release wouldn’t normally be cause for celebration, it’s basically unheard of for an Android manufacturer to still be updating a handset six years after its original release. Only Apple comes close to these kinds of support periods and recently released its latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility"&gt;iOS 15 update for the 2015 iPhone 6S&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j3avgV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Beta testing of Android 10 for Fairphone 2 starts today, with the aim to be publicly available in early 2022. But the good news doesn’t end there – for Fairphone 3 and 3+ users, beta testing for Android 11 also starts this week.&lt;/p&gt;— Fairphone (@Fairphone) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fairphone/status/1463138305176973323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="98F8Or"&gt;Meanwhile, Samsung offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;three generational Android updates&lt;/a&gt; for its recent phones. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones%2Cpixel-pixel-pro-phones%2Cpixel-a-a-xl-xl-a-a-g-a-g"&gt;Google has promised&lt;/a&gt; to provide security updates for its latest Pixel 6 devices for five years and Android version updates for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaCOPo"&gt;Offering updates for this length of time isn’t easy, as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fen%2F2020%2F06%2F18%2Ffairphone-2-gets-android-9%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F23%2F22798512%2Ffairphone-2-android-10-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fairphone explained&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post when it released its public beta of Android 9 running on the Fairphone 2. One of the bigger challenges is that the chipset manufacturer Fairphone uses, Qualcomm, only offers support for its processors for a certain number of years. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/qualcomm-promises-three-years-of-android-updates-for-its-entire-soc-lineup/"&gt;As of last December&lt;/a&gt;, Qualcomm supports its chips for three major OS updates and four years of security updates. However, once this support ends, manufacturers like Fairphone are on their own if they want to continue keeping their phones updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNtusy"&gt;For the Fairphone 2’s Android 10 update, the company says it collaborated with its community to speed up the update process. Together with help from Indian software developer Bharath Ravi Prakash, Fairphone says the Fairphone 2’s Android 10 update took just 10 months to develop, compared to 18 months for Android 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQiaZt"&gt;Today’s news will be welcome for anyone still using a Fairphone 2 who wants to benefit from Android 10 features like gesture navigation and support for an OS-level dark mode. But it’s also reassuring for anyone thinking about picking up its latest phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716194/fairphone-4-review"&gt;Fairphone 4&lt;/a&gt;, which the company hopes to keep supported for six years until 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tile is selling its Bluetooth tracking business to Life360 for $205 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple, Tile, and Samsung all offer smart Bluetooth trackers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UaLxMRoUeTodLOxMiwLgqQ4HqGg=/291x146:1835x1175/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180433/ajohnson_210702_4659_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Me6qU1"&gt;Tile popularized marking items and tracking them from your phone with its small Bluetooth tags, but suddenly faces more competition from giants like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung. The company that started out of an incubator &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/tile-grabs-2-6m-via-selfstarter-for-its-lost-property-finding-bluetooth-tags-plus-app/"&gt;and crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/life360-to-acquire-tile-creating-the-world-leader-in-finding-and-location-solutions-301430364.html"&gt;has announced it will be acquired by Life360&lt;/a&gt;, which calls itself a “leading family safety platform.” The deal is valued at $205 million and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3rxcai"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Subscribers to Tile and Life360 services can expect  some new benefits in their packages&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HUtvVv"&gt;Tile has developed its product line over the years with a variety of different trackers and partnerships with other companies to use its technology. It also has a subscription service, Tile Premium, with extra features, battery replacements, and insurance against potential losses. However, the game may have changed once Apple and Google started building their own item-locating features into iPhones and Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Life360 app screenshots" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C7nIpwT2b__Yr89DXqzICIXjBUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23036284/life360_app.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Life360 app screenshots&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="btPUOi"&gt;Life360 bills itself as an overall family safety app, with location sharing between family members, crash detection, and other features. Over the summer, it announced that it has over 1 million paying customers and reported its valuation had crossed $1 billion. It also acquired another item locating hardware startup, Jiobit, which makes cellular-connected trackers for kids and pets.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYn9dH"&gt;Life360 expects the deal will increase the global footprint for both companies, Tile’s non-Bluetooth Finding Network, and create a larger combined subscriber base. Currently listed on the stock exchange in Australia, Life360 says it has plans for a “potential dual listing in the US” next year.&lt;/p&gt;

We’ll be bundling Tile devices as part of our Membership plans, and Tile will offer Life360 Membership benefits to its customers. We’ll also start work on integrating our technologies so Tile devices, Jiobit wearables, and Life360 app customers will show up on a unified map – people, pets, and things all in one place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="CG7WTI"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;launched the $29 AirTag earlier this yea&lt;/a&gt;r that also uses Bluetooth for tracking, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;adds precise Ultra Wideband tech and deep integration with the iOS platform&lt;/a&gt; that Tile just doesn’t have. And there are indications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540625/google-find-my-device-android-spot-location-network"&gt;Google won’t be left behind&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung launched its own pocket-sized Bluetooth trackers, and Amazon is building on Echo devices to enable tracking via the Sidewalk network (Tile announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424837/tile-amazon-sidewalk-support-release-date-2021-bluetooth-tracking-airtags"&gt;a partnership with Amazon that began in June&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRA5R4"&gt;Tile recently announced its first ultra-wideband enabled tracker, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716870/tile-ultra-bluetooth-tracker-uwb-ar-early-2022"&gt;the Tile Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, which will launch next year and has the advantage of working with both mobile platforms to provide much more precise tracking. Still, as Tile vice president and general counsel Kirsten Daru &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21070812/sonos-tile-basecamp-popsocket-congressional-hearing-amazon-google-apple-competition"&gt;said to Congress last year about Apple&lt;/a&gt;, “You might be the best soccer team, but you’re playing against a team that owns the stadium, the ball, and the league, and can change the rules when it wants.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tile&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Tile tracker lineup&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nMLurb"&gt;Hulls has a more optimistic vision of that reality in mind, as described in his blog post, pointing out that Apple’s introduction of AirPods expanded the market for all Bluetooth headsets much more than a single pioneer like Jawbone could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YVH9x"&gt;Tile says it will continue to operate as an independent entity with the same team, led by current CEO CJ Prober. Prober will join Life360’s board of directors and says in the announcement, “This acquisition not only brings together two incredible teams with complementary missions and values, it paves the way for us to jointly build the world’s leading solutions for peace of mind and safety. “&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC approves $6 billion Verizon-Tracfone acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S2GUm5vwQHbxbIjEWs02y1pEK5Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180043/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ib4gJG"&gt;On Monday, the Federal Communications Commission voted to approve Verizon Wireless’ purchase of Tracfone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435980/verizon-tracfone-acquisition-prepaid-phones-budget"&gt;in a deal worth more than $6 billion&lt;/a&gt;, positioning Verizon to become one of the largest prepaid service providers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQJqTB"&gt;Tracfone is the largest reseller of wireless devices in the US and maintains over 20 million subscribers with more than 90,000 retail locations. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621905/verizon-tracfone-merger-lifeline-fcc-public-interest"&gt;Verizon’s Tracfone acquisition&lt;/a&gt; combines the largest mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) with the largest wireless provider in the country. When Verizon first proposed the deal last September, the company said that the acquisition would bolster Tracfone’s networks while making low-income wireless services more competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wN31HY"&gt;“After rigorous review, the Commission found that the transaction, as modified by Verizon’s enforceable commitments, will make Verizon and Tracfone stronger providers of prepaid and Lifeline services,” the FCC said in a Monday press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MItMBV"&gt;It’s unclear which commissioners voted to approve the deal. Currently, there are only two Democrats and two Republicans serving at the agency, meaning at least one Democrat would have been required to approve the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GoxN4U"&gt;As part of its decision to approve the deal, the FCC said that it would be requiring Verizon to make several consumer protection agreements with the agency. First, Verizon promised to continue its participation in the Lifeline subsidy program for at least seven years. The company must also provide “cost-effective” 5G devices and services to Lifeline customers. Verizon must also submit semi-annual reports describing how its compliance meets these restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zJIEE"&gt;Last Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-requires-consumer-protection-measures-for-verizon-acquisition-of-tracfone"&gt;the California Public Utility Commission&lt;/a&gt; approved the deal, mandating similar restrictions to those imposed by the FCC. However, the California regulators required Verizon’s Tracfone to participate in the Lifeline program for at least 20 years. Customers will also receive free 5G-compatible devices and should not see wireless plan price increases over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em4Fas"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is updating its Snapdragon branding to try and simplify its chip names</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRRIycVMvXNE5EBFFqLOL92m2h0=/44x0:644x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70178166/eye_688.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Qualcomm’s teaser for its new branding scheme | Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dwFiJC"&gt;Qualcomm has &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2021/11/22/welcome-new-era-snapdragon"&gt;announced some key changes&lt;/a&gt; to how it brands its Snapdragon chips, including a shift away from the three-digit numbering system it’s been using to differentiate between its products for years. The news comes ahead of the company’s expected next-gen flagship chip debut at the Snapdragon Tech Summit on November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pWRjX"&gt;To start, Snapdragon will now exist as a standalone brand, separate from the “Qualcomm” brand (which won’t be showing up as much on its chips). It’s a direction the company has started moving in earlier this year (the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550723/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-cpu-ai-performance-mwc-2021"&gt;Snapdragon 888 Plus badge&lt;/a&gt;, for example, notably lacked the word “Qualcomm”), but today’s news solidifies that plan going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-4_slc_dklqiNlCeBUSKf8UNpVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23034691/Screen_Shot_2021_11_22_at_11.46.46_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The already “Qualcomm”-less Snapdragon 888 Plus icon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HDVufZ"&gt;But the biggest change might be in how the company handles actually naming its semiconductor products. For years, Qualcomm has labeled its chips with three-digit names, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Snapdragon 480&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995714/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-chip-affordable-5g-phones-processor-low-price"&gt;Snapdragon 765&lt;/a&gt;, or Snapdragon 888. The first number broadly informed customers how powerful the chip was (with the 8-series chips serving as flagships, while 4-series models were for entry-level products). The second number typically indicated annual generational releases (going from a Snapdragon 865 to an 875), while changes in the third number generally showed more minor updates (like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995714/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-chip-affordable-5g-phones-processor-low-price"&gt;Snapdragon 765G&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/11/21252114/qualcomm-snapdragon-768g-5g-processor-765g-improvements-cpu-gpu-update"&gt;Snapdragon 768G&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0SHGj2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Qualcomm was running out of numbers to use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="idLfJk"&gt;The problem, though, is that in addition to being slightly jargony and confusing to keep track of, Qualcomm is also simply running out of numbers in its naming scheme. The 8-series lineup hit Snapdragon 888 last year, the 7-series is already at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350079/qualcomm-snapdragon-780g-888-5g-mobile-chipset-phone-android"&gt;Snapdragon 780&lt;/a&gt;, and the 6-series is already on the brink with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22740748/qualcomm-snapdragon-695-778-plus-480-680-5g-4g-smartphone-chips"&gt;Snapdragon 695&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyucHw"&gt;Going forward, though, Qualcomm says that it’ll be shifting to “a single-digit series and generation number, aligning with other product categories,” starting with the upcoming announcement of its next 8-series flagship (which had previously been expected to be called the Snapdragon 898, based on Qualcomm’s old pattern). Qualcomm already uses a generational naming scheme for its Snapdragon PC processors, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020"&gt;Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451392/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-arm-processor"&gt;Snapdragon 7c Gen 2&lt;/a&gt;, too, so the change isn’t coming out of nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QPaqkX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lx6qXW9FP18?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YumLEV"&gt;Unfortunately, Qualcomm isn’t actually &lt;em&gt;saying&lt;/em&gt; what that new branding scheme will be, although that announcement is expected to come at the Snapdragon Tech Summit next week. Instead, the company has published a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx6qXW9FP18"&gt;vague hype reel&lt;/a&gt; that features the number eight a lot to tease out the new, top-secret naming scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nP3NLL"&gt;In addition to the as-yet-unrevealed naming scheme, Qualcomm also announced a few other details about its Snapdragon branding plan. Going forward, the company plans to emphasize the use of gold to indicate top-tier flagship products. It’s going to stop explicitly calling out 5G on chips, noting that “5G has become ubiquitous” across its product lineup and will be “a given.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MediaTek’s new Dimensity 9000 flagship could compete with Qualcomm’s top-tier Snapdragon chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4slEI1ao4vAnpgNt-xQBvC0A7xI=/121x0:1654x1022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70162443/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_5.12.45_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="goAfye"&gt;MediaTek has just announced its latest flagship processor: the Dimensity 9000, the company’s most powerful chip ever that looks like it should be able to go head to head with the best chips that more popular competitors like Qualcomm and Samsung offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZACaL"&gt;Where previous top-tier Dimensity chips (like last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartphones/dimensity-1000-series"&gt;Dimensity 1000)&lt;/a&gt; were still less powerful than contemporaries like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 or Samsung’s Exynos 2100, the new Dimensity 9000 is coming out of the gate to make a case for 2022 Android flagships. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hd9pC8mvi0gT5J0qduWPN2LjCsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025826/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_5.14.00_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7kU3pO"&gt;The new Dimensity 9000 is the first mobile chip to be built on TSMC’s 4nm process, in addition to using Arm’s new v9 architecture. It’s also the first announcement CPU to use Arm’s new core designs: a single Cortex-X2 performance core clocked at 3.05GHz, three Cortex-A710 cores at 2.85GHz, and four Cortex-A510 efficiency cores at 1.8GHz. The GPU, meanwhile, is a 10-core Arm Mali-G710, along with MediaTek’s fifth-generation APU with six total cores for AI processing (which the company says offers four times the performance and power efficiency compared to its previous generation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sldTPx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first 4nm smartphone processor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4IHP3V"&gt;The new 18-bit Imagiq Gen 7 ISP claims to be the world’s first chip to be capable of capturing a 320-megapixel image (assuming your phone has a sensor that can shoot at that level), capable of transferring data at 9 gigapixels per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SL4KM"&gt;As one might expect for a modern smartphone chip, the Dimensity 9000 offers an onboard 5G modem with support for the 3GPP’s Release 16 specification. Notably, though, the new chip still lags behind competitors by only offering built-in sub-6GHz 5G support, without the faster mmWave standard. The Dimensity 9000 does claim to be the first smartphone to support Bluetooth 5.3 and will work with Wi-Fi 6E, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hz0lq3"&gt;It’s likely that MediaTek won’t be alone for long when it comes to using the latest Arm technologies — Qualcomm, for example, is widely expected to announce a successor to its Snapdragon 888 chipset at its annual Snapdragon Tech Summit on November 30th. But even if MediaTek finds that the Dimensity 9000 is merely in the same weight class as whatever Qualcomm announces this year, instead of a leap ahead, that’s a big win for MediaTek, which has largely lagged behind until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSRCZ1"&gt;MediaTek has long been an also-ran when it comes to major Android devices, but the Dimensity 9000 shows that it’s finally looking to really compete. The question now is whether phone manufacturers are ready to join it. &lt;/p&gt;
