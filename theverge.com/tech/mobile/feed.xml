    <title>TCL’s Fold ‘n Roll concept transforms a 6.87-inch phone into a 10-inch tablet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tvGy1RXa0aBF2FkOb_d4TjLdFVM=/179x0:1822x1095/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125577/Fold__n_Roll_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s concept uses a folding hinge and extendable mechanism to expand from phone to tablet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="csIn7W"&gt;TCL is once again teasing a foldable phone concept — and it’s a Frankenstein’s monster of some previously showcased flexible concepts. Called Fold ‘n Roll, it combines the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18237259/tcl-foldable-phone-prototype-video-dragonhinge-mwc-2019"&gt;“dragonhinge” technology&lt;/a&gt; with an extendable display panel. The result is a 6.87-inch phone that can expand to an 8.85-inch phablet size or fully extend to a 10-inch tablet. Outside of that, the company isn’t offering any other detailed information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P58r4i"&gt;TCL says it’s “still exploring the technical specifications” of this type of device, which doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence that the Fold n’ Roll will hit the market anytime soon. But TCL did say it plans to launch some kind of foldable phone before the end of 2021. The company has offered no shortage of foldable display concepts; most recently, it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;several to show off&lt;/a&gt; at this year’s virtual CES. But there’s a long distance between creating concepts and turning them into mass-market products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Ha5Xj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10446091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fU3Lng"&gt;Still, TCL might be in a good position to address a gap in the rollable market: affordable devices. Flexing, rolling phones are mostly reserved for the high end of the market right now, and TCL may be well-positioned to offer a less costly option. Samsung has hinted at a lower-cost flexible device coming soon, but until then, its current &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; options are still very pricey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrdhAn"&gt;LG’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;rollable concept&lt;/a&gt; may have been destined for a flagship device, but with the manufacturer’s exit from the smartphone business, we’ll never know if that tech might have trickled down to a midrange device. If it is TCL’s intention to offer something more affordable in the space, then there’s certainly some room to jump in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL aims to build a better budget phone with the 20 Pro 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lCZilEyPsfqjlhmV6PBSvFSapXY=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124944/TCL_20_Pro_5G_design_14.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G offers a 6.67-inch screen and 48-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YetCgh"&gt;TCL has announced the rest of its 20-series lineup, with the 20 Pro 5G leading the way. Along with the 20L and 20L Plus, the phone joins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219101/tcl-20-5g-20-se-android-phone-price-specs"&gt;two devices announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; at CES, the TCL 20 5G and 20 SE, all of which prominently feature the company’s display technology. TCL says the 20 Pro 5G and 20S (a regional variant of the 20L Plus) will come to the US this summer, though the company hasn’t confirmed prices yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lk7kQb"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G offers the most advanced specs of the bunch, with some refinements over last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257398/tcl-10-pro-review-release-date-specs-features-camera-screen"&gt;good-not-great 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It offers a 6.67-inch 1080p OLED with HDR10 support and includes the latest generation of TCL’s NXTVISION technology to identify on-screen content and adjust color, contrast, and sharpness accordingly. The 20 Pro 5G uses a Snapdragon 750G chipset — a step up from the 10 Pro’s 600-series processor — with 6GB RAM, ships with Android 11, and offers a 4,500mAh battery. Sub-6GHz 5G is supported, but TCL says it can adapt to include other 5G bands depending on the carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1HbzjVkiVB0lvVWnta7m8ROdjbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441810/TCL_20_Pro_5G_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 20 Pro 5G will come to the US this summer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PNeHDG"&gt;The phone’s main camera uses a 48-megapixel sensor with a small but important addition: optical image stabilization. It’s a feature that should help reduce blur in lower-light conditions, and it wasn’t offered on any of last year’s 10-series models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBhCb0"&gt;The standard wide camera is accompanied by a 16-megapixel ultrawide, 5-megapixel macro, 2-megapixel depth-sensing chip, and 32-megapixel selfie camera. For biometric unlock, the 20 Pro includes an in-display fingerprint sensor. We’re pleased to report that the 3.5mm headphone jack remains, and a microSD card slot is available for expansion on the 256GB of built-in storage. The 20 Pro 5G goes on sale tomorrow in the UK, Italy, and Portugal for €549 (about $655).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C9Qmm2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10444791"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h8XOQi"&gt;The TCL 20L and 20L Plus are more budget-oriented devices. They both offer a 6.67-inch 1080p LCD, a 5,000mAh battery, and a Snapdragon 662 processor. The 20L offers 4GB of RAM in its base model, while the Plus model starts at 6GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnwNfh"&gt;The 20L Plus also features a 64-megapixel main camera, while the 20L includes a 48-megapixel main sensor; both devices include an 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, 2-megapixel depth sensor, and 16-megapixel selfie camera. Both phones also use circular polarization display technology, so that the screen is visible from any angle when viewing it with polarized sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekN725"&gt;The 20L and 20L Plus go on sale tomorrow in the UK, Italy, and Portugal, starting at €229 and €269, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ0clq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next year’s iPhones will have 48-megapixel cameras and no mini option: Kuo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iWq6kGonFQK3rK2AwFJRrC7OjRo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123372/vpavic_4279_20201107_0094.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1evF1E"&gt;The 2022 iPhone lineup will feature substantial changes to the camera system, according to analyst Ming-chi Kuo in an investor note reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2022-iphones-no-mini-upgraded-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/14/kuo-48mp-camera-with-8k-support-coming-to-iphone-in-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo says the high-end iPhones — presumably the Pro range — will use a larger 48-megapixel sensor for the primary camera. Separately, the analyst suggests that 2023 iPhones may start to use Face ID sensors under the screen as a way to get rid of the notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnH08t"&gt;48-megapixel sensors have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/22/18192579/honor-view-20-48-megapixel-camera-review"&gt;common in Android phones for years&lt;/a&gt;, but this component will reportedly be larger than most. It’ll be a 1/1.3-inch sensor with a pixel size of 1.25µm, according to Kuo. That’s smaller than the 1.7µm pixels in the iPhone 12 Pro Max, but Kuo says that the equivalent pixel size will be more like 2.5µm when the sensor is used for 12-megapixel images. Kuo also expects the higher-resolution sensor to enable 8K video capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FZVE5e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple may ditch the iPhone mini in 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwCn04"&gt;The 2022 iPhone lineup is going to see a reduction in screen size options, Kuo says; there won’t be a 5.4-inch mini any more, and Apple will stick to the 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays on other models. The mini has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;not sold to Apple’s expectations&lt;/a&gt;, with the company said to have overestimated demand and cut production orders. The 2021 lineup, however, is expected to keep the same screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDY4ZP"&gt;Finally, Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2023-iphones-under-display-face-id/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone will begin to use an under-display Face ID system in 2023. Kuo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;previously claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Apple will replace the Face ID notch with a hole-punch camera in some models from next year, and that 2023 will also see under-display fingerprint scanners come to the iPhone. It’s not clear exactly which technologies will make it out when, or in which combination.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US carriers have thankfully abandoned at least one bad plan for RCS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qR0YepDCoxN1VkapUXCRiSdAW6o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69122020/VRG_ILLO_2411_Google_Messaging_3.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span data-author="-1"&gt;GIF by Garret Beard and William Joel / The Verge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ppkPbJ"&gt;According to the telecom industry news site &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ossbsscx/verizon-atandt-t-mobile-blow-rcs-launch/d/d-id/768729"&gt;Light Reading, the big three US carriers are walking away from&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;Cross Carrier Messaging Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. The CCMI was meant to be a joint effort to promote RCS, the next-generation messaging standard designed to replace SMS. But while that might seem like bad news on the face of it, what it actually means is that carriers have given up on a bad plan that would have been bad for consumers. Whether or not they will replace it with a &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;plan remains, as ever with RCS, to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUOqAt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;CCMI was launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and by all indications was a joint effort that was spearheaded by Sprint. It initially seemed like a mixed bag of news. At the time, any effort by carriers to support proper cross-compatibility in RCS was a good sign. But the bad part was the consortium planned on creating an Android app themselves for messaging features. If you’ve ever used an app designed by a major US carrier, you know that’s a recipe for a bad experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaoIQK"&gt;Google was not part of the CCMI announcement, either, which was very strange given that Google is by far the biggest booster for the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTsU3N"&gt;However, after that announcement there was precious little information or movement. All the carriers seemed too busy hyping up 5G to give any real attention to the CCMI. Plus, T-Mobile was barreling down the path towards acquiring Sprint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gq804x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The CCMI promised a custom Android app from the carriers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dPxnpm"&gt;That acquisition happened and the one carrier that seemed enthusiastic for CCMI was subsumed into another. Then, last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;T-Mobile announced a huge deal with Google&lt;/a&gt; that included switching Android phones over to Android Messages as the default RCS/SMS app. The writing was on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plPW8g"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt; reached out to the third-party vendor, Synchronoss&lt;/a&gt;, that was originally going to handle the back-end logistics for the CCMI app (RCS can be run through a carrier’s server, Google’s server, or a third-party server). But while Synchronoss’ comment was noncommittal, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are now just telling it like it is. Here’s what Verizon told &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KQ9F9S"&gt;The owners of the Cross Carrier Messaging Initiative decided to end the joint venture effort. However, the owners remain committed to enhancing the messaging experience for customers including growing the availability of RCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4xjEne"&gt;Reached for comment by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T gave us a nearly identical statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9Kyk1"&gt;The rollout for RCS worldwide — and especially in the US — has been terribly slow and even more terribly confusing. Phones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563641/pixel-3a-t-mobile-rcs-chat-rollout-broken-encryption"&gt;should be compatible weren’t&lt;/a&gt;, carriers that promised their RCS would interoperate with others didn’t build those systems, and Apple continued to stay absolutely silent on whether it would support RCS (and it continues to stay silent to this day). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIanVz"&gt;However, Google has plodded along with its plan, making piece-by-piece efforts to broaden RCS adoption. It made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964477/googles-rcs-chat-android-rollout-us-ccmi-texting-sms"&gt;RCS available to anybody on any carrier if they used Android Messages&lt;/a&gt; as their SMS app. It cut that deal with T-Mobile. It has even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"&gt;begun testing end-to-end-encryption over RCS inside Android messages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBubJg"&gt;I will be the first in line to tell you that the rollout for RCS took what should have been a coordinated six-month effort that was a win for both carriers and Google and turned it into a multi-year slog that didn’t help anybody, least of all consumers. But the end of the CCMI is a sign that carriers might just be implementing more consumer-friendly RCS policies, not that they’re walking away entirely. T-Mobile made that deal with Google instead. Will all AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon continue to drag their feet on RCS? Almost definitely. But at least they won’t be foisting a carrier-made app on every Android user in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five things to consider before you sign up for T-Mobile Home Internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1TZIzJqFNRIgNYCXWaFZO0zeUIU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69119429/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s 5G home internet may sound like a tempting alternative to Big Cable.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0MLEl6"&gt;After a long early life in a pilot program, T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;5G home internet service&lt;/a&gt; has finally arrived. The bar for decent, reasonably priced internet service in the US is embarrassingly low, so T-Mobile’s terms might sound like a dream: $60 per month, no contract, no installation appointment, no equipment rental fees, and no data caps. It’s a service that’s very much in its early days, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/t-mobiles-60-home-internet-service-six-weeks-later/"&gt;reviews so far&lt;/a&gt; note some inconsistencies in performance among other quirks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgbpDM"&gt;Even taking all this into consideration, it may still sound well worth the potential risks if you’re shelling out close to twice that to Big Cable every month. But before you drop-kick your Comcast router into the river, there are a few things to be aware of if you’re thinking about switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zaKGul"&gt;Eligibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MeoYKV"&gt;First, and most obviously, is that you may not be eligible for the service. Home Internet isn’t offered everywhere that has T-Mobile cellular phone service; the company is introducing it as local network capacity allows. And even where it’s offered, you might not necessarily be able to get it. To make sure that it can handle the added demands of home internet users, T-Mobile may limit the number of signups they’ll allow in your neighborhood or condo building, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAxZwQ"&gt;Take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/where-can-you-get-t-mobiles-5g-home-internet-service-lets-go-to-the-map"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;’s map&lt;/a&gt; for an easy visual of the areas where home internet is currently offered, but for the most precise information, you’ll of course want to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Feligibility&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F13%2F22381885%2Ft-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check your home address with T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3AK7cs"&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IRBirI"&gt;Setting up wireless internet isn’t quite the plug-and-play experience you get with traditional wired service. You’ll be looking for the best spot in your home to place the Internet Gateway, as T-Mobile calls it. Signal strength may vary from room to room, and even within the same room you might find better signal near a particular window. An accompanying app takes you through the setup steps and lets you self-evaluate your tech comfort level at the beginning to provide an appropriate amount of guidance through the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="WC8zV0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;unlike traditional broadband, you might find a different spot in your home gives better service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nepUqz"&gt;Reviewers and early testers have noticed that signal strength can also vary throughout the day, so keep an eye on your internet speeds. Be prepared to try moving the Gateway to other locations if you’re not getting performance you’re happy with when you need it — unlike traditional broadband, you might find that a different spot in your home gives you better service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hM81wx"&gt;Slowdowns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XTCRst"&gt;Home internet service is subject to the same “data prioritization” policies as most of the company’s cellular data plans, meaning customers might see their speeds temporarily drop during busy times for the network. On some plans, this is applied only after a certain data threshold is met, but that’s not the case for Home Internet — users are always subject to this kind of slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="4uKY6j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;customers might see their speeds temporarily drop during busy times&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aFUL1R"&gt;That sounds like a dealbreaker, but T-Mobile executives that I spoke to said that customers are “unlikely” to experience this thanks to how the company is expanding the service. They say that Home Internet is only offered in places with adequate network capacity, and that signups in a particular area or building may be capped to avoid congestion. That’s reassuring but still something to take into account as a potential drawback if you need guaranteed speeds at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kDuKlS"&gt;Hulu + Live TV isn’t supported right now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gDoDBy"&gt;Tucked away in Home Internet’s fine print is a statement that it’s “not compatible with some live TV streaming services.” T-Mobile clarified this for us, saying that while YouTube TV and Netflix will work, Hulu’s live TV service doesn’t work right now due to a technical requirement. The company says it’s working with Hulu to resolve the problem. If Hulu is your main source for live TV, then it’s a good idea to wait until that’s squared away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="imZe3x"&gt;You can’t take it with you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yWK4wZ"&gt;It might sound appealing to take your internet with you when you stay somewhere else, like a vacation home, but that’s not allowed according to the service’s terms. T-Mobile says that’s to make sure that the service is being used in areas with adequate network capacity. Similarly, you can’t take the SIM card out of your modem and pop it in your phone when you leave the house. T-Mobile’s not going to let you quit your cellphone plan that easily.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Quantum 2 has quantum cryptography built in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RrYlX1bpoTaEsCDXGHFFrnhDoIA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117262/_Photo__SKT_to_Launch_QRNG_Powered_5G_Smartphone_Galaxy_Quantum2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oD1Wz8"&gt;Samsung and South Korean carrier SK Telecom have announced the Galaxy Quantum 2, Samsung’s second phone that features built-in quantum cryptography technology for increased security. It’s the follow-up to last year’s Galaxy A Quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ka7P1O"&gt;The Quantum 2 includes a chip developed by a company called ID Quantique, which says it’s the world’s smallest quantum random number generator (QRNG) at 2.5mm square. It works by capturing random noise with an LED and a CMOS image sensor. According to SK Telecom, the QRNG chip “allows smartphone holders to use services that require security in a more safe and secure manner by generating unpredictable and patternless true random numbers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4QGTZ"&gt;Quantum cryptography RNG is considered to be extremely challenging to hack without extensive physical access to a given device. The benefits will seem pretty niche to the average customer, but the QRNG chip does automatically work with apps that use the Android Keystore APIs, which should make the technology more accessible for developers. SK Telecom is touting local compatibility with the likes of Shinhan Bank and Standard Chartered Bank Korea, plus its own services like T World. The carrier says it’ll work with more services in the future, including Samsung’s own credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6b3mCn"&gt;The phone itself has reasonably high specs, close to what you’d have found in a high-end flagship phone from a year or two ago. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus processor, a 64-megapixel camera, and a 6.7-inch 120Hz OLED display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arWTr7"&gt;The Galaxy Quantum 2 is only confirmed for a release in South Korea right now. It’ll go on sale on April 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4HM3F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s follow up to the Z Fold 2 could be smaller, but maybe not in the dimension you want</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l5HaK0iuv9C7whGTmTMSI2pFSaY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116445/vpavic_200907_4181_0010_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u8ZMiY"&gt;Samsung’s next Galaxy Z Fold folding phone might have a slightly smaller screen than its previous models, feature a smaller battery, and quite possibly launch in July alongside a new Galaxy Z Flip, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=11865"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-3-will-reportedly-be-smaller-than-the-galaxy-z-fold-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CmxEB"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 will reportedly have a 7.5-inch main tablet screen and a 6.2-inch screen on the front cover of the phone, &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; writes, which would be virtually the same as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;the Fold 2’s&lt;/a&gt; 7.6-inch main display and 6.2-inch cover display. &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; says these screen sizes come with the added benefit of “zero bezels,” so even though the screens may be the same size, the third Fold could feel slightly smaller because the actual body of the phone might shrink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBiiEB"&gt;In comparison to the Fold 2’s 4,500mAh battery, the Fold 3 will reportedly make do with a slightly smaller 4,380mAh battery. Again, not a dramatic change in size and it might not even noticeably impact battery life, but it’s interesting to note if it effects other changes to the Fold’s design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uujIi-TwtsLqEJjklQdTF3pllPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439698/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_4.30.23_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even with a slight taper, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 is still almost as thick as two phones back to back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hwzwyn"&gt;There’s other rumored changes to the Fold line, including the possibility of S Pen support, just like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra got earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. For the Fold, a stylus could also pose additional challenges if Samsung tries to integrate stylus storage directly in the phone rather than using an add-on case like the Ultra. A hole for a stylus could take up space that could be filled with extra battery capacity or removed entirely for an overall thinner phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MF37JS"&gt;And — though &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t mention it at all, so don’t expect a change — thinness is the dimension that might actually matter when it comes to a new Galaxy Fold. Including the extra gap created by its hinge, the Fold 2 is about two S21 Ultra thick when folded. If Samsung isn’t thinning out the rumored Fold 3 to make it easier to hold and fit in a pocket, I hope they’ll consider that the next time around: it could also help Samsung compete with newcomers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Huawei’s Mate X2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi’s Mi Mix Fold&lt;/a&gt; which both use similar folding designs and are already thinner than the Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6H3DQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG Korea says that the Wing, Velvet 5G, and Velvet LTE phones will get Android 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1wDBuWsGUlparL02Rj8-GBW33go=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115027/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wing will be one of a few devices to receive OS upgrades for several years after LG exits the smartphone business.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vhTjQN"&gt;LG’s Korean website now lists which phones the company plans to update to Android 12, along with a few devices which will even get Android 13. These upgrades will most likely come long after the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;mobile industry exit&lt;/a&gt;, announced last week. &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/LG-Korea-reveals-which-phones-will-receive-Android-12-and-Android-13-update_id131368"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spotted the &lt;a href="https://www.lge.co.kr/lgekor/contents/mobile/swUpgradeDetail.do?swSeq=1441"&gt;updated FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, which previously stated that some models would get the OS upgrade to 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoiLYB"&gt;According to the FAQ, the LG Wing and both variants of the Velvet (LTE and 5G) will get Android 13. LG also says that those models, along with the V50, V50S, G8, Q31, Q52, and Q92, will receive an Android 12 upgrade. The company also notes that these two updates aren’t strictly guaranteed and will depend on product performance, product stabilization level, and Google policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBwiwF"&gt;LG Korea says that an Android 11 update, already in progress, is planned for the models mentioned above, along with the Q61, Q70, and Q9 One. As an aside, the Q-series models sold throughout Europe and Asia are similar to corresponding models sold as the K-series in the US but aren’t strictly a 1:1 match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4q1Bzo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG leaves behind more than a flip phone-shaped hole in our hearts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375938/lg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="s7vL90"&gt;Availability and timing of updates will, of course, vary by region, but the list is a good indication of which models the company plans to prioritize. Recently, LG’s German website &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327144/lg-android-11-software-update-wing-phones-mobile-q4-2021"&gt;published a timetable&lt;/a&gt; for its Android 11 updates, most of which won’t be released until the end of the 2021. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/1/18164265/lg-android-pie-update-g7-v40-q1-2019"&gt;isn’t known for a great track record&lt;/a&gt; on platform updates, but it’s encouraging to see specific model names mentioned for the future upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook adds state vaccine information to the top of the News Feed for US users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHzxHMDNgZz3cIahqSgeCEwwJGM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113471/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0445stills_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOo2aG"&gt;As all adults across the US become eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, Facebook is making it easier for its users to find information based on where they live. The company has started rolling out a feature that adds a box with state-specific information about &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/state-covid-19-vaccine-information/"&gt;where to get a COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the News Feed for every US user living in a state where the general public is eligible to receive the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmIyfF"&gt;The feature, once available, will appear at the top of your News Feed and show you state-specific information, confirming that you are now eligible to receive the vaccine, including a link on where to find the vaccine in your province, as seen in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HhaQxfqUxA3kr4gpBRtres2Ui7w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22437890/NRP_Covid_Vaccine_Eligibility_Notifications_banner.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BqRhSu"&gt;Most US states have now made vaccination appointments available to all adults, although &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-19-vaccine-eligibility.html"&gt;some states&lt;/a&gt; are still lagging. With more availability, it has become a challenge for some people in certain parts of the US to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;book an appointment&lt;/a&gt;, leading &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;some volunteers to build dedicated websites&lt;/a&gt; to help people in their search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sRMz0"&gt;The feature is also available in “nearly 20 countries,” according to Facebook, with the ultimate goal to release it in more areas as countries begin opening COVID-19 vaccinations to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90l29M"&gt;Facebook rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177085/facebook-covid-19-misinformation-notifications"&gt;a similar feature to its mobile app last year&lt;/a&gt;, which helped fight misinformation about COVID-19 appearing on its platform as the site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253055/facebook-q4-2020-earnings-report-app-usage-record-user-numbers"&gt;saw a surge in users&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook says more than 3 million US users clicked through those promotions between January and March, suggesting the new vaccine links may reach a significant number of Facebook users in the months to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG leaves behind more than a flip phone-shaped hole in our hearts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2nix_zd-RTVqievZhpUQKgS4w_Y=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69108712/ajohnson_210222_4437__005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Stylo 6 is one of the company’s bestselling phones in recent history.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company leaves a void that brands like Motorola and TCL are well-positioned to fill&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zHTSjt"&gt;LG’s exit from the smartphone business felt inevitable in the weeks leading up to it as rumors mounted. When it was finally confirmed, Avi Greengart, a longtime consumer tech analyst and president of Techsponential, noticed a trend toward nostalgia in the reactions to the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zosnHP"&gt;“I’m not getting a lot of people saying ‘What will I do to replace my LG G8X ThinQ?’ I’m getting ‘Aw, my first phone was an LG flip phone, and it was durable and reliable and I loved it.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuJe7t"&gt;As someone who spent many years covering the digital camera market, it’s a very familiar moment to me. We mourn the loss of the brand that gave us our first flip phone or our first camera with a tweet and a broken heart emoji. But truthfully, we moved on long ago, as did most of the rest of the phone- or camera-buying population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="t7t3Mw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Through last year, LG still held close to 10 percent market share in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ChXH3e"&gt;Things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/28/11525306/lg-g5-earnings-q1-2016"&gt;weren’t looking good&lt;/a&gt; for LG’s phone business in 2016 when it introduced the modular G5, and the ecosystem’s failure to take off perpetuated what would become years of losses for the mobile division. In 2020, the smartphone business &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fglobal%2Fpdf%2Fir_report%2F20%25204Q%2520Earning%2520Release%2520of%2520LGE.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F11%2F22375938%2Flg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recorded an operational loss of around $750 million for the year&lt;/a&gt;; the company promised to “closely review the direction of the business,” and we know now how that turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHTQMi"&gt;While most shoppers have moved on, there are still gaps left in the market when a Kodak or an LG packs it in. “This is a void. When they do leave, this will be a void,” says Ryan Reith, program vice president for IDC’s Mobile Device Tracker division. He says that through last year, LG still held close to 10 percent market share in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84KiyC"&gt;In particular, the company still had a solid foothold in the prepaid device business. Greengart doesn’t think there will be any lack of appetite to snap up that share of the market. “The competition there is brutal. The real question is will US carriers invite a new brand in — someone like Xiaomi would be my longshot.” The company’s Redmi and Poco lineups might be good candidates, with a focus on bringing high-end features and solid performance to affordable handsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8l9WYc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The real question is will US carriers invite a new brand in — someone like Xiaomi would be my longshot.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LfyPlb"&gt;Greengart also notes that OnePlus already has a foot in the door at Metro by T-Mobile, the carrier’s prepaid sub-brand. Samsung has already announced that it will sell two of its least expensive A-series phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;the A02s and A12&lt;/a&gt;, through prepaid brands like Cricket and Metro this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWl2U6"&gt;As for the sub-$300 space in general, there’s no shortage of brands ready to pounce. “I would say the two brands that are probably going to take that share going to be Motorola and TCL,” Reith says. He notes that Motorola is already well-positioned to pick up LG’s Latin American customers, which was recently about 30 percent of its mobile phone business. Even on an individual device level, there are obvious heirs: one of LG’s last bestselling devices is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301223/lg-stylo-6-review"&gt;Stylo 6&lt;/a&gt;, and its sole competitor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt;, is quite frankly a better phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b19Eaj"&gt;TCL has also made it clear in the past couple of years that it’s eager to get its own brand devices into more consumers’ hands, in addition to the phones the company already makes for other brands. Reith says he’s “bullish” on the company’s prospects, as more US shoppers have become familiar with the brand name by way of its TV business. If one thing’s certain, it’s that more than a few companies are in a good position to fill that void LG leaves behind. As Greengart puts it, “Undoubtedly there will be plenty of substitutes; in fact there already are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o55aMP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Undoubtedly there will be plenty of substitutes; in fact there already are.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DH5Gs2"&gt;Although LG only had a small presence in the premium market, there’s a gap left there too — even if it’s mostly symbolic. The few devices the company still sold were an alternative to the two dominant brands in the US: Apple and Samsung. Especially considering the lower cost of entry to the S21 series this year, those remaining customers will likely be easily scooped up by the duopoly. “The market is mostly Apple and Samsung in the United States,” says Greengart. “If it was concentrated before, it’s even more concentrated today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6wpis"&gt;Realistically though, the market had already spoken. LG’s efforts at bold, unusual designs in the premium space never caught on and spelled serious trouble for the business. Reith points to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;the LG Wing&lt;/a&gt; as an example. “To come up with a design like that… it takes so much money for R&amp;amp;D, that when you put that out and it only sells thousands of units — not hundreds of thousands, but &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of units — it’s a big, big loss,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rfzHOP"&gt;LG’s premium devices may have been interesting and unique, but the market spoke, and the company’s mobile phone exit became seemingly inevitable. That’s how these things work, and a multitude of companies are ready to swoop in and pick up where LG left off. But whether you follow mobile tech closely or just have a special place in your heart for your old flip phone, many of us will still take the opportunity to pause and shed a digital emoji tear.&lt;/p&gt;
