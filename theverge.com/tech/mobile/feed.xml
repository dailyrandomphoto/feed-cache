    <title>Startup Halo will bring driverless car service to Las Vegas later this year on T-Mobile 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQ4bVX2CCwAEhHYpxBXBIULu4AQ=/0x23:3000x2023/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557369/21CM0192_05_060221_1040v2m_sm.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo says it will use remote drivers to operate its vehicles over T-Mobile 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GdySA9"&gt;Driverless car startup Halo has announced a new service coming to Las Vegas later this year: a fleet of remotely operated electric vehicles, using T-Mobile’s 5G network. It’s potentially a big step toward fulfilling the promise of 5G remote driver tech, with a significant catch: the cars don’t operate &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; on T-Mobile 5G. While it’s the primary network they’ll use (mid- and low-band 5G, specifically, with LTE as a fallback), they will also rely on other networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pWiKV"&gt;The idea is simple enough: Halo employs remote drivers to operate the vehicles, delivering them to waiting customers who then get behind the wheel and take the car to their destination. When the trip has ended, the car moves on to its next pick-up under remote control. Halo is also currently operating test drives with safety drivers in vehicles, which it says it won’t include when the service launches for paying customers. That’s easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xag8xZ"&gt;There’s no shortage of driverless and autonomous vehicle pilot programs in Las Vegas; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17718018/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-cars-las-vegas-5000-trips"&gt;Lyft has operated a driverless taxi service&lt;/a&gt; in the city, and more recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22291682/motional-fully-driverless-autonomous-cars-las-vegas"&gt;Motional has been testing autonomous rides&lt;/a&gt; without a backup driver behind the wheel. Halo’s service is a little different, using a remote driver, along with an “Advanced Safe Stop” mechanism to automatically bring the car to a halt if a hazard is detected. The company says that ultimately it hopes to achieve full autonomy, and that in the meantime its vehicles are designed to “learn” from their human operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UW4YRK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"I took a gamble by riding in a self-driving Lyft in Las Vegas","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16860590/self-driving-lyft-las-vegas-ces-2018"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="f66CMo"&gt;Fully remote driverless vehicles have been one of the promises of 5G, and it’s a use case that actually demands the speed and low latency that 5G connectivity is capable of delivering. But in the US, at least, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;our networks just haven’t met the bar yet&lt;/a&gt; to make it a reality. This new service is a step in the right direction, but it seems we’re not quite at full 5G remote operation yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zlq7l"&gt;It won’t exactly be a widespread service at first, either. Halo says that it will operate in “urban parts of the Las Vegas Valley” at launch and doesn’t disclose how large of an area it will cover, just that it plans to later expand to more parts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phRERG"&gt;Oh, and it’s probably a coincidence, but Las Vegas is also set to be the stage for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;Dish Network’s first 5G rollout&lt;/a&gt; this summer, a venture that T-Mobile is supposed to be helping to facilitate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134278/sprint-tmobile-merger-court-ruling-opinion-decision-explainer-carriers-antitrust"&gt;per its Sprint acquisition deal&lt;/a&gt;. If T-Mobile’s 5G network can indeed support a fleet of remotely operated vehicles, it’ll be thanks in part to the addition of Sprint’s spectrum. Before we get carried away by the possibilities of driverless cars, let’s spare a thought for the fourth wireless carrier we’re still missing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus admits to throttling popular apps to save battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro (top) and OnePlus 9" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/huCXNrOJELXUlJp4vIz_9kp-KpQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69554977/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0061_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JbIu1k"&gt;OnePlus has confirmed that it deliberately reduces performance in “many of the most popular apps” in order to improve battery life on its latest OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro phones. The issue arose following &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16794/oneplus-9-performance-examination/"&gt;testing by &lt;em&gt;Anandtech’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Andrei Frumusanu, who called the situation “rather baffling” after discovering slowdown in a wide range of prominent apps from Google’s Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLyXdg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt;’s conclusion is that OnePlus is “blacklisting popular applications away from its fastest cores, causing slowdown in typical workloads such as web browsing.” The site tested Chrome and Twitter performance extensively, but concluded that the slowdown “applies to pretty much everything that has any level of popularity in the Play Store.” That’s said to cover all Google apps, all Microsoft Office apps, and all notable social media apps and web browsers, though some complex games like &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt; are reportedly unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T24grs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zEHInm"&gt;Some phone manufacturers have been caught in the past &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/1/4791354/samsung-rigging-benchmark-scores-galaxy-note-3"&gt;artificially boosting performance&lt;/a&gt; so that their devices run unreasonably fast in benchmarks. That isn’t quite what’s happening here; while benchmark apps seem to be running within expectations, it’s the performance of “regular” apps that’s been reduced. Nevertheless, popular testing tool GeekBench &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geekbench/status/1412433598200823810"&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; OnePlus’ approach as “benchmark manipulation” and has removed the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro from its Android benchmark chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiwDjh"&gt;OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-9-pro-performance-throttling-popular-apps/"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that this is intended behavior designed to improve battery life. Here’s the full statement: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sT9NBw"&gt;“Our top priority is always delivering a great user experience with our products, based in part on acting quickly on important user feedback. Following the launch of the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro in March, some users told us about some areas where we could improve the devices’ battery life and heat management. As a result of this feedback, our R&amp;amp;D team has been working over the past few months to optimize the devices’ performance when using many of the most popular apps, including Chrome, by matching the app’s processor requirements with the most appropriate power. This has helped to provide a smooth experience while reducing power consumption. While this may impact the devices’ performance in some benchmarking apps, our focus as always is to do what we can to improve the performance of the device for our users.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jINyzh"&gt;OnePlus’ statement implies that the performance is only affected in benchmark results, which is essentially the opposite of what &lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt; has found. Unless, of course, the intended user experience is for most popular apps to be slowed down, and the “impact” is on benchmark results that are higher than they ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxXoFe"&gt;It is worth noting that the performance tweaks may well not make much difference to the user’s overall experience. “I wouldn’t blame anybody if they hadn’t necessarily noticed the performance discrepancy — I hadn’t immediately noticed it myself beyond the device’s extremely slow momentum scrolling speed setting,” Frumusanu writes. “However, having it side-by-side to a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, or a Xiaomi Mi 11 (Ultra) and paying attention, I do very much notice that the OnePlus 9 Pro is less responsive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgSmJl"&gt;What’s clear is that OnePlus is taking an unusual approach to power management on the 9 Pro — Frumusanu says it “certainly represents the first case of a vendor implementing application and benchmark detection in this manner” — and that’s something you might want to be aware of before dropping the cash on the company’s latest flagship.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android app tests your phone’s waterproof seals without a drop of water</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XCS5gxdAqWXzkLdSSTgiXlDoeXk=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69552625/cat-s60-5945.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Water Resistance Tester is designed to check waterproofing, which can degrade over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rxsGxm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ray.waterresistancetester"&gt;Water Resistance Tester&lt;/a&gt;, available on the Google Play store and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/07/app-claims-to-test-your-phones-water-resistance-without-a-plunge/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, falls firmly into the category of “neat stuff we didn’t know you could do with an app.” It tests the integrity of your Android phone’s IP67/IP68 rating by accessing the device’s barometer. Just download the free app, follow the prompts to press down firmly on the screen, and you’ll get a swift pass/fail grade. It’s simple, geeky, and practical, which is a combination we love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgsEMX"&gt;Developer Ray Wang says he created the app to help people check the state of their devices’ waterproof sealing after a repair or as it degrades over time. Obviously, don’t take a passing grade as a free pass to chuck your phone into a lake. That said, it appears to work reliably, based on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/oev1rt/app_water_resistance_tester_app/"&gt;feedback from Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; and Play store reviewers — as well as our own quick testing. An IP68-rated Galaxy Note 20 Ultra passed the test at first, but when we popped out the SIM card tray, it failed — as you’d expect. A TCL 20 Pro 5G, which has no IP rating, failed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P6q89K60ouf5x0LGd_Onz3YT2p8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704069/water_resist_screens.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In our testing, a TCL phone (left) without an IP rating failed, as expected, while the IP68-rated Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (middle and right) passed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="43xJs7"&gt;This app &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=waterproof%20test&amp;amp;c=apps&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;isn’t the first of its kind&lt;/a&gt;, but some of the existing waterproof test apps on the Play store appear to have been designed for older phones with a different style of waterproofing than used in phones today, and may not work accurately now, according to user reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFMhNp"&gt;In any case, this new app seems to work well, and it’s free unless you want to tip the developer $1 to remove a small ad at the bottom of the screen. Not a bad price to pay for a little bit of geeky fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon has its own version of spatial audio and it’s already pushing it on phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdA7Nx_txiaOx-y7u2tg4yvul0g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69552002/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h7fivc"&gt;You know spatial audio is having quite a moment when wireless carriers decide to create their own implementations of it. Verizon has announced a new sound feature it’s calling “Verizon Adaptive Sound,” and the company claims it “produces a brilliant spatial surround experience regardless of what headphone, soundbar, or earbud brand you use or what application you’re watching or listening to.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNuXwO"&gt;The audio trick, which Verizon says has been in the works since 2019, is coming to Motorola phones first, including the new Motorola One 5G UW Ace that goes on sale July 8th. The Motorola Edge Plus also just received a firmware update that seems to add this feature, &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/07/05/motorola-edge-update-adds-something-called-verizon-adaptive-sound/"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;Droid Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6jFwE"&gt;Verizon Adaptive Sound is integrated right into the settings menu on Android devices in the sound section. From there, you can adjust sliders for treble, bass, voice enhancement, and spatial surround sound. For those who’d prefer to ignore VAS completely and hear everything as normal, it can toggled on or off in settings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrjWt6xY5uE9XG2fHYt6KgndHCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703786/Screen_Shot_2021_07_07_at_12.57.02_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Verizon&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YhXV3I"&gt;“While some technology solutions have attempted to provide premium sound experiences to some specific (usually expensive) devices and to a limited subset of content, most devices and content experiences have been relegated to a disjointed, sub-optimal, and lowest-common-denominator-like experience,” a Verizon spokesperson said by email, in an obvious reference to Apple, Sony, and Amazon. “We wanted to change that.” Some devices that offer 360-degree audio do indeed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22360437/sony-srs-ra5000-speaker-review-360-audio-features"&gt;come at a premium&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHGt2H"&gt;Verizon Adaptive Sound is based around “an innovative software and cloud-based solution,” a spokesperson said. That’s on the vague side, so I’ve asked the carrier for more specifics on exactly how it works and what it does. Is this just some kind of gimmicky, fake virtual surround effect? Or does it mix down Dolby Atmos channels (when available) to make the sound profile, similar to Apple’s spatial audio? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLxleo"&gt;Apple spatial audio works with AirPods earbuds and the AirPods Max headphones to create immersive surround sound — with head tracking — when watching TV shows and movies in supported apps. The company has more recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;added spatial audio to its Apple Music service&lt;/a&gt;, though the results are very inconsistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWaUx8"&gt;Verizon’s big talking point seems to be universal support across hardware and streaming services. But until we can give Verizon Adaptive Sound a try ourselves on one of these Moto devices, we can’t say how it compares to existing approaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9kqCY"&gt;The feature “will be made available on a broader portfolio of new devices in the future, as well as some existing devices via an over-the-air software update,” according to Verizon. My initial hunch was that we’ll mostly see this on entry-level and midrange 5G phones, but the carrier told me it won’t be specific to budget devices. Does that mean Verizon will force this into the sound settings of something like Samsung’s Galaxy S21? For now, Motorola is the only partner being named. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google crowd out the competition with default apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-BajpgSWY_z9XLxnIOLTmw66pc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550154/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new study shows how Apple and Google’s preinstalled apps dominate their mobile platforms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wJfzM4"&gt;If you use an iPhone or Android phone, chances are the majority of your most-used apps were made by Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysNYXF"&gt;That’s the takeaway from a new Comscore study that ranks the popularity of preinstalled iOS and Android apps, such as Apple’s Messages, alongside apps made by other developers. The results show that the majority of apps people use on their phones in the US come preinstalled by either Apple or Google. The first-of-its-kind report was commissioned by Facebook, one of Apple’s loudest critics, and shared exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHrZWT"&gt;Preinstalled services dominate when it comes to basics like weather, photos, and clocks, according to the report, suggesting these categories will be difficult for other apps to compete in. Defaults don’t win out exclusively, though: Apple Maps and Music don’t appear on the iOS list at all, and Gmail makes the iOS list several entries below Apple Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="c5cAMz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for favoring their own services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzYrnI"&gt;The timing, as Facebook likely intentioned, is apt: Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for how they favor their own services over competitors like Spotify. US lawmakers are currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;reviewing a new set of bills&lt;/a&gt; designed to curb the power of Big Tech, including legislation that could potentially bar Apple and Google from giving their services the upper hand against rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDvTGa"&gt;The pushback stems from how Apple and Google bundle their apps and services with their mobile operating systems in ways that some of their competitors think is unfair. The criticism is harsher against Apple, given that it more tightly controls the apps that come preinstalled on the iPhone and doesn’t allow developers to circumvent its App Store.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzrZxb"&gt;At the same time, it has been difficult to know how popular these preinstalled apps are relative to apps made by third-party developers since Apple and Google don’t disclose user numbers for their default apps. Research firms regularly track the popularity of apps that are available for download in app stores, but Comscore’s study is the first real attempt at charting how default mobile apps compete against other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="TCKt1W"&gt;&lt;div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/6523915"&gt;&lt;script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tknLNo"&gt;You can view the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22313379"&gt;full interactive version here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9sO-_nhMbJmafmbNBALEFxq300A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702366/VRG_Data_Top20Apps_BarChart_Vert2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CDcIg6"&gt;To make the report last December, Comscore used data it regularly gathers from apps and websites alongside a survey of roughly 4,000 people asking about the default apps they used during the month of November. The results show that 75 percent of the top 20 apps on iOS in the US were made by Apple, while Google made 60 percent of the top apps on Android. The top four apps on both platforms were made by their respective parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hheye"&gt;Facebook is the only outside developer with more than one app on the iOS list and the only developer with three apps on the list for Android. Randomly, a staggering 78 million people used Apple’s Calculator app — more than the users of Gmail on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcH7KS"&gt;Facebook paid for the Comscore study to show the “impact of preinstalled apps on the competitive app ecosystem,” according to company spokesman Joe Osborne. The social network’s executives have long criticized Apple’s limitations on third-party developers for hindering their ability to distribute mobile games and compete effectively with iMessage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iJJVIt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple called the report “seriously flawed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBAsdA"&gt;Apple rejected the report’s findings. “This Facebook-financed survey from December 2020 was narrowly tailored to give the false impression that there’s little competition on the App Store,” an Apple spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In truth, third-party apps compete with Apple’s apps across every category and enjoy large scale success.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXdn9R"&gt;The spokesperson said the survey’s methodology was “seriously flawed in a number of ways” and that the results contradicted Comscore’s recent &lt;a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings#tab_mobile_apps/"&gt;April 2021 rankings&lt;/a&gt; on app usage. But those rankings didn't attempt to factor in the usage of all preinstalled apps like the Facebook-commissioned study did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVl9oD"&gt;Google did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MknSY7"&gt;Besides Comscore showing app usage in the US for a particular window of time, there are a couple of other quirks in its methodology to note: it did not include browsers such as Apple’s Safari or Google’s Chrome in the rankings or what it calls “embedded operating system features” like Siri. And results for Android weren’t gathered by specific phone manufacturers, meaning app usage isn’t broken out for Samsung phones relative to the Google Pixel, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="05S9u9"&gt;Still, the report points to the power platform owners have over what apps are used on their devices. It’s not just the app stores that serve as gatekeepers, but the phones themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 9 is on sale — and it’s an even better deal at $649</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0XoJzbpw0mSnKeUGflvNB8t8miA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69543226/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0070_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 misses some of the high-end features on the more expensive Pro model, but it’s a better overall buy for most people.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u8wNGQ"&gt;The OnePlus’ latest flagship phones are marked down at several retailers, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/05/grab-a-oneplus-9-for-the-price-it-probably-shouldve-been-at-launch/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B08Y73NTXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;normally $729 OnePlus 9 down to $649&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B07XM7WVS8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro (usually $1069) to $969&lt;/a&gt;. We think that the more basic 9 is already the better buy than the 9 Pro for most people, and the extra $80 off the retail price makes it an even sweeter deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwH0B6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;The OnePlus 9 gives up surprisingly few features&lt;/a&gt; compared to its more expensive sibling — you still get a Snapdragon 888 processor, display with 120Hz refresh rate, and an excellent 50-megapixel ultrawide camera. You’ll have to make do with an unstabilized main camera, plastic rather than aluminum frame, and slower wireless charging. Considering that you save more than $300 off the price of the premium model, these downgrades feel like things most of us could live with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f9yVX6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0zv63j"&gt;A word of caution if you’re ready to add the OnePlus 9 to your virtual cart: while it’s fully compatible with Verizon and T-Mobile 4G and 5G networks, it’s 4G only on AT&amp;amp;T. That’s not a big deal now (actually, you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;probably better off sticking with its 4G&lt;/a&gt; at the moment). However, AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network should improve over the next couple of years as the company starts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;employing its new C-band frequencies&lt;/a&gt;, which the 9 and 9 Pro support. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra is getting an ultra-limited release in India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ixpGO5NDQgFFdSFUavpoihg_A3w=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541768/DSCF7720_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LbPe5P"&gt;Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra is finally going on sale in India in limited quantities. The company had announced its latest flagship smartphone all the way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;back in March&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s been near-impossible to buy one outside of China ever since. The phone sold out instantly in the UK in May, suggesting very limited stock, and last month Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XiaomiIndia/status/1400042494792921089"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the Indian launch would be delayed “due to circumstances beyond our control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgoLQA"&gt;Now, Xiaomi has announced details of how people in India will actually be able to buy one, as long as they’re willing to jump through a few hoops. Customers will need to buy an “ultra gift card” for Rs. 1,999 (~$27) &lt;a href="https://in.event.mi.com/in/mi-11-ultra-register"&gt;on the Mi.com website&lt;/a&gt;, which can later be redeemed against the price of the Mi 11 Ultra and includes some bonuses like two free screen replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0QVgbI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;⚡️&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mi11Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Mi11Ultra&lt;/a&gt;⚡️&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Register for the first sale by purchasing the ultra gift card, get guaranteed access to sale &amp;amp; other benefits  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  2 Free Screen Replacements&lt;br&gt;  Ultra Merchandise Superfan Box&lt;br&gt;  Times Prime Annual Membership&lt;br&gt;  Extra F-code&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Know more: &lt;a href="https://t.co/GGbHaZvU2d"&gt;https://t.co/GGbHaZvU2d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/61x4jYCREP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/61x4jYCREP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mi India (@XiaomiIndia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XiaomiIndia/status/1411280371396669440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="18WscM"&gt;The Mi 11 Ultra itself starts at Rs. 69,999 (~$940) in India. Xiaomi hasn’t said how long the gift cards will be available for, how many phones it’ll make available for purchase, or when they’ll ship, but it’s describing the release as a “limited-quantity sale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3ELbM"&gt;Xiaomi’s key selling point for the Mi 11 Ultra over its (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;very good&lt;/a&gt;) non-ultra sibling is an all-new camera system. The main camera has a large 1/1.12-inch 50-megapixel sensor, and there are also 48-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto modules. All of this is housed in a gigantic camera bump complete with a secondary OLED screen that can serve as a viewfinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eco7pE"&gt;I’ve been using the Mi 11 Ultra for a while now — stay tuned for our review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL 20 Pro 5G review: good looks aren’t everything</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The 20 Pro 5G includes premium features you’d be hard-pressed to find in another $500 phone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jSGHyq"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G is a good-looking budget phone that works out some of the first-gen kinks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257398/tcl-10-pro-review-release-date-specs-features-camera-screen"&gt;we encountered in the 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but it isn’t quite ready to take on the category heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMAQQq"&gt;Much like its predecessor, the 20 Pro 5G combines a high-end look with a budget price tag — $499 for 6GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in this case. That’s $50 higher than the 10 Pro’s starting price, but this time you get more storage and 5G, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6klsf"&gt;It’s worth stating again: this is a very good-looking phone for just $500. Its huge curved-edge display boasts very slim bezels, and build quality is top-notch with an aluminum frame and glass on the front and back. The rear-facing cameras are neatly arranged under a vertical strip that sits flush with the rear panel. It’s tidy, and kind of retro cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eWAn76"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10634905"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nudokf"&gt;Good looks aside, I wouldn’t recommend the 20 Pro 5G to most people. There are a few usability quirks that make it feel like the second-gen device that it is. But more importantly, the 20 Pro 5G’s network compatibility and security support policy just aren’t as strong as the Pixels and Galaxy A-series phones in the category. It’s slated for two OS upgrades (decent for a midrange phone) but only two years of security patches (less good). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jINwzQ"&gt;It also lacks compatibility with AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network and isn’t certified to use C-band frequencies that will likely make Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G networks much better over the next couple of years. It’s yet another device that may be best suited for T-Mobile customers who will get full 4G and 5G connectivity and don’t need to worry about C-band as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxxRtx"&gt;There’s a lot to like about the 20 Pro 5G, and TCL has made some steps in the right direction with this device, but it still comes up short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ma3dxXAld7tygbzrq0GE5sXHAZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693979/ajohnson_210630_4655_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rather than offering a faster refresh rate, TCL has opted to include its second-gen Nxtvision display technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FEU2ls"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G screen, performance, and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CDOuhY"&gt;A lot of the credit for the 20 Pro 5G’s premium look goes to its curved 6.67-inch 1080p OLED screen with slim bezels — you just won’t find another screen like it in this class. It offers a standard 60Hz refresh rate, bucking the trend toward faster 90Hz and 120Hz displays, so you won’t get that smooth-scrolling goodness here. I noticed a little bugginess in the screen’s color temperature jumping between warm and cool, particularly after leaving the camera app, but overall it’s a pleasure to look at. And thankfully, it seems much less prone to registering touches accidentally on the curved sides than in the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leyDBH"&gt;TCL has included its second-generation Nxtvision 2 technology here, which aims to make standard images and video look more like high dynamic range content, with deeper blacks and brighter whites. You can choose from a few different profiles, with “vivid” as the default, or turn it off entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjQ7ch"&gt;We thought the first generation of this tech was a little heavy-handed, and I can’t say I’m impressed this time around either. The effect is often so subtle that I’m sure I wouldn’t notice it if I didn’t know it was there. When I could see a noticeable difference with it turned on versus off, it made images look too unnaturally processed for my taste. That said, I don’t think it will negatively impact anyone’s experience using this phone, it’s just not the impressive feature that TCL makes it out to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xa93z0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TCL seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2mQ5WZ"&gt;The company seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates, and it’s starting to feel like a weird choice. A faster refresh rate screen is an obvious benefit that many more users will see and appreciate. The advantages of viewing HDR content on an HDR screen are real, but the effect is hard to mimic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlygzZ"&gt;TCL has equipped the 20 Pro 5G with a Snapdragon 750G 5G processor and 6GB of RAM. It’s certainly up to day-to-day tasks, and stutters only occasionally with heavier tasks. The customizable smart key from last year’s model makes an appearance again here, and there are a ton of functions you can map it to, from opening a particular app to launching the camera in a specific mode, like night or portrait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zoKYr"&gt;It’s really useful, but unfortunately, it’s still easy to bump unintentionally. It’s positioned out of the way so that I don’t hit it while I’m using the phone; it’s just when I pick up the device or my hand brushes against it that I press it by accident. This is how you end up with multiple photos of your couch cushions in your camera roll, which nobody needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DMLv2y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s another premium feature on board here, too: wireless charging at up to 15W&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4HAibz"&gt;Moving along to the top edge of the device, there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is great! The phone’s mono speaker isn’t very good, but I wouldn’t expect it to be at this price, and anyway: headphone jack! The optical in-display fingerprint sensor is also good — one of the faster and more accurate I’ve encountered in the midrange class. I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate this after struggling with some finicky fingerprint sensors in lower-end devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOVzUo"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery. It will get you through a day of moderate use, but overall battery life doesn’t seem quite as robust as it could be. If you’re a heavy user, you may be pushing your luck by the end of a long day of use. There’s another premium feature on board here, too: wireless charging at up to 15W. That’s something that’s still hard to come by in the $500-and-under class, and it’s only a little slower than the phone’s 18W wired charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1910Q"&gt;On the software side, the 20 Pro 5G ships with Android 11 and TCL has promised it two OS upgrades. One (or god forbid, none) is common in this class, so that’s great to see. However, it will get just two years of security updates, which lags behind Samsung and Google’s four- and three-year policies, respectively. You should get more than a couple of years of support out of a $500 phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JH6614"&gt;Otherwise, TCL’s take on Android is a good one. It’s highly customizable but doesn’t feel overly busy, with handy features like a tray for frequently used apps tucked away on the right-hand side of the screen, and the option to rearrange the order of system navigation buttons during setup. It’s a lot, but it feels like useful stuff rather than customization overkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pc-uvEmcDX2EsQ0JR-ebB7ndNm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693982/ajohnson_210630_4655_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are four camera sensors on the rear of the device, including a stabilized 48-megapixel main camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CF7tGL"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oDC2iD"&gt;The 20 Pro 5G includes a 48-megapixel f/1.8 main camera with optical image stabilization, which isn’t guaranteed at this price and is a real benefit in dim lighting conditions. There’s also a 16-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, and 2-megapixel depth sensor as well as a 32-megapixel selfie camera around front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40vSfH"&gt;The camera hardware is clearly capable of good things. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail in photos I took outside in good light — there’s some aggressive sharpening going on, but it’s not too distracting. However, there’s still room for improvement. Colors like greens and blues look a little unnatural and bright. Photos can look flat and washed out, and I spotted more lens flare in my images than I’d expect to see. It’s possible that this is an effect from the cameras’ recessed position rather than on a protruding bump, which would be a real shame — I’ll gladly take an uglier camera bump than flare in my photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D94MRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10634994"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="66E3QV"&gt;Portrait mode does a convincing enough job of separating subjects from a blurred background, though a disappointing number of my photos showed a little subject blur even with OIS assisting. “Super Night” mode is a bit of a miss. It seems to retain more detail in very low-light images compared to standard auto mode, but it also employs some heavy noise-reduction. Images show some unnatural smoothing and can skew a little too warm — personally I’d stick to auto mode for low-light shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDA8fP"&gt;All in all, the 20 Pro 5G’s camera capabilities are underwhelming. There are some real positives — OIS helps you get more steady shots and detail retention is good — but as a total package it’s not quite on par with the likes of the Pixel 4A 5G and Galaxy A52 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwa5VdasTJagR-lQ2UjV1gCvLJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693981/ajohnson_210630_4655_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While it offers some premium features for its price, the 20 Pro 5G is hard to recommend to just anyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YaZVgv"&gt;There’s a whole lot to like about the TCL 20 Pro 5G, but it still feels like a device that’s still shaking off some early-generation quirks. While it does offer some features and hardware you’d be hard-pressed to find on any other $500 phone, it’s not quite the total package that it should be for that price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBQNV5"&gt;There have been some important improvements over the first generation. The curved sides of the screen are less prone to accidental touches, and there have been some nice additions like the inclusion of wireless charging. Yet some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device: the Smart Key is still easy to press accidentally, the camera is basic, and Nxtvision is underwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jdEFyR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3c8nC"&gt;And then there’s network compatibility — in the US, it’s kind of a jigsaw puzzle to which only the established players have all of the pieces. Thanks to some of these missing pieces, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers won’t get the most out of this device and its 5G capabilities. And with only two years of security updates promised, it lags behind the competition in terms of longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CwH3IS"&gt;If you’re on T-Mobile and you’d really like a budget device with a flagship look and feel, then the 20 Pro 5G is a good option, with a strong caveat that you’ll be putting up with some issues that competitors have already figured out. Most others would do best to consider one of those $500 midrange heavyweights. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; offers a fast refresh rate screen, better network compatibility, and a solid four-year security support policy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;The Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt; is a good option, too, with a better camera — if you can find it still in stock. You won’t get a fancy curved display or the high-end build quality with either of those alternatives, but depending on your priorities, they may serve you better in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Qualcomm CEO sees former Apple execs as key to beating M1</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7p0LX3"&gt;Qualcomm’s new CEO, Cristiano Amon, has big plans for competing with Apple when it comes to laptop performance, thanks to the ex-Apple employees Qualcomm brought on when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;it acquired Nuvia earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-ceo-focus-idUSKCN2E75QY"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he believes Qualcomm could make the world’s best processor, which would require designing a chip better than Apple’s M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvbyn8"&gt;Before assuming his new role as CEO, Amon was head of Qualcomm’s semiconductor division and was in charge of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;acquisition of Nuvia for $1.4 billion&lt;/a&gt;. The startup was founded by three former Apple engineers who specialized in chip design and worked on Apple’s A-series SOCs. Those founders joined Qualcomm, and it’s apparent now that they’ll be focusing on making chips for consumer computers (though the company wouldn’t turn down the chance to license its tech to data centers, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;). Qualcomm hopes to start selling Arm laptop chips, powered by Nuvia’s designs, next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jm3rlX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple hasn’t added 5G, or any cellular compatibility at all, to its M1 Macs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="soFLVj"&gt;Amon also hopes to use the company’s experience in making 5G chips and smartphone processors to help provide a better laptop experience, by building 5G connectivity into its laptop-focused CPUs. Adding 5G, or any cellular compatibility at all, is something that Apple hasn’t done yet for its M1 Macs, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/macbook-air-and-pro-with-m1-opens-the-door-to-5g-it-cant-come-soon-enough/"&gt;despite demand from some&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;M1-powered iPad Pro has a 5G option&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NehvPD"&gt;It’s safe to say that if Qualcomm wants to become a dominant player in powering laptops like it is in the smartphone market, it has a lot of work to do. While Microsoft does use Qualcomm-designed chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496677/microsoft-surface-pro-x-refresh-sq2-processor-new-platinum-color-option"&gt;in its Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; (which made an appearance at the Windows 11 event), the list of &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile-computing/mobile-pcs"&gt;Windows PCs with Qualcomm inside&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a long one. It’s also unlikely that Intel is planning on just letting Arm take over the laptop space without a fight — the &lt;a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313803-intel-makes-it-official-hybrid-cpu-cores-arrive-with-alder-lake"&gt;company is working on hybrid CPUs&lt;/a&gt; that, like Arm, mix high-power and efficiency-focused cores to provide better battery life, but using an x86 architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxBCE8"&gt;Amon &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-ceo-focus-idUSKCN2E75QY"&gt;also talked to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about challenges and opportunities the company faces due to sanctions in China and about the company’s struggles to become a household name like Intel or AMD.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus is merging OxygenOS with Oppo’s ColorOS</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sxGtmt"&gt;Following last month’s announcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;that OnePlus was integrating with Oppo&lt;/a&gt;, effectively becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543184/oppo-oneplus-merger-brand-pete-lau-bbk-memo"&gt;a sub-brand of the phone manufacturer&lt;/a&gt;, the company &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/update-to-the-oxygenos-codebase-and-software-maintenance-schedule.1462181/"&gt;announced on Friday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s also merging OxygenOS with Oppo’s ColorOS operating system (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/02/oneplus-android-update-schedule-years-oxygenos-coloros/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuNLqJ"&gt;Both companies’ software will remain separate and continue to serve their individual regions (OxygenOS for OnePlus phones globally, ColorOS on OnePlus and Oppo devices in China) but share a common codebase, which OnePlus says should standardize its software experience and streamline the development process for future OxygenOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14iqGm"&gt;OnePlus says the change will also allow the company to guarantee better Android update  support going forward, something Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;has also tried to improve on&lt;/a&gt; in the last few years. OnePlus lays out the life span for updates as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="exG21w"&gt;Flagship phones including the T and R models get three major Android updates and four years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dpAw7u"&gt;Nord and Nord CE phones get two major Android updates and three years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FOtNuJ"&gt;Nord N phones will get one major Android update and three years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jIYDoF"&gt;OnePlus does limit those update commitments to the OnePlus 8 and up, so older OnePlus devices will be out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsAxF6"&gt;As the next step in whatever is going on with OnePlus, Oppo, and the wider BBK Electronics umbrella, merging the companies’ software on the backend seems like a net positive for OnePlus users. How independent OnePlus is now that it’s “integrated” seems about as unclear as when it was independent, owned by BBK, and seemingly sharing some parts with Oppo, but as long as phones are supported, it hopefully shouldn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
