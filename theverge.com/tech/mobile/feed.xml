    <title>T-Mobile delays shutdown of Sprint 3G network</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile has delayed its plans to shut down Sprint’s CDMA network | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kyB0TN"&gt;T-Mobile said it will delay its planned shutdown of Sprint’s 3G network by three months to ensure its “partners” have time to help customers with the transition. It had originally planned to phase out the network in January; that date has now been pushed to March 31st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Kh5mD"&gt;“Recently it’s become increasingly clear that some of those partners haven’t followed through on their responsibility to help their customers through this shift,” the company said in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Fupdate-on-our-cdma-network-transition-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F23%2F22741762%2Ftmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “So, we’re stepping up on their behalf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRagtl"&gt;T-Mobile’s statement doesn’t mention it by name, but likely is referring to Dish Network. The two sides have tangled over T-Mobile’s announcement it was shutting down Sprint’s legacy network, because of the impact it would have on Dish’s Boost Mobile customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSrfgT"&gt;As one of the conditions of the T-Mobile/Sprint Merger, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;Dish acquired Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in July, 2020 with the goal of Dish taking Sprint’s place as a fourth wireless carrier in the US. After T-Mobile announced it planned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;shut down Sprint’s CDMA network&lt;/a&gt;, Dish chairman Charlie Ergen compared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;T-Mobile to the Grinch&lt;/a&gt;, and later said his company was making every effort to migrate its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsLa4p"&gt;But T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Ffor-t-mobile-5g-connectivity-means-that-no-one-is-left-behind&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F23%2F22741762%2Ftmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that Dish was “dragging their feet in getting their customers upgraded to the superior 4G/5G world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGLj9w"&gt;Dish fired back on Monday; Jeff Blum, the company’s executive VP of external and legislative affairs said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that T-Mobile’s announcement “is a recognition that its premature shutdown of the CDMA network will harm consumers who rely on this network for critical connectivity, including 911.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAEr4d"&gt;Blum said that the additional time was “not nearly sufficient” to ensure that “over one million Boost customers— many of whom are low-income — projected to still need access to this network beyond March 31, 2022.” Supply chain cellphone shortages and COVID-related interruptions have slowed the upgrades, he added&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZrdWJ"&gt;“Given T-Mobile’s new admission that continuing the operation of its CDMA network will have ‘no material financial impact’ to its business and 5G buildout, we urge the company to live up to its promises to regulators,” Blum said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99YHwf"&gt;The Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618472/doj-letter-dish-t-mobile-3g-cdma-network-shutdown"&gt;Justice told Dish Network and T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in a July &lt;a href="https://dish.gcs-web.com/static-files/d0097e8d-56b9-486a-bc0a-1190e7141481"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; that it had “grave concerns” about the shutdown of Sprint’s legacy network, and urged both sides to take “all appropriate steps” to reduce the impact on customers who still rely on the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6gjLQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: October 25th 1:46PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statement from Dish Network EVP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy stores will soon offer Samsung foldable repairs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Best Buy store." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lg-MmU4YHeLxf9SRRQjTk6g-iIA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70041988/1336158138.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WbALcP"&gt;Samsung foldable owners will soon have more options for repairing their devices, with over 100 Best Buy stores gearing up to offer repairs in “early November,” &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/bestbuy/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The retailer is also officially offering repairs of Galaxy S and Galaxy Note devices as of today. Although some Best Buy stores offered similar repairs of these devices in the past, Samsung says this was previously a pilot program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpw77M"&gt;Expanding its repair options to foldables is important given the ongoing concerns people have about durability, especially when it comes to their internal folding displays. And when it comes to foldables, you’ll almost certainly want to turn to a professional for service. The devices are filled with stuff like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;tape, glue, and goo&lt;/a&gt;, which make successful home repairs very difficult to pull off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4pXevt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Foldables are hard to repair yourself&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1qXDZ6"&gt;As well as offering repairs on Samsung devices, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18691649/best-buy-apple-iphone-mac-ipad-repairs-all-stores"&gt;as of early 2019&lt;/a&gt; Best Buy also offers authorized repairs on Apple devices across its stores in the US. Easy access to replacement screens and batteries are important for prolonging the life span of devices, saving customers money, and decreasing the amount of electronic waste that ends up in landfills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJ5EKu"&gt;Samsung says it has a network of over 550 Authorized Care locations across the US, and that it also has over 600 independent service providers. The company also offers a doorstep repair service called “&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/service/we-come-to-you/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;We Come to You&lt;/a&gt;,” as well as a mail-in service. For a full list of Samsung devices that can be repaired at Best Buy, check out &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/http://www.samsung.com/us/support/bestbuy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9a1ibi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 25th, 11:28AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to clarify that Best Buy’s previous Samsung repair options were offered as part of a pilot program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stop annoying robocalls on your iPhone or Android phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="robocall" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ifKkE4MxbKXxLOul3EzAq-RBaSI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67382107/DSCF2964.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K0LsOJ"&gt;Mobile spam calls have been a nuisance for years. I get between four and six robocalls daily, and a quick survey of friends shows that I’m not alone. Every waking day brings with it a new barrage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDh4m1"&gt;Robocallers have upped their game by masking their spam with local, genuine-looking phone numbers. Sometimes their nonsense is amusing — like when you get a threatening voicemail about your impending arrest over owed back taxes — but the vast majority of the time, it’s an unwelcome distraction. It’s all too easy for these scammers to wield the power of the internet and fire off countless calls with ease. And once even just a few people fall for a scam, they’ve made enough profit to cover their trivial expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRGgSZ"&gt;Estimates put the number of robocalls in 2019 at over 50 billion. Both the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission say they’re doing their best to get a handle on the situation, and yes, there have been significant crackdowns. But real-world feedback indicates that things are getting worse — not better — and it can often feel out of control. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;The FCC has required that US carriers adopt a technology&lt;/a&gt; that will go a long way toward combatting spam calls. But we’re not quite there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nxu3tDtXZw3gxqt9gLDtlbqFqaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10355789/akrales_180305_2355_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rVf4pk"&gt;So if you’re as sick as I am of pulling a vibrating phone out of your pocket only to see a random, suspicious number, let’s go over the options for fighting back and restoring some sense of peace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fW6Fa"&gt;First, I’ll review some definitions since the carriers make important distinctions between these calls — even if they’re all unwelcome and annoying. Here’s how Verizon looks at things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7v0EJZ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Robocallers&lt;/strong&gt;: Automated, prerecorded phone messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gbn800"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Spammers&lt;/strong&gt;: Unwanted callers that may be calling indiscriminately to a large number of recipients; sometimes includes callers to whom you’ve given consent to contact you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p5FXjM"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fraud calls&lt;/strong&gt;: An entity likely pretending to be someone they’re not with malicious intent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3u4VE9"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option A&lt;/strong&gt;: Block individual numbers one by one&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uP22n2"&gt;This is probably a hopeless endeavor if you’re aiming to completely eradicate robocalls, but if there’s a particular number that keeps calling, it’s fairly easy to block it forever from your iPhone or Android phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ocFu4"&gt;On iOS, just go to the Phone app, then your Recents, tap the blue information icon to the right of the number you want to block, and select “Block this Caller.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeQtPq"&gt;For Android, the process isn’t much different: go to the Recents section of the Phone app, long press on the bothersome number, and choose “Block.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkuaeK"&gt;Again, this will take a lot of persistent work on your part to keep the spammers away — and it does no good against blocked or private callers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kt8cHd"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option B&lt;/strong&gt;: Trust (or pay) your carrier to protect you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RT4nE6"&gt;Most of the major mobile providers have taken steps to insert themselves as a barrier between you and these annoying callers. They’ve done this through behind-the-scenes network improvements, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;SHAKEN/STIR technology&lt;/a&gt; that has started making it possible for carriers to verify when a call is legitimate and weed out the many spoofed numbers you’re probably getting from your own local area code. In reality, those calls are probably coming from across the globe, but it’s easy for robocallers to impersonate local numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Oqx9w"&gt;All of the major US carriers offer some level of spam blocking for free as part of your wireless plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luQmc1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/features/security-apps.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call Protect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available for free for all postpaid customers. $3.99 / month for the Plus version&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NIOIuAjtiLTfYFbGY1TYSy_DcB4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21866449/Screen_Shot_2020_09_09_at_11.55.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7ApA4Y"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has a free service, Call Protect, that’s designed to block fraudulent robocalls and likely spam risks before they reach you, and you won’t have to do anything besides install the software on your phone. Call Protect won’t completely stop telemarketer calls, but it will at least display a “nuisance warning” when you receive those. The service also makes it easy to permanently block callers, and you can build a personal block list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOPiBs"&gt;There is also a Call Protect Plus service that offers caller ID, reverse number lookup, and the ability to block or send calls to voicemail by category. These added features cost $3.99 per month, but the main Call Protect service comes free as part of your plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pAJJt"&gt;Call Protect is also available to prepaid customers if they own an AT&amp;amp;T HD Voice-capable phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sJfB6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/at-t-call-protect/id1181632589"&gt;Download for iPhone&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.att.callprotect&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Download for Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgfzS9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fplans-features%2Fblock-unwanted-calls&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scam Shield and Scam Block&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available for free for all postpaid customers. $4 / month for Scam Shield Premium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qrYkOLJIb_Cz70nj7RID312AZY4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21866327/Screen_Shot_2020_09_09_at_11.17.54_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: T-Mobile&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FJ7j6w"&gt;T-Mobile’s effort to combat annoying robocalls is called &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcustomers%2Fscam-shield&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Scam Shield&lt;/a&gt;. The free-to-download Scam Shield app bundles all of T-Mobile’s various tools — Scam ID, Scam Block, and Caller ID — so you can easily configure whatever level of protection is right for you. By default, suspicious calls are always flagged. Enabling Scam Block will prevent many of them from ever ringing your phone. And T-Mobile’s Caller ID service will frequently show the information for whoever’s calling you, even if they’re not in your contacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoOUyp"&gt;You can always turn on Scam Block without the Scam Shield app. To do so, dial #662# from your T-Mobile phone. To disable it, just dial #632#. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2jABw"&gt;Scam Shield goes beyond just blocking bad calls: you can also request a secondary “proxy” number that you can use in instances where you don’t want to share your private phone number. And if you find yourself hopelessly inundated, T-Mobile will let you change your actual number once per year for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8wyqM"&gt;For an added $4 per month per line, you can upgrade to Scam Shield Premium, which lets you “send entire categories of unwanted robocalls directly to voicemail, like telemarketers; create ‘always block’ lists; and get voicemail-to-text for at-a-glance access to your voicemails.” (Customers with Magenta Max plans get Scam Shield Premium for free.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sEtWl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon Wireless: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizonwireless.com%2Fsolutions-and-services%2Fcall-filter%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;l Filter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available free for all postpaid customers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eurjIJRnBSx_H_bute7qt9rVYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10348535/Screen_Shot_2018_03_05_at_2.27.22_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NuHL4X"&gt;Verizon’s Call Filter service, free for postpaid lines, allows customers to “get alerts when a call is likely spam, report unsolicited numbers, and automatically block robocalls based on their preferred level of risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTOAfR"&gt;For no charge, you can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizonwireless.com%2Fsupport%2Fblock-numbers%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;block up to five phone numbers&lt;/a&gt; that you want to prevent from contacting you. However, blocks expire after 90 days and aren’t very helpful against robocallers with numbers that change every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6Vb1n"&gt;You can get more features, such as the ability to create a personal block list, for $2.99 a month per line. The Verizon Smart Family plan offers additional features, including parental controls and the ability to permanently block as many as ten numbers, for $4.99 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HbQb9f"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option C&lt;/strong&gt;: Protect yourself with third-party apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="K5ADcW"&gt;There are a number of services, such as Nomorobo, RoboKiller, and Hiya, that are designed to prevent robocalls from ever ringing your phone. Most of them require a monthly (or annual) subscription. At their core, these services rely on a constantly updating list of robocallers, spammers, and fraudsters and use that database to stop nuisance calls. (When I say “constantly updating,” I mean they’re identifying thousands of bad numbers every day.) A call comes in, and the service runs it against that huge list of scam numbers. If it finds a match, the incoming call gets shut down before it reaches you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbTGHUlqcfFdpZbdA4n1UKLmtVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10357151/Screen_Shot_2018_03_06_at_2.50.48_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QohVLJ"&gt;All of them allow you to maintain your own personal blacklist of numbers that might be bothering you and whitelist those you want to get through. Some work by downloading a dedicated contacts list — separate from your regular contacts — to your phone. But both iOS and Android have recently given these services more leeway in taking control over your phone app and stopping the jerks from ever reaching you. On iPhone, you’ll have to enable them in the Settings app and give them caller ID permissions before they can start working. Apple shows you how to do that &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099"&gt;step-by-step right here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVpXNO"&gt;I’d recommend looking into each of these services to see which one you like best. All of them are largely well-reviewed by customers, and all offer free trials to get started. One of these will ultimately be what you need to really fight back against the robocalls. It’s just a matter of finding your favorite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="8Q4UUQ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option D:&lt;/strong&gt; Depend on your mobile OS to protect you&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ya016nQKUOe0-yNZtWWEUQ-lrGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10357035/apps_smart_call_kv_pc.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A6tyvX"&gt;Many Android phones — including those from Samsung and Google — have built-in options for flagging suspected spam calls. If you’ve got a Google Pixel device, the entire screen will turn red when a spammer rings you, which is an easy way of knowing to ignore the call if you’re across the room from your phone. On Pixel phones, you can also tap the three dots in the upper right corner of the Phone app and then go to Settings &amp;gt; Caller ID &amp;amp; spam; you can then see spam IDs and filter spam calls. Other phones will have similar features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZ8pDN"&gt;iOS 13 introduced its own app called Silence Unknown Callers, which blocks any callers that aren’t in your contact list, haven’t been in contact with, or haven’t texted. Instead, those calls will go straight to voicemail. You can enable it by selecting Settings &amp;gt; Phone &amp;gt; Silence Unknown Callers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Sk8sol"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Nuclear Option:&lt;/strong&gt; Use Do Not Disturb to only allow calls from your contacts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Jy7xYw"&gt;On both Android and iOS, you can set each operating system’s Do Not Disturb mode to allow phone calls from only those people and businesses in your contacts list. This is a pretty drastic, sledgehammer solution to the problem of robocalls, and you’re almost certain to miss calls that you would’ve liked to have answered. But those calls will go through to voicemail, and then you can add that number to your contacts for the future. I’d still only recommend this option if you’re &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; fed up, and only if you’re very good and meticulous about keeping contacts up to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WAranM"&gt;Why do more and more spam calls look like they’re coming from a local number?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3z8si2"&gt;It’s super annoying, isn't it? It’s a trick called neighborhood spoofing, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.robokiller.com%2Fblog%2Flocal-call%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RoboKiller has a good explainer on it here&lt;/a&gt;. In short, scammers think that a number matching your area code (and maybe even the first digits of your own number) will trick your brain and make you more likely to answer. And it makes their deception feel even more nefarious. What if it’s a family emergency? Maybe it’s your doctor’s office or the pharmacy? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EyjcD"&gt;Thankfully, the robocall blocker apps have gotten better at spotting neighborhood spoofing. RoboKiller claims it’s been good at doing so since the beginning, and Nomorobo has also made detecting neighborhood spoofing a major focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cXa47e"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Don’t forget to add yourself to the Do Not Call Registry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="slsnjn"&gt;In theory, telemarketers are supposed to be honoring the &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0108-national-do-not-call-registry"&gt;National Do Not Call Registry&lt;/a&gt;. You can add yourself to the list by visiting &lt;a href="http://www.donotcall.gov"&gt;www.donotcall.gov&lt;/a&gt;. The FTC says to allow 31 days for legitimate telemarketer sales calls to stop. Once you’ve signed up, your presence on the Do Not Call Registry never lapses or expires, contrary to some recent rumors. There’s no reason to renew or re-add your number to the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hHGVI"&gt;The Do Not Call Registry only covers &lt;em&gt;sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;calls. Charities, political groups, debt collectors, and surveys are still allowed to call you once you’ve signed up. The same goes for companies that you might’ve recently done business with. (You might be able to stop this specific type by verbally telling them to stop calling you.) Unfortunately, scammers / robocallers don’t pay the DNC Registry any mind and just ignore the thing entirely. These robots answer to no one, so you’re better off circling back to one of the solutions earlier in this article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BpDOis"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Never let the robots know you’re a real human&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CTiJtD"&gt;Tempting as it might be to swear up and down at a robocaller or scammer, your best course of action is to leave them unsure as to whether they connected with an actual person. Don’t say anything. Don’t push buttons — even if the robotic voice says doing so will prevent further calls. Put no faith or trust in the robot voice. Either just let it go through to voicemail or hang up immediately if you mistakenly picked up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QCE5gr"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Complain to the FTC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wZrSyK"&gt;When all else fails and you’re consumed by despair and anger over the never-ending interruptions, you can always report callers to the FTC. They’re not going to pursue every individual complaint, but it’s certainly important to keep the commission aware of the magnitude of this problem. And as I said earlier, sometimes the FTC &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/01/ftc-announces-crackdown-two-massive-illegal-robocall-operations"&gt;does actually take down&lt;/a&gt; some of these scammers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mC8bMy"&gt;Even with all of these tools in place, it’s unlikely you’ll avoid every robocall or spammer. But it should help ease the avalanche you’re probably experiencing right now. And hopefully, when all carriers get call verification up and running, you’ll be able to start trusting your caller ID again and actually answer calls more often than not. But at least in 2021, that’s still wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG: New State arrives on iOS and Android on November 11th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EPNtL00A7dQnLYcHRPZOGQPQgZA=/0x0:1894x1263/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70029953/msedge_dX2AbABxCv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Krafton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SOEq8q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt;, the upcoming free-to-play mobile game, will release on iOS and Android on November 11th, its &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/krafton-to-globally-launch-pubg-new-state-on-nov-11-857106352.html"&gt;publisher Krafton announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The game is set in the year 2051, and will offer a futuristic take on the multiplayer-focused PUBG formula with new features like weapon customization and in-game drones. &lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; will be available in over 200 countries and 17 languages at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0nwwi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; is a significant launch for the PUBG series, which popularized the battle royale genre after the launch of its first title in 2017. Although &lt;em&gt;New State &lt;/em&gt;isn’t its first mobile entry, following the launch of PUBG Mobile in 2018, it’s the first to have been made by the game’s original developer, PUBG Studios. Development of the original PUBG Mobile was handled primarily by Chinese tech giant Tencent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZgTyPn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Strong anti-cheat” measures have been promised&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aySGaS"&gt;PUBG Studios emphasizes that New State will come with “strong anti-cheat” measures at launch, and that the company will be actively monitoring the community to catch problems before they grow too widespread. The PUBG games have had big problems with cheaters in the past, with &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ywj3/inside-the-worlds-largest-video-game-cheating-empire"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that one cheat-making group allegedly made over $70 million selling cheats for PUBG Mobile. PUBG is far from the only game to have had these problems, however. Other companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724037/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-system-kernel-level-driver"&gt;Activision&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games"&gt;Valve &lt;/a&gt;have made news recently with their efforts to prevent cheating in their games and hardware, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBZJMh"&gt;Like previous PUBG games, &lt;em&gt;New State &lt;/em&gt;is centered around multiplayer matches. Up to 100 players enter a map, and one player or squad emerges victorious. There’ll be four maps available at launch in &lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt;, including franchise staple Erangel, and PUBG Studios is promising to regularly update it with new content over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjlDMD"&gt;Away from mobile, Krafton plans to release another PUBG-related game for PC and consoles by next year, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-18/coding-prodigy-behind-hit-game-pubg-eyes-ipo-worth-billions?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported in January&lt;/a&gt;. There are also plans for a new survival horror game set in the PUBG universe three centuries in the future, which will release in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwakPS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s95wND"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit took a peek underneath the Apple Watch Series 7’s larger display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 7 teardown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQtiqu6CTaHpkru5HduODV1SUKA=/0x245:5843x4140/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70029041/Apple_Watch_S7_21_guide_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 teardown | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/53688/three-former-apple-engineers-helped-us-tear-down-apple-watch-series-7" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dYGSz2"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;our review of the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, Dieter Bohn called it the best smartwatch while noting the new model’s changes as “smaller iterations” year-over-year than we previously expected. Even those small improvements required some reengineering. To appreciate those efforts, the folks from&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F53688%2Fthree-former-apple-engineers-helped-us-tear-down-apple-watch-series-7&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F21%2F22738876%2Fapple-watch-series-7-teardown-ifixit-diagnostic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; iFixit teamed up with former Apple engineers to investigate the new parts&lt;/a&gt; and get some insight into how the changes came to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fJoxT4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2lD2llGLJzk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JmSg7r"&gt;Ex-Apple product designer Tobias is now with &lt;a href="https://instrumental.com/about?utm_medium=Network&amp;amp;utm_source=Partner%20Referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Content&amp;amp;utm_group=ifixit&amp;amp;utm_subgroup="&gt;Instrumental&lt;/a&gt;. He points out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lD2llGLJzk"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt; that by looking at the back of the display, we can see that for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, Apple removed a ribbon cable, combining touch and display signals into one cable instead of two. That helped shrink the device’s bezels, but Tobias says in a video that he’s “fairly certain” the complexity of that change and how it rippled through the supply chain is the reason why this Watch was slightly delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYGtzD"&gt;A more surprising moment is when they found out that the Apple Watch Series 6 battery fits in, and works with, the newer model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDSNXT"&gt;Of course, another element of the teardown is what’s not inside the new Apple Watch — an old diagnostic port. Since the earliest versions, it had been hiding inside the watch’s wristband groove, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690061/apple-watch-series-7-wireless-dock-data-transfer-port-free"&gt;now Apple has replaced it with wireless technology&lt;/a&gt;. Is this a hint at an iPhone without ports? We can’t tell yet, but the teardown will show you how everything came together to make the device less susceptible to cracking, better at resisting dust and water, and just that tiny bit better than the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is white-labeling Google Stadia to give you free Batman game streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Batman Arkham Knight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SiLmkRgx4hYWZlBxSCG8_rfA-5g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027946/533ca3dcc5607.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dhvWOn"&gt;Months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;we predicted that Stadia would soon become a white-label cloud-gaming service&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T appears to be taking Google up on the idea. AT&amp;amp;T is offering a free browser-based version of &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt; exclusively for wireless customers that makes use of Stadia’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxzk2P"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;confirmed that its new game streaming experience runs on Google Stadia’s tech (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/21/att-confirms-stadia-arkham-knight-teases-cloud-gaming-ambitions/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Google announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;the shutdown of its internal Stadia game studio&lt;/a&gt; in February. While Stadia is still available and supported by Google, the studio shutdown means Google is relying on third parties to provide all the games, and it opens up the potential for Google’s partners to use the tech.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Arkham Knight demo" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KCBJ3yKyUQMVFgIpO9PSUrP-fDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945285/batman_arkham_knight_att.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WssIXv"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is apparently the first of those partners — it released &lt;a href="https://more.att.com/play/batman/"&gt;a browser-based demo of &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This is being powered by the Stadia technology,” an AT&amp;amp;T representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “For this demo AT&amp;amp;T created a front end experience to enable gamers to play &lt;em&gt;Batman Arkham Knight &lt;/em&gt;directly from their own website and the game is playable on virtually any computer or laptop.” Although AT&amp;amp;T calls it a “demo,” there’s no mention of length, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXnYZsmf-Ao"&gt;as shown in a short walkthrough of the experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5AUFYd"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also adds that you can stream &lt;em&gt;Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt; at up to 1080p and 60fps, which is the same performance you’ll get if you use Stadia for free. Paid Stadia Pro subscribers have the ability to stream up to 4K at 60fps, for which AT&amp;amp;T doesn’t offer an option. On the &lt;em&gt;Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;page, AT&amp;amp;T notes that the game will be “available for a limited time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWT634"&gt;We also asked AT&amp;amp;T whether the company would be working on similar Stadia-powered games in the future or if it planned on establishing a game streaming service for customers. AT&amp;amp;T wasn’t able to share any additional details, but its dip into Stadia technology may open the door for other companies to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOpuzK"&gt;Will other companies &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to partner with Stadia? Stadia’s servers may be in need of a hardware upgrade soon, and there’s no word on when that will happen. Currently, &lt;a href="https://stadia.dev/about/"&gt;the hardware in Stadia’s servers is still the same&lt;/a&gt; as when the service first launched in 2019, consisting of a custom 2.7GHz x86 processor, a custom AMD GPU offering up to 10.7 teraflops of processing power, and 16GB of RAM. In theory, this should promise powerful performance, however, that didn’t really pan out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;our Stadia review&lt;/a&gt; — we discovered that 4K looked closer to 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tCt3I"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738006/nvidia-rtx-3080-geforce-now-features-price-release-date-streaming-option"&gt;Nvidia just announced that it plans on equipping its GeForce Now servers with hardware equivalent to the RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; by the end of this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546139/xbox-xcloud-series-x-hardware-games-servers-datacenters"&gt;Microsoft even upgraded its xCloud servers&lt;/a&gt; with Xbox Series X hardware in June. Stadia will need a plan to upgrade its own hardware if it wants to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 101: how to free up space on your phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_tKj4Zu4bODR5smc6AEbt_v0Lw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027682/acastro_180413_1777_android_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IzRTjs"&gt;It can happen all too easily, especially if you’ve got an Android phone with less than 128GB of storage: one day, you try to install a cool new game or an intriguing new app, and you can’t. You’ve run out of space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoqml5"&gt;Don’t panic. If you’re not ready to buy a new phone, and your phone doesn’t have a handy microSD slot for some extra storage, you can probably still pick up a decent amount of free space with some simple house cleaning. Here are some suggestions on how to get back some of that storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eiWtyM"&gt;Note: These were tested using a Pixel 3 phone running Android 12. Depending on your phone’s make and operating system, your directions may vary slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GnNVLi"&gt;Use Android’s “Free up space” tool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xuRMFJ"&gt;Android has a built-in tool to help you increase the amount of useable storage on your phone. It’s easy to find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TKpz8N"&gt;Go to your phone’s settings, and select “Storage.” You’ll see information on how much space is in use and a list of file categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kyOaXr"&gt;Tap on the “Free up space” button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DD4kWK"&gt;You’ll be moved to Google’s Files app — specifically, to its “Clean” feature, which offers suggestions on how to free up space by getting rid of junk files, deleted screenshots, large photos, backed-up media, and unused apps; there may be other suggestions as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on the “Free up space” button to help clean up your phone’s storage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtE_I-qwQ4dYONX_tSzTN2bQ9ao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944616/Screenshot_20211021_101947.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Free up space” button can help clean up your phone’s storage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Files app can offer a number of ways to clear out old files." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RCGLmGszvbcKznMaBGpRZ5D21dI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944618/Screenshot_20211021_102518.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Files app can offer a number of ways to clear out old files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCo26D"&gt;There are other handy tools in the “Storage” section. For example, you can find out how much space each of your apps takes up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xxSLLB"&gt;In Storage, tap on Apps. You’ll get a list of all your apps, along with how much space each is taking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vMLIW5"&gt;Tap on the app name. You can now see the app size, how much of the available storage is being used by user data, and how much space is being used by the cache. Two buttons let you either “Clear storage” or “Clear cache.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Storage &amp;amp;gt; Apps, you can see how much space apps take up." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q5vRn88E-Mh0tgJh57uGkq-__kw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944644/Screenshot_20211021_103604.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Storage &amp;gt; Apps, you can see how much space apps take up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s a good idea to clear your cache to save space." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rURyrDAFS7hX86azSGySFMopMJg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944647/Screenshot_20211021_103415__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good idea to clear your cache to save space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MuovL5"&gt;(Note for newbies: it is usually safe to clear the cache. However, before you hit “Clear storage,” check to see what your user data is. You don’t want to accidentally delete any important media or documents.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HyaVI"&gt;Finally, there is a hidden toggle for a feature called “Smart Storage,” which gives your phone permission to automatically remove backed-up photos after 60 days. It will also automatically remove backed-up photos and videos if the storage on your device has less than 25 percent space left. You turn it on (or off) via Google’s Files app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zTA1bh"&gt;Open the Files app and tap the three parallel lines in the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X5eehG"&gt;Select Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CFCEX5"&gt;Look for the Smart Storage setting and toggle it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to the Settings for the Files app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCLizfkd2YJew9Jum2uJfYX15Tg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944706/Screenshot_20211021_110015.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to the Settings for the Files app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle Smart Storage on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Unp5i_gHMXB4-8zdvf9rgl8gLaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944708/Screenshot_20211021_105955.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle Smart Storage on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DVu23o"&gt;Check your apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LfqXSH"&gt;A good way to save space is to make sure you’re not clogging up the works with apps that you haven’t used in months. It’s all too easy to download an app, try it out, and then let it sit while you go on to other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dU6ZS4"&gt;If you’re curious about how long it’s been since you’ve used certain apps, here’s how to find out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hulp9E"&gt;Tap on your Play Store app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QEVczG"&gt;Tap on your personal icon in the upper right corner and select “Manage apps &amp;amp; device.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PAFbZt"&gt;Select the Manage tab. On the line below that, the Installed button should be highlighted; if it isn’t, tap on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cDSWR8"&gt;To the right of the Apps heading, you’ll see the sorting icon. Tap on that and select “Least used.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BSQKva"&gt;Now, you can see the apps that you’ve only used occasionally (if at all) on top of the list. You won’t necessarily want to get rid of them — sometimes an app is fine to have around just in case — but you might catch some that you really don’t need anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Files app helps you manage all the apps on your phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/avt6qS7iG2hmSSYxa3QIksBQtfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944742/Screenshot_20211021_111012.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Files app helps you manage all the apps on your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can sort your apps by the least used." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zYuGF4Ymka3C3_OyTyJpETLH3DI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944744/Screenshot_20211021_111215.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can sort your apps by the least used.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xb0HvW"&gt;Store your photos online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XMjVh5"&gt;Photos and videos can be some of the most space-hogging items on your phone. Luckily, if you’ve got an Android phone, you’re probably already uploading your photos to Google Photos — and can therefore take them off your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOb173"&gt;First, check to make sure you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; backing up your photos to your Google account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Uc7FJR"&gt;Open the Photos app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6oS59e"&gt;Tap on your personal icon in the upper right corner. If you’re backing up your photos, you should see a “Backup complete” entry in the drop-down menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wt5x8P"&gt;If you’re not backing up your photos, then select “Photos settings” &amp;gt; “Back up &amp;amp; sync.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gUql0a"&gt;Make sure that the “Back up &amp;amp; sync” toggle on top of the page is set to “On.” You should also check which account is listed under “Backup Account.” If you have more than one account, you can switch to whichever you want to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If your phone is not backing up your photos, go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Back up &amp;amp;amp; sync. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yTz95_E-c2wHG6cVWa8nd64KsTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945196/Screenshot_20211021_112556.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your phone is not backing up your photos, go to Settings &amp;gt; Back up &amp;amp; sync. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle “Back up &amp;amp;amp; sync” on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fqDamRNGTmSfAsAVqlXSkeWfLuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945198/Screenshot_20211021_112627.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle “Back up &amp;amp; sync” on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dZTR3V"&gt;There are other options as well. For example, you can choose the quality of the photos you want to upload and whether you want the phone to upload photos when you’re using cellular data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFP21g"&gt;Now that you’re sure your photos are being backed up, you can delete them from your phone. It’s very likely that there is already a notice on top of the Photo app’s front page offering to free up memory from your device; if not, it’s easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ceuxav"&gt;In the “Photo settings” menu, tap on “Free up device storage.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JMW25G"&gt;You’ll get a window saying how much memory and how many items will be removed. Select the “Free up XX” at the bottom of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll be told how much space you’ll free up." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hyHqVsxGVY2994HzZxSEkf0s0F8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945214/Screenshot_20211021_113030.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll be told how much space you’ll free up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Keeping your photos in the cloud will save space on your phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RGYWF6Z2DNaB-LmPOeXnMjD5JQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945215/Screenshot_20211021_134620.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keeping your photos in the cloud will save space on your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TliatA"&gt;Still running out of space? Then, unfortunately — or luckily, if you’re looking for a good excuse — it may be time to start thinking about a new phone, one with more storage space and perhaps that also offers you the chance to offload your data onto a micro-SD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dt8xtE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 21st, 2021, 2:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on August 9th, 2019, and has been updated to account for changes in Android.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s Nova 9 is its latest smartphone to launch globally sans Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sb-RDQcjHh7R152PgcdWDuFZNTI=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025998/huawei_nova_9_1_mob_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s Nova 9.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2z0MQ4"&gt;Huawei’s Nova 9 is getting a global launch just under a month after the phone was &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_nova_9_series_announced_with_snapdragon_778g_4g_chipsets_up_to_100w_charging_-news-51106.php"&gt;announced for the Chinese market&lt;/a&gt;, the company said today. Huawei characterizes the Nova 9 as a “flagship smartphone for the younger generation,” compared to its Mate series (high-tech and premium) and P-series (photography) lineups. Pre-orders open today with pricing starting at €499, and Huawei says the phone will be on sale from November 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OY7tmv"&gt;The company also gave an update on the global release status of the P50, the flagship phone Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598135/huawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras"&gt;announced for the domestic Chinese market in July&lt;/a&gt;. The company says the P50 will release outside of China in 2022, which will come roughly two years after the release of its predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21278958/huawei-p40-pro-review-camera-price-specs-features"&gt;P40&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYXQMz"&gt;Thanks to Huawei’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;ongoing presence on the USA’s entity list&lt;/a&gt;, the Nova 9 will once again ship without Google’s apps or services, including the Google Play Store, which will severely limit its appeal outside of China. Instead, it runs Huawei’s Harmony OS-branded software, which shares a lot of similarities with the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;open-source version of Android&lt;/a&gt;, only with Huawei’s apps, services, and app store replacing Google’s versions. The P50 will likely suffer the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RwemAqXW6RzbgNA1lw79gtoUNvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941587/huawei_nova_9_pro_colours_4_mob_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Huawei&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nova 9 is launching globally in black and blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FXwqpr"&gt;The Nova 9 is powered by a Snapdragon 778G rather than one of Huawei’s in-house Kirin chips, following the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;problems with Kirin production&lt;/a&gt;. Around back, there’s an array of four cameras: a 50-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth camera, and a 2-megapixel macro. Meanwhile, on the front you’ll find a 32-megapixel selfie camera inside a hole-punch notch in its 1080p, 120Hz 6.57-inch curved OLED display. Its 4,300mAh battery can be fast charged at 66W, which Huawei says should refill its battery in 38 minutes. There’s no mention of 5G support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJGtgA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 21st, 11:27AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with pricing and release date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL’s Verizon tablet is the only one you’ll find with 5G for $399</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QqrGLl8LDKRO8kQSeR_VEQ_nXmw=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025439/tcl_5g_tablet.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PiMOyo"&gt;TCL, the company best known for its affordable Roku-equipped 4K TVs, has a new budget-oriented $399.99 5G tablet — the Tab Pro 5G. The device is available to order via Verizon’s online “Buy More, Save More” promo, which takes $100 off if purchased with a qualifying Android device on a Verizon plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRryU4"&gt;Similar to its newer TVs that now offer Google TV in the US, TCL’s Tab Pro 5G continues the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;trend&lt;/a&gt; with a standard set of Google apps... alongside the expected mass of Verizon bloatware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It comes in one color" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kUiJ3EgRl-CdUj2jVRdn3L2G4TE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944409/Screen_Shot_2021_10_21_at_8.41.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tablet is meant to be held in widescreen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1PM6zb"&gt;Tablets with 5G have not entered this price point yet. Verizon also sells the $669.99 Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE 5G and the $649 iPad Mini with 5G. However, if you want an iPad with high-speed mmWave connections like this TCL slate has, your cheapest option is an 11-inch iPad Pro that starts at about $1,000. The technology’s limited range means it’s more useful if the signal is available within a block or two of where you live and play, but at this price point there just aren’t any other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZqbMS"&gt;The TCL Tab Pro 5G’s 10.36-inch (1200 x 2000 resolution) “NXTVISION” LCD screen is accompanied by stereo speakers that together provide an “impressive cinematic experience,” according to the company. Dark mode, reader mode, and a software HDR effect are included. Parents can screen-nanny their kids longer with a fast-charging 8,000mAh battery that TCL says can endure up to 17 hours of mixed use and can work as a power bank to charge your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFXQCU"&gt;Optics include a front 8MP camera with face unlock and a rear 13MP shooter with LED flash and 1080p video capability. There’s no headphone jack, but the company includes a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box along with an 18W charger. On the edges of the tablet, you’ll also find a USB-C connector, fingerprint sensor, volume buttons, dual microphones, and what seems to be a five-pin accessory connector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 5-pin port of the TCL TAB Pro 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SjMC2AyzygpAktRU-MgsZz8Odk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944401/Screen_Shot_2021_10_21_at_8.39.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mysterious five-pin connector is visible on the bottom of the landscape-oriented Tab Pro 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1rho03"&gt;The TCL Tab Pro 5G is equipped with Verizon mmWave and 802.11ac Wi-Fi (no Wi-Fi 6 here), 64GB of internal storage (expandable up to 1TB via microSD), and it’s running Android 11. With an eight-core Snapdragon 480 5G SoC and 4GB of RAM, it can probably handle light to medium gaming and a bit of productivity on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ST3RH7o1_mOUSZxfGy4nhE4wo5I=/152x0:1768x1077/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016186/lcimg_e5568f90_70f5_4d74_938b_5d1c34060e11.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can preorder Google’s just-announced Pixels.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p512wU"&gt;Google’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are freshly announced&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re already up for preorder. These Pixels promise new designs, new cameras, a uniquely designed Google Tensor CPU, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57DFat"&gt;This year’s Pixel phones come in two sizes: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;the standard Pixel 6 and the larger, triple-camera equipped Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The base Pixel 6, with 128GB of storage, starts at $599, while the Pixel 6 Pro runs $899 and up if you prefer to go above the base 128GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="samX3I"&gt;WHAT’S NEW&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jTBVbQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 and 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; look mostly nothing like prior iterations, with a metal and glass design highlighted by a rear camera bar that is slightly reminiscent of the classic Nexus 6P. These are big phones. The smaller Pixel 6, which cannot truly be considered small by any stretch of the imagination, has a 6.4-inch 2400x1080 OLED 90Hz display. The larger Pixel 6 Pro stretches its legs with a huge 6.7-inch 3120x1440 LTPO OLED 120Hz screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzGN0n"&gt;On the inside, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;Google’s brand new Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt; powers both, while the Pixel 6 gets 8GB of RAM, and the 6 Pro has 12GB. The new chips have a lot to prove for Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;just as the new camera systems do&lt;/a&gt; — with the Pixel 6 housing a dual-camera setup and the 6 Pro adding a third camera and lens to its rear bar. The phones match each other with 50-megapixel main cameras and a 12-megapixel ultrawide, but only the Pro counterpart gets a 48-megapixel sensor complete with telephoto 4x optical zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpMCfQ"&gt;Time will tell if all this hardware and new camera software brings the Pixels back to the top of the pack, but in the meantime, let’s look at how the Pixel 6 phones are configured and available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x26RG3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the Pixel 6 compares to the Pixel 6 Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22724481/google-pixel-6-pro-specs-comparison-price"},{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="af9xF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10816444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Fl3bAs"&gt;WHERE TO PREORDER THE PIXEL 6 AND PIXEL 6 PRO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3iYB8E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US"&gt;Google has kicked off its preorders on its own store&lt;/a&gt; first, right as the phone became official. The release date for the phones is Thursday, October 28th. Though, like most phone launches these days, delays may be expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO9lWc"&gt;We will update this post as more options become available, but we can immediately see how some models are not available everywhere — if a 512GB Pixel 6 Pro is your jam, your only option is Google at this time. So far, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfO5wFAh05o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-5g-unlocked-128gb%2F-%2FA-84683612%3Fpreselect%3D83607398%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergepixel6preorders" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1665071-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02900_us_pixel_6_dual_sim_128gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; are all taking preorders for both Pixels with at least the base 128GB storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4YOc6"&gt;Deals on new phones are tough to come by, but the best preorder deal going around for an unlocked Pixel 6 or 6 Pro is a free pair of Pixel Buds A wireless earbuds included with your purchase. The Pixel Buds A are Google’s budget-friendly earbuds, but they’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a solid set that is more worthwhile than the more expensive Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt; — and free is free. You can currently get this promo with all of those preorders from Google, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H, and Target. Just note that some retailers like &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-pixel-buds-a-series-wireless-headphones%2F-%2FA-83360244&amp;amp;subid1=vergepixel6preorders" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target may require you to add the Pixel Buds A to your cart manually&lt;/a&gt;, and they might be out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FfBJXi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815891"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZBa1GT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815902"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gHSBMR"&gt;Carrier deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qBhCBk"&gt;If you’re not shopping for an unlocked phone and prefer to utilize promos and payment plans from your carrier, there are some offers from the likes of AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Google’s own Fi service. Bear in mind that carriers give discounts as bill credits over time, attempting to rope you into service for 36 months or more. The Pixel 6 models offered from &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-128gb-stormy-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; (including Verizon models bought on Google’s store) have radios for mmWave 5G, which cost upward of $100 more and still may not give you faster speeds depending on where you live and use the phone. Pixel 6 Pro phones, unlocked or bought through a carrier, work with mmWave 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bskHg6"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fwxgST"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is offering up to $700 off the &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-128gb-cloudy-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a qualifying trade-in for new and existing customers, and 50 percent off of any Google-branded accessories purchased simultaneously. The base &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-128gb-stormy-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; 128GB model costs $15 per month over 36 months without a trade-in, but keep in mind that the mmWave-equipped model AT&amp;amp;T is selling is fully priced at $740 and not the base $599 of unlocked models using only Sub-6 5G. The $15 per month over 36 months will result in a total price of $540, reflecting the $200 AT&amp;amp;T will discount over time via bill credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="X9W7Oc"&gt;Verizon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pPtJqr"&gt;Verizon’s offers are similar promo, with up to $700 off a &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a trade-in— though this is limited to new customers switching over. Existing customers can get up to $350 off when trading in a phone and upgrading a line. If you’re shopping for more than one Pixel device, you can buy one and get a second Pixel 6 or 6 Pro for up to $700 off (given to you in billing credits over time; you’ll pay in full upfront) with eligible unlimited plans. The base Pixel 6 on a payment plan from Verizon will run $23.33 per month for 30 months, totaling $700 and a one-time $35 activation fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74YwEQ"&gt;If you want to buy a Pixel 6 for Verizon’s network &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;direct from Google&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll also receive up to $100 in Google store credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="O5sVYL"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hVohEb"&gt;T-Mobile is advertising the base &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%3Fsku%3D810029932646&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; as free with a trade-in on its Magenta Max plan and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro%3Fsku%3D810029931533&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; up to $900 off under the same terms. Once again, these promotions involve buying the device as a Magenta Max subscriber or purchasing that service, paying the sales tax, trading in a qualifying phone that T-Mobile will offer a value on, and then receiving the allotted money back as monthly bill credits over 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bpnx5n"&gt;Note that T-Mobile’s offerings for the Pixel 6 does not have a mmWave radio, only Sub-6 5G, and is thus the respective $599 base price as Google advertised. T-Mobile’s price for the Pixel 6 Pro also matches Google’s $899.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="66aMs3"&gt;Google Fi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rwhuyq"&gt;Google’s own Fi service combines its &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/promo-terms/?p=2021-october-pixel-6-series" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free Pixel Buds A offer with $200 in bill credits&lt;/a&gt; if you transfer your number from another carrier after purchasing a &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6_pro?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
